      "Lee Soo Man spent three decades trying to bring K-pop into the global market, often bending but never breaking his vision",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Lee Soo Man resisted the title at first. \u201cKing of K-pop\u201d sounded too brash, too nightclub-esque \u2014 like something you\u2019d see on a neon sign in Itaewon, a nightlife neighborhood in the South Korean capital Seoul once popular with U.S. soldiers and foreign visitors. \u201cI asked them, \u2018Couldn\u2019t it be Father of K-pop?\u2019\u201d the 73-year-old recalled during a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "He was discussing the title of Amazon Prime's documentary about his career. The producers insisted the bolder moniker would resonate better with American audiences. After some back-and-forth, Lee relented. \u201cI had to follow their decision.\u201d",
      "The compromise speaks to Lee\u2019s pragmatic approach to breaking South Korean acts into the American mainstream \u2014 a three-decade quest that often required him to bend but never break his vision. Now, as the founder of SM Entertainment and widely credited as the architect of K-pop\u2019s global expansion, Lee will be inducted into the Asian Hall of Fame on Saturday alongside basketball legend Yao Ming, Olympic figure skater Michelle Kwan, and rock icon Yoshiki, among others.",
      "Lee remains a prominent but controversial figure in K-pop history. His label pioneered the industry\u2019s intensive training system, recruiting performers as young as elementary school age and putting them through years of rigorous preparation. Some of his artists have challenged their contracts as unfair, sparking broader debates about industry practices.",
      "The recognition arrives as Lee reemerges into the spotlight after a contentious, high-profile departure from the agency he founded in 1995 \u2014 a management battle that included a public feud with his nephew-in-law and a bidding war over his shares. He\u2019s been keeping busy since, debuting a new band, A20 MAY, in both China and the U.S. He's also investing in a boutique Chinese firm\u2019s high-tech production technologies.",
      "Born in South Korea, Lee studied computer engineering in the U.S. for his master's degree. That technical background would later inform his approach to everything from visualization and cutting-edge production technologies \u2014 he said he\u2019s been rewatching \"The Matrix\u201d to revisit filming techniques \u2014 to pioneering elaborate \u201cworldviews\u201d and virtual avatars for his K-pop bands.",
      "For Lee, the Hall of Fame honor \u201cconfirms that K-pop has become a genre that the mainstream is now paying attention to\u201d \u2014 an acceptance that came after costly lessons and years of trial and error.",
      "Lee invested about $5 million in BoA\u2019s 2009 American debut with \u201cEat You Up,\u201d one of the first songs by a South Korean artist to be primarily written and produced by Western producers \u2014 a bold early attempt to bring K-pop into the U.S. mainstream. But with few widely recognized Asian artists in American pop culture at the time, the market wasn\u2019t ready. After nearly two years, BoA \u2014 already a megastar in Korea and Japan \u2014 decided to return home. The experience, Lee has said, left him with lasting regrets.",
      "\u201cWhen I asked the songwriter(s) to revise \u2018Eat You Up,\u2019 they refused,\u201d Lee recalled. \u201cIf we had changed it, I believe it would have achieved much better results.\u201d",
      "That setback taught Lee that K-pop needed to source global talent while maintaining creative control to adapt songs for the worldwide market. His quest for the perfect tracks took him worldwide.",
      "\u201cI once heard a song that was so good I couldn\u2019t let it go,\u201d he said, recalling the track that would later become \u201cDreams Come True\u201d for S.E.S., the late-1990s girl group. \u201cI could\u2019ve bought the license to the song in South Korea, Hong Kong, or Sweden. But I wanted to play it safe, so I found the Finnish address, went to meet the songwriter directly, wrote up a contract, and brought it back.\u201d",
      "At the time, top Western songwriters prioritized Japan, the world\u2019s second-largest music market. \u201cEuropean songwriters were willing to sell to Asia,\u201d Lee explained. \u201cThat\u2019s how we eventually built a system where music from Europe, Asia, and America could come together.\u201d",
      "That fusion became K-pop\u2019s signature. Lee also helped to pioneer another innovation: elaborate fictional universes, or \u201cworldviews,\u201d for groups like EXO and aespa \u2014 a storytelling approach that would later be adopted across the industry, including by groups like BTS.",
      "The concept emerged during his time in the U.S., where he witnessed MTV transform music into a visual medium. \u201cBut we only have three or four minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we express dramatic, cinematic elements in such a short time?\u201d",

      "Unable to attract established screenwriters, Lee developed the storylines himself. The strategy proved prescient: These interconnected narratives give global fans reason to follow groups across comebacks, waiting for the next chapter in an unfolding saga.",
      "Despite K-pop\u2019s global success, Lee remains focused on Asia\u2019s potential. He envisions South Korea as a creative hub where international talent learns production. \u201cKorea should become the country of producers,\u201d he said.",
      "With the Asia-Pacific region home to more than half the world\u2019s population, he sees it as entertainment\u2019s inevitable future center.",
      "His latest venture with A20 MAY, which operates in both China and the U.S., is testing that vision in one of Asia\u2019s most challenging markets. China\u2019s entertainment landscape has grown increasingly restrictive, with Beijing recently cracking down on \u201c effeminate \u201d male celebrities and youth culture. Asked about potential political risks, Lee dismissed concerns.",
      "\u201cPolitical risk? I don\u2019t really know much about that,\u201d he said.",
      "He said he aims to elevate South Korea\u2019s cultural influence as a center of production while meeting China\u2019s needs as it seeks to expand its soft power alongside economic dominance.",
      "\u201cCulturally, does China need what we do? I believe they do.\u201d",
      "The documentary also addressed darker aspects of K-pop close to Lee\u2019s heart, including the suicides of SM Entertainment artists.",
      "He traces the problem to anonymous and malicious online comments that often evade accountability, especially when posted on servers outside South Korea\u2019s jurisdiction, calling it a global issue requiring international cooperation. Lee advocates for worldwide standards on user verification and mediation systems where victims could identify attackers without expensive legal battles.",
      "But Lee resists the media\u2019s focus on K-pop\u2019s problems. \u201cShould we always weigh the dark side equally with the bright side, the future?\u201d he asked. \u201cMedia should consider whether K-pop represents more future or more past that holds us back. Rather than just discussing the dark side and dragging us down by clinging to the past, shouldn\u2019t we talk more about the future?\u201d",
      "After more than three decades, Lee\u2019s definition remains straightforward: \u201cK-pop is a new language of communication that transcends barriers. These languages move around naturally \u2014 what you can\u2019t stop is culture.\u201d",

      "As details of Andrew\u2019s links to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein continued to dribble out and Parliament raised questions about his rent-free residence at a sprawling country house near Windsor Castle, King Charles III moved Thursday to shield the monarchy from any further revelations.",

      "The king\u2019s decision came after the announcement earlier this month that Andrew had agreed to stop using the titles failed to stanch the flood of tawdry stories that threaten to weaken support for the monarchy. Far from ending the media frenzy, the earlier move spurred calls from some members of Parliament that Andrew be formally stripped of his titles and evicted from Royal Lodge.",

      "Andrew\u2019s disgrace comes as Charles, who is 76 and undergoing treatment for an undisclosed form of cancer, works to resolve stubborn problems and buttress the foundations of the monarchy for his elder son, Prince William, to inherit.",

    "story": [
      "Florence Welch explores her desire for greatness and the constraints she faces as a female artist in Florence + the Machine's sixth album, \"Everybody Scream.\"",
      "During his acceptance speech for best actor at this year\u2019s Screen Actors Guild Awards, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet made known his desire to be remembered as \u201cone of the greats.\u201d A few years earlier, Chalamet starred in Greta Gerwig\u2019s adaptation of \u201cLittle Women,\u201d in which his character demonstratively asks his future wife, \u201cWhat women are allowed into the club of geniuses, anyway?\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody Scream,\u201d Florence + the Machine\u2019s sixth album, is a response to that familiar, gendered notion. Across its 12 tracks, Florence Welch contends with both her desire for greatness and the constraints she understands to have been put on her as a female artist.",
      "It\u2019s unclear if Welch had Chalamet\u2019s viral speech in mind when writing, \u201cOne of the Greats,\u201d the album\u2019s lead single. But what is apparent in her brooding feminist treatise are grievances about sexism and male entitlement. \u201cIt must be nice to be a man and make boring music just because you can,\u201d she belts over gothic synths and strings. But it's a bit funny, too: \"Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m a fan, you\u2019re my second favorite frontman.\u201d",
      "Welch collaborated with Mark Bowen of IDLES for much of the record, as well as Mitski and Aaron Dessner of The National. Sometimes the collaborations create a haunting sound, but most of \u201cEverybody Scream\u201d is packed with the band's signature orchestral pop, an ornate arrangement of strings, synths, guitars, pianos and percussion.",
      "Perhaps to a fault, \u201cEverybody Scream\u201d isn\u2019t sonically dissimilar from what fans of Florence + the Machine have come to expect. But in a lyrical shift, Welch meditates heavily on mysticism and witchcraft throughout, something she turned to after suffering a nearly fatal ectopic pregnancy in 2023. The 39-year-old later revealed that she performed with a burst fallopian tube during her last tour and had to undergo emergency surgery.",
      "\u201cI sit in salt water/Call in a vision of my daughter/Light a candle/Place my grief upon the altar,\u201d her voice vibrates over haunting background vocals and an eerie electric guitar on \u201cYou Can Have It All.\u201d",

      "More than 100 investigators are racing to solve a daring heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris",
      "PARIS -- More than 100 investigators are racing to piece together how thieves pulled off the brazen heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, working to recover the stolen gems and bring those responsible to justice.",
      "The daytime theft of centuries-old jewels from the world's most-visited museum thought to be of significant cultural and monetary value has captured the world's attention for its audacity and movie plot-like details.",
      "But thus far little has been revealed about how the investigation is unfolding, a source of frustration for those accustomed to the 24-hour flow of information in American true crime or British tabloids.",
      "Suspects, like the jewels themselves, have remained out of sight, the case file cloaked in mystery and French authorities characteristically discreet.",
      "Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said on Sunday that more details would come once the suspects\u2019 custody period ends, likely around midweek, depending on the charges. But here's what we know so far about the case:",
      "Authorities said it took mere minutes for thieves to ride a lift up the side of the museum, smash display cases and steal eight objects worth an estimated 88 million euros ($102 million) on Oct. 19. The haul included a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a set linked to 19th-century queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense.",
      "Beccuau has not publicly announced what charges the suspects could face, though French media have reported that the charges include criminal conspiracy and organized theft, which can carry hefty fines and yearslong prison sentences.",
      "Beccuau said investigators made several arrests Saturday evening but didn\u2019t name them or say how many. One suspect, she added, was stopped at a Paris airport while trying to leave the country.",
      "In France, where privacy laws are strict, images of criminal suspects are not made public as they often are elsewhere. Suspects aren\u2019t paraded before cameras upon arrest or shown in mugshots.",
      "The presumption of innocence is inscribed in France's constitution and deeply valued throughout society. The French often express shock at the spectacle of criminal trials in the United States, including in 2011 when media outlets photographed Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then a candidate in France's presidential election, on a \u201cperp walk\u201d to a New York prison after he was indicted on charges he sexually assaulted a hotel maid. The charges were eventually dismissed.",
      "Information about investigations is meant to be secret under French law, a policy known as \u2033secret d\u2019instruction\" and only the prosecutor can speak publicly about developments.",
      "Police and investigators are not supposed to divulge information about arrests or suspects without the prosecutor's approval, though in previous high-profile cases, police union officials have leaked partial details. Beccuau on Saturday rued the leak of information about the ongoing investigation.",
      "A police official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing case, told The Associated Press that two men in their 30s, both known to police, were taken into custody. He said one suspect was arrested as he attempted to board a plane bound for Algeria.",

      "FIFA began the process of selling another 1 million tickets for next year\u2019s World Cup on Monday, with the opening of a new ticket draw marking the start of the tournament\u2019s second phase of sales.",
      "This draw, which runs through 11 a.m. Eastern Friday, includes a domestic exclusivity time slot for residents of the three host countries \u2014 the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Fans from those countries, whose entries are selected out of this draw, will have the opportunity to buy single-match tickets for games taking place inside their home nation.",
      "The phase is open to all fans, regardless of which country they live.",
      "\u201cWe already have seen massive interest from around the world for this tournament, and especially from within the host countries as Canada, Mexico and the United States prepare to host the biggest FIFA World Cup yet,\u201d said Heimo Schirgi, the tournament\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cThis second phase, with its host country domestic exclusivity time slot, will allow us to say \u2018thank you\u2019 to these local fans, while ensuring global opportunity as well.\u201d",
      "Those fans from the U.S, Canada and Mexico who enter the draw before it closes Friday have a chance to receive, through what FIFA says is a randomized process, a time slot during which they can buy tickets starting on Nov. 12. Those slots will be issued through Nov. 15. Fans who win those chances will receive word at least 48 hours before their time slot opens.",
      "Residents of the three host countries \u2014 the U.S., Canada and Mexico, in that order \u2014 purchased more tickets than those from any other nation in the initial phase of ticketing. England, Germany, Brazil, Spain, Colombia, Argentina and France, in that order, rounded out the top 10.",
      "Once the domestic exclusivity time slot ends, more fans will be eligible to obtain a purchasing slot starting on Nov. 17. Additional tickets will be made available in subsequent phases, FIFA said.",
      "FIFA announced earlier this month that more than 1 million tickets have already been sold for next year\u2019s World Cup, with people from 212 different countries and territories having already purchased. So far, 28 of the 48 spots for teams in the field have been filled.",

An international friendly match between defending World Cup champion Argentina \u2014 featuring Lionel Messi \u2014 and Puerto Rico was moved from Chicago to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, because of lagging ticket sales that some believe were in response to the immigration crackdown.",
      "Based on the listed stadium attendance figures, there are roughly 7.1 million seats to fill for the 104 matches for the tournament around 16 North American venues. It is unknown how many of those seats will be available for sale to the public.",
      "Ticket data has shown that the lowest-priced seats \u2014 set at $60 \u2014 were available for at least 40 matches. Almost all seats for the vast majority of matches were set at a much higher price. The opening match for the U.S., to be played at Inglewood, California, had prices ranging from $560 to $2,735 when sales opened. On the resale site, at least one ticket for that opening U.S. match on June 12 was listed for more than $60,000 earlier this month.",
      "Fans with the option to purchase could choose seats in one of four categories; Category 1 is what FIFA officials call the best seats, Category 4 is somewhere around the tops of stadiums. Ticket costs are expected to fluctuate as soccer\u2019s biggest event utilizes dynamic pricing for the first time.",

Kennedy Jr. and his deputies against a chemical that is a mainstay of dental care.",

      "The government shutdown has been a source of anxiety for educators, wondering how long grant money will last and who can help them interpret federal laws",
      "WASHINGTON -- The government shutdown has been a source of anxiety for school leaders wondering how long grant money will last and who can help them interpret federal laws. For Education Secretary Linda McMahon, it offers a preview of what she hopes to make permanent.",
      "Much of the department\u2019s work has gone completely cold. No new grants are being awarded, and civil rights investigations have been halted. Money is still flowing for key programs, but in many respects, schools and states are on their own.",
      "That\u2019s the vision President Donald Trump has promoted since his presidential campaign \u2014 a world where states fully have the reins of education policy with little or no influence from the federal government.",
      "Even before the shutdown, mass layoffs had left the agency with 2,400 employees, down from 4,100 when Trump took office. Remaining workers have mostly been furloughed during the budget impasse, leaving some 330 who are responsible for carrying out duties that are deemed essential.",
      "In a recent social media post, McMahon said the shutdown proves her department is unnecessary. \u201cTwo weeks in, millions of American students are still going to school, teachers are getting paid, and schools are operating as normal,\u201d McMahon wrote.",
      "She offered a more direct assessment days later, after the agency hit its 46th year: \u201cWe don\u2019t need a birthday cake,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe need an eviction notice.\u201d",
      "Some say the shutdown's impact has been more significant. They warn that funding for preschool centers and school meals is running out, and students with disabilities might not be getting the help they need.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the impact so far.",
      "Most of the billions of dollars the Education Department steers to schools each year went out the door in October, leaving schools funded until July.",
      "Other programs that aren\u2019t funded in advance face more uncertainty. That includes federally funded Head Start preschool centers and school nutrition programs funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said Julia Martin, director of policy and government affairs at the Bruman Group, an education law firm.",
      "Districts are required to cover the cost of school meals and then seek reimbursement from the Department of Agriculture, but the agency said it only has two months of reimbursements left amid the shutdown.",
      "\u201cDistricts are really worried that they\u2019re going to have to dig deep into their pockets to fund meals,\u201d Martin said.",
      "The last remnants of federal COVID-19 aid are still being released by the Education Department, but reimbursements have slowed with fewer staff reviewing the requests, Martin said.",
      "America\u2019s public schools are primarily funded by states and cities, but federal funding plays an important role. The billions sent already to schools include grants to help low-income students, those with disabilities and other populations.",
      "Grant competitions to award smaller amounts of money have largely frozen. Schools and states that already received grants can keep spending them down, but all new grantmaking has ceased, the department said. At the college level, federal Pell grants for low-income students are still flowing, and the FAFSA financial aid form is still being processed.",
      "Ordinarily, states and schools rely on the department to answer questions on a wide range of topics \u2014 from special education laws to statewide academic assessments to laws requiring public schools to provide certain services to students at private schools.",

It maintains \u201cvery regular\u201d communication with states to field questions on coordinating aid to families and eliminating waitlists, said Katy Neas, CEO of The Arc of the United States, a disability rights group.",

In August, the department rescinded 2015 guidance explaining schools\u2019 legal obligations to students who are learning English. But with no new guidance replacing it before the government shutdown, schools have questions about their responsibilities, said Martin, of the Bruman law firm.",

      "Bill Swick, who has a rare degenerative brain disease, has lost access to virtual speech therapy due to the federal government shutdown",
      "MINOOKA, Ill. -- Bill Swick has a rare degenerative brain disease that inhibits his mobility and speech. Instead of the hassle of traveling an hour to a clinic in downtown Chicago to visit a speech therapist, he has benefited from virtual appointments from the comfort of his home.",
      "But Swick, 53, hasn\u2019t had access to those appointments for the last month.",
      "The federal government shutdown, now in its fifth week, halted funding for the Medicare telehealth program that pays his provider for her services. So, Swick and his wife are practicing old strategies rather than learning new skills to manage his growing difficulties with processing language, connecting words and pacing himself while speaking.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because we want to continue with his journey, with his progress,\u201d 45-year-old Martha Swick, a caregiver for her husband since his diagnosis three years ago, said during an interview at their home in Minooka, Illinois. \u201cI try to have all his therapy and everything organized for him, to make his day easier and smoother, and then everything has a hitch, and we have to stop and wait.\u201d",
      "Their experience has become common in recent weeks among the millions of patients with Medicare fee-for-service plans who count on pandemic-era telehealth waivers to attend medical appointments from home.",
      "With Congress unable to agree on a deal to fund the government, the waivers have lapsed, even with support from Republicans and Democrats. As a result, medical providers are deciding whether they can continue offering telehealth services without the guarantee of reimbursement or whether they need to halt virtual visits altogether.",
      "That\u2019s left a patient population of mostly older adults with fewer options to seek specialists or get help when they can\u2019t physically travel far from home.",
      "Swick, whose corticobasal degeneration causes symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease, can\u2019t feed or dress himself anymore and struggles with balance and walking. Add on the logistical nightmare of driving to the city in traffic, and in-person speech therapy appointments aren\u2019t a worthwhile ordeal for him and his wife.",
      "But missing even a few appointments can impede progress for patients with dementia and other degenerative conditions who depend on continuity of care, experts said.",
      "It \u201cfeels like you\u2019re taking a step back,\u201d Swick said in the interview.",
      "Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Medicare only paid for virtual medical appointments under narrow circumstances, including in designated rural areas and when patients logged in from eligible sites, like hospitals and clinics.",
      "That changed in 2020, when Trump\u2019s first administration dramatically expanded telehealth coverage in response to the public health emergency. Medicare started reimbursing a wide range of telehealth visits, stripping the geographic requirement, and allowing patients to take calls from their homes.",
      "Congress has routinely extended the telehealth flexibilities and was poised to do so again before their Sept. 30 expiration. But when budget negotiations stalled and the government shut down Oct. 1, the vote never happened, leaving the program temporarily unfunded.",
      "With more than 4 million Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries using telehealth in the first half of 2025, according to Brown University\u2019s School of Public Health, the pause has had a major impact on an already vulnerable population.",
      "Swick\u2019s speech therapy services are provided by the Chicago-area business Memory and Aphasia Care. Owner Becky Khayum said many of her clients are in different cities and states and sought her therapists out because they specialize in frontal temporal dementias.",
      "\u201cNow suddenly without telehealth services, they do not continue to have the support to participate in those activities that are so important to them,\u201d Khayum said. \u201cThe risk is we could see social withdrawal; we could see depression and anxiety increased.\u201d",

Dr. Faraz Ghoddusi, a family medicine provider in Tigard, Oregon, said he uses telehealth to check in and help his patients manage their conditions, like diabetes and chronic lung disease. He said that in the current Medicare telehealth pause, one of his patients wasn\u2019t having regular check-ins and ended up in the emergency room.",
      "Susan Collins, 73, in Murrieta, California, said Medicare-reimbursed telehealth appointments were a \u201ctremendous relief\u201d to her when she was a full-time caregiver for her late husband, Leo. Before he died last year from progressive supranuclear palsy, a rare brain disorder, she struggled to lift him from his wheelchair in and out of the car for his in-person doctor visits 60 miles from their home.",
      "\u201cHe was much safer at home,\u201d Collins said, noting that telehealth was a useful resource when her husband needed a medication or symptom consultation but not a complete physical exam.",
      "The latest guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services does not ban medical providers from providing telehealth services during the lapse \u2013 but it stops short of promising they\u2019ll be reimbursed if they do.",
      "In response, providers are deciding whether they can absorb the risk of continuing care without assurance that they\u2019ll be paid for it when the government reopens.",
      "Khayum in Illinois said she had to stop providing telehealth services to Medicare patients because her small business couldn\u2019t handle the volatility of potentially losing out on payments. Ghoddusi, the family medicine provider, said his Oregon practice is honoring telehealth appointments made before Oct. 1 but not scheduling additional ones for Medicare patients until the funding is restored.",
      "Genevieve Richardson, owner of a speech pathology business in Austin, Texas, has stopped providing telehealth services to her Medicare clients who are spread across the country. She has been referring them to outpatient clinics in their areas who can provide stopgap services in person.",
      "Major hospitals are also grappling with whether to provide virtual care to Medicare patients. Dr. Helen Hughes, medical director of the Office of Telemedicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said the hospital initially continued the care, but paused scheduling more Medicare telehealth visits as of Oct. 16 as the shutdown continued.",
      "She said the uncertainty surrounding the waivers has been \u201ca total roller coaster.\u201d",
      "The government shutdown is in its fifth week with no clear end on the horizon. Meanwhile, Medicare telehealth flexibilities and a separate Medicare program offering patients hospital-level care at home both remain paused.",
      "Mei Kwong, executive director of the Center for Connected Health Policy, said the simplest solution to renewing the telehealth waivers would be for Congress to vote separately on them.",
      "The hands of federal health care administrators \u201care kind of tied,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, you really do need Congress to act.\u201d",
      "But with lawmakers divided and looking for leverage, hopes for such action are low.",
      "Martha Swick, practicing word exercises with her husband in their home on a recent morning, said if a solution isn\u2019t found soon, \u201cmy resource collection is going to run out.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just doing what I\u2019m able to at home as a wife and a caregiver,\u201d she said. \u201cBut eventually I\u2019m really going to need those appointments to come back.\u201d",

      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- The Alaska Supreme Court is weighing a case that is expected to determine who can provide abortion care in the state.",
      "The court heard arguments Wednesday in a 2019 case challenging the constitutionality of a law that states only a doctor licensed by the State Medical Board can perform an abortion in Alaska.",
      "The law, dating to the 1970s, was struck down as unconstitutional by Superior Court judge Josie Garton last year, a victory for the group that brought the challenge, Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky. The state appealed Garton's ruling.",
      "Planned Parenthood has argued there is no medical justification for the restriction and that it unfairly burdens those seeking an abortion by limiting the pool of those qualified to provide care. In 2021, Garton granted the group\u2019s request to allow advanced practice clinicians \u2014 health care workers, such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants \u2014 to provide medication abortion pending her decision in the underlying case. They have continued to do so and since the 2024 ruling also have been able to provide procedural abortions, Planned Parenthood says.",
      "Advanced practice clinicians routinely provide care similar in risk and complexity to that of providing abortion services, and in 25 states can provide medication abortion, attorneys for Planned Parenthood said in court documents. Planned Parenthood's advanced practice clinicians seek to provide abortion care in just the first trimester, the attorneys said.",
      "Since Garton's 2021 decision, advanced practice clinicians have been providing \u201cnearly all\u201d medication abortions in Alaska, and Planned Parenthood clinics in the state have been able to offer medication abortion each day they've been open, the attorneys wrote. Before that, doctors hired by Planned Parenthood on a per diem basis \u2014 at the clinics on limited days \u2014 were able to offer medication abortions perhaps once or twice a week at each clinic, they wrote.",
      "A vital statistics report released by the state this year shows that the total number of abortions in Alaska has been fairly consistent \u2014 1,229 in 2021, 1,247 in 2022, 1,222 in 2023 and 1,224 last year. The report says that could include cases where medication was provided to manage a miscarriage, but without providing a number. It also says reasons for ending pregnancies are not reported to the state.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned a federal right to abortion, leaving it up to each state to regulate.",

      "BERLIN -- The organization that handles claims on behalf of Jews who suffered under the Nazis said Wednesday that Germany has agreed to extend another $1.076 billion (923.9 million euros) for Holocaust survivors ' home care around the globe for the coming year.",
      "The compensation was negotiated with Germany\u2019s finance ministry and is the largest budget for frail and vulnerable Holocaust survivor home care in the organization\u2019s history.",
      "\u201cThis historic increase to home care funding reflects the complex and growing needs of Holocaust survivors worldwide,\u201d said Gideon Taylor, the president of the New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, also referred to as the Claims Conference.",
      "\u201cWhile we are losing survivors at a rapid pace each year, those who remain are older, frailer and in greater need than ever before,\u201d Taylor said in a written statement. \"This budget is critical in providing each of them the opportunity to age in place, a dignity that was stolen from them in their youth.\u201d",
      "The average age of survivors receiving home care through Claims Conference funding has increased from 86 in 2018 to 88.5 in 2024. Data collected by the organization show that survivors are experiencing more complicated health needs and increased disability, with the number of survivors who qualify for full-time assistance due to extreme disability \u2014 such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia \u2014 has nearly doubled during that time period.",
      "Additionally, the Hardship Fund Supplemental payments, which were previously guaranteed to be paid annually to eligible Holocaust survivors until 2027, have been extended through 2028 at an amount of \u20ac1,450 per survivor, impacting more than 127,000 Holocaust survivors globally.",
      "The Claims Conference projected in April that approximately 200,000 survivors are still alive, most of them living in Israel, the United States and Europe, but also scattered all over the globe.",
      "Also, righteous rescuers \u2013 non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust - currently receiving a monthly pension from the Claims Conference, will be eligible to receive home care similar to that provided to Jewish survivors, allowing them to live their final years with dignity in their own homes, the group announced.",

Her father wants to be a grandfather and her mother, before she died, always told Porretto that she would eventually want to be a mom.",
      "\u201cSome people think it's a bad thing\u201d not to have a child, said Porretto, who works in advertising. \u201cI just don't think I need to bring more people into (the world) when there's so much here currently that we need to fix.\u201d",
      "Younger generations of Americans are increasingly citing climate change as making them reticent to have children, according to several studies. They are worried about bringing children into a world with increasing and more intense extreme weather events, a result of climate change, which is caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide when oil, gas coal are burned. And they are concerned about the impact their offspring will have on the planet.",
      "In a 2024 Lancet study of people 16 to 25 years old, the majority of respondents were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d worried about climate change. The study also found that 52% said they were hesitant to have children because of climate change. Adults under 50 years old without children were four times more likely than adults over 50 without children to say that climate plays a factor in their decision, according to a Pew Research Center report published last year. And a study published this year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found more than half of respondents said \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cmaybe\u201d to whether climate change made them question having children.",
      "Parenthood and climate change are related not just because of fears for a child's well-being, but also by concern for the planet's well-being.",
      "Compared to the carbon emissions of all the other decisions, \"having a child is by far, by orders of magnitude, larger,\u201d said Nandita Bajaj, executive director of Population Balance, which is a nonprofit focused on humans' environmental impact.",
      "Unlike other choices, procreation comes with something that bioethics professor Travis Rieder of Johns Hopkins University calls \u201ccarbon legacy.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not only doing carbon expensive activities like buying a larger house and a larger car and diapers and all that,\" said Rieder. \u201cYou\u2019re also creating someone who is going to have their own carbon footprint for the rest of their lives.\u201d",
      "That child might have children, and those children might have children, creating an impact that lasts generations, Rieder added. Of course, the logical extreme of minimizing an environmental footprint means having no children, Rieder said, which he is not advocating.",
      "It's tricky to quantify the impact of a child. That's because there's no consensus on what percentage of their impact is the parent's responsibility, and partly because the impact of that child depends on their parents' lifestyle.",
      "\u201cOne of the best predictors of how carbon-expensive they\u2019ll be is how wealthy you are,\u201d Rieder said.",
      "For example, the U.S. emits 123 times more carbon emissions than Ghana, according to the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research. Adjusted for population size, that means the average American emits more than 12 times as much as the average Ghanan.",
      "Procreation might have the largest climate impact, but when it comes to actions people can take to reduce their personal contribution to global warming, having fewer children often isn't discussed.",
      "Researchers who study climate change and family planning give two reasons.",

      "ZANZIBAR, Tanzania -- The women wade with baskets near the beaches, their colorful dresses a magnet for tourist cameras. Sunscreen worn by the holidaymakers may even contain the product the women are collecting: Zanzibar\u2019s seaweed.",

      "\u201cI experience pain in my back, waist and chest due to the labor in the sea. There are also risks of being stung or bitten,\u201d said one farmer, Mwanaisha Makame Simai. \u201cSometimes strong waves sweep you away. I have personally witnessed three cases of people drowning.\u201d",
      "Seaweed has been farmed off Zanzibar, part of Tanzania's Indian Ocean coast, for decades but there is a new boom underway as global demand increases.",
      "Seaweed is primarily exported to the global food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries, which extract their thickening and stabilizing agents.",
      "In Zanzibar, private investment and donor dollars have been increasing. Seaweed is the third largest contributor to the local economy after tourism and spices.",
      "\u201cTen years ago, people thought you were crazy for working in seaweed,\u201d said Klara Schade, director at Mwani Zanzibar, which describes itself as a boutique seaweed farm and factory in the village of Paje. \u201cNow it\u2019s become a buzzword.\u201d",
      "Mwani even runs seaweed tours in Paje to introduce the work.",
      "For the government of the semi-autonomous archipelago, seaweed is at the heart of its \u201cblue economy\u201d initiative to drive growth from sustainable marine and coastal resources.",
      "Cargill, one of the world\u2019s largest commodity trading firms, invested an unspecified amount in Zanzibari seaweed in 2020 in a partnership with The Nature Conservancy, with a view to improving yields and farmers' incomes.",
      "Other nongovernmental organizations have stepped up funding, including the Global Seaweed Coalition, which oversees the safety and sustainability of the sector as it scales up.",
      "Most of Zanzibar\u2019s 25,000 seaweed farmers are women, notable in a society where fewer than half of women are employed, according to a government census taken in 2021.",
      "The Associated Press spoke with five of the women, who described sometimes harsh working conditions in the manual labor. The vast majority of seaweed farmers work independently or in collectives, selling to local middlemen. There are few if any protections.",
      "Long days are spent wading under the equatorial sun. Back aches and skin irritation can result, with stings from sea urchins or other creatures being another worry.",
      "\u201cThere are health and safety challenges in this work,\u201d said Simai, an independent farmer who said she makes around $50 per month to help support her small family of two. The work may be more challenging for those with larger families, she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy job, it\u2019s tiresome,\u201d said Pili Khalid Pandu, 43, who works for Mwani, doing rotations between its factory and collecting in the sea.",

Schade said Mwani\u2019s high-end cosmetics \u2014 a bottle of its \u201cface and body skin superfood\u201d sells online for $140 \u2014 mean its workers make far more than the average seaweed farmer.

      "But the stress can be reduced if people have a plan for preparing their homes and for deciding whether to stay and ride out a storm or evacuate, according to emergency management officials. That preparation, which includes putting together a kit of essential supplies, should begin long before a storm is approaching.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t be complacent, take preparedness seriously, spend the time now to do the little things that will make a big difference for you and your loved ones when something does happen,\u201d said Brian Mason, director of Houston\u2019s Office of Emergency Management.",
      "Anything in the backyard that isn\u2019t tied down, such as furniture and barbecue grills, should be secured or brought inside so it doesn't become a projectile that can come through a window, said Shawn Schulze, regional CEO for the American Red Cross Texas Gulf Coast Region.",

    "story": [
      "Notices of rising health insurance premiums are landing in voters\u2019 mailboxes and sending some to town halls to vent their frustration",
      "WASHINGTON -- The first caller on a telephone town hall with Maryland Rep. Andy Harris, leader of the House\u2019s conservative Freedom Caucus, came ready with a question about the Affordable Care Act. Her cousin's disabled son is at risk of losing the insurance he gained under that law, the caller said.",
      "\u201cNow she\u2019s looking at two or three times the premium that she\u2019s been paying for the insurance,\u201d said the woman, identified as Lisa from Harford County, Maryland. \u201cI\u2019d love for you to elucidate what the Republicans\u2019 plan is for health insurance?\u201d",
      "Harris, a seven-term Republican, didn\u2019t have a clear answer. \u201cWe think the solution is to try to do something to make sure all the premiums go down,\u201d he said, predicting Congress would \u201cprobably negotiate some off-ramp\u201d later.",
      "His uncertainty reflected a familiar Republican dilemma: Fifteen years after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, the party remains united in criticizing the law but divided on how to move forward. That tension has come into sharp focus during the government shutdown as Democrats seize on rising premiums to pressure Republicans into extending expiring subsidies for the law, often referred to as Obamacare.",
      "President Donald Trump and GOP leaders say they\u2019ll consider extending the enhanced tax credits that otherwise expire at year's end \u2014 but only after Democrats vote to reopen the government. In the meantime, people enrolled in the plans are already being notified of hefty premium increases for 2026.",
      "As town halls fill with frustrated voters and no clear Republican plan emerges, the issue appears to be gaining political strength heading into next year's midterm elections.",
      "\u201cPremiums are going up whether it gets extended or not,\u201d said GOP Sen. Rick Scott. \u201cPremiums are going up because health care costs are going up. Because Obamacare is a disaster.\u201d",
      "At the center of the shutdown \u2014 now in its fourth week with no end in sight \u2014 is a Democratic demand that Affordable Care Act subsidies passed in 2021 be extended.",
      "Trump has long promised an alternative. \u201cThe cost of Obamacare is out of control, plus, it\u2019s not good Healthcare,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social in November 2023. \u201cI\u2019m seriously looking at alternatives.\u201d",
      "Pressed on health care during a September 2024 presidential debate, Trump said he had \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d",
      "But nearly 10 months into his presidency, that plan has yet to come. Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told NBC on Wednesday, \u201cI fully believe the president has a plan,\u201d but didn't go into details.",
      "Republicans say they want a broader overhaul of the health care system, though such a plan would be difficult to advance before next year. Party leaders have not outlined how they\u2019ll handle the expiring tax credits, insisting they won\u2019t negotiate on the issue until Democrats agree to end the shutdown.",
      "A September analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that permanently extending the tax credits would increase the deficit by $350 billion from 2026 to 2035. The number of people with health insurance would rise by 3.8 million in 2035 if the credits are kept, CBO projected.",
      "Asked Wednesday on CNN whether Republicans have a plan to address the subsidies if the government reopened, House Speaker Mike Johnson said they had \u201cproposals\u201d that can be \u201cready immediately.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated, very complex issue, that requires a long time to build consensus around,\u201d he said.",
      "With notices of premium spikes landing in mailboxes now and the open enrollment period for Affordable Care Act health plans beginning Nov. 1, the political pressure has been evident in Republican town halls.",
      "In Idaho, Rep. Russ Fulcher told concerned callers that \u201cgovernment provided health care is the wrong path\u201d and that \u201cprivate health care is the right path.\u201d In Texas, freshman Rep. Brandon Gill responded to a caller facing a sharp premium increase by saying Republicans are focused on cutting waste, fraud and abuse.",

More than 24 million people were enrolled in the marketplace plans in 2025, up from about 11 million in 2020, according to an analysis from the health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "Sara from Middleville, Michigan, told Rep. John Moolenaar during his town hall that if health insurance premiums go up by as much as 75%, most people will probably go without heath care. \"So how do you address that?\u201d she asked.",

      "Many Democrats credited their ability to flip the House in 2018 during Trump\u2019s first term to the GOP\u2019s attempt at repealing Obamacare, and they\u2019re forecasting a similar outcome this time.",
      "About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they trust the Democrats to do a better job handling health care, compared with about one-quarter who trust the Republicans more, a recent AP-NORC poll found. About one-quarter trust neither party, and about 1 in 10 trust both equally, according to the poll.",
      "Even as GOP leaders pledge to discuss ending the subsidies when the government opens, it's clear that many Republican lawmakers are adamantly opposed to an extension.",
      "\u201cAt least among Republicans, there\u2019s a growing sense that just maintaining the status quo is very destructive,\u201d said Brian Blase, the president of Paragon Health Institute and a former health policy adviser to Trump during his first term.",
      "Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he\u2019s working with multiple congressional offices on alternatives that would let the subsidies end. For example, he wants to expand the Affordable Care Act exemption given to U.S. territories to all 50 states and reintroduce a first-term Trump policy that gave Americans access to short-term health insurance plans outside the Affordable Care Act marketplace.",
      "Cannon declined to name the lawmakers he\u2019s working with, but said he hopes they act on his ideas \u201csooner than later.\u201d",
      "David McIntosh, president of the influential conservative group Club For Growth, told reporters Thursday that the group has \u201curged the Republicans not to extend those COVID-era subsidies.\u201d",

      "Britain\u2019s monarchy holds prestige but not power and is subject to public sentiment",
      "LONDON -- Holding prestige but not power, Britain\u2019s monarchy is finely tuned to public sentiment.",
      "That's been evident with the disgrace of Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, who was stripped of his princely title and his spacious home by his brother King Charles on Thursday, a banishment that has left the disgraced royal increasingly exposed to political and legal scrutiny over his finances and his friendship with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Following years of scandals related to Andrew, Charles arguably took the biggest step of his reign by seeking to insulate the monarchy from any further scandals relating to Andrew and his connections with Epstein, who took his own life in prison in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges, more than a decade after his initial conviction.",
      "It's not the first time the current iteration of the British monarchy \u2014 the House of Windsor \u2014 has been in crisis over the past century and where the future of the institution has been threatened.",
      "George Gross, a royal expert at King\u2019s College London, said the most recent precedent for what has happened to Andrew is the 1917 Titles Deprivation Act, which \u201csaw various members of loosely affiliated royals and dukes and members of the peerage losing titles if they had sided with Germany in the First World War.\u201d",
      "The royal families of Europe are intertwined, and Britain\u2019s is heavily German, especially after Queen Victoria married Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, with whom she had nine children.",
      "When Britain and Germany went to war in 1914, some members of the wider British royal family found themselves on opposing sides.",
      "Britain\u2019s King George V changed the family name from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor in 1917, and initiated legislation to strike out the titles of princes and lords \u201cwho have, during the present war, borne arms against His Majesty or His Allies, or who have adhered to His Majesty\u2019s enemies.\u201d",
      "One target was Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, who was a U.K. royal and also a prince of Hanover. His title was removed for being an enemy of Britain under the 1917 act, which was enacted in 1919, once the war was over.",
      "According to the House of Commons Library, \u201cthis was the first and only time such a title has been removed in this way.\u201d",
      "The relationship between Edward, Prince of Wales, and U.S. socialite Wallis Simpson was a headache that turned into a constitutional crisis. Simpson was twice divorced, and Edward, the heir to the throne, was destined to be ceremonial head of the Church of England, which did not allow divorced people to remarry in church.",
      "The prince became King Edward VIII when his father King George V died in early 1936. He continued to say he wanted to marry Simpson, despite the opposition of the British government.",
      "Forced to choose between duty and passion, he gave up the throne in December 1936, announcing in a radio broadcast that \u201cI have found it impossible ... to discharge my duties as king as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love.\u201d",
      "The news was a surprise to many in Britain, though not beyond it. British newspapers had not reported on the relationship, and American magazines had offending articles cut out before going on sale.",

All doubled down on the idea that the monarch\u2019s primary attribute should be a sense of duty \u2014 something Edward, in the popular imagination, lacked.",

      "The strength of public feeling caught the royal family by surprise. Mounds of floral tributes piled up outside the gates of Buckingham Palace to mourn a princess who had been ostracized by the royal family after her divorce from Charles in 1992.",
      "The queen was at Balmoral in Scotland on her summer holiday with her husband Prince Philip, Charles, William and Harry. The family kept their grief private and stuck to routine \u2014 taking the ashen-faced boys to church on Sunday morning \u2014 and the queen did not issue a statement for several days.",
      "She was advised to make a public display of grief by Prime Minister Tony Blair, who perfectly caught the public mood with his own tribute calling Diana \u201cthe people\u2019s princess.\u201d",
      "After newspaper headlines urging \u201cSpeak to us Ma\u2019am\u201d and \u201cShow us you care,\u201d the queen made a live televised address to the nation on the eve of Diana\u2019s funeral.",
      "\u201cWhat I say to you now, as your queen and as a grandmother, I say from my heart,\u201d the queen said, acknowledging the country\u2019s grief, praising Diana and promising to cherish her memory.",

      "Harry became estranged from his father and older brother, Prince William, heir to the throne, when he and his wife, Meghan, stepped down from their working roles and moved to California in 2020. The couple famously aired their grievances with the royal family in a tell-all interview to Oprah Winfrey and a revealing Netflix series. Harry, also known as the Duke of Sussex, then fueled the tensions by revealing personal conversations in his memoir, \u201cSpare.\u201d",
      "Harry also broke from royal protocol in turning to the courts to sort out his legal problems. He became the first senior royal to testify in court in more than a century in his successful phone hacking lawsuit against the Daily Mirror.",
      "A failed legal effort to restore his police protection detail that was stripped from him when he left royal work, though, was seen as an attack on his father\u2019s government.",
      "When the courts finally rejected the lawsuit, it provide a chance for a reunion between father and son. The two shared a cup of tea at Charles\u2019 London abode, Clarence House, in September. It was their first meeting in over a year. It lasted less than an hour.",

      "Speaking at a meeting in Malaysia with his counterparts from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Hegseth reiterated U.S. concern over what he called China\u2019s aggression in the disputed waters that intensified in recent months, citing incidents such as ramming of vessels and the use of water cannons.",
      "The South China Sea remains one of Asia\u2019s most volatile flashpoints. Beijing claims almost the entire region, while ASEAN members the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei also claim ownership of coastal areas and features. The Philippines, a key U.S. ally, has had frequent clashes with China's maritime fleet.",

      "Only 37 other people have been given the title \u201cdoctor\u201d in the 2,000-year history of the Catholic Church. Newman now joins the ranks of such monumental Christian figures as St. Augustine, St. Therese of Lisieux and St. John of the Cross.",
      "The title recognizes that Newman, beloved in both the Anglican and Catholic churches, has universal appeal and made a timeless, eminent contribution to understanding the Christian faith.",
      "A theologian and poet raised in the Church of England, Newman is best known for his writings and sermons on the development of doctrine, truth and the nature of a university. He is admired by conservatives and progressives alike, because he followed his conscience at great personal cost when he decided to convert to Catholicism in 1845.",
      "Leo pronounced Newman a church doctor on Saturday during a special Holy Year Mass for Catholic teachers and students, during which he also declared Newman a co-patron of Catholic education, alongside St. Thomas Aquinas.",
      "It was particularly fitting: It was Leo\u2019s namesake, Pope Leo XIII, who made Newman a Catholic cardinal after his conversion, and it was the earlier Leo who declared Aquinas a doctor of the church and patron of Catholic education.",
      "Leo\u2019s decision to hold out Newman as a model for Catholic educators suggests that Catholic teaching will be a priority for him going forward, especially as he emphasizes the ethical use of artificial intelligence for future generations.",
      "Earlier this week, Leo penned a new document that cited Newman in his call for Catholic schools to be places for spiritual growth and community, and where the use of technology always keeps human dignity front and center.",
      "In his homily, Leo quoted from Newman\u2019s most famous text, the beloved British hymn \u201cLead, Kindly Light,\u201d to urge that Catholic educators \u201cshine like stars in the world\u201d in the collective search for truth.",
      "\u201cThe task of education is precisely to offer this Kindly Light to those who might otherwise remain imprisoned by the particularly insidious shadows of pessimism and fear,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are called to form people, so that they may shine like stars in their full dignity.\u201d",
      "The Catholic Church is one of the world\u2019s leading players in education, operating more than 225,000 primary and secondary schools and enrolling some 2.5 million students at Catholic universities around the globe, according to Vatican statistics.",
      "Leo was educated by the Augustinians, taught math and physics, and is a member of the Augustinian religious order, which places a special emphasis on St. Augustine\u2019s search for truth and the command \u201cTolle, lege,\u201d which translates from Latin as \u201cTake up and read.\u201d",

      "The Rev. George Bowen, the postulator who oversaw Newman\u2019s canonization and designation as a doctor, said Newman too was confronted with the 19th-century equivalent of the information age, when cheap periodicals were readily available and reading rates shot up. Newman insisted on the need for a wholistic liberal education that included Catholic theology, but also focused on students and teachers interacting in a relational way in the quest for truth and knowledge, he said.",
      "\u201cSuddenly, the world was swimming with information,\u201d Bowen told reporters. \u201cSo Newman\u2019s ways of coping with this huge ocean of knowledge and making sense of it, having a connected view, is something very, very relevant today.\u201d",
      "When Newman defected from the Church of England to the Catholic Church in 1845, he lost friends, work and even family ties, believing the truth he was searching for could only be found in the Catholic faith.",
      "And yet even today, Newman remains beloved in the Church of England. His hymns were sung last week in the Sistine Chapel when King Charles III prayed alongside Leo in the historic ecumenical service.",
      "Several important Anglican leaders wrote to the Vatican, supporting his designation as a church doctor, and the Anglican archbishop of York was invited to participate in Saturday's service. It featured the hymn, \u201cLead, Kindly Light,\u201d which remains a fixture of Anglican services.",
      "\u201cNewman is a big ecumenical figure in the sense that he owes his faith to his upbringing in the Church of England,\u201d Bowen said.",
      "Paul Shrimpton, a leading Newman scholar at Magdalen College, Oxford, said it was significant that each of the last popes had promoted Newman in his remarkably quick path to being declared a doctor of the church, underlining his universal appeal to progressive and liberals alike.",
      "St. John Paul II declared him venerable in 1991, in the first step to possible sainthood; Pope Benedict XVI beatified him during a 2010 visit to Birmingham, England; Pope Francis canonized him in 2019 with Charles in the audience, and now Leo declared him a church doctor.",
      "\u201cI think that speaks volumes,\u201d said Shrimpton, who contributed an essay on Newman\u2019s influence on Catholic education for the official Vatican dossier, or \u201cpositio\u201d that made the case for him to be declared a doctor. \u201cAll very different popes show that he is part of the universal teaching of church.\u201d",

      "As Mexican families prepare for Day of the Dead celebrations, altars are set up to welcome back loved ones under the belief that they return home for one night each Nov. 2",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Marigolds? Check. Candles? Check. And of course, sugar skulls \u2014 the final touch on altars honoring deceased loved ones during Mexico\u2019s Day of the Dead.",
      "Just like the traditional \u201c pan de muerto,\u201d these colorful treats known as \u201ccalaveritas\u201d (or little skulls) capture how Mexicans remember their dearly departed with celebration rather than sorrow each November.",
      "\u201cVery few customers buy them to eat,\u201d said Adri\u00e1n Chavarr\u00eda, whose family has crafted and sold calaveritas since the 1940s in a Mexico City market. \u201cMost people get them to decorate their altars.\u201d",
      "Following a tradition rooted in pre-Hispanic beliefs related to agriculture, many think their loved ones return home to spend the night on Nov. 2.",
      "To welcome them, families set up homemade altars. Candles are lit in the hope of illuminating their paths and the departed\u2019s favorite dishes are cooked for the occasion.",
      "\u201cI set out a beer, a Coke, a cigarette \u2014 a little of everything just in case,\u201d said Margarita S\u00e1nchez, who spent a recent October evening shopping for calaveritas and other items for her altar. \u201cThat way, whoever comes can help themselves.\u201d",
      "Her whole family takes part in setting up the offerings, but her daughters lead the way, finding creative ways to surprise their deceased relatives with a fresh display each year.",
      "\u201cThis is how we honor our loved ones who left earlier than we would have hoped,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cWe do this to remember them.\u201d",
      "Calaveritas are mostly made of sugar, chocolate or amaranth. Nonetheless, each Mexican state has its variations. Ingredients such as almonds, peanuts, pumpkin seeds and honey can be added as well.",
      "According to Mexico\u2019s Agriculture and Rural Development Department, the calaveritas\u2019 origins date back to ancient Mesoamerican traditions.",
      "The Aztecs used to make amaranth figures mixed with honey as offerings to their gods. Sugar was introduced in the 16th century with the arrival of the Spaniards, who brought a new technique to mold figures \u2014 a practice that eventually led to the colorful sugar skulls made today.",
      "The pre-Hispanic offerings, however, bear no resemblance to the altars used nowadays during Day of the Dead.",
      "\u201cThose offerings were not structures set up at home,\u201d said historian Jes\u00fas L\u00f3pez del R\u00edo, who recently led a tour on human sacrifices to deities in Mesoamerica. \u201cThey were given to entities beyond the human realm and consisted of food, blood, animals, songs, prayers and other things.\u201d",

      "The design of his products was his mother\u2019s. Yet his grandfather launched the business around 1941. \u201cBesides being part of our folklore, calaveritas are artisanal sweets,\u201d he said.",
      "All are made by hand. The process is so meticulous that production starts in April, sales kick off by mid-September and by late October his products are sold out.",
      "He can\u2019t specify how many calaveritas are crafted per year, but his shop offers 12 different sizes and produces around 40 boxes per size. Packages containing the tiniest sugar skulls can accommodate up to 600 pieces, while those holding the largest can store around 300.",
      "Prices are affordable \u2014 ranging from 3 to 400 pesos ($0.17 to $20) \u2014 but days are required to finish each piece. According to his son Emmanuel, who will inherit the business, the process is equally hard and fascinating.",

Once it boils, the blend is poured into ceramic molds, where it sits for a few minutes before the skulls are removed to cool. Around five days later, each calaverita is painted by hand.",
      "Beyond the Day of the Dead, Emmanuel feels close to his departed relatives every day he crafts calaveritas and puts them up for sale at his family\u2019s shop.",

      "Francos was appointed chief of staff last year as the irascible political outsider sought help from the seasoned negotiator in persuading Congress to pass wide-ranging economic overhaul measures to trim the fiscal budget and spur foreign investment.

The sight of soldiers patrolling the streets, sporadic gunfire and closed stores is rare in the usually peaceful country that many foreigners visit for its pristine coastal beaches and safari tourism.",
      "That\u2019s partly because Tanzania\u2019s first female leader, who has served as president since 2021, has sparked widespread anger for running virtually unopposed after her two main opponents were blocked or prevented from contesting.",
      "President Samia Suluhu Hassan, who seeks five more years as president, ran against 16 candidates from smaller parties. Critics say that\u2019s a coronation, not a contest.

      "The pattern includes enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial killings, according to Amnesty International. In June, a United Nations panel of human rights experts cited more than 200 cases of enforced disappearance since 2019, saying they were \u201calarmed by reports of a pattern of repression\u201d ahead of elections.",

      "Tanzania\u2019s president has \u201coverseen an unprecedented crackdown on political opponents,\u201d the International Crisis Group said in its most recent analysis. \u201cThe government has curbed freedom of expression, ranging from a ban on X and restrictions on the Tanzanian digital platform JamiiForums to silencing critical voices through intimidation or arrest.\u201d",

      "CCM is fused with the state, effectively in charge of the security apparatus and structured in such a way that new leaders emerge every five or ten years. Hassan herself was able to rise to the presidency as vice president without incident when her predecessor, John Pombe Magufuli, died suddenly after the start of his second term.",

      "In rural Ukraine, attack drones are assembled in secret to strike deep into Russia",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- At a secret location in rural Ukraine, columns of attack drones are assembled at night and in near silence to strike deep inside Russia.",
      "Their targets are strategic: oil refineries, fuel depots, and military logistics hubs. Since the summer, Ukraine\u2019s long-range drone campaign has ramped up dramatically, pounding energy infrastructure across Russia and stretching Moscow\u2019s air defenses thin.",
      "Built from parts made in a scattered network of workshops, these drones now fly much further than at any point in the war.",
      "Officers in body armor move with quick precision; headlamps glow red to stay hidden. Engines sputter like old motorcycles as exhaust fumes drift into the moonless night. Minutes later, one after another, the drones lift from a makeshift runway and head east. The strikes have caused gasoline shortages in Russia, even forcing rationing in some regions and underscoring a growing vulnerability in the country\u2019s infrastructure.",
      "Western analysts say the attacks on energy infrastructure so far have had a serious \u2014 but not crippling \u2014 effect. Ukrainian drones have repeatedly hit 16 major Russian refineries, representing about 38% of the country\u2019s nominal refining capacity, according to a recent review by the Carnegie Endowment, a U.S.-based think tank.",
      "But it argues the actual impact has been considerably more limited: most plants resumed operations within weeks, and Russia\u2019s refining output has been cushioned by idle capacity and existing fuel surpluses.",
      "The deep strikes have, however, given Kyiv the initiative at an important moment. The United States and Europe are ramping up sanctions on Russia\u2019s oil industry even as Kyiv\u2019s request for U.S. long-range Tomahawk missiles has stalled. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Ukraine\u2019s improved long-range strike capability is causing real damage \u2013 forcing the Kremlin to import fuel and curb exports. \u201cWe believe they\u2019ve lost up to 20% of their gasoline supply \u2014 directly as a result of our strikes,\u201d he told reporters at a briefing in Kyiv.",
      "At the secret launch site, the commander overseeing the operation \u2014 a broad-shouldered man identified by his call sign, \u201cFidel,\u201d in accordance with Ukrainian military regulations \u2014 watches through night-vision goggles as the drones climb into the star-filled sky.",
      "\u201cDrones are evolving,\u201d Fidel told The Associated Press. \u201cInstead of flying 500 kilometers (310 miles), now they fly 1,000 ... Three factors go into a successful operation: the drones, the people and the planning. We want to deliver the best result. For us, this is a holy mission.\u201d",
      "Much of Ukraine\u2019s fleet is homegrown. The Liutyi, a workhorse of the nightly attacks, is a waist-high craft with a sausage-shaped body, a propeller at the back, and a distinctive triangular tail.",
      "It looks neither sleek nor intimidating \u2014 more Home Depot than Lockheed Martin \u2014 but the ease of assembly means it can be kept hidden and constantly tweaked: optimized to slip through heavily monitored frontline airspace.",
      "Typical of Ukraine\u2019s no-frills war production philosophy, the Liutyi \u2014 whose name means \u201cfierce\u201d in Ukrainian \u2014 has become a symbol of national pride and recently featured on a local postage stamp.",

      "The reach of these drones \u2014 with some models doubling in range over the past year to routinely strike targets within a 1,000-kilometer radius of the border \u2014 marks a shift in the geography of the conflict. Attacks a year ago damaged refineries in a much narrower range, mostly in western Russian border regions. Costs have also come down, further testing expensive air defense systems, with long-range drones now being produced in Ukraine for as little as $55,000.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that Ukraine is getting better at taking the war inside Russia,\u201d said Adriano Bosoni, director of analysis at RANE, a global risk analysis firm. \u201cFor most of the war, Russia operated on the assumption that its own territory was safe. That\u2019s no longer the case.\u201d",
      "The strategic logic is attrition by logistics, he argued: by forcing Russia to reroute supplies and commit air defenses to a wider area, Kyiv seeks to degrade Moscow's capacity to sustain large-scale operations.",
      "The Paris-based International Energy Agency says repeated drone strikes have cut Russia\u2019s refining capacity by about 500,000 barrels a day. That\u2019s triggered domestic fuel shortages and curbed exports of diesel and jet fuel, even as overall global oil production remains steady and prices stable.",
      "Kyiv\u2019s homegrown strike capability allows independent drone launches, bypassing the Western approval required for imported long-range weapons. That autonomy preceded tougher sanctions on Russia: allies escalated only after Ukraine had spent months hitting Russian refineries.",
      "On the ground, each mission is a study in tradeoffs. Fewer than 30% of drones even reach the target area, so meticulous planning is essential, said Fidel, who reflected on the human cost. \u201cWar has fallen to our generation so that we can fight for our kids and they can live in a free democratic country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are currently obtaining experience that will be used by every country in the world, and we are paying the price with our lives and the lives of our friends.\u201d",

      "But last month's $9.7 billion investment in OxyChem won't do much to diminish the $381.7 billion cash pile that Berkshire was sitting on at the end of September even though it is the biggest deal the company has made in years.",
      "The biggest thing on most investors' minds right now is that Buffett Vice Chair Greg Abel is set to succeed him as CEO in January, although Buffett will remain chairman at Berkshire. The Class A stock is well off its peak of $812,855, set just before Buffett surprised shareholders at the annual meeting in May by announcing he will step back. It closed Friday at $715,740, but Berkshire still didn't buy back any of its own stock in the quarter, which suggests Buffett thinks it is still overvalued.",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said she expects investors will clamor for more details from Berkshire after Abel takes over, and that calls for the company to finally pay a dividend if it can't find better uses for all that cash will also grow louder. But with Buffett remaining chairman there may not be any immediate changes.",
      "\u201cThe lack of discussion and disclosure \u2014 I think has a lot of the investment community frustrated,\u201d Seifert said. Berkshire has never had public or investor relations departments, and the company skips the quarterly investor calls that nearly every public company holds. Buffett has long said he prefers to share results with every investor at the same time, on Saturdays, and give them the weekend to digest the results before the markets reopen.",
      "Berkshire said Saturday that it earned $30.796 billion, or $21,413 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's up from last year's $26.251 billion, or $18,272 per A share.",

      "On that measure, Berkshire's operating profit jumped to $13.485 billion, or $9376.15 per Class A share, thanks to a strong rebound in its insurance companies. A year ago, Berkshire reported operating earnings of $10.09 billion, or $7,023.01 per Class A share.",

      "Black vultures have killed and eaten several calves on Tom Karr\u2019s cattle ranch in southeastern Ohio, a loss he says didn't happen two decades ago",
      "EMINENCE, Ky. -- Allan Bryant scans the sky as he watches over a minutes-old calf huddled under a tree line with its mother. After a few failed tries, the calf stands on wobbly legs for the first time, looking to nurse.",
      "Above, a pair of birds circle in the distance. Bryant, hoping they're not black vultures, is relieved to see they're only turkey vultures \u2014 red-headed and not aggressive.",
      "\u201cHonestly, the black vulture is one of the ugliest things I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re easy to hate.\u201d",
      "Black vultures, scavengers that sometimes attack and kill sick or newborn animals, didn't used to be a problem here. But now Bryant frequently sees the birds following a birth. He hasn't lost a calf in several years, but they've killed his animals before. So now he takes measures to stop them.",
      "In some of his fields, he erects a scarecrow of sorts \u2014 a dead black vulture \u2014 aimed at scaring off the birds. It's a requirement of his depredation permit through the Kentucky Farm Bureau, which allows him to shoot a few birds a year. The dead bird keeps the live birds away for about a week, but they eventually come back, he said.",
      "It\u2019s a problem that may grow worse for cattle farmers as the scavenging birds\u2019 range expands northward, in part due to climate change. Lobbying groups have been pushing for legislation that would allow landowners to kill more of these birds, which are protected but not endangered. But experts say more research is needed to better understand how the birds impact livestock and how their removal could affect ecosystems.",
      "Black vultures used to mainly live in the southeastern U.S. and farther south in Latin and South America, but over the past century they've started to rapidly stretch northward and also west into the desert Southwest, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at Cornell Lab of Ornithology who studies bird migration.",
      "Warmer winters on average, fueled by climate change, are making it easier for the birds to stay in places that used to be too cold for them. What's more, the human footprint in suburban and rural areas is enriching their habitat: development means cars, and cars mean roadkill. Cattle farms can also offer a buffet of vulnerable animals for vultures that learn the seasonal calving schedule.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned from a lot of different studies of birds, it\u2019s that they are very good at taking advantage of food resources and remembering where those things are,\u201d Farnsworth said.",
      "Although black vultures are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, they aren't really a migratory species, he said. Instead, they breed, and some disperse to new areas and settle there.",
      "After losing a calf to a black vulture a decade ago, Tom Karr, who raises cattle near Pomeroy, Ohio, tried to move his fall calving season later in the year in hopes the vultures would be gone by then. But that didn't help \u2014 the birds stay all year, he said.",
      "Until newborn calves are a few days old, \u201cwe try to keep them up closer to the barns,\u201d said Joanie Grimes, the owner of a 350-head calf-cow operation in Hillsboro, Ohio. She said they've been dealing with the birds for 15 years, but keeping them out of remote fields has helped improve matters.",
      "Annette Ericksen has noticed the black vultures for several years on her property, Twin Maples Farm in Milton, West Virginia, but they haven't yet lost any animals to them. When they expect calves and lambs, they move the livestock into a barn, and they also use dogs \u2014 Great Pyrenees \u2014 trained to patrol the fields and the barnyard for raptors that might hurt the animals.",

      "\u201cThe difficulty with that is, if the birds show up, by the time you can get your permit, get all that taken care of, the damage is done,\u201d said Brian Shuter, executive vice president of the Indiana Beef Cattle Association. Farmers said calves can be worth hundreds of dollars or upward of $1,000 or $2,000, depending on the breed.",
      "In March, lawmakers in Congress introduced a bill that would let farmers capture or kill any black vulture \u201cin order to prevent death, injury, or destruction to livestock.\u201d Many farmers and others in the cattle industry have supported the move, and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association in July commended the House Natural Resources Committee for advancing the bill.",
      "Farnsworth, of the Cornell lab, said it's not necessarily a good thing to make it easier to kill black vultures, which he said fill \u201ca super important role\" in cleaning up \u201cdead stuff.\u201d",
      "Simply killing the birds, Farnsworth said, may make room for more bothersome predators or scavengers. He said though black vultures can leave behind gory damage, current research doesn't show that they account for an outsize proportion of livestock deaths.",

      "Trump fired the first shot in the trade war in February when he imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods over the allegation that Beijing failed to stem the flow of chemicals used to make fentanyl.

      "China's promise to delay its newest restrictions on the export of the rare earths that are crucial to many high-tech products for one year as part of a trade agreement President Donald Trump secured creates an opportunity for the U.S. and its allies to bolster their own production and processing capabilities. But it will be hard to undercut China's stranglehold on the market.",
      "The restrictions China imposed on rare earths this year have been a key issue in the trade talks between Beijing and Washington. Trump responded angrily to China's latest rules with a threat to impose an additional 100% tariff on all Chinese imports, but he has since dropped that demand as part of this agreement.",
      "This week's deal will delay the regulations that would have required foreign companies to get special approval to export items that contain even small traces of rare earths elements sourced from China even if those products were made elsewhere by foreign companies, but it doesn't eliminate restrictions that were imposed in the spring after Trump imposed his tariffs.",
      "These critical minerals are needed in a broad range of products, from jet engines, radar systems, electric vehicles and robots to consumer electronics including laptops and phones. China accounts for nearly 70% of the world\u2019s rare earths mining. It also controls roughly 90% of global rare earths processing.",
      "Neha Mukherjee, a rare earths analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said the one-year delay in China\u2019s new rare earth export controls that were announced earlier this month provides some short-term relief that will allow exports to return to a more normal level, but it doesn\u2019t change the broader strategic picture, and it's important for America and its allies to continue investing in the industry.",
      "\u201cThis move appears more tactical than structural, a pause to stabilize trade relations with the U.S. rather than a policy reversal,\u201d Mukherjee said. \"This is a temporary window for the U.S. and allies to accelerate diversification before controls likely return.\u201d",
      "The White House has made it a priority to revive and expand the domestic critical minerals industry while also seeking supplies of these elements from allies. The Pentagon agreed to invest $400 million in rare-earth producer MP Materials and promised to ensure every magnet made at its massive new plant is bought and set a minimum price for its neodymium and praseodymium products for a decade.",
      "Ian Lange, who is an economics professor who focuses on rare earths at the Colorado School of Mines, said he thinks the U.S. and its allies can make significant progress in a year\u2019s time to lessen China\u2019s dominance of the rare earths market.",
      "There are a number of promising efforts already underway. Noveon will continue to produce rare earth magnets at its plant in Texas, and MP Materials and USA Rare Earth are both scheduled to begin producing magnets at their plants over the next year. And starting next year MP also plans to begin processing the heavy rare earths China had restricted in the spring at the only operating U.S. rare earths mine in Mountain Pass, California.",
      "And Lange said that other efforts to recycle rare earths and begin producing them as byproducts at existing steel and zirconium mines may also start to pay off. The United States\u2019 recent agreement with Australia will also help provide additional materials to counter China.",
      "China has shown little sign of being willing to allow rare earth exports to defense contractors, which is concerning given the national security implications. But military demand for rare earths is relatively small, so America might be able to supply its needs by prioritizing rare earths from other sources for use in fighter jets, guided missiles and nuclear submarines.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate passed a resolution Thursday that would undo many of President Donald Trump's tariffs around the globe, the latest note of displeasure at his trade tactics in Washington that came just as the president celebrated his negotiations with China as a success.",
      "After a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea, Trump said he would cut tariffs on the Asian economic giant and China would in turn purchase 25 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans annually for the next three years. The Republican president claimed his trade negotiation would secure \u201cprosperity and security to millions of Americans.\u201d",
      "But back in Washington, senators \u2014 several from Trump's Republican Party \u2014 have demonstrated their dissent with Trump's tariff tactics by passing a series of resolutions this week that would nullify the national emergencies that Trump has declared to justify the import taxes. Already this week, the Senate approved resolutions to end tariffs imposed on Brazil and Canada. While the legislative efforts are ultimately doomed, they exposed fault lines in the GOP.",
      "The latest resolution, which would effectively end most of Trump's tariff policies, passed on a 51-47 vote, with four Republicans joining with all Democrats.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who backed Democrats on the resolutions, credited Trump for decreasing the tariffs on China, but said the result is \u201cstill much higher than we\u2019ve had.\u201d",
      "\"It still will lead to increased prices,\" he said.",
      "The votes were orchestrated by Democrats using a decades-old law that allows Congress to nullify a presidential emergency. But House Republicans have instituted a new law that allows the leadership to prevent such resolutions from coming up for a vote. Plus, Trump would surely veto legislation that inhibits his power over trade policy, meaning the legislation won't ultimately take effect.",
      "But Democrats have still been able to force the Senate to take up an uncomfortable topic for their Republican colleagues.",
      "\u201cAmerican families are being squeezed by prices going up and up and up,\u201d said Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, in a floor speech. He added that \u201cin many ways, red states in rural areas are being hit the hardest,\u201d and pointed to economic strain being put on farmers and manufacturers.",
      "Overall there has been little movement among Republicans to oppose Trump's import taxes publicly. A nearly identical resolution failed in April on a tied vote after Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky was absent. On Thursday, McConnell and Paul, as well as Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, voted along with all Democrats to pass the resolution.",
      "Those four Republicans helped advance similar resolutions this week to end the tariffs on Brazil and Canada. Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, also voted in favor of the resolution applying to Brazil, but otherwise, GOP senators have held the line this week behind the president.",

      "The Chinese promise to buy at least 25 million metric tons of soybeans annually for next three years will bring their purchases back in line with where they were before President Donald Trump launched his trade war with China in the spring.

      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said China also agreed to remove all its retaliatory tariffs on American ag products, which should open the door for sales of other crops and beef. Plus, China promised to resume buying U.S. sorghum, which is another crop largely used for animal feed that depends on that market. More than half the sorghum and soybean crops are exported every year with much of that going to China.",

      "Trump had promised to offer farmers a significant aid package this fall to help them survive the trade war with China, but it's been put on hold because of the ongoing government shutdown.

      "Ohtani is batting .318 in the World Series with three homers, five RBIs and eight walks. The unprecedented two-way star is 0-1 with a 6.00 ERA after striking out six and walking one in his Game 4 start, when he threw 93 pitches.",
      "His only prior outing on three days\u2019 rest was on April 21, 2017, when he allowed two hits over seven innings and struck out 11 in a 2-0 win over Kansas City. His start at Boston on April 17 was cut short by a rain delay after two innings and 31 pitches.",
      "Every other major league start by Ohtani has been with five or six or more days' rest.",

      "Starting Ohtani made more sense than using him in relief.",
      "Under a rule adopted for the 2022 season, pitchers who start games in the batting order can remain in the game as a designated hitter after leaving the mound. If Ohtani would start the game only as a DH and then would take the mound, the Dodgers would lose their DH and pitchers would have to bat in that slot if Ohtani was relieved.",

      "\u201cYou don\u2019t kind of pigeon hole him in his usage,\u201d he said.",

      "TORONTO -- Shohei Ohtani might start Game 7 of the World Series on Saturday. Tyler Glasnow might pitch on back-to-back days. For Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, the only certainty is that Yoshinobu Yamamoto won't pitch. Besides that?",
      "\"Everyone will be available,\" Roberts said.",

      "\u201cI think right now, there\u2019s no wrong answer,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly going to be a part of the pitching plan. With Shohei it could be two innings, but it could be four innings. So I\u2019m not sure where we\u2019re going to slot him. We\u2019re going to have to talk to him first on where he feels most comfortable.\u201d",
      "If Ohtani entered as a reliever after starting the game as a designated hitter, he would need to play a position after pitching to remain in the game. The Dodgers would lose their DH.",
      "Per MLB rules created to facilitate Ohtani's two-way status, Ohtani can remain in the game as a DH if he begins the game as the starting pitcher.",
      "Ohtani threw 93 pitches in Wednesday\u2019s 6-2 loss in Game 4, allowing four runs and six hits in six innings.",
      "Ohtani has never pitched in relief during his Major League Baseball career.

      "Los Angeles had been expected to start Tyler Glasnow before he closed out a 3-1 victory in Game 6. The 6-foot-8 right-hander is likely still available, but manager Dave Roberts could also start Shohei Ohtani for 2-4 innings on short rest.",

      "Toronto gave the three-time Cy Young Award winner a $15.5 million, one-year contract. Scherzer picked his destination hoping to win a third World Series ring, after titles with Washington in 2019 and Texas in 2023. The 18-year big league veteran has eagerly shared his experience with the Blue Jays.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not afraid to question baserunning, question defense, question offense. He still thinks he\u2019s our best baserunner on the team from his days with the Nationals,\u201d Blue Jays manager John Schneider said Friday. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid to push the envelope. He\u2019s not afraid to be curious. He\u2019s not afraid to share things that he\u2019s been through that maybe I haven\u2019t been through.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of teams that don\u2019t like Max Scherzers just because he questions everything,\" teammate Chris Bassitt added. \"He wants to know every little detail from outfield positioning to why you\u2019re throwing this pitch to who is playing here to how we control off days.",

And then I told the pitching staff about him, and I told the coaching staff, like: This is a guy that\u2019s going to stir a lot of pots,\" Bassitt said. \u201cSo everyone looked at Max, the 41-year-old that might end up on the IL a couple times, and they don\u2019t understand the true value of having that veteran guy that knows what it takes to win, and then he might teach you a thing or two along the way, too.\u201d",

      "Glasnow, acquired from Tampa Bay in December 2023, was sidelined between April 27 and July 9 by right shoulder inflammation. The 32-year-old right-hander has a 1.42 ERA in three starts and two relief outings this postseason.",

      "Los Angeles kept alive its bid for a third title in six seasons.",
      "TORONTO -- A two-run lead was starting to slip away from the Los Angeles Dodgers in the ninth inning \u2014 along with their chance to force the World Series to Game 7.",
      "And then Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez turned what might have been a tying, two-run single by Andr\u00e9s Gim\u00e9nez into the first game-ending left field-to-second base double play in postseason history.",
      "\u201cThe crazy thing is I had no idea where the ball was because it was in the lights the whole time,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said after preserving a 3-1 win over the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 6 on Friday night.",
      "Instead of getting a World Series-winning, three-run homer like the one Joe Carter hit off Philadelphia's Mitch Williams to capture the title in Game 6 in 1993, the Blue Jays were pushed to Game 7 and the Dodgers kept alive their chance to become the first repeat champion since the 1998-2000 New York Yankees.",
      "Max Scherzer will start Game 7 for Toronto against a Dodgers pitcher still to be determined \u2014 perhaps two-way star Shohei Ohtani, perhaps Tyler Glasnow. The October Classic will end in November for the 10th time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the two best words in sports: Game 7,\" Toronto manager John Schneider said.",
      "Yoshinobu Yamamoto beat Toronto for the second time in a week by allowing one run in six innings, and slumping Mookie Betts hit a two-run single in a three-run third against Kevin Gausman that included Will Smith's go-ahead double.",
      "George Springer, back after missing two games with a sore right side, hit an RBI single in the bottom half, and the Dodgers held that 3-1 lead going to the ninth.",
      "Roki Sasaki hit Alejandro Kirk on the left wrist with an 0-2 splitter leading off and Addison Barger followed with a drive that landed at the base of the left-center wall. In a seldom-seen rarity, the ball lodged there instead of caroming back into play.",
      "Both runners crossed the plate as many in the Rogers Centre crowd initially thought Toronto had tied the game, but the rule book is clear that a ball lodged in a fence is a ground-rule double. The runners were placed at second and third, and Dodgers manager Dave Roberts brought in Glasnow, who was lined up to start Game 7 on normal rest.",
      "\u201cI just felt that Roki wasn\u2019t as sharp, and I just felt we needed some swing-and-miss and Glasnow was the guy. So I had him loose, kind of looming,\u201d Roberts said.",
      "Glasnow escaped with just three pitches, earning the first save of the Series.",
      "Ernie Clement popped up his initial offering to first base. Gim\u00e9nez took a ball and hit the next 247 feet to the opposite field, in short left.",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez said he decided to play more shallow than the Dodgers' scouting card called for. He ran 52 feet and while on the run made a catch that had only a 40% probability, then delivered a one-hop throw to second baseman Miguel Rojas that doubled up Barger.",
      "\u201cFor a split second as Glasnow threw the ball, the crowd got quiet and I was able to hear that the bat broke,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cSo I just got a really good jump on the ball and I came in and halfway there, the ball got in the lights. And I was just like, not the right time to stop to see where the ball is, just keep going.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to hit me in the face \u2014 but I\u2019m not stopping,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez remembered thinking. \"I\u2019m not pulling up. And at the very end, the ball came out of the lights and went into my glove.\u201d",

      "With Los Angeles seeking its third title in six seasons, Roberts dropped the slumping Betts from second to third in the batting order in Game 5 and then to fourth in Game 6 \u2014 the lowest Betts had hit since 2017.",
      "Betts fell behind 1-2 in the count, fouled off two pitches and laced Gausman\u2019s third straight fastball between shortstop and third for a 3-0 lead. That ended an 0-for-13 stretch with the bases loaded for the Dodgers that dated to the Division Series.",
      "\u201cHe could hit me seventh, I don\u2019t care. I just want to win,\" said Betts, already a three-time champion. \u201cWhatever we do, however we get there, I\u2019ll jump on whoever\u2019s back to go. We all get a ring, that\u2019s all I care about.\u201d",
      "Scherzer and Glasnow started Game 3, won by the Dodgers 6-5 in 18 innings. A 41-year-old right-hander, Scherzer will become the fourth pitcher to start multiple World Series winner-take-all Game 7s after Bob Gibson (1964, \u201967, \u201968), Lew Burdette and Don Larsen (both 1957 and \u201958). Scherzer allowed two runs over five innings for Washington against Houston in 2019, and the Nationals rallied for a 6-2 win.",

      "The win snapped a four-game losing streak for the Tar Heels (3-5, 1-3 ACC), while the Orange (3-6, 1-5) lost for the fifth consecutive time. North Carolina lost its previous two games by a combined four points.",
      "The Tar Heels had not scored more than 20 points against an FBS team and trailed 10-6 when Lopez hit June for a short gain of 9 yards on the team\u2019s first play of the second half. June then broke a tackle and scampered 63 yards down the right sideline for a 72-yard scoring play to give the Tar Heels a 13-10 lead they would never surrender. On the team\u2019s next series, June ran it in from 5 yards out for a 20-10 margin. A 21-yard scoring strike from Lopez to Jordan Shipp gave the Tar Heels a 27-10 lead and 21 unanswered points.",

      "Syracuse walk-on Joe Filardi, a true freshman, started at quarterback for the Orange. He was 1 of 11 in the first half and didn\u2019t complete his first pass until 6:12 remained in the half. He finished 4 of 18 for 39 yards. Filardi replaced struggling LSU transfer Rickie Collins, who had gone 0-4 as a starter in relief of Steve Angeli. Angeli, who directed the Orange to a 3-1 start, suffered a season-ending Achilles injury against Clemson. Syracuse hasn\u2019t won since.",
      "The only touchdown in the first half came courtesy of the Syracuse defense. Devin Grant knocked the ball loose from Shamar Easter on a short completion from Lopez.

      "The recent escape of several research monkeys after the truck carrying them overturned on a Mississippi interstate is the latest glimpse into the secretive world of animal research",
      "The recent escape of several research monkeys after the truck carrying them overturned on a Mississippi interstate is the latest glimpse into the secretive industry of animal research and the processes that allow key details of what happened to be kept from the public.",
      "Three monkeys have remained on the loose since the crash on Tuesday in a rural area along Interstate 59, spilling wooden crates labeled \u201clive monkeys\u201d into the tall grass near the highway. Since then, searchers in masks, face shields and other protective equipment have scoured nearby fields and woods for the missing primates. Five of the 21 Rhesus macaques on board were killed during the search, according to the local sheriff, but it was unclear how that happened.",
      "Mississippi authorities have not disclosed the driver's name, the company involved in transporting the monkeys, where the monkeys were headed or who owns them. While Tulane University in New Orleans has acknowledged that the monkeys had been housed at its National Biomedical Research Center in Covington, Louisiana, it said it doesn't own them and won't identify who does.",
      "The questions surrounding the Mississippi crash and the mystery of why the animals were traveling through the South are remarkable, animal advocates say.",
      "\u201cWhen a truck carrying 21 monkeys crashes on a public highway, the community has a right to know who owned those animals, where they were being sent, and what diseases they may have been exposed to and harbored simply by being caught up in the primate experimentation industry,\u201d said Lisa Jones-Engel, senior science adviser on primate experimentation with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.",
      "\u201cIt is highly unusual \u2014 and deeply troubling \u2014 that Tulane refuses to identify its partner in this shipment,\u201d Jones-Engel added.",
      "Transporting research animals typically requires legally binding contracts that prevent the parties involved from disclosing information, Tulane University said in a statement to The Associated Press. That's done for the safety of the animals and to protect proprietary information, the New Orleans-based university said.",
      "\u201cTo the best of Tulane\u2019s knowledge, the 13 recovered animals remain in the possession of their owner and are en route to their original destination,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The crash has drawn a range of reactions \u2014 from conspiracy theories that suggest a government plot to sicken people to serious responses from people who oppose experimenting on animals.",

This fall, the facility's name was changed from the Tulane National Primate Research Center to the Tulane National Biomedical Research Center to reflect its broader mission, university officials announced.",
      "The Mississippi crash is one of at least three major monkey escapes in the U.S. over the past four years.",
      "Last November, 43 Rhesus macaques escaped from a South Carolina compound that breeds them for medical research after an enclosure wasn't fully locked. Employees from the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee, South Carolina, set up traps to capture them. However, some spent two months that winter living in the woods and weathering a rare snowstorm. By late January, the last four escapees were recaptured after being lured back into captivity by peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.",
      "In January 2022, several cynomolgus macaque monkeys escaped when a truck towing a trailer of about 100 of the animals collided with a dump truck on a Pennsylvania highway, authorities said. The monkeys were headed to a quarantine facility in an undisclosed location after arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on a flight from Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation, authorities said. A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said all of the animals were accounted for within about a day, though three were euthanized for undisclosed reasons.",

      "Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia plans to supply its graphics processing units for projects with the South Korean businesses and government to advance the country\u2019s artificial intelligence infrastructure and technologies",
      "GYEONGJU, South Korea -- Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia plans to supply hundreds of thousands of its graphics processing units for projects with South Korean businesses and the government to advance the country\u2019s artificial intelligence infrastructure and technologies.",
      "The plan was announced Friday by the government, Nvidia, and some of South Korea\u2019s biggest companies, including chipmakers Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and auto giant Hyundai Motor, after President Lee Jae Myung met with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.",
      "At a news conference, Huang said he hopes to export Nvidia\u2019s most advanced AI chips to China, following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on loosening U.S. chip restrictions as the two leaders pledged to reduce trade tensions.",
      "However, he acknowledged that it was up to Trump to decide, and said there were no current plans to sell the next generation Blackwell chips to China.",
      "Huang has gotten rockstar treatment reminiscent of Apple\u2019s Steve Jobs since arriving in South Korea on Thursday to attend meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Gyeongju. As APEC host, South Korea is using the gathering of world leaders to showcase its ambitions in AI.",
      "According to Lee\u2019s office and the companies, Nvidia will supply around 260,000 GPUs to support South Korea\u2019s AI computing and manufacturing capabilities.",
      "About 50,000 of the GPUs will be used to support a government project to build a national cloud computing center for AI and Nvidia will provide the same number of GPUs each to Samsung and SK to help them enhance their manufacturing processes through AI and accelerate the development of advanced semiconductors.",
      "Hyundai and Nvidia said they plan to collaborate on developing technologies related to self-driving cars, smart factories and robotics, a process that will be powered by 50,000 of Nvidia\u2019s advanced Blackwell GPUs.",
      "Speaking to business leaders, Huang highlighted how AI and advanced computing are driving a profound transformation across industries, adding to the need for more infrastructure and capacity. South Korea\u2019s strengths in software, technical expertise and manufacturing give it an edge, he said.",
      "\u201cWhen you combine software, AI technology, and manufacturing, you have the opportunity to really take advantage of robotics,\u201d which is the future of AI, Huang said.",
      "Santa Clara-based Nvidia, whose GPU chips power much of the global AI industry, featured in talks Thursday between Trump and Xi in the South Korean city of Busan, where the leaders agreed to take steps to ease their escalating trade war.",

Trump and former President Joe Biden have imposed restrictions on China\u2019s access to the most advanced chips, including those used for AI. Trump said China will speak with Nvidia about purchasing their chips, but not the company\u2019s latest Blackwell AI chips.",
      "Nvidia has argued that U.S. export controls hinder American competitiveness in one of the world\u2019s largest technology markets and warned that such limits could push other countries toward China\u2019s AI technology. Talking to reporters in South Korea, Huang said he hopes to eventually sell Blackwell chips to China, \u201cbut that\u2019s a decision for the president to make.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re always hoping to return to China,\u201d Huang said. \u201cIt\u2019s in the best interest of the United States, it\u2019s in the best interests of China. And so I\u2019m hopeful that both governments will arrive at a conclusion someday where Nvidia\u2019s technology could be exported to China.\u201d",
      "Huang acknowledged U.S. security concerns about Nvidia technology being used by China\u2019s military but argued that China already has ample AI capabilities, making the use of Nvidia chips for military purposes largely unnecessary.",
      "In August, Trump announced a deal with Nvidia and AMD, another chipmaker, to lift export controls on sales of advanced chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut of the revenue, despite concerns among national security experts that such chips will end up in the hands of Chinese military and intelligence services.",
      "Nvidia earlier this week confirmed that it has become the first $5 trillion company, just three months after the company broke through the $4 trillion mark. The milestone underscores the upheaval driven by the AI craze, widely seen as the biggest technological shift since Apple co-founder Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago.",

The tech executives clinked glasses, took bomb shots, and at one point, Huang stepped outside to hand baskets of chicken and fried cheese to the crowd waiting outside.",
      "The three later took the stage before hundreds of cheering fans at a nearby gaming festival, where Huang said Korea\u2019s gaming scene aided Nvidia\u2019s early success back when it mainly made graphics cards for gamers.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple's iPhone sales growth decelerated during its summertime quarter, but the company still delivered financial results that exceeded analyst projections while the trendsetting company continued to catch up to its Big Tech peers in the artificial intelligence race.",
      "The performance announced Thursday was driven largely by strong initial demand for the premium models of the iPhone 17 lineup that went on sale last month.",
      "Although the iPhone 17 lacks the AI wizardry featured in rival devices recently introduced by Samsung and Google, Apple spruced up its latest models with a redesign highlighted by a sleek \u201cliquid glass\u201d appearance on the display screens.",
      "Apple also largely maintained its pricing on its latest iPhones, despite being squeezed by President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war that imposed tariffs on the U.S. devices that the company mostly makes in India and China.",
      "The formula apparently was enough to win over consumers, particularly in the United States, and deliver iPhone sales totaling $49 billion during the July-September period, a 6% from the same time last year. That was slightly below the 8% increase in iPhone sales that had been anticipated by analysts, and less than the 13% bump in sales during the April-June period.",
      "Buoyed by the iPhone results, Apple earned $27.5 billion, or $1.85 per share, nearly doubling its profit from a year ago. Revenue climbed 8% from a year ago to $102.5 billion. Both the earnings and revenue eclipsed the analyst forecasts that steer the stock market.",

A key next step is developing aerial robots that can be deployed in swarms and make their own decisions about where to search, said Ryan Williams, an associate professor at Virginia Tech.",

      "Williams tackled that problem with a recent project that involved programming drones to choose search trajectories in coordination with human searchers. Among other things, his team used historical data from thousands of missing person cases to create a model predicting how someone would behave if lost in the woods.",
      "\u201cAnd then we used that model to better localize our drones, to search in locations with higher chances of finding someone,\u201d he said.",
      "At WPI, Sanket\u2019s project addresses other limitations of current drones, including their size and perception capabilities.",

      "During a recent demonstration, a student used a remote control to launch the drone in a brightly lit room and then again after turning off all but a faintly glowing red light. As it approached a clear, Plexiglas wall, the drone repeatedly halted and backed away, even with the lights off and with fog and fake snow swirling through the air.",
      "\u201cCurrently, search and rescue robots are mainly operational in broad daylight,\u201d Sanket said. \u201cThe problem is that search and rescues are dull, dangerous and dirty jobs that happen a lot of times in darkness.\u201d",

The researchers realized that the noise of the bat robot\u2019s propellers interfered with the ultrasound, requiring 3D printed shells to minimize the interference. They also used artificial intelligence to teach the drone how to filter and interpret sound signals.",
      "Still, there\u2019s a long way to go to match bats, which can contract and compress their muscles to listen only to certain echoes and can detect something as small as a human hair from several meters away.",

      "A Yup'ik community near the Bering Sea in southwest Alaska was spared the widespread devastation other communities experienced from the remnants of Typhoon Halong earlier this month",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- A fragment of a mask that was preserved for hundreds of years in permafrost sat in the muck of a low tide in the western Alaska community of Quinhagak. Wooden spoons, toys, a fishing lure and other artifacts were strewn, in some cases for miles, along the beach.",
      "The Yup'ik community near the edge of the Bering Sea was spared the widespread devastation wrought by the remnants of Typhoon Halong on its neighbors further west earlier this month. But it suffered a different kind of blow: The lashing winds and storm surge devoured dozens of feet of shoreline, disrupting a culturally significant archaeological site and washing away possibly thousands of unearthed artifacts.",
      "About 1,000 pieces, including wooden masks and tools, were recovered in Quinhagak after the storm ravaged parts of southwest Alaska on Oct. 11 and 12. But many more pieces \u2014 perhaps up to 100,000 \u2014 were left scattered, said Rick Knecht, an archaeologist who has worked on the Nunalleq, or old village, project for 17 years. That's roughly the number of pieces previously recovered from the archaeological site.",
      "Meanwhile, freezing temperatures and ice have settled into the region, stalling immediate efforts to find and recover more displaced artifacts on searches done by four-wheeler and foot.",
      "Knecht called what happened a major loss. The site has yielded the world's largest collection of pre-contact Yup'ik artifacts. Much of what's known about Yup'ik life before outsiders arrived stems from the project, said Knecht, an emeritus senior lecturer in archaeology at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.",
      "\u201cWhen there are holes or disturbances in the site, it\u2019s like trying to read a book with holes in the pages. You're going to miss a few things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the bigger those holes are, the weaker the story gets. There\u2019s a few holes in the book right now.\u201d",
      "While the name of the original village isn't known, it was attacked by another village and burned around 1650, he said. Knecht has worked with elders and others in Quinhagak to combine their traditional knowledge with the technology and techniques used by the archaeology teams to study the past together.",
      "Quinhagak has about 800 residents, and subsistence food gathering is critically important to them.",
      "The storm dispersed artifacts from a site long preserved by permafrost, Knecht said. A longstanding concern has been the threat that climate change \u2014 melting permafrost, coastal erosion, the potential for more frequent or stronger storms \u2014 has posed to the site, he said.",
      "It poses risks to the community itself. Erosion threatens major infrastructure in Quinhagak, including a sewage lagoon, homes and fish camps. Thawing permafrost is also unsettling and undermining buildings, according to a 2024 report from the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.",
      "The excavation project itself began after artifacts began appearing on the beach around 2007. Part of the site that washed out had been excavated previously.",

      "When he left in July, there was a roughly 30-foot buffer to the sea. The storm took out the buffer and another 30 feet of the site, he said. It also left what Knecht described as piano-sized clumps of tundra on the tidal flats.",

If one were to just take one of the wooden artifacts off the beach and let them dry, they'd \u201ccrack to pieces, sometimes in a matter of hours.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Producing and manufacturing electric vehicles and their batteries uses a lot of energy, leading many to be skeptical about the environmental benefits of going electric",
      "DETROIT -- Making electric vehicles and their batteries is a dirty process that uses a lot of energy. But a new study says that EVs quickly make up for that with less overall emissions through two years of use than a gas-powered vehicle.",
      "The study also estimated that gas-powered vehicles cause at least twice as much environmental damage over their lifetimes as EVs, and said the benefits of EVs can be expected to increase in coming decades as clean sources of power, such as solar and wind, are brought onto the grid.",
      "The work by researchers from Northern Arizona University and Duke University, published Wednesday in the journal PLOS Climate, offers insight into a transportation sector that makes up a big part of U.S. emissions. It also comes as some EV skeptics have raised concerns about whether the environmental impact of battery production, including mining, makes it worthwhile to switch to electric.",
      "\u201cWhile there is a bigger carbon footprint in the very short term because of the manufacturing process in creating the batteries for electric vehicles, very quickly you come out ahead in CO2 emissions by year three and then for all of the rest of the vehicle lifetime, you\u2019re far ahead and so cumulatively much lower carbon footprint,\" said Drew Shindell, an earth science professor at Duke University and study co-author.",
      "The researchers evaluated several harmful air pollutants monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as emissions data, to compare the relative impact over time of EVs and internal combustion engines on air quality and climate change.",
      "Their analysis said that EVs produce 30% higher carbon dioxide emissions than gasoline vehicles in their first two years. That can be attributed to the energy-intensive production and manufacturing processes involved in mining lithium for EV batteries.",
      "They also sought to account for how the U.S. energy system might develop in coming years, assuming growth in clean energy. And they modeled four different scenarios for EV adoption, ranging from the lowest \u2014 a 31% share of vehicle sales \u2014 to the highest, 75% of sales, by 2050. (EV sales accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2024.)",
      "The researchers said the average of those four models found that for each additional kilowatt hour of lithium-ion battery output, carbon dioxide emissions drop by an average of 220 kilograms (485 pounds) in 2030, and another 127 kilograms (280 pounds) in 2050.",
      "The consistent decrease in CO2 emissions from EVs is \u201cnot only driven by the on-road vehicles, but also reduction that has been brought due to electricity production,\u201d said lead author Pankaj Sadavarte, a postdoctoral researcher at Northern Arizona University.",
      "Greg Keoleian, a University of Michigan professor of sustainable systems who wasn\u2019t involved in the research, called it a \u201cvaluable study\u201d that echoes other findings and \u201cconfirms the environmental and economic benefits\u201d of EVs.",
      "\u201cAccelerating the adoption of battery electric vehicles is a key strategy for decarbonizing the transportation sector which will reduce future damages and costs of climate change,\u201d he said.",
      "Shindell, the Duke researcher, said the grid will evolve to have more solar and wind power.",
      "\u201cWhen you add a bunch of electric vehicles, nobody\u2019s going to build new coal-fired power plants to run these things because coal is really expensive compared to renewables,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the grid just overall becomes much cleaner in both the terms of carbon emissions for climate change, and for air pollution.\"",
      "Outside experts agreed \u2014 as long as the policy landscape supports it. That hasn't been the case under President Donald Trump, who has worked to boost fossil fuels and restrain solar and wind power development.",

But Trump reversed that policy, and Congress has terminated federal tax credits for an EV purchase. The administration has also targeted vehicle pollution rules that would encourage greater uptake of EVs in the U.S., and the president has attempted to halt a nationwide EV charging buildout.",

      "If it happens, the deal would mark the end of months of uncertainty about the fate of the popular video-sharing platform in the United States. After wide bipartisan majorities in Congress passed \u2014 and President Joe Biden signed \u2014 a law that would ban TikTok in the U.S. if it did not find a new owner in the place of China's ByteDance, the platform was set to go dark on the law's January deadline. For a several hours, it did. But on his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order to keep it running while his administration tries to reach an agreement for the sale of the company.",
      "Three more executive orders followed, as Trump, without a clear legal basis, continued to extend the deadline for a TikTok deal. The second was in April, when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump\u2019s tariff announcement. The third came in June, then another in September, which Trump said would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States in a way that meets national security concerns.",
      "Trump\u2019s order was meant to enable an American-led group of investors to buy the app from China\u2019s ByteDance, though the deal also requires China\u2019s approval.",
      "However, TikTok deal is \u201cnot really a big thing for Xi Jinping,\u201d said Bonnie Glaser, managing director of the German Marshall Fund's Indo-Pacific program, during a media briefing Tuesday. \u201c(China is) happy to let (Trump) declare that they have finally kept a deal. Whether or not that deal will protect the data of Americans is a big question going forward.\u201d",
      "\u201cA big question mark for the United States, of course, is whether this is consistent with U.S. law since there was a law passed by Congress,\u201d Glaser said.",

China previously stated the algorithm must remain under Chinese control by law.

      "Bill Gates thinks climate change is a serious problem but he thinks scientific innovation will curb it",
      "NEW YORK -- Bill Gates thinks climate change is a serious problem but it won't be the end of civilization. He thinks scientific innovation will curb it, and it\u2019s instead time for a \u201cstrategic pivot\u201d in the global climate fight: from focusing on limiting rising temperatures to fighting poverty and preventing disease.",
      "A doomsday outlook has led the climate community to focus too much on near-term goals to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that cause warming, diverting resources from the most effective things that can be done to improve life in a warming world, Gates said. In a memo released Tuesday, Gates said the world\u2019s primary goal should instead be to prevent suffering, particularly for those in the toughest conditions in the world\u2019s poorest countries.",
      "If given a choice between eradicating malaria and a tenth of a degree increase in warming, Gates told reporters, \u201cI\u2019ll let the temperature go up 0.1 degree to get rid of malaria. People don\u2019t understand the suffering that exists today.\u201d",
      "The Microsoft co-founder spends most of his time now on the goals of the Gates Foundation, which has poured tens of billions of dollars into health care, education and development initiatives worldwide, including combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. He started Breakthrough Energy in 2015 to speed up innovation in clean energy.",
      "He wrote his 17-page memo hoping to have an impact on next month\u2019s United Nations climate change conference in Brazil. He\u2019s urging world leaders to ask whether the little money designated for climate is being spent on the right things.",
      "Gates, whose foundation provides financial support for Associated Press coverage of health and development in Africa, is influential in the climate change conversation. He expects his \u201ctough truths about climate\u201d memo will be controversial.",
      "\u201cIf you think climate is not important, you won\u2019t agree with the memo. If you think climate is the only cause and apocalyptic, you won\u2019t agree with the memo,\u201d Gates said during a roundtable discussion with reporters ahead of the release. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of this pragmatic view of somebody who\u2019s, you know, trying to maximize the money and the innovation that goes to help in these poor countries.\u201d",
      "Every bit of additional warming correlates to more extreme weather, risks species extinction and brings the world closer to crossing tipping points where changes become irreversible, scientists say.",
      "University of Washington public health and climate scientist Kristie Ebi said she thoroughly agrees with Gates that the U.N. negotiations should focus on improving human health and well-being. But, she said, Gates assumes the world stays static and only one variable changes \u2014 faster deployment of green technologies \u2014 to curb climate change. She called that unlikely.",
      "Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, called the memo \u201cpointless, vague, unhelpful and confusing.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no reason to pit poverty reduction versus climate transformation. Both are utterly feasible, and readily so, if the Big Oil lobby is brought under control,\u201d he wrote in an email.",
      "Stanford University climate scientist Chris Field said there is room for a healthy discussion about whether the current framing of the climate crisis is typically too pessimistic.",
      "\u201cBut we should also invest for both the long term and the short term,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cA vibrant long-term future depends on both tackling climate change and supporting human development.\u201d",
      "Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer said he doesn't dispute the principle of making human well-being the primary objective of policy, but what about the natural world?",
      "\u201cClimate change is already wreaking havoc there,\" he wrote in an email. \"Can we truly live in a technological bubble? Do we want to?\u201d",

Gates concluded his memo by saying governments should work toward driving this difference to zero, and be rigorous about measuring the impact of every effort in the world\u2019s climate agenda.",

Artificial intelligence is helping accelerate advances in clean energy technologies, he added.",
      "At the same time, money to help developing countries adapt to climate change is shrinking. Led by the United States, rich countries are cutting their foreign aid budgets. President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax.",

      "Tourism officials said Zhufeng peak in Dingri county, where the Chinese side of Everest is located, is shut until further notice, according to an announcement Tuesday. Earlier in October, hundreds of hikers were trapped for days on Everest after a heavy snowstorm hit during China's national holidays, a peak travel season.",
      "The local weather forecast predicted snowfall and icy conditions into Wednesday, potentially a hazard for visitors at higher altitudes as even moderate amounts of snowfall can hamper trails and road conditions.",

    "story": [
      "A small company in Vermont that specializes in women's cycling apparel is at the center of the fight over President Donald Trump's contentious tariff policy",
      "BURLINGTON, Vt. -- From the moment President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on nearly every country, Nik Holm feared the company he leads might not survive.",
      "Terry Precision Cycling has made it 40 years with a product line specifically for women, navigating a tough early market, thin profit margins and a pandemic-era boom and bust. But Holm, the company president, wasn\u2019t sure how his operation could pay the tariffs first announced in April and stay in business.",
      "\u201cWe felt like our backs were up against the wall,\u201d he said, explaining why he joined a lawsuit challenging the tariffs that the Supreme Court will hear next week.",
      "Terry Precision Cycling\u2019s offices are tucked behind a Burlington, Vermont, coffee shop on a leafy street that bursts into color in the fall. Local accolades share wall space with bike saddles and a color wheel's worth of fabric samples. Orders are shipped out from a warehouse a few miles away.",
      "It seems an unlikely epicenter for the furor over Trump\u2019s tariffs playing out on the trading floors of global market exchanges and in the boardrooms of international corporations.",
      "But Terry Precision Cycling is one of a handful of small businesses that are challenging many of Trump's tariffs Wednesday before the Supreme Court in a case with extraordinary implications for the boundaries of presidential power and for the global economy.",
      "The company is small, but it works with suppliers around the world. It sells cycling shorts manufactured in the U.S. using materials imported from France, Guatemala and Italy. Its distinctive, colorfully printed bike jerseys are made with high-tech material that can't be found outside of China.",
      "Tariffs mean the company has to pay more for all those imports, and without the cash reserves of a big company, it has few choices to make up the shortfall besides raising prices for customers. The bewildering pace of changes in tariffs, especially on goods from China, has made setting prices more like rolling the dice. \u201cIf we don\u2019t know the rules of the game, how are we supposed to play?\u201d Holm asked.",
      "The company had to add $50 to one pair of shorts in the pipeline when China tariffs hit 145%, bringing the price to $199. \u201cName the cost and we can name the price, and then we can backtrack to see who can actually afford it,\u201d Holm said.",
      "The other companies in the lawsuit he joined are also small businesses, including a plumbing supply company in Utah, a wine importer from New York and a fishing-tackle maker in Pennsylvania.",
      "Holm started working for the company more than a decade ago, taking up cycling in earnest alongside the job. He often rides his bike to work and props it outside his office, alongside the company's designers and salespeople. A thin man with deep-set eyes and side-parted hair, Holm was named president about two years ago as the company started by women's cycling pioneer Georgena Terry was wrestling with a downturn in the outdoor market after the coronavirus pandemic. His normally level demeanor gets animated when he talks about the design of their padded shorts or the level of SPF protection in the jerseys.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all about fit and function, and feeling safe and comfortable,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s our foundation, getting people, getting women, riding. More butts on bikes and getting out there.\u201d",
      "The businesses challenging Trump's tariffs are represented by Liberty Justice Center, a libertarian-leaning legal group usually more aligned with conservative causes. But they say Trump is wrong on sweeping tariffs, which are projected to collect a total of some $3 trillion from businesses over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "They argue the president is using an emergency powers law that doesn't even mention tariffs to claim nearly unlimited powers to impose and change import duties at will, something no other president has done on such a scale.",
      "\u201cIt is practically what the American Revolution was fought over, the principle that taxation is not legitimate unless it is adopted by the representatives of the people,\u201d said Jeffrey Schwab, an attorney with the Liberty Justice Center.",
      "The Trump administration said the law lets the president regulate importation, and that includes tariffs. The president has been vocal about the case, suggesting at one point he might go to the arguments himself \u2014 something no other sitting president is recorded to have done. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the most important cases in the history of our country because if we don\u2019t win that case, we will be a weakened, troubled financial mess for many, many years to come,\u201d he said.",

      "The high court will now be asked to rule on the scope of a president's authority. The justices, three of whom were appointed by Trump, have so far been reluctant to check his extraordinary flex of executive power.",

The court found that the law didn\u2019t clearly give Biden the power to enact such a costly program.",
      "Trump\u2019s tariffs, by contrast, are expected to total in the trillions. They\u2019re also projected to increase people\u2019s bills by about $2,000 per household this year, an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab found.",
      "Revenue from tariffs totaled $195 billion by September, more than double what it was the year before \u2014 though the government could have to pay back that money if the justices strike down the tariffs.",
      "Trump has acknowledged that Americans could feel some short-term pain from tariffs but maintained that they\u2019ll bring about more favorable trade deals and help American manufacturing. His administration says the tariffs are different from the Biden student-loan case because they're about foreign affairs, an area where it says the courts should not be second-guessing the president.",
      "For the people at Terry Precision Cycling, though, those big-picture political questions were far from their decision to join the lawsuit. Holm thought more about the company's 20 or so employees, its legacy and the women who buy its products out of a love for cycling.",
      "\u201cIf it becomes so unaffordable for them to do it, less can enter into that joy, that freedom of being on a bike,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was about surviving this uncertainty.\u201d",

      "Lightfoot was inspired to write his ode to the Fitzgerald and the 29 men who died on board after reading the first Associated Press story about the wreck and a Nov. 24, 1975, article in Newsweek magazine. The song was released in August 1976, less than a year later.",
      "Lightfoot's mournful storytelling propelled the tragedy into infamy. Affection for the song and interest in the wreck has sustained for half a century, though it wasn't even the deadliest recorded on the Great Lakes. The deadliest wreck on open waters was the Lady Elgin in 1860, which historians estimate killed nearly 400 people.",
      "\u201cThe song has made this by far the most famous Great Lakes shipwreck,\u201d said John U. Bacon, author of \u201cThe Gales of November,\u201d a recently published book coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the wreck. He said the Edmund Fitzgerald trails only the Titanic and possibly the Lusitania as the most famous shipwreck in the world.",
      "Rick Haynes, 80, played bass on the single and in Lightfoot\u2019s band for 55 years. He said the first recorded take of the song was what they released on the album \u201cSummertime Dream.\u201d",

      "RICHMOND, Va. -- Former President Barack Obama will headline rallies Saturday for Democrats running for governor in Virginia and New Jersey, corralling voters ahead of elections that may signal the national mood 10 months into Donald Trump\u2019s second presidency and a year ahead of midterm elections that could reshape it.",
      "Republicans in those states are stumping as well on the final weekend of campaigning before Tuesday's elections, but without the national star power.",
      "And on the west coast, California advocates are making a final push ahead of a statewide referendum over whether to redraw the state's congressional map in Democrats' favor. The effort backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom is part of a national redistricting battle that began when Trump urged GOP-run states to help him keep a friendly House majority in 2026.",
      "Obama, the Democrat whom Trump succeeded when he first assumed the presidency, will appear first Saturday with Virginia\u2019s Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger in Norfolk. Obama then travels to New Jersey for an evening rally with Democratic gubernatorial nominee Mikie Sherrill in Newark. Both events put the nation's first Black president in areas where Black voter turnout is key for Democratic victories.",
      "Virginia Republican nominee Winsome Earle-Sears, the current lieutenant governor, and New Jersey Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former state lawmaker, have busy itineraries, as well.",
      "The Virginia contest ensures the election of the first woman to lead the Commonwealth since its 1776 founding. If elected, Earle-Sears would be the first Black woman elected governor of any state.",
      "Democratic Virginia House Speaker Don Scott brushed off questions about whether Obama was needed to help turn out Black voters who are key to Democrats' coalition of voters, saying his popularity spans racial lines.",
      "\u201cBlack folks and white folks are inspired by his leadership. They\u2019re inspired by the way that he governed himself,\u201d said Scott, Virginia's first Black state House speaker.",
      "Obama\u2019s campaign swing affirms how popular the 64-year-old remains among his party\u2019s base more than eight years removed from the White House. Yet it underscores Democrats' lack of current top leaders and surrogates, with Republicans holding all levers of federal power and a cadre of Democratic governors and lawmakers vying for status as national figures.",
      "And, Scott's protests aside, the visit highlights pressure on Democrats to maximize their diverse coalition after Trump chipped away in 2024 at Democrats' usual advantages among Black and Hispanic voters. Trump lost Virginia and New Jersey but narrowed the margins in both states from his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Republicans believe New Jersey, especially, is ripe to continue that trend for Ciattarelli.",
      "Trump endorsed Ciattarelli and has said \u2014 without naming Earle-Sears \u2014 that he backs the GOP candidate for Virginia governor. The president conducted a phone rally for Ciattarelli. He has not campaigned in person for either nominee, despite traveling multiple times in recent months to his golfing resort in New Jersey.",

      "Republicans began the current Congress with just a 220-215 advantage in the House.

      "MARQUETTE, Mich. -- Spend enough time along the shores of Lake Superior and it won\u2019t be long before there\u2019s some reminder of what happened \u201cwhen the gales of November came early.\u201d",
      "This year marks the 50th anniversary of the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald, the largest and most famous of the estimated 6,500 ships that have gone down in the Great Lakes. But the Fitzgerald is remembered while the others are forgotten, thanks in large part to Gordon Lightfoot\u2019s 1976 haunting folk ballad that became a surprise hit.",
      "The Fitzgerald, a 730-foot long freighter named after a Milwaukee insurance company executive, went down in Lake Superior on Nov. 10, 1975. All 29 men on board died.",
      "The Fitz, as it's still affectionately called, was the largest ship on the Great Lakes when it launched in 1958 and kept that title until 1971.",

      "\u201cIt was an honor to be on the Fitzgerald,\u201d Gomez-Felder said, speaking in her home outside of Milwaukee adorned with images of her dad and paintings of the famous ship.",
      "Most of the crew members were born and lived in states that border the Great Lakes \u2014 Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Minnesota.",
      "The captain, 63-year-old Ernest M. McSorley, intended to retire after the 1975 season. He was known for his ability to navigate storms on the Great Lakes, but the one that hit on Nov. 10 was unlike any he had encountered.",
      "McSorley chose a northerly route across Lake Superior to be protected by highlands along the Canadian shore. Gale warnings were issued the night of Nov. 9. Those worsened to storm warnings in the early morning of Nov. 10.",
      "The crew of the nearby Arthur Anderson, which was trailing the Fitz, reported waves as high as 25 feet. The first mate radioed McSorley, who reported that the Fitz had been damaged by the storm.",
      "\u201cWe are holding our own,\" McSorley said. That was the last message received from anyone aboard.",

      "There are many theories as to what caused the Fitzgerald to sink so rapidly without a distress call, but the exact reason remains unknown.",
      "Even without an answer, the wreck spurred many \u201cincredible\u201d safety improvements, said Frederick Stonehouse, whose 1977 book \u201cThe Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald\u201d was the first of dozens written about the tragedy.",

      "The tolling bell helped spread the word of what had happened and was memorialized by Lightfoot when he sang \u201cthe church bell chimed til it rang twenty-nine times.\"",
      "In 2023, after Lightfoot died, they rang the bell a 30th time. The bell will also be rung 30 times this year on the anniversary, with the final toll representing all sailors lost on the Great Lakes.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon has rolled out a new policy that will severely undercut the ability for transgender troops who have been banned from the armed forces by the Trump administration to turn to boards of their peers to argue for their right to stay in the military, according to a memo obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "If military separation boards decide to allow transgender service members to remain in uniform, commanders can override that decision, according to an Oct. 8 memo to all the services from the Pentagon\u2019s undersecretary for personnel and readiness, Anthony Tata. That breaks with longstanding policy that boards act independently.",
      "It is the Pentagon\u2019s latest step to drive transgender troops out of the armed forces following an executive order from President Donald Trump. He and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have targeted diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in what they say is an effort to make the military more lethal.",
      "The adminstration's policies have faced pushback in the courts as trans troops and their supporters say they have proven their worth to the military, but the U.S. Supreme Court in May allowed the ban to be enforced while legal challenges proceed.",
      "The new memo, which advocates say was only made available to troops last week, also sets up an additional hurdle of requiring that trans service members appear before separation boards in uniforms that match the gender assigned to them at birth \u2014 and if they fail to do so, their absence can be used against them.",
      "The policy \u2014 and specifically the uniform mandate \u2014 will force a lot of people not to be able to attend their separation board hearings, according to Emily Starbuck Gerson, a spokeswoman for SPARTA Pride, an advocacy group for transgender troops and veterans.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re already essentially being rigged with a predetermined outcome and then now you\u2019re further penalizing someone for not showing up because they can\u2019t wear the wrong uniform,\u201d Gerson added.",
      "When asked about the memo, Pentagon assistant press secretary Riley Podleski said that \u201cas a matter of policy, the Department does not comment on ongoing litigation.\"",
      "The policy follows an Air Force directive reported by The Associated Press in August, which said separation boards could not independently decide whether to keep or discharge transgender troops and instead \u201cmust recommend separation of the member\u201d if they have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria \u2014 when a person\u2019s biological sex does not match up with their gender identity.",
      "Gerson said the new policy that applies to all the services \u201cfeels very similar to what the Air Force rolled out\u201d but noted that some of the additional hurdles like the uniform mandate were \u201calarming.\u201d",
      "The October memo says, \u201cshould the Service member not conform to uniform and grooming standards, board proceedings will continue with the Service member in absentia and may, as appropriate, take the Service member\u2019s failure to comply with standards intro consideration when determining whether the basis for separation has been established.\u201d",

      "Gerson, the advocate, says the new policy seems to run counter to the ideal of a merit-based military that Hegseth has touted.",
      "\"It does not account for the service member's career history, accomplishments, training and the necessity to their field,\u201d she said.",
      "Ireland also noted that the policy \"denies us the dignity and respect we were promised as we are forced out of a service that once honored our contributions.\u201d",
      "The boards traditionally offer troops who are facing separation from the military a chance at a quasi-legal hearing to determine if that service member still has value to the military and should stay on. Fellow service members hear evidence of whatever wrongdoing occurred and about the person\u2019s character, fitness and performance.",
      "While not a formal court hearing, it has much the same structure. Service members are often represented by lawyers, they can present evidence in their defense and they can appeal the board\u2019s findings to a federal court.",
      "The Pentagon\u2019s policy on separating officers notes that they are entitled to \u201cfair and impartial\u201d hearings that should be \u201ca forum for the officer concerned to present reasons the contemplated action should not be taken.\u201d",

Her mother's second husband was jealous and forbid anyone from speaking about the father she was named after, Marion Pierce Hobgood, while she was growing up, she said.

      "The report released by Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat from Georgia, is the second in a series of inquiries examining alleged human rights abuses in the immigration detention system. It builds on an August review that detailed mistreatment of children and pregnant women and draws from more than 500 reports of abuse and neglect collected between January and August.",
      "The latest findings document more than 80 credible cases of medical neglect and widespread complaints of inadequate food and water. Senate investigators say that points to systemic failures in federal detention oversight.",
      "The report cites accounts from detainees, attorneys, advocates, news reports and at least one Department of Homeland Security employee, describing delays in medical care that, in some cases, proved life-threatening. One detainee reportedly suffered a heart attack after complaining of chest pain for days without treatment. Others said inhalers and asthma medication were withheld, or that detainees waited weeks for prescriptions to be filled.",
      "A Homeland Security staff member assigned to one detention site told investigators that \u201cambulances have to come almost every day,\u201d according to the report.",
      "Ossoff said the findings reflect a deeper failure of oversight within federal immigration detention.",
      "\u201cAmericans overwhelmingly demand and deserve secure borders. Americans also overwhelmingly oppose the abuse and neglect of detainees,\u201d Ossoff told The Associated Press. \u201cEvery human being is entitled to dignity and humane treatment. That is why I have for years investigated and exposed abuses in prisons, jails, and detention centers, and that is why this work will continue.\u201d",
      "The medical reports also detailed how a diabetic detainee went without glucose monitoring or insulin for two days and became delirious before medical attention was given and that it took months for another detainee to receive medication to treat gastrointestinal issues.",
      "The Senate investigation also identified persistent complaints about food and water, including evidence drawn from court filings, depositions and interviews. Detainees described meals too small for adults, milk that was sometimes expired, and water that smelled foul or appeared to make children sick. At one Texas facility, a teenager said adults were forced to compete with children for bottles of clean water when staff left out only a few at a time.",
      "The Associated Press asked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment on the report's findings multiple times Wednesday and Thursday, but the agency did not provide a response. The Homeland Security Department previously criticized Ossoff's first report in August, saying the allegations of detainees being abused were false and accusing him of trying to \u201cscore political points.\u201d",
      "Attorneys for some of those detained at facilities across the country said they've seen some of the issues with medical care and food firsthand.",

      "Doctors there prescribed him a walker to help him move during his recovery, but Alvarez-Jones said the detention staff would not let him have it when he first returned and placed him in a segregation cell.",
      "\u201cHe still could not walk by himself,\" she said. \u201cHe still had paralysis on his left side.\u201d She added: \u201cHe was not able to get up and get his food, to shower by himself or to use the bathroom without assistance. So he had to lay in soiled bedsheets because he wasn't able to get up.\u201d",
      "Alvarez-Jones said the guards had insinuated to the man that they believed he was faking his illness.

Through the lawsuit, she said the government agency had to admit in the court record that it does not have a food vendor to provide three meals a day or any onsite medical staff at the facility that was initially only supposed to hold detainees for about 12 hours.",
      "But since January and the various immigration enforcement actions, it's much more likely that detainees are held for as much as a week in the Baltimore Hold Room.",
      "\u201cWhat we started hearing very quickly, maybe in February, was that the food they were being fed three times a day was incredibly inadequate,\" Dagen said. \u201cWe would hear sometimes it would be a protein bar or sometimes just bread and water. There is very little nutritional value and very little variety. I mean, sometimes it was a military ration component, but just the rice and beans, not a full meal.\u201d",
      "Dagen said the detainees also have to ask for bottles of water and they aren't always given. The ICE office has taken the stance that the sinks attached to the cell toilets are a continuous supply of water. But Dagen said the detainees complained the sink water has a bad taste.",
      "\u201cThis is 100% a problem of their own making,\u201d she said of the authorities. \u201cThese hold rooms were not used in this way prior to 2025. They are setting themselves these quotas, removing discretion to release people and trying to arrest numbers of people that are just impractical \u2026 fully knowing they don\u2019t have the ability to hold these people.\u201d",

      "The wealthiest Americans have a long history of calling on each other to give away more of their money. In 1889, the steel magnate and industrialist Andrew Carnegie argued in the essay \"The Gospel of Wealth\" that the richest should give away their fortunes within their lifetimes, in part to lessen the sting of growing inequality.",
      "In 2010,\u00a0Bill Gates,\u00a0Melinda French Gates\u00a0and\u00a0Warren Buffett\u00a0took up that call by creating the\u00a0Giving Pledge, a commitment for billionaires to give away more than half their wealth in their lifetimes or when they die.",
      "Fifteen years on, some 256 billionaires have taken the pledge, with 110 of them coming from the U.S., according to a recent\u00a0report by the Charity Reform Initiative\u00a0of the Institute for Policy Studies. Those U.S. billionaires represent 13% of the total 876 billionaires in the U.S., according to the report, revealing the small portion of the wealthiest people who have publicly committed to giving away their fortunes.",
      "The report found that of the 22 billionaires who have died since taking the pledge, only one gave away his fortune before he died. Meanwhile, only eight of the 22 deceased pledgers fulfilled the commitment by giving away half of their wealth or more at their death, though some of their estates are still being resolved.",
      "Chuck Collins, one of the authors of the report and an expert at the Institute for Policy Studies, said Eilish's comments are part of a growing realization that the rules of the economy favor those with assets over those who earn wages.",
      "He thinks the Giving Pledge has created an expectation and competition for the wealthiest to give away their money, but the fortunes of many of the pledgers have increased over time, meaning they will need to move even more aggressively if they are to fulfill the commitment.",
      "\"In the end, philanthropy is not a substitute for a fair and effective tax system,\" Collins said. \"The level of extreme inequality will require some form of restoring progressivity to the tax system, a wealth tax as well as progressive income tax.\"",

      "Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" one of the most influential rock songs ever recorded, was released 50 years ago.",
      "It broke records and soared to the top of the British charts. It was No. 1 twice in the U.K. and also made history with the first ever promotional rock video.",
      "But in the U.S., the song took 17 more years and being featured in the movie \"Wayne's World\" to turn into a mega hit. Today, it has almost 3 billion streams on Spotify, which is the most for any 20th century song.",
      "\"It changed the dynamics of music\"",
      "The hit song came to life in the Welsh countryside at Rockfield Studios, which was set up in the 1960s by two farmers and musicians, Charles and Kingsley Ward.",
      "Queen's band members \u2014 Freddie Mercury, John Deacon, Roger Taylor and Brian May \u2014 lived at Rockfield for two weeks in 1975, working on their fourth album, \"A Night at the Opera.\"",
      "\"I don't think anybody realized at the time that 'Bohemian Rhapsody' would end up the iconic record it was,\" said Kingsley Ward, who's now 85 years old.",
      "In the main studio, which is still in use, Queen laid down the song in three sections \u2014 choral, hard rock and opera. The sound was revolutionary, as was the length of the track at almost six minutes.",
      "\"It's probably the greatest record ever made, a rock record, because it changed the dynamics of music, and people now realize they can do anything with music,\" Ward said.",
      "Ward remembers Queen's leader, Mercury, as \"very quiet, unassuming and just a genuinely nice person, wasn't flamboyant at all.\"",
      "He said Mercury kept the band waiting for the song they then knew only as \"Freddy's thing.\"",
      "\"Brian and John were playing frisbee. I remember talking to Brian and saying, 'You've been here a long time, five days, you haven't done much.' And I think Brian said, 'Freddy's in there writing something.'\"",
      "Ward explained Mercury was inside what is now an office and in the corner of the office was an old piano. Out the window, Kingsley said Mercury would have been able to see the old farm wind vane.",
      "\"Now, the odd thing is, a lot of people ask me, 'did Freddy get the idea of that iconic line, 'any way the wind blows,' looking at the weathercock?' We don't know, because Freddy's not here to tell us, but it's a great story, isn't it?\"",

      "From \"In the South\"",
      "The day Junior fell down began like any other day: the explosion of heat rippling the air, the trumpeting sun\u00adlight, the traffic's tidal surges, the prayer chants in the distance, the cheap film music rising up from the floor below, the pelvic thrusts of an \"item number\" dancing across a neigh\u00adbor's TV; a child's cry, a mother's rebuke, unexplained laughter, scarlet expectorations, bicycles, the newly plaited hair of school\u00adgirls, the smell of strong coffee, a green wing flashing in a tree. Senior and Junior, two very old men, opened their eyes in their bedrooms on the fourth floor of a sea-green building on a leafy lane, just out of sight of Elliot's Beach, where, that evening, the young would congregate, as they always did, to perform the rites of youth, not far from the village of the fisherfolk, who had no time for such frivolity. The poor were puritans by night and day. As for the old, they had rites of their own and did not need to wait for evening. With the sun stabbing at them through their window blinds, the two old men struggled to their feet and lurched out onto their adjacent verandas, emerging at the same moment, like characters in an ancient tale, trapped in fateful coincidences, unable to escape the consequences of chance.",
      "Almost at once they began to speak. Their words were not new. These were ritual speeches, obeisances to the new day, of\u00adfered in call-and-response format, like the rhythmic dialogues or \"duels\" of the virtuosi of Carnatic music during the annual December festival.",
      "\"Be thankful we are men of the south,\" said Junior, stretch\u00ading and yawning. \"Southerners are we, in the south of our city in the south of our country in the south of our continent. God be praised. We are warm, slow, and sensual guys, not like the cold fishes of the north.\"",
      "Senior, scratching first his belly and then the back of his neck, contradicted him at once. \"In the first place,\" he said, \"the south is a fiction, existing only because men have agreed to call it that. Suppose men had imagined the earth the other way up! We would be the northerners then. The universe does not under\u00adstand up and down; neither does a dog. To a dog there is no north and south. And in the second place, you're not that warm a character, and a woman would laugh to hear you call yourself sensual\u2014but you are slow, that is beyond a doubt.\"",
      "This was how they were: they fought, going at each other like ancient wrestlers whose left feet were tied together at the ankles. The rope that bound them so tightly was their name. By a curious chance\u2014which they had come to think of as \"des\u00adtiny,\" or, as they more often called it, a \"curse\"\u2014they shared a name, a long name like so many names of the south, a name neither of them cared to speak. By banishing the name, by re\u00adducing it to its initial letter, V., they made the rope invisible, which did not mean it did not exist. They echoed each other in other ways\u2014their voices were high, they were of similarly wiry build and medium height, they were both nearsighted, and, after lifetimes of priding themselves on the quality of their teeth, they had both surrendered to the humiliating inevitabil\u00adity of dentures\u2014but it was the unused name, that symmetrical V., the Name That Could Not Be Spoken, that had joined them together for decades.",
      "The two old men did not share a birthday, however. One was seventeen days older than the other. That must have been how \"Senior\" and \"Junior\" got started, even though the nicknames had been in use for so long that nobody could now remember who originally thought them up. V. Senior and Junior they had become, Junior V. and Senior V. forevermore, quarreling to the death. They were eighty-one years old. If old age was thought of as an evening, ending in midnight oblivion, they were well into the eleventh hour.",
      "\"You look terrible,\" Junior told Senior, as he did every morn\u00ading. \"You look like a man who is only waiting to die.\"",
      "Senior\u2014nodding gravely, and also speaking in accordance with their private tradition\u2014responded, \"That is better than looking, as you do, like a man who is still waiting to live.\"",

    "story": [
      "Prince Andrew is being stripped of his titles and must surrender his lease to Royal Lodge, the mansion in Windsor where he lives, according to a statement from Buckingham Palace.",
      "\"Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor,\" the statement said. \"Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation.\"",
      "Andrew had recently said he would stop using his royal titles and honors, including the Duke of York, but Thursday's statement on behalf of King Charles III and Queen Camilla initiated the formal process of revoking all his titles, including prince.",
      "\"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,\" the statement said.",
      "Andrew has come under intense scrutiny over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and accusations from\u00a0Virginia Giuffre\u00a0that she was trafficked to engage in sex with the prince while she was underage. Andrew has denied the allegations. He reached a\u00a0settlement with Giuffre in 2022. Giuffre died by suicide earlier this year.",
      "\"Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse,\" the statement said.",
      "Giuffre's family said Thursday in a statement provided to CBS News' partner network BBC News, \"Today, an ordinary American girl from an ordinary American family, brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage.\"",
      "\"Today, she declares victory. We, her family, along with her survivor sisters, continue Virginia's battle and will not rest until the same accountability applies to all of the abusers and abettors connected to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell,\" said the statement sent on behalf of her brother, Sky Roberts, and sister-in-law, Amanda.",
      "In a memoir published posthumously, Giuffre detailed her alleged encounters with Andrew.",
      "\"He was friendly enough, but still entitled \u2014 as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she wrote. \"The next morning, [Ghislaine] Maxwell told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun.' Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy.'\" (Maxwell was convicted for her role in trafficking and is serving a 20-year sentence.)",
      "In 2022, Andrew gave up his military affiliations, royal patronages and official public duties. He also stopped using the title \"His Royal Highness.\"",
      "Andrew had faced heavy criticism from the British public over his living arrangements, with many voicing concern that he continued to live in his mansion on a royal estate despite the accusations leveled against him and his retreat from royal duties.",
      "His 75-year lease for Royal Lodge, signed in 2003, included an up-front payment of around 8 million pounds (around $10.5 million) and an annual rent described as a \"peppercorn,\" meaning an extremely small amount, according to\u00a0BBC News. Part of that payment was for renovations to the property, which at the time was in a state of disrepair, and Buckingham Palace felt that having Andrew pay the cost to upgrade the property was better than using public funds, BBC reported.",
      "The lease had previously been referred to as \"cast iron,\" and Buckingham Palace said it needed to negotiate with Andrew in order to remove him, but did not provide further information about the details of those negotiations.",
      "Buckingham Palace said Andrew will move out of the residence as soon as possible and will move to a property on the Sandringham estate, located about 100 miles north of London.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Actress June Lockhart (June 25, 1925-Oct 23, 2025) was best known for roles in two popular TV series: as Ruth Martin in \"Lassie,\" and as Maureen Robinson, matriarch of a family that was \"Lost in Space.\"",
      "The daughter of actors Gene and Kathleen Lockhart, June appeared on stage in New York beginning at age 6. After her parents moved to Hollywood, she made her unbilled film debut at age 13 alongside Gene and Kathleen, who played Bob Cratchit and his wife, in 1938's \"A Christmas Carol.\" June's first credit was in the Bette Davis drama \"All This, and Heaven Too.\" \u00a0She appeared in \"Sergeant York,\" \"The White Cliffs of Dover,\" \"Meet Me in St. Louis\" and \"She-Wolf of London,\" and won a Tony Award for the 1947 comedy \"For Love or Money.\" But her starring role in 1945's \"Son of Lassie\" (as the adult version of the character played by Elizabeth Taylor in the original) foreshadowed what would become her most familiar role.",
      "In 1958, Lockhart joined the TV series \"Lassie\" as Ruth Martin (taking over the role played by Cloris Leachman). For six years, in more than 200 episodes, Lockhart dispensed motherly wisdom to young Timmy (Jon Provost), who would engage in less-than-proper behavior or find himself in danger (but never, as the trope suggested, fallen down a well), only to be rescued by his faithful collie.",
      "And she knew who the star of the show was. \"Often, if the scene had gone well, and maybe we hadn't gotten the dialogue quite right, if the dog was right, they'd print it,\" she told The New York Times in 2004.",
      "The show, which aired on CBS, featured scripts that were in some cases written by blacklisted writers. \"When people come up to me and say, 'Well, sure wish we had wonderful American shows like that the way we used to in the 50's,' I say, 'Let me tell you who wrote those scripts Yes, they were good Americans, and they were in jail,'\" she said.",
      "Beginning in 1965, Lockhart starred in the frequently campy science fiction series \"Lost in Space.\" For three seasons, the Robinson Family \u2013 crewmembers aboard the doomed Jupiter II spacecraft \u2013 were marooned, or attacked by monsters and evil aliens (and in one notorious incident, a talking carrot), all while dealing with typical family drama. \"It was really endearing. 'Lost in Space' was like going out in the backyard in the sand and playing space. We did have fun,\" she said at a 2010 public appearance. She was also a NASA spokesperson, and attended space shuttle launches.",
      "In 1968, she joined the cast of \"Petticoat Junction\" for the sitcom's last two seasons. She also appeared on \"General Hospital,\" \"Marcus Welby, M.D.,\" \"Ellery Queen,\" \"Quincy, M.E.,\" \"Vega$,\" \"Magnum, P.I.,\" \"Knots Landing,\" \"Murder, She Wrote,\" \"Full House,\" \"Roseanne,\" \"Beverly Hills, 90210,\" \"Grey's Anatomy,\" and \"Cold Case.\" She provided the voice of Alpha Control in the 2021 Netflix reboot of \"Lost in Space.\" She also starred in touring productions of \"Steel Magnolias,\" \"Bedroom Farce\" and \"Once More with Feeling.\"",
      "In the 1950s, while appearing as a panelist on the Fred Friendly-produced game show \"Who Said That?,\" Lockhart met White House press correspondents. A self-described \"news junkie,\" she later traveled with them while they covered the 1956 presidential campaigns. When she filled in for the host of a TV talk show, she used her connections to interview President Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty. As thanks, Hagerty gave Lockhart a lifetime press pass. She used it for decades to attend White House briefings whenever she was in Washington."

She made her professional debut at age 8, playing Mimsey in a Metropolitan Opera production of Peter Ibbetson. She later made her screen debut in MGM's version of \"A Christmas Carol\", playing the daughter of her real-life parents in the movie.",
      "Lockhart then went on to play the ing\u00e9nue in the Broadway comedy \"For Love or Money\" with John Loder, winning the Tony in the category of Best Newcomer in 1947. She was the first recipient of the award, which is now no longer a category. Her award was later donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 2008.",
      "The actor became a household name to American audiences when she starred as Ruth Martin, the mother in \"Lassie,\" the hit TV show featuring a beloved long-haired collie that aired from 1954 to 1973.",
      "Lockhart would again capture TV audiences in her role as Maureen Robinson, the matriarch in \"Lost in Space,\" a show about a family struggling to survive in a space colony. It ran from 1965 through 1968.",

    "summary": "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" said one mother of two about a looming freeze in food aid.",
    "story": [
      "Roughly 42 million Americans rely on food stamps that arrive every month on their electronic benefit transfer cards. On Nov. 1, that aid is set to abruptly stop amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, potentially leaving households scrambling to figure out how to put food on the table.",
      "People enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, told CBS News they're bracing for some tough financial choices. Kasey McBlais, a 42-year-old single mother living in Buckfield, Maine, said she's planning to delay paying her electric and credit card bills to make sure her two children have enough to eat.",
      "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" McBlais, who works for a Maine social services agency and who draws about $600 a month in SNAP benefits, said. \"My children won't go hungry.\"",
      "The suspension of food aid comes as Democratic and Republican lawmakers continue to trade blame over the\u00a0government shutdown, which now stands as the second-longest funding lapse in U.S. history. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds the SNAP program, warned earlier this month that there would be insufficient funding to pay full November benefits if the shutdown continued, prompting local governments to post notices on their websites about the potential interruption in payments.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the USDA said in a memo\u00a0posted Sunday on its website. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.\"",
      "A stoppage in SNAP payments on Saturday isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday, Oct. 31, that the Trump administration is required by law to\u00a0use contingency funds\u00a0to pay at least partial SNAP benefits.",
      "The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have asked the USDA to use contingency funds to cover most of next month's SNAP benefits, but an agency memo surfaced on Friday that says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "That means beginning Nov. 1, the government will halt about $8 billion in monthly SNAP payments, cutting off food assistance for the one in eight Americans who are enrolled in the program. Recipients, who include households in every state, typically get about $187 a month on a prepaid card to help cover the cost of groceries.",
      "Unused benefits on SNAP recipients' cards will roll over into November.",
      "\"That's money that's already been appropriated. It's been put on their card,\" Mackenzie Libbey, a staff attorney with Community Legal Services, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"So we definitely do not want people rushing out to try to use up their benefits at the end of October thinking they're not going to be able to buy anything in November.\"",
      "The USDA said it is incumbent on Democrats in Congress to end the government shutdown.",
      "\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely\" SNAP benefits and other federal food aid, the agency said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Some U.S. states, including Louisiana, Vermont and Virginia, have vowed to continue disbursing SNAP benefits even if the federal government suspends payments. New York on Monday\u00a0pledged $30 million in emergency food assistance, while also recently committing to provide millions more in support for food banks. The USDA memo stipulates that states won't be reimbursed for temporarily providing food aid to residents, raising questions about the viability of that approach.",
      "Other states are taking legal action.",
      "A coalition of 25 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday\u00a0sued the Trump administration, alleging that the suspension of food stamps is unlawful and threatens the health and well-being of millions. The states are asking a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the USDA to provide SNAP benefits in November by tapping into a contingency fund, which is estimated to hold around $5 billion.",
      "\"Where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sharlene Sutton, a 45-year-old single mother of four in Dorchester, Massachusetts, who left her job as a security officer last month to care for one of her children, who has epilepsy, said she relies on the $549 she gets in monthly SNAP benefits to feed her family.",
      "\"I was freaking out because I'm like, 'Oh my god, now I don't have a job,'\" she told CBS News. \"I'm not worried about myself that much. It's about the kids. Like, where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sutton said she's looking for a food bank to help fill the gap if her food aid is cut off. But experts warn that the non-profit organizations alone aren't capable of filling the $8 billion monthly hole left by a looming SNAP suspension.",
      "\"The charitable food system and food banks don't have the resources to replace all those food dollars,\" John Sayles, CEO of Vermont Foodbank in Barre, Vermont, told CBS News.",
      "Already, food banks are getting an influx of calls from SNAP recipients who are worried about the payment freeze, and food shelves could see long lines next month if the shutdown persists, Sayles said.",
      "\"There is no safety net after SNAP other than the food shelf,\" he added.",
      "Albuquerque, New Mexico's Roadrunner Food Bank, which typically serves 83,000 households per week, is \"seeing panic\" among residents due to the SNAP halt, said Katy Anderson, vice president of strategy, partnerships and advocacy at the nonprofit organization.",
      "George Matysik, executive director of the Share Food Program in Philadelphia, has also noticed an uptick in demand. He told CBS News in a text message that some of the pantries the hunger relief nonprofit works with have reported 12-fold increases in new registrations week to week.",
      "Even before this new surge in demand, food banks were already facing pressures because of the growing number of people seeking their services, aggravated this year by\u00a0persistent inflation\u00a0and funding constraints. In March, the\u00a0USDA said it was nixing $420 million in funding\u00a0for a program that allows food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "Broader economic impact",
      "A temporary halt in $8 billion in monthly food aid could also impact local businesses, from grocers to farm stands, said Sayles of Vermont Foodbank. Each $1 in SNAP benefits provides an economic benefit of $1.60, he said, referring to the so-called\u00a0multiplier effect\u00a0in which dollars flowing through the local economy help support spending, jobs and growth.",
      "\"SNAP is the foundation of economic support for a lot of food retailers, like those smaller places in rural areas and the corner store in our cities,\" said Kate Bauer, an associate professor of nutritional services at the University of Michigan. \"So this has far-reaching impacts beyond just the people who get SNAP.\"",
      "SNAP is designed to provide supplemental aid for a family's grocery budget, but some families depend on it as their main source of income to buy food, Bauer noted. For those living paycheck to paycheck, even a short disruption in benefits can have immediate consequences, experts said.",
      "The loss of SNAP funding threatens some of the most vulnerable people in the U.S., with the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities noting that two-thirds of food-stamp recipients are children, seniors or people with disabilities.",
      "For McBlais, the single mom, the issue isn't political. Rather, it's about making sure families can eat in an economy where many are already struggling to afford rent, utilities and basic groceries, she told CBS News.",
      "\"Everybody needs food \u2014 SNAP recipients are Democratic, Republicans and everything in between,\" McBlais said.",

    "story": [
      "The prolonged U.S.\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0is putting millions of Americans at risk of missing their November food stamp benefits, a vital lifeline for low-income households.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, stated in a memo on Sunday that no benefits will be issued on Nov. 1, leaving the program's roughly 42 million beneficiaries uncertain about how they'll pay for groceries next month.",
      "SNAP recipients receive an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card, and many families rely on those benefits as their main source of money for food. Many of those registered with the program are asking if they will still be able to use the remaining dollars on their cards once funding is suspended and if they'll receive their November benefits retroactively, should lawmakers reach a deal to reopen the government.",
      "A stoppage in SNAP payments on Nov. 1 isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday, Oct. 31, that the Trump administration is required by law to\u00a0use contingency funds\u00a0to pay at least partial SNAP benefits.",
      "The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "With just days to go before a potential suspension in SNAP funding, here's what to know.",
      "Will current SNAP benefits roll over to November?",
      "While SNAP benefits will not be disbursed as scheduled in November, program recipients can use existing funds on their EBT cards to make purchases. If someone enrolled in the program hasn't spent all their October EBT dollars, for example, those benefits would roll over into November.",
      "Some states are advising recipients to use their remaining food stamps wisely, given the stalemate over funding the federal government.",
      "\"If you have remaining balances from previous months, we encourage you to plan your shopping carefully and purchase essential food items when needed,\" Hawaii's Department of Human Services said on its website.",
      "Will SNAP recipients get paid retroactively for missed payments?",
      "The USDA hasn't indicated whether SNAP benefits would be paid retroactively once the government shutdown ends.",
      "But social service experts who spoke with CBS News said they expect the USDA to pay the delayed November benefits once federal funding resumes.",
      "\"It is our understanding that SNAP benefits will be issued retroactively when the shutdown ends,\" said Lizbeth Ginsburg, a managing attorney in the welfare law unit at Greater Boston Legal Services.",
      "Federal rules\u00a0governing the food-stamp program stipulate that SNAP recipients are entitled to their benefits, and that they should receive them if there's a disruption, said Gina Plata-Nino, interim SNAP director at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on ending hunger.",
      "\"That's why many state agencies have done a very good job of saying, 'Your benefits will be delayed,' versus, 'You are not getting benefits,'\" she told CBS News.",
      "Can states step in to fund SNAP?",
      "While SNAP is federally funded and overseen by the USDA, each state is responsible for administering the program to its residents.",
      "Some states are taking action, with Democratic lawmakers\u00a0urging\u00a0Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to tap into an estimated $5 billion in contingency funds to cover SNAP benefits next month. On Tuesday, a coalition of officials from 25 states and the District of Columbia\u00a0sued the Trump administration\u00a0over the suspension of benefits, arguing that it is unlawful. The\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0notes that this would mark the first delay in SNAP benefits in the program's history.",
      "In recent days, several states have pledged to step in to ensure SNAP recipients can afford food in November. Their approaches vary, with some states promising to dispatch troops to support food banks, while others are allocating funds for general hunger relief.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry\u00a0signed an emergency declaration on Oct. 24 intended to fund SNAP benefits for people who rely on the program, while Vermont lawmakers on Oct. 29 approved a plan to cover its residents' food stamp benefits through Nov. 15.",
      "Other states say they plan to ramp up support for local food banks by providing on-site personnel and additional funding. California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0said\u00a0last week he would deploy National Guard troops to assist food bank operations and fast-track $80 million to keep the state's food banks stocked.",
      "In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul said she is providing $30 million in state funding to support 16 million meals. Roughly 3 million people in New York are on food stamps.",
      "Other states that have announced actions to help SNAP recipients include\u00a0Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia\u00a0and\u00a0Washington.",
      "Officials in these states are stepping in despite the USDA saying states lack the authority to cover benefits and won't be reimbursed.",
      "\"There is no provision or allowance under current law for states to cover the cost of benefits and be reimbursed,\" the agency said in its memo.",
      "Plata-Nino said that puts states in a difficult position, given their already limited reserves. It also diverts attention and funding from other priorities, she added.",

    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans are sliding toward a financial cliff as the\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0stretches into a second month, with four federal assistance programs for low-income families set to run out of funding on Nov. 1.",
      "Some families could lose access to multiple sources of government support. Ashley Trent, a 37-year-old single mother of six, expressed concern she could soon be without aid provided under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), better known as food stamps, and the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program, which provides food aid for mothers of young children.",
      "\"I'm wondering how I'm going to be able to afford everything,\" Trent, a Bloomington, Ill., resident who works full-time as a housing navigator, told CBS News. \"It's very stressful \u2014 what bills will I have to put off? I have a car note, I have insurance, I have clothes I have to get my kids because it's getting colder.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds SNAP and WIC, has said it will halt payments for the anti-hunger programs on Nov. 1 due to the government shutdown. Head Start programs serving 65,000 low-income children will also lose federal funding on Saturday, potentially disrupting preschool for thousands of families,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Head Start Association.",
      "The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps struggling households heat their homes, could be next to run short of funding.",
      "Halting funding for these programs \u2014 which help cover food, education, and energy costs \u2014 could have lasting consequences for poor families already strained by high grocery and utility prices, said Ailen Arreaza, executive director of the advocacy group ParentsTogether Action.",
      "Although funding will resume once Congress passes legislation to reopen the government, she warned that the damage to households could persist.",
      "\"What we are hearing from parents is desperation \u2014 parents going without meals, making impossible decisions about not paying bills or going without medication,\" Arreaza told CBS News. \"This has so many implications, because these kids need these programs to get ahead.\"",
      "Experts note that hunger can hinder children's ability to learn, while parents who fall behind on bills may face utility shutoffs or other lasting setbacks.",
      "Food stamps",
      "The USDA is set to\u00a0halt SNAP payments on Nov. 1, leaving about 42 million Americans uncertain how they'll afford groceries next month. Recipients receive an average of about $187 a month on prepaid cards that can be used to buy food at grocery stores, farmers' markets and other retailers.",
      "A prolonged cessation in food-stamp funding isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday that the Trump administration is required by law to use contingency funds to pay at least partial SNAP benefits. The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "Meanwhile, more than a dozen states are trying to fill the gap by using state funds to support food aid or local food banks. But food bank leaders say charities can't make up for a cutoff in food stamps.",
      "\"It's going to hurt us really bad,\" said Taylour Grant, 29, a Tampa medical assistant who relies on $970 a month in SNAP benefits to feed her four children, plus WIC support for her youngest, who is 1-year-old. \"It's really scary because I know I'll go without to make sure my kids are fed.\"",
      "Grant said many people misunderstand who relies on SNAP. \"We're not on it because we want to be \u2014 no one makes enough to live off these days. That help is really needed,\" she said.",
      "WIC",
      "Nearly 7 million low-income pregnant women, new mothers and children under 5 who receive WIC could lose federal aid in November because of the government shutdown.",
      "Unlike food stamps, WIC provides funds specifically to purchase formula and nutritious foods for pregnant women and young children, though many families rely on both programs, said Georgia Machell, CEO of the National WIC Association.",
      "\"None of these programs operate in a vacuum,\" she said. \"Often, if a family is participating in WIC, they're also participating in SNAP.\"",
      "WIC continued paying benefits in October after the Trump administration tapped\u00a0$300 million\u00a0in leftover tariff revenue from the previous fiscal year. But with the stalemate in Congress continuing into November, that funding could run out.",
      "The USDA didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about whether it could tap additional tariff revenue to fund the program. At this point, the program is set to delay payments on Nov. 1, according to the National WIC Association.",
      "WIC has been able to maintain funding during previous shutdowns in its 50-year history, according to the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on stopping hunger. \"The disruptions we're concerned about would be fairly historic,\" Machell said.",
      "Some states have pledged to use their own funds to keep WIC running, but many lack the budget, according to FRAC.",
      "Head Start",
      "About 140 Head Start programs in 41 states and Puerto Rico will lose federal funding with the shutdown set to extend past Nov. 1, affecting roughly 65,000 children, according to the National Head Start Association. Nationwide, about 750,000 children are enrolled in Head Start.",
      "Some programs may not be able to stay open, regional program directors warn.",
      "\"Everybody is trying to do everything they can to keep children in classrooms and families at work,\" Michelle Haimowitz, executive director of the Massachusetts Head Start Association,\u00a0told CBS News Boston. \"But it is incredibly difficult to operate without those federal funds.\"",
      "Minnesota mother Jaycee Chrudimsky said she fears that the closure of her local Head Start program could force her to miss work and affect her 4-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It would impact her, and that's the thing I worry about the most, because she looks forward to coming to school every single day and seeing her friends and being a part of the program,\" Chrudimsky\u00a0told\u00a0CBS News Minnesota this week.",
      "LIHEAP",
      "Another program threatened by the shutdown is the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). The program helps about 6 million low-income households pay their energy bills.",
      "\"We are now at a point where the government shutdown is going to cause serious delays in the release of LIHEAP funds,\" Wolfe told CBS News.",
      "The delay could leave millions of families behind on utility bills and facing power shutoffs just as\u00a0energy prices are skyrocketing, he added.",
      "NEADA projects the\u00a0average cost for people to heat a home this winter\u00a0will rise nearly 8%.",
      "\"It's a perfect storm of misery for low- and middle-income households,\" Wolfe said.",

    "summary": "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol doesn't expect AI to replace baristas as the coffee chain focuses on improving the \"human-to-human experience\" for customers.",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol took the helm in September 2024, inheriting a company facing its first revenue decline in four years amid customer complaints about high prices and long wait times. A year later, the coffee giant has halted the slide but faces fresh pressures, from surging coffee bean costs to store closures.",
      "Coffee prices\u00a0jumped 30% from January through September, squeezing Starbucks' profit margins even as Niccol vowed not to raise menu costs this year. The restaurant chain said last month it would spend $1 billion to close underperforming stores and cut 900 jobs.",
      "As Niccol told CBS News' Jo Ling Kent, the retail chain can't rule out price hikes in 2026 due to rising coffee prices, although he described this step as a \"last resort.\" At the same time, Niccol noted that Starbucks has no plans to introduce a value menu like McDonald's and other fast-food chains appealing to budget-conscious patrons.",
      "\"We have a huge point of difference and that is, I think, that customer connection and the experience you get in our stores,\" Niccol told CBS News. \"I just believe, at the end of the day, the experience sets us apart from everybody else.\"",
      "He added, \"Pricing would be one of those things that we do as a last resort, and we do it very surgically. To say never, you know, I don't think you can do that in this environment.\"",
      "\"Human-to-human\"",
      "Starbucks' reboot involves what the company calls its \"Green Apron service model,\" which aims to hire more baristas, improve customer service and cut down on customer wait times.",
      "\"What we're doing right now is making sure that we're staffed correctly,\" Niccol said. \"The teams are trained correctly for the demand that we know we have in the morning, and we know that we're growing in the afternoon.\"",
      "While other companies are turning to artificial intelligence to replace some workers, Niccol said he doesn't envision AI supplanting baristas. He said the technology could be useful for behind-the-scenes tasks, such as managing the company's supply chain.",
      "\"I don't see [AI] replacing our baristas \u2014 that human-to-human experience is just too important,\" Niccol said. \"And I think it really separates our experience from everybody else.\"",
      "While Starbucks is bolstering its barista ranks, it also faces the threat of strikes from Starbucks Workers United, which represents 9,500 workers in some 550 Starbucks cafes across the country. Overall, the company has roughly 201,000 employees working in 10,000 stores across North America.",
      "Niccol said he's open to talking with union members, but also described his company's pay and benefits as generous, adding that their demands \"to date have been unreasonable.\"",
      "\"We already give them the best job in retail. We have the lowest turnover in the industry \u2014 it's below 50%,\" Niccol told CBS News. \"We also have the best benefits in the industry, and we actually have the best wages in the industry.\"",
      "Although other companies have noted a pullback from low- or middle-income consumers as inflation continues to tick upwards, Niccols said Starbucks patrons are still opening their wallets.",
      "\"Transactions are up, our sales are up,\" Niccol said. \"What we hear from them is they love the experience and they think it's a great value proposition, so I think they're being much more judicious in where they want to spend their money.\"",
      "He added, \"And I think it's really important that you give them a great experience so that it justifies why they chose to spend money with you.\"",

    "story": [
      "Powder supplements sold at Sam's Club stores are linked to at least 11 cases of Salmonella in seven states, federal health authorities said Friday.",
      "Member's Mark Super Greens Powder Supplements, which were sold at the discount chain's stores nationwide and online, have been pulled from store shelves because they contain moringa leaf powder that may be contaminated with Salmonella bacteria, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an alert posted on its website.",
      "\"If you have any of the products listed below in your home, throw them out or return them to the store,\" the agency said, while noting that the product has not been recalled.",
      "Three of the people who contracted Salmonella were hospitalized, according to the agency. Illnesses, which were reported between May and September, were confirmed in Florida, Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina, New York, South Carolina and Virginia.",
      "The source of the Salmonella was traced to a single lot of organic moringa leaf powder imported from Vallon Farm Direct in Jodhpur, India, according to an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration. State health officials in Virginia and Michigan collected and tested samples of the product from the homes of people who fell ill.",
      "The CDC said it may add other Vallon Farm products with moringa leaf powder to avoid as the agency's investigation continues.",
      "Moringa is a plant native to India and other countries prized for essential nutrients including protein, amino acids, vitamins and minerals, according to research published by the National Institutes of Health. Its leaves can be dried and powdered.",
      "People infected with the Salmonella bacteria can experience symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping and fever. Rarely, Salmonella can result in more serious ailments, including arterial infections, endocarditis, arthritis, muscle pain, eye irritation and urinary tract symptoms.",
      "Infections can be severe in young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems, who may require hospitalization.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Oct 2025 16:37:06 -0400",
    "summary": "Unionized baristas will begin voting Friday on whether to authorize a strike amid stalled contract negotiations, Starbucks Workers United said.",
    "story": [
      "Thousands of Starbucks workers are gearing up to vote on whether to go on strike next week.",
      "The strike authorization vote is set to begin Friday and will remain open for several days, with Starbucks Workers United expected to share results after voting ends. Employees represented by the union have staged two national strikes over the last year, most recently in May to protest Starbucks' new dress code. Thousands of workers\u00a0also walked off the job\u00a0in December 2024.",
      "As the voting gets underway, the union is also planning a series of rallies and pickets over the weekend outside Starbucks stores in dozens of U.S. cities.",
      "Starbucks Workers United originated in Buffalo, New York, in 2021 and now represents 9,500\u00a0workers in approximately 550 Starbucks cafes across the country.",
      "A union spokesperson confirmed that contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United began in May 2024 but fell apart in December. The group entered mediation in February, which ended two months later with Workers United rejecting Starbucks' contract proposal. The union says it has secured 33 tentative agreements from Starbucks, but maintains that the vast majority are noneconomic proposals.",
      "The union spokesperson said the coffee giant has since refused to come to the table with a new proposal that meets workers' demands, which is why negotiations have stalled.",
      "For its part, Starbucks says it has engaged in nearly 200 hours of negotiations but claims that Workers United ultimately presented union members with an incomplete outline of single-store contracts to vote on.",
      "\"Workers United only represents around 4% of our partners but chose to walk away from the bargaining table,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CBS News in an email statement. \"If they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk.\"",
      "What workers want",
      "The workers' demands are threefold, according to the union \u2014 increased hours and\u00a0higher take-home pay, as well as a resolution from Starbucks for what the union refers to as \"unfair labor practice charges\" for union busting.",
      "\"Too many baristas still aren't getting enough hours to pay the bills or meet the threshold for benefits,\" the union says in its statement of demands on its website.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has filed hundreds of unfair labor practice charges against Starbucks with the National Labor Relations Board, including over its dress code.",
      "The union has not specified the size of the pay increase it is seeking. Starbucks said employees receive $30 an hour in pay and benefits. Store managers, or \"coffeehouse leaders\" as they're referred to by the retailer, are salaried. The company contends that nearly 85% of its employees work their preferred hours.",
      "Limited impact",
      "Susan Schurman, a distinguished professor at Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, said previous Workers United strikes have had a limited effect on persuading the company to return to the bargaining table.",
      "\"The basic problem is that not enough Starbucks stores are organized yet so that a strike inflicts serious financial or publicity damage to the company,\" Schurman said in an email.",
      "Last month, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol announced that the company was shuttering certain locations and cutting about 900 jobs. The closures affected 59 union stores, according to Starbucks Workers United.",
      "In a letter to employees at the time, Niccol framed the decision to close stores as part of a \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, an effort he initiated in 2024 to revitalize sales and foot traffic at the chain's coffee shops. The plan includes adding more personal touches to the customer store experience, like handwritten notes on Starbuck's cups.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has\u00a0openly questioned whether Niccol's strategy is working, whereas Starbucks has painted the plan as a success.",
      "\"The facts show that 'Back to Starbucks' is making the experience better for both customers and partners,\" Anderson said. \"We've invested more than $500M to improve our coffeehouse staffing, training, and support on top of offering the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging over $30 per hour for hourly partners.\"",

      "\"There was a voice message that was coming on with this that said, 'Don't turn your computer on, don't turn your computer off,'\" she told CBS News.",
      "Reynolds was also instructed to call a phone number she was led to believe would provide her with tech support. Instead, she was connected to a\u00a0scam artist\u00a0who claimed that hackers had obtained access to her bank account. The only way to protect her money was to convert the funds into bitcoin, the person told Reynolds.",
      "She withdrew her entire bank account balance, which totaled $13,100, and followed the scammer's directions to go to a bitcoin ATM at a nearby gas station. The ATM was operated by Athena Bitcoin, which has more than 4,000 such terminals across the U.S.",
      "Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian Schwalb said such incidents highlight the surge in cryptocurrency scams linked to bitcoin ATM providers, resulting in the theft of millions of dollars.",
      "\"Bitcoin ATMs are a tool that scammers, that criminals, are using to separate people, including D.C. residents, from their hard-earned money,\" Schwalb told CBS News. \"Athena, as a bitcoin operator, knows that its kiosks are being used by this element, and yet [has] failed to put proper anti-fraud prevention systems in place to keep it from happening.\"",
      "He added, \"What makes it worse is they are profiting from this because they're charging very substantial fees.\"",
      "Schwalb in September filed a lawsuit against Athena, alleging that it charges \"undisclosed fees on deposits that it knows are often the result of scams, and for failing to implement adequate anti-fraud measures.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Athena Bitcoin said it \"strongly disagrees with the allegations\" and that it will contest the charges in court.",
      "\"We employ aggressive safety protocols to protect the financial interests of our customers. ...Our kiosks employ multiple safeguards, from prominent warnings and daily transaction limits to five separate verification screens designed to stop coerced transactions,\" the company said.",
      "Reynolds is also suing Athena Bitcoin. Her attorney, Vaught Stewart, accused the company of \"not just allowing the fraud to happen \u2014 they're profiting from it.\"",
      "In Washington, D.C., Athena Bitcoin charged fees of up to 26% per transaction, while 93% of all deposits made through the company's ATMs are linked to scams, Schwalb alleged in his suit.",
      "For her part, Reynolds wants to help others avoid losing their savings. \"Now I'm an advocate for just telling people this is real,\" she said. \"Be aware.\"",
      "Financial scams connected to bitcoin ATMs are on the rise, according to the Federal Trade Commission.",

      "Billie Eilish wants billionaires to donate more.",
      "As the Grammy and Oscar winner accepted the music award at this year's WSJ. Magazine Innovator Awards on Wednesday night, she urged the ultra-wealthy to address more of the world's issues.",
      "\"We're in a time right now where the world is really, really bad and really dark and people need empathy and help more than, kind of, ever, especially in our country,\" Eilish said to an audience that included Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, as well as \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas. \"I'd say if you have money, it would be great to use it for good things, maybe give it to some people that need it.\"",
      "Late-night host Stephen Colbert\u00a0introduced Eilish onstage at New York's Museum of Modern Art by announcing that she would donate $11.5 million of the proceeds from her Hit Me Hard and Soft tour to causes dedicated to food equity, climate justice and reducing carbon pollution.",
      "In accepting the award, the \"Bad Guy\" singer added a polite but direct call to others in the room, saying a lot of people, especially in the U.S., could use some help right now.",
      "\"Love you all, but there's a few people in here who have a lot more money than me,\" she said, to a smattering of applause. \"And if you're a billionaire, why are you a billionaire? And no hate, but give your money away, shorties.\"",
      "Through her Changemaker Program, Eilish has worked with the nonprofit Reverb for years on its Music Decarbonization Project and its Music Climate Revolution initiative, alongside artists ranging from Dead & Company to Harry Styles.",
      "Chan was also honored at the event, receiving the \"Philanthropy of Science Innovator of the Year\" award. A spokesperson for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Brandi Hoffine Barr, said Zuckerberg and Chan have committed to giving away 99% of their Meta shares to philanthropy over the course of their lifetimes and have already granted out $7 billion. According to Forbes, Zuckerberg's current net worth is around $224 billion.",
      "Eilish's comments come as the number of billionaires worldwide continues to grow, with 204 new billionaires added in 2024, according to a January report from\u00a0Oxfam International titled \"Takers Not Makers.\"",
      "The report found that the billionaires grew wealthier three times faster in 2024 than in 2023, pointing to an increased concentration of resources globally.",
      "Oxfam predicted that at least five people will become trillionaires in the next decade, up from one person the year before. The group called for higher taxes on the rich and other measures to break up monopolies, cap CEO pay and require companies to pay living wages.",
      "The wealthiest Americans have a long history of calling on each other to give away more of their money. In 1889, the steel magnate and industrialist Andrew Carnegie argued in the essay \"The Gospel of Wealth\" that the richest should give away their fortunes within their lifetimes, in part to lessen the sting of growing inequality.",
      "In 2010,\u00a0Bill Gates,\u00a0Melinda French Gates\u00a0and\u00a0Warren Buffett\u00a0took up that call by creating the\u00a0Giving Pledge, a commitment for billionaires to give away more than half their wealth in their lifetimes or when they die.",
      "Fifteen years on, some 256 billionaires have taken the pledge, with 110 of them coming from the U.S., according to a recent\u00a0report by the Charity Reform Initiative\u00a0of the Institute for Policy Studies. Those U.S. billionaires represent 13% of the total 876 billionaires in the U.S., according to the report, revealing the small portion of the wealthiest people who have publicly committed to giving away their fortunes.",
      "The report found that of the 22 billionaires who have died since taking the pledge, only one gave away his fortune before he died. Meanwhile, only eight of the 22 deceased pledgers fulfilled the commitment by giving away half of their wealth or more at their death, though some of their estates are still being resolved.",
      "Chuck Collins, one of the authors of the report and an expert at the Institute for Policy Studies, said Eilish's comments are part of a growing realization that the rules of the economy favor those with assets over those who earn wages.",
      "He thinks the Giving Pledge has created an expectation and competition for the wealthiest to give away their money, but the fortunes of many of the pledgers have increased over time, meaning they will need to move even more aggressively if they are to fulfill the commitment.",
      "\"In the end, philanthropy is not a substitute for a fair and effective tax system,\" Collins said. \"The level of extreme inequality will require some form of restoring progressivity to the tax system, a wealth tax as well as progressive income tax.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Oct 2025 12:24:21 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",

      "New Jersey-based drugmaker Teva Pharmaceuticals USA and drug distributor Amerisource Health Services issued voluntary nationwide\u00a0recalls\u00a0earlier this month of over half a million bottles of various strengths of prazosine capsules, according to the FDA.",
      "The capsule drug, known as prazosin hydrochloride, comes in 1 mg, 2 mg and 5 mg doses. It helps relax blood vessels to facilitate blood flow and is sometimes prescribed for nightmares and other sleep disturbances caused by post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "Teva Pharmaceuticals did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In its recall\u00a0orders\u00a0posted on its website, the FDA said it has classified the affected lots of the recalled drug as a Class II risk because some of the medication may have nitrosamine impurities that are considered potentially carcinogenic.

    "published": "Fri, 31 Oct 2025 08:52:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Visa predicts Americans will spend an average of $736 on holiday gifts in 2025, a 10% increase from the $669 reported last year.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are expected to open their wallets this holiday season, increasing their gift budgets even as a slowing job market and stubborn inflation weigh on consumer confidence, according to a new analysis from Visa Business and Economic Insights.",
      "U.S. consumers are forecast to spend an average of $736 each on holiday gifts, a 10% increase from the $669 reported last year, Visa said in its 2025 holiday spending outlook.",
      "Inflation partly explains this year's projected sales growth, with the Consumer Price Index showing that prices rose 3% on an annual basis in September. But Americans are also planning on upping their gifting, especially older consumers, with baby boomers forecasted to boost their holiday spending by 21%, the study found.",
      "The robust spending outlook highlights consumers' resilience, even as confidence surveys paint a more cautious picture.",
      "\"We are clearly seeing consumers spend in a far better, more robust way than what we're seeing in the consumer sentiment and confidence data,\" Michael Brown, a principal U.S. economist at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Visa tapped retail sales data from the U.S. Department of Commerce \u2014 excluding automobiles, gas stations and restaurants \u2014 for its holiday spending projections.",
      "In the years leading up to the pandemic, changes in consumer spending corresponded more closely with consumer sentiment, Visa's analysis shows. But that link has weakened in recent years. In April, for example, when consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since the pandemic, real consumer spending increased 3.1% on an annual basis, the Visa report points out.",
      "Consumers continue to express dour views about the economy, with sentiment falling for a third consecutive month\u00a0in October due to worries about a weaker job market and rising inflation, according to the latest University of Michigan sentiment index. Another measure from the Conference Board, a nonprofit group, also shows confidence in the economy edged down slightly this month.",
      "What explains the disconnect? Steady wage gains have kept spending aloft, with many Americans continuing to shop despite higher prices because their take-home pay remains solid, Brown said.",
      "Other holiday outlook forecasts from groups like Abode for Business and polling firm\u00a0Gallup point to the same conclusion as Visa's: Americans are planning to dish out billions on holiday gifts, travel and food despite their gloomy views on the economy.",
      "Still, some are exercising caution in their purchasing, Brown said, noting that low- and middle-income households will face the biggest tradeoffs this holiday season. Higher costs for essentials such as groceries are leaving them with less room for discretionary spending, he added.",
      "\"There is absolutely an undercurrent of trying to make the dollar stretch, given some of those necessities are costing a bit more this season,\" Brown said.",

      "Cinnamon's tainted history",
      "Lead has a history of finding its way into the nation's cinnamon supply, with several factors playing a role, according to Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports.",
      "\"Cinnamon comes from the inner bark of several tree species and can absorb lead from the soil in which it's grown, and the soil can be contaminated with lead from industrial byproducts,\" he explained. \"Lead can also enter cinnamon from processing equipment, storage containers or packaging.\"",
      "To protect against contamination, the FDA monitors and regulates lead levels in foods. In 2023, the agency launched an investigation to find the source of tainted cinnamon in applesauce pouches that caused hundreds of children to get lead poisoning. The products, which were eventually recalled, were sold by brands WanaBana, Weis and Schnucks.",
      "In a separate move last year, the FDA issued three alerts identifying ground cinnamon products with elevated levels of lead. The agency launched a third alert in August 2024, which it continues to update.",
      "\"Overall, it's troubling that these elevated lead levels continue to be found in cinnamon,\" Ronholm said. \"It's also reassuring that the FDA is continuing to scrutinize these products given all of the budget and staffing uncertainty they are experiencing.\"",
      "The FDA in March announced\u00a0plans to cut 3,500 employees, although some dismissals\u00a0have since been reversed.",
      "Thousands of FDA-regulated products, ranging from food to drugs to cosmetics, are recalled each year in an effort to protect the public from potential harm.",
      "Lead's impact on health",
      "According to the FDA, there is no known safe level of contact with lead. The agency says that continued exposure to elevated levels of lead for months or longer can lead to a range of adverse health effects, particularly in young children.",
      "\"High levels of exposure to lead in utero, infancy and early childhood can lead to neurological effects such as learning disabilities, behavior difficulties and lowered IQ,\" the FDA states in its most recent alert.",
      "Lead can also cause long-term health problems in adults, according to the World Health Organization, including increased risk of high blood pressure, cardiovascular problems and kidney damage.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted Thursday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on countries around the world, the third in a trio of rebukes of the president's trade policy this week.",
      "In a 51 to 47 vote, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve the resolution. Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, along with Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, supported the resolution. It was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation, requiring just a simple majority.",
      "The resolution is largely symbolic since it almost certainly won't be taken up by the House, where GOP leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs. Senate Democrats forced a vote on the resolution, which was led by Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, by bypassing GOP leadership using a provision of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the law that the president invoked to impose the tariffs.",
      "In April, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency, citing \"structural imbalances in the global trading system.\" The president then announced the U.S. would impose a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on goods imported from all foreign countries, dubbing it \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "Wyden, speaking on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, said the president's \"actions clearly go beyond what the law allows, which is why I'm urging passage of this bill to finally end the president's unlawful tariffs.\"",
      "\"The Senate is not a spectator to the workings of the federal government,\" Wyden said. \"When it comes to international trade, and tariffs in particular, the United States Congress has clear authority.\"",
      "Sen. Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, spoke out against the resolution, saying \"at this juncture, this resolution is counterproductive to helping American families and businesses of all sizes.\"",
      "\"It's no secret that for decades, countries around the globe have raised tariff and non-tariff barriers against Americans and against American business, and have raised the cost for Americans and American businesses without response from the United States. President Trump is now responding,\" Crapo said. \"The president's negotiations are bearing fruit.\"",
      "The vote came after Mr. Trump announced overnight that he would cut tariffs on Beijing after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. China was part of the \"Liberation Day\" tariffs and has been embroiled in a months-long trade war with the U.S.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Oct 2025 14:52:49 -0400",
    "summary": "With the Treasury Department no longer minting the one-cent coin, some businesses are offering perks to customers who bring in pennies.",
    "story": [
      "Businesses around the U.S. are desperate for pennies.",
      "President Trump's decision to stop producing the penny earlier this year is leaving some merchants short of the one-cent coin and struggling to give customers exact change. Unable to order fresh supplies of pennies, banks are also rationing them.",
      "Some retailers are pulling out all the stops just to scrounge up some pennies. Pennsylvania-based grocery chain Giant Eagle is holding a one-day event this weekend where customers can exchange their pennies for gift cards worth double the value of the coins, CBS News Pittsburgh reports.",
      "Sheetz, a convenience store chain, is also running a promotion offering a free soda to customers who bring in 100 pennies.",
      "Troy Richards, president and chief operations officer at Louisiana-based Guaranty Bank & Trust Co., said he's had to scramble to have enough pennies on hand for his customers since August.",
      "\"We got an email announcement from the Federal Reserve that penny shipments would be curtailed. Little did we know that those shipments were already over for us,\" Richards said.",
      "Richards said the $1,800 in pennies the bank had were gone in two weeks. His branches are keeping small amounts of pennies for customers who need to cash checks, but that's it.",
      "The lack of pennies has also become a legal minefield for stores and retailers. In some states and cities, it is illegal to round up a transaction to the nearest nickel or dime because doing so would run afoul of laws that are supposed to place cash customers, as well as debit and credit card customers, on an equal playing field when it comes to item costs.",
      "To avoid lawsuits, retailers are rounding down. While two or three cents may not seem like much, that extra change can add up over tens of thousands of transactions. A spokesman for Kwik Trip, the Midwest convenience store chain, said it has been rounding down every cash transaction to the nearest nickel.",
      "That's expected to cost the company roughly $3 million this year. Some retailers are asking customers to give their change to local or affiliated charities at the cash register, in an effort to avoid pennies as well.",
      "Costs more than they're worth",
      "To be sure, retailers and banks aren't clamoring for pennies to stick around. Pennies, especially in bulk, are heavy and largely used to give customers change.",
      "\"We have been advocating abolition of the penny for 30 years. But this is not the way we wanted it to go,\" said Jeff Lenard with the National Association of Convenience Stores.",
      "The penny, which dates from the\u00a0early days of the U.S. Mint\u00a0after its establishment in 1792, now costs more to manufacture than the coin is worth. One penny cost about 3.7 cents to manufacture and distribute in 2024, according to the U.S. Mint's 2024\u00a0annual report.",
      "\"Let's rip the waste out of our great nation's budget, even if it's a penny at a time,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a Feb. 9 post on his Truth Social social media platform.",
      "The Treasury Department said in May that it was placing its last order of copper-zinc planchets \u2014 the blank metal disks that are minted into coins. In June, the last pennies were minted, and by August those pennies were distributed to banks and armored vehicle service companies.",
      "Despite their coppery look, pennies are mostly made of zinc, with their distinctive appearance coming from a copper overlay. Zinc's cost per metric ton is more than double what it was in 2000, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Piling up in jars",
      "The U.S. Mint issued 3.2 billion pennies in 2024, the last full year of production, more than double that of the second-most minted coin in the country: the quarter. But the problem with pennies is they are issued, given as change and rarely recirculated back into the economy. Americans store their pennies in jars or use them for decoration. This requires the Mint to produce significant sums of pennies each year.",
      "The government is expected to save $56 million by not minting pennies, according to the Treasury Department. Despite losing money on the penny, the Mint is profitable for the U.S. government through its production of other circulating coins as well as coin proof and commemorative sets that appeal to numismatic collectors.",
      "In 2024, the Mint made $182 million in seigniorage, which is its equivalent of profit.",
      "Besides Americans' penny-hoarding habit, a logistical issue is also preventing pennies from circulating.",
      "The distribution of coins is handled by the Federal Reserve system. Several companies, mostly armored carrier companies, operate coin terminals where banks can withdraw and deposit coins. Roughly a third of these 170 coin terminals are now closed to both penny deposits as well as penny withdrawals.",
      "Bank lobbyists say these terminals being closed to penny deposits is exacerbating the penny shortage, because parts of the country that may have some surplus pennies are unable to get those pennies to parts of country with shortages.",
      "\"As a result of the U.S. Department of the Treasury's decision to end production of the penny, coin distribution locations accepting penny deposits and fulfilling orders will vary over time as (penny) inventory is depleted\" a Federal Reserve spokeswoman said.",
      "The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment on whether they had any guidance for retailers or banks regarding the penny shortage, or the issues regarding penny circulation.",
      "\"We don't want the penny back\"",
      "The U.S. isn't the first country to transition away from small denomination coins or discontinue out-of-date coins. But in all of these cases, governments wound down the use of their out-of-date coins over a period of, often, years.",
      "For example, Canada announced it would eliminate its one-cent coin in 2012, transitioning away from one-cent cash transactions starting in 2013 and is still redeeming and recycling one-cent coins a decade later. The \"decimalization\" process of converting British coins from farthings and shillings to a 100-pence-to-a-pound system took much of the 1960s and early 1970s.",
      "The U.S. removed the penny from commerce abruptly, without any action by Congress or any regulatory guidance for banks, retailers or states. The retail and banking industries, rarely allies in Washington on policy matters related to point-of-sale, are demanding that Washington issue guidance or pass a law fixing the issues that are arising due to the shortage.",
      "\"We don't want the penny back. We just want some sort of clarity from the federal government on what to do, as this issue is only going to get worse,\" said Jeff Lenard with the National Association of Convenience Stores.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted Wednesday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on Canada, a day after the chamber rebuked the president with another vote to block tariffs on Brazil.",
      "In a 50 to 46 vote, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve the measure, which would terminate the national emergency used to impose tariffs on some goods from Canada. Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky broke with their party to vote in favor of the resolution, which required a simple majority and was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation.",
      "The move is mostly symbolic, since it is unlikely to be taken up in the GOP-controlled House. Republican leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs in the lower chamber.",
      "For months, trade tensions have flared between the U.S. and Canada. In August, the president raised tariffs on the country to 35%, though a large share of goods remain exempt under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Then, over the weekend, Mr. Trump said he is raising tariffs on Canada by an additional 10%, blasting the U.S.'s northern neighbor over an anti-tariff ad by the government of Ontario that used quotes from former President Ronald Reagan.",
      "In February, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency with respect to \"the public health crisis of deaths due to the use of fentanyl and other illicit drugs, and the failure of Canada to do more\" to combat \"drug and human traffickers, criminals at large, and drugs.\"",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, forced a vote to challenge the move under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, effectively bypassing Senate leadership. He has argued that the tariffs on one of the nation's top trading partners aren't justified under the emergency.",
      "\"I don't think you can say that fentanyl is not an emergency vis-a-vis Mexico or China, but it is ridiculous to say that fentanyl is an emergency with respect to Canada,\" Kaine said. \"And it's a pretext that's just being used to pour more and more tariffs onto Canada.\"",
      "The vote came after the Senate on Tuesday approved a resolution that would block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to back the measure. Wednesday's vote also marked the second time lawmakers have weighed in on the Canada tariffs, after the Senate approved a resolution aimed at blocking the levies in April.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision-today-fomc-meeting/",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 15:53:53 -0400",
    "summary": "The Fed on Wednesday announced its second interest-rate cut of 2025, reducing borrowing costs in a move to spur U.S. hiring.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, but Chair Jerome Powell hinted that the central bank might pause before further lowering borrowing costs.",
      "The Fed cut lowers the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 3.75% and 4%, down from its prior range of 4% to 4.25%. The Fed reduced rates by the same amount in September, its first cut since December of 2024.",
      "In a Wednesday afternoon press conference to discuss the decision, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said another rate cut at its next meeting, set for Dec. 10, \"isn't a foregone conclusion.\" That may disappoint some borrowers and investors, given that the Fed last month had penciled in an additional rate cut for its final meeting of the year.",
      "\"There were strongly differing views on how to proceed in December\" during the central bank's meeting today, Powell said. Those conflicting views mean \"we haven't made a decision about December. I'm saying something in addition here \u2014 that it's not to be seen as a foregone conclusion. In fact, far from it.\"",
      "He added, \"We've cut 50 more basis points in the last two meetings, and there's a sense from some, 'Let's pause here,' and a sense from others, 'Let's go ahead.'\"",
      "Stocks erased modest gains after Powell's comments, with the S&P 500 slipping 0.2% in afternoon trading and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipping 0.4%.",
      "The central bank's move to ease monetary policy is aimed at shoring up economic growth by lowering borrowing costs, spurring consumer spending and investment by businesses. Although the ongoing U.S. government shutdown has delayed release of the Labor Department's September jobs report, other indicators point to a continued slowdown in hiring. The ADP National Employment Report, for instance, showed private-sector payrolls shrinking by 32,000 last month.",
      "In its policy\u00a0statement on Wednesday, the Fed said \"downside risks to employment rose in recent months.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve's so-called dual mandate requires monetary policymakers to keep both inflation and unemployment low, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting last month that risks to the labor market are growing.",
      "While Powell said the Fed is watching layoff announcements from large businesses such as Amazon, he added that the weakness in the job market does not appear to be accelerating. His comments indicate that another back-to-back rate cut this year isn't a certainty, financial experts said.",
      "\"The knee-jerk reaction of the markets to the Fed meeting (and press conference) was to sell stocks and bonds, because Chairman Powell said that an additional rate cut in December wasn't a sure thing,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email. Investors \"were negatively surprised that future cuts might be taken off the table.\"",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the panel that sets the Fed's monetary policy, isn't scheduled to meet on interest rates in November.",
      "Data blackout",
      "The near-total blackout on government economic data during the shutdown may complicate the Fed's decision-making, experts said. Typically, Fed officials are able to draw on a host of official reports, ranging from measures of employment growth to inflation markers, as they seek to determine the best path for policy.",
      "\"While today's rate cut and the general direction of future policy remain relatively clear, guidance on the committee's perspective on economic conditions is more necessary than ever,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates said in an email. \"A prolonged government shutdown and ongoing tariff negotiations continue to introduce significant uncertainty into the immediate monetary policy outlook.\"",
      "Powell noted that the lack of official economic data may complicate the Fed's December decision, given that the central bank relies on such information to assess the economy.",
      "\"What do you do when you are driving in the fog? You slow down,\" Powell said.",
      "On Wednesday, 10 of the 12 FOMC members voted in favor of the quarter-point cut, with two members objecting. Fed Governor Stephen Miran dissented, preferring a 0.50 percentage point cut, as he did at the September meeting. Kansas City Fed President Jeffry Schmid also dissented, saying he preferred no rate change.",
      "Inflation battle",
      "While the Fed is now focused on weakness in the labor market, its battle against inflation isn't over. The Fed cranked rates higher after consumer prices soared during the pandemic, with inflation hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "Because higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow, businesses and consumers typically react by paring spending, which dampens demand throughout the economy and cools inflation. Since mid-2022, inflation has receded to an annual rate of 3% as of September, although that remains higher than the Fed's target of a 2% annual pace.",
      "While the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs are starting to trickle through to consumer prices, the impact has been more muted than economists had predicted earlier this year. Some businesses are eating some of the tariff costs, while others stocked up on imports earlier in the year to get ahead of the import duties.",
      "\"Though inflation is still higher than comfortable, the jobs market is holding on to signs of weakness, and their desire to stimulate the economy further is likely to continue outweighing inflation concerns,\" said Steve Rick, chief economist at financial services company TruStage.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk is widely recognized as an electric car pioneer. Yet the Tesla CEO has also single-handedly chilled the automaker's sales, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at Yale University.",
      "Public controversy over Musk's role as leader of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), as well as his acquisition of social media platform Twitter (now known as X) in 2022, reduced Tesla's sales by up to 1.2 million vehicles over a three-year period, the researchers estimated in a working paper published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research that aimed to measure the effect of Musk's politics on Tesla's business.",
      "\"This study highlights just how impactful a CEO's partisan actions can be,\" the researchers wrote. \"We show that Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization, had a dramatic effect on Tesla sales due to his politically partisan activities unrelated to Tesla's core business.\"",
      "Musk's adverse impact on Tesla's business became visible starting in mid-2022, with sales especially dropping in Democratic-leaning states and counties, the study further concludes.",
      "\"Musk's actions antagonized his most loyal customer base, for, as we show, Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to purchase a Tesla,\" the researchers said.",
      "The study's lead author is energy and environmental economist Kenneth Gillingham, who is the senior associate dean of academic affairs at the Yale School of the Environment. His research focuses on consumer behavior and policy in the transportation and energy sectors.",
      "Musk announced in May that he was pulling back from DOGE, which the Trump administration formed to shrink the federal government and cut spending.",
      "Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the paper's findings.",
      "Musk's foray into politics and emergence as a prominent adviser to President Trump early in his second term raised the entrepreneur's visibility but alienated some potential Tesla customers, Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, previously told CBS News.",
      "Tesla last week reported third-quarter earnings of $1.4 billion, down 37% from the year-ago period, citing higher costs and tariff-related headwinds. Tesla's vehicle sales fell 1% in 2024 despite a 7% increase in EV sales across the car industry.",
      "Tesla's stock fell 27% in February, a period of time that coincided with Mr. Trump's first full month in the White House. But the shares have rebounded and are now up roughly 14% on the year, with investors betting on growth in the company's fledgling robotaxi business, autonomous driving technology and plans to build AI-powered humanoid robots.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\"\u00a0Wedbush Securities technology analyst Dan Ives said in a recent report, adding that he expects the Trump administration to fast-track such initiatives.",
      "Another measure of Musk's perceived value to Tesla is the enormous pay package shareholders are preparing to vote on for the executive. That total package could be worth up to $1 trillion in a decade, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history.",
      "For Musk to earn the full amount, Tesla would have to hit certain profitability and production targets, as well as reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion \u2014 nearly six times its current value \u2014 in 10 years.",
      "Robyn Denholm, chairman of Tesla's board of directors, is urging shareholders to approve Musk's proposed compensation. \"Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become: a transformative force reimagining the fundamental building blocks of mobility, energy and labor,\"\u00a0 Denholm said in the letter.",

      "Hospitals nationwide are urging the Trump administration to reconsider a steep new fee for hiring highly skilled workers from other countries. Many turn to medical professionals from abroad to fill the gaps, but the new $100,000 price tag for the popular H-1B visa is making that nearly impossible, particularly for midsize hospitals or smaller.",
      "\"We need to stabilize,\" said Jamie White, the chief nursing officer at Frederick Health in Maryland. She also said, \"We have had a continual desire to bring on about 100 nurses for the last three years.\"",
      "Frederick Health, like others nationwide, looked abroad to fill in the gaps, planning to sponsor up to 45 nurses on H-1B visas. Now, those plans are on hold, with a new $100,000 fee to obtain the visa and hire foreign employees.",

      "\"President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages,\" Rogers said in a recent statement to CBS News.",

      "\"Given the staffing and financial challenges our hospitals are already facing, the increased petition fees outlined in the September 19 Proclamation would likely prevent many of them from continuing to recruit essential health care staff and could force a reduction in the services they are able to provide,\" said the letter, addressed to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not comment on the letter when contacted by CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "For most of 2025, the job market was described by economists as \"no hire, no fire\" \u2014 a stretch of time when job seekers faced slim prospects, but workers could count on job security. But that fragile balance may now be shifting, labor experts warn, as mass layoffs at companies like Amazon and UPS signal a possible turning point for the labor market.",
      "Amazon on Tuesday announced 14,000 job cuts, citing a shift toward artificial intelligence, while UPS on the same day said it has reduced its workforce by 48,000 from a year earlier. Paramount Skydance, the owner of CBS News, on Wednesday also announced it is shedding jobs, part of an ongoing effort to cut costs at the entertainment and media company.",
      "Target on Tuesday also notified a state employment agency in Minnesota, where the retailer is based, that it plans to lay off more than 800 workers in January as part of a broader corporate restructuring,\u00a0CBS News Minnesota reported. The retailer announced last week that it would cut 1,800 corporate positions as the chain trims its global workforce by about 8%.",
      "The mass layoffs come as the Federal Reserve scrutinizes the labor market for signs of weakness, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month citing concerns about slower hiring\u00a0in announcing the central bank's first interest-rate cut of 2025. The announcements from Amazon and UPS could signal that the Fed has good reason to be worried, experts said.",
      "\"No question that this is a shift, and it does seem to me it signals that 'no hire, no fire' is a thing of the past,\" John Challenger, CEO of outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told CBS News.",
      "\"These are major layoffs, the kind of which we only see in periods of real change in the economy,\" he added.",
      "Layoffs picking up",
      "Even before Tuesday's job cuts, layoffs had been trending higher, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Employers across the U.S. cut nearly 950,000 jobs this year through September, the largest number of layoffs since 2020, its most recent data shows.",
      "Official federal reports on the state of the labor market have been suspended due to the government shutdown, which means the Fed will make its next interest rate decision tomorrow, Oct. 29, without information about hiring in September.",
      "But job growth has slowed sharply in recent months, with average monthly payroll gains of roughly 27,000 between May and August \u2014 down from average gains of nearly 123,000 per month between January and April, labor data shows.",
      "On Oct. 1, the ADP National Employment Report, a measure of private employment in the U.S., said payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs in September.",
      "At the same time, recent reports suggest layoffs have accelerated in October, Grace Zwemmer, associate economist with Oxford Economics, said in a report Wednesday. State-level data also shows jobless claims by federal employees topped 10,000 in the week ended Oct. 18, a sign the stalemate in Congress is taking a toll, the investment advisory firm said in a separate research note.",
      "To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate remains low by historical standards, edging up to 4.3% in August from 4.2% in July. The latest layoffs are unlikely to dramatically drive up joblessness, experts say.",
      "\"When we look at the scale of the announcements vis-\u00e0-vis the broader economy and the data we have from unemployment claims, we don't see them yet at a scale where the unemployment rate is going to shoot up,\" said Andy Stettner, director of economy and jobs at the left-leaning Century Foundation.",
      "But, he added, \"These larger corporate downsizings are happening at a time when there aren't many job openings.\"",
      "That means some workers who lose their jobs could struggle to find new employment, experts say. As a result, the ranks of long-term unemployed people, or those who have been searching for work for more than six months, are predicted to rise even higher from its August figure of almost 2 million, the highest level since 2022.",
      "What's impacting the labor market?",
      "Employers are cutting jobs due to several factors, experts say, ranging from artificial intelligence to economic uncertainty. Earlier this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the e-commerce giant's investment in AI tools would allow the company to\u00a0trim its human workforce\u00a0as the business becomes more efficient.",
      "\"Amazon really pointed to robotics, AI and new technology \u2014 and being on the cutting edge of that technology \u2014 for shifting jobs,\" Challenger said.",
      "About one-quarter of technology industry workers said they had experienced layoffs or role eliminations due to AI adoption during the past two years, according to a new study from career site Indeed.",
      "Other companies are holding off on hiring or are cutting jobs for other reasons. UPS cited the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, as well as shipping declines from Amazon, its biggest customer, on its business. Amazon has been building its own delivery infrastructure, leading it to cut back on its use of UPS.",
      "On Monday, children's clothing brand Carter's said it is cutting 300 jobs, or 15% of its workforce, and closing 150 stores over the next three years due to higher costs from tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies to the federal government.",
      "The Trump administration has said that its tariffs would help protect U.S. manufacturing and boost domestic production as businesses move their operations stateside.",
      "In the meantime, Americans are growing more pessimistic about the job market, according to recent\u00a0CBS News polling. About 52% of Americans describe the labor market as \"bad,\" up seven percentage points from April, the poll found.",
      "\"We are moving more into a time where job security might be more precarious,\" Challenger said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-fomc-interest-rate-meeting-decision-october-29-forecast/",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 07:44:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Concerns about a weakening labor market may outweigh worries about rising inflation, tipping the Fed toward another rate cut, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve is set to make its next interest rate decision today, even as a near-total blackout of federal economic data continues amid the government shutdown.",
      "The Labor Department, however, on Friday released one key report ahead of its meeting:\u00a0the Consumer Price Index. That report showed that the inflation rate rose at a pace of 3% last month, cooler than expected, as the impact of President Trump's wide-ranging tariffs have so far been more muted than economists have forecast.",
      "Economists say the softer inflation report likely opens the door to a rate cut today.",
      "\"Concerns about tariffs driving prices higher are still not showing up in most categories,\" Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, said Friday in an email. \"Nothing in the inflation print should stop the Fed from cutting rates next week. Yes, prices are higher, but not enough to keep them from helping the economy,\" he added.",
      "There's a 96.7% probability that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points on Oct. 29,\u00a0according to CME FedWatch, which bases its predictions on 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices.",
      "A quarter-point cut would bring down the benchmark rate to a range of between 3.75% to 4%, down from its current range of between 4% to 4.25%, and mark the Fed's second rate cut this year.",
      "What's the argument for cutting rates?",
      "The Federal Reserve has a so-called dual mandate to keep both inflation and unemployment low. When inflation is soaring \u2014 such as when it hit a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022 \u2014 the Fed ratchets rates higher to make borrowing more expensive, which in turn dissuades consumers and businesses from spending, tempering inflation.",
      "But a weak labor market can be bolstered by lower interest rates, because it's easier for businesses to expand and hire more workers if it's less expensive to borrow money.",
      "When Powell last month announced the Fed's first rate cut of 2025, he signaled the central bank was growing increasingly concerned about a sharp slowdown in the labor market. \"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,\" he said in September.",
      "However, the monthly jobs report for September wasn't released earlier this month due to the federal shutdown. In an Oct. 14 speech, Powell acknowledged the data halt, yet added that the central bank has access to \"a wide variety of public- and private-sector data that have remained available.\"",
      "According to those sources of information, \"the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting,\" Powell noted.",
      "Friday's CPI report \"should keep the Fed focused on the labor market in terms of the near-term policy trajectory. In the absence of the September jobs report, an October cut appears to be a done deal,\" Bank of America economists noted in a Friday research report.",
      "How would a rate cut impact your money?",
      "While a quarter-point rate cut is relatively small, it would come after September's reduction \u2014 and economists are also expecting the Fed to usher in a third cut at its December meeting. Together, that means the benchmark rate by year-end could sit 0.75 percentage points lower than it was in January.",
      "That would help reduce rates for credit cards and loans such as home equity lines of credit, or HELOCs. Those types of credit products are based on the prime rate, or the interest rate that banks charge each other, and which in turn is based on the Fed's benchmark rate.",
      "Mortgage rates, meanwhile, have already dipped ahead of the Fed's rate decision. While mortgage rates aren't set by the Fed, they're\u00a0heavily influenced\u00a0by its policy moves, as well as bond market investors' expectations for economic growth and inflation.",
      "The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 6.19% as of Oct. 23, marking their lowest level in a year, according to Freddie Mac. Homebuyers might not see much more of a break, at least in the near-term, economists said.",
      "\"Mortgage rates have moved down notably in advance of the Fed's meeting, hitting their lowest level in more than a year, but further declines will depend on new developments,\" noted Realtor.com's chief economist Danielle Hale in an email. \"The Fed's decisions are anticipated by the market, which means that the upcoming rate cut and several more over the next few months are already largely priced in.\"",

      "The vote to approve the measure was 52 to 48. Republican Sens. Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Thom Tillis, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul joined Democrats to vote in favor. The resolution required a simple majority and was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation.",
      "In July, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency with respect to \"recent policies, practices, and actions of the Government of Brazil\" that he said constitute an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\" The move came during the trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who was ultimately convicted and sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting a coup in 2022.",
      "\"President Trump's tariff regime \u2014 global, Brazilian tariffs, Canadian tariffs, tariff deals announced then paused, tariff deals negotiated, exceptions granted and in some cases not granted \u2014 have created huge chaos in the national economy,\" Kaine said in a speech on the Senate floor before the vote. \"Tariffs are a tax on American consumers. Tariffs are a tax on American businesses. And they are a tax that is imposed by a single person: Donald J. Trump.\"",
      "Kaine told reporters that the president's emergency order was \"unusual and extreme,\" and accused him of putting it in place due to the \"decision to prosecute Donald Trump's friend.\"",
      "\"If that's an emergency, then anything is an emergency, and any president can make up anything and call it an emergency and then use massive powers to impose regulations or evade regulations,\" Kaine said.",
      "The bill will still need to pass the House and be signed by the president, meaning it is mostly symbolic. House Republican leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs in the lower chamber.",
      "But Kaine said Tuesday that he has learned that \"the president is responsive to things like this.\"",
      "\"When he sees Republicans starting to vote against his policies, even in small numbers, that makes an impression on him and can often cause him to alter his behavior,\" he said.",
      "One of those Republican yes votes was McConnell, a former Senate majority leader who has clashed with Mr. Trump for years \u2014 including on trade policy. McConnell has long been skeptical of tariffs and supportive of free trade, a stance that was essentially considered doctrine in pre-Trump GOP politics.",
      "\"Tariffs make both building and buying in America more expensive,\" McConnell said in a statement prior to the vote. \"The economic harms of trade wars are not the exception to history, but the rule.\"",
      "Earlier in the day, Vice President JD Vance met with Senate Republicans at the Capitol and urged them to reject the resolution.",
      "\"The point that I made to my Republican colleagues, recognizing that there's a diversity of opinions about it, is that the tariffs give us the ability to put American workers first,\" Vance told reporters after the meeting. \"They force American industry to reinvest in the United States of America, instead of a foreign country. They're also incredible leverage for the president of the United States in negotiating these trade deals overseas.\"",
      "The president cited a law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act in his order imposing the Brazil tariffs. The act gives any senator the authority to force a vote to challenge the move, effectively bypassing Senate leadership.",
      "In April, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve a measure aimed at blocking the Canada tariffs. Those Republicans were Murkowski of Alaska, Collins of Maine and McConnell, along with Paul of Kentucky, a Republican who cosponsored the legislation. Later that month, an effort aimed at blocking Mr. Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on countries around the world fell short, with two senators who had previously backed the tariff measure absent from the vote. The resolutions need a simple majority to pass.",
      "Kaine said he would force additional votes on Canadian tariffs and global tariffs throughout the week as he pushes back on the administration and puts pressure on Senate Republicans.",
      "\"So the votes are about tariffs, and they're about the economic destruction of tariffs, but they are also really about, how much will we let a president get away with?\" Kaine said. \"Do my colleagues have a gag reflex or not, in terms of powers that constitutionally are handed to Congress?\"",

    "summary": "For a second-straight day Saturday, President Trump accused the Nigerian government of not doing enough to prevent the killings of Christians.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump threatened to stop all aid to Nigeria and has instructed the Pentagon to \"prepare for possible action\" in the West African country, accusing the country's government of allegedly failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.",
      "In a post on Truth Social on Saturday, Mr. Trump accused the Nigerian government for a second-straight day of not doing enough to prevent the killings of Christians. He threatened that the U.S. \"may very well go into that now disgraced country, 'guns-a-blazing' to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.\"",
      "\"If we attack, it will be fast, vicious and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians! WARNING: THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT BETTER MOVE FAST!\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "In a post to X Saturday night in response to Mr. Trump's statement, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote, \"Yes sir.\"",
      "\"The killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria \u2014 and anywhere \u2014 must end immediately. The Department of War is preparing for action,\" Hegseth wrote. \"Either the Nigerian Government protects Christians, or we will kill the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.\"",
      "The Department of War is the Trump administration's preferred term for the Defense Department. \"",
      "The Nigerian government has vehemently rejected the claims, and analysts say that while Christians are among those targeted, the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria's Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur.",
      "Nigeria's President Bola Ahmed Tinubu said Saturday on social media that the characterization of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country does not reflect the national reality.",
      "\"Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so,\" Tinubu said. \"Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it. Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.\"",
      "The warning of possible military action follows an announcement on Friday that he would designate Nigeria \"a country of particular concern\" as it relates to religious freedom, a move that had been pushed by some U.S. lawmakers.",
      "The designation does not necessarily mean that sanctions, which could include a ban on all non-humanitarian aid, will be imposed, but it is one step ahead of that.",
      "\"Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria,\" Mr. Trump said\u00a0in a social media post. \"Radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter. I am hereby making Nigeria a 'COUNTRY OF PARTICULAR CONCERN.'\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he would be asking several U.S. lawmakers to look into the matter and report back on what the response to the designation should be.",
      "\"The United States cannot stand by while such atrocities are happening in Nigeria, and numerous other Countries. We stand ready, willing, and able to save our Great Christian population around the World!\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Designating a \"country of particular concern\" under the\u00a01998 International Religious Freedom Act\u00a0is an executive prerogative that normally follows recommendations from both the congressionally mandated U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and the State Department.",
      "The State Department usually releases\u00a0its annual\u00a0Report on International Religious Freedom in the spring, but has not yet done so this year. The report may or may not include \"particular concern\" designations, which can be done at any time. And, such designations, which authorize U.S. penalties, do not necessarily impose sanctions.",
      "The State Department's most recent religious freedom reports cover 2023 and were released last year under the Biden administration. These reports, like others on broader human rights and human trafficking, cover the previous calendar year and are often late in being submitted.",
      "The designation comes after Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has been trying to rally fellow evangelical Christians to urge Congress to designate Nigeria as a violator of religious freedom with claims of \"Christian mass murder.\"",
      "Nigeria was first placed on the \"country of particular concern\"\u00a0list\u00a0by the U.S. in 2020 in what the State Department called \"systematic violations of religious freedom.\" But the designation did not single out attacks on Christians. The designation was lifted in 2023 in what many saw as a way to improve ties between the countries ahead of a visit by then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Nov 2025 17:39:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Zohran Mamdani is viewed as the leading candidate to become the next mayor of New York City, even as the contest has divided the normal partisan lines between Republicans and Democrats.",
    "story": [
      "New York \u2014 With just days to go before polls close in New York City's fractious race for mayor, frontrunner Zohran Mamdani spoke Saturday with former President Barack Obama, even as some major Democrats have taken a cautious political approach when it comes to the democratic socialist.",
      "A source familiar confirmed their call, first reported by the New York Times. In a statement to CBS News, a spokeswoman for Mamdani's campaign said the candidate \"appreciated President Obama's words of support and their conversation on the importance of bringing a new kind of politics to our city.\"",
      "Mamdani's win in June over former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo in a crowded mayoral Democratic primary was arguably the most significant progressive primary victory since now-Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated a Democratic incumbent congressman in 2018. The win by Mamdani upended Democratic party politics in a year where the national party has struggled to repair its brand issues after a disastrous 2024 election cycle.",
      "While Mamdani's success so far has brought the 34-year-old politician praise, it has also led to more focused criticism for his record, or lack thereof.",
      "Even after Mamdani's summer primary win, some national Democrats have either been slow to publicly embrace him, or have avoided doing so altogether.",
      "In Tuesday's general election contest, Mamdani is facing off against Cuomo, now running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries waited until Oct. 24, the eve of early voting, to endorse Mamdani. Meanwhile, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, have not endorsed in the race.",
      "At a rally last week with Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mamdani said his opponents, Cuomo and Sliwa, possess \"the playbook of the past.\"",
      "\"New York, our work has only just begun,\" Mamdani said as the rally ended. \"On [Tuesday] November 4th we set ourselves free.\"",
      "And in these final days of the contest, Democrats aren't the only ones making political decisions that don't follow normal party lines.",
      "In an interview earlier this week with CBS News, Republican Rep. Nick Langworthy of New York, a former state GOP chair, said of Cuomo that \"no one was a fiercer critic of his time as governor than I was.\"",
      "\"We fought him tooth and nail every step of the way,\" said Langworthy, who is supporting Cuomo for mayor. \"But he would be a far superior choice for the people of New York than Zohran Mamdani.\"",
      "Langworthy also expressed concern about the implications of a Mamdani victory, saying Mamdani's policies would become \"contagious around the country if he has a platform to talk to vast sums of people.\"",
      "The national impact of the race isn't lost on either major party given what a Mamdani victory could mean for control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterms, where Republicans are attempting to defend a narrow majority. Whichever party holds the House will likely play a major role in how Washington functions in the final two years of President Trump's term.",
      "Moderate Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York backed Cuomo late last month, saying in a social media post, \"I'm a Democratic Capitalist, not a Democratic Socialist. I endorse Andrew Cuomo. I can not back a declared socialist with a thin resume to run the most complex city in America.\"",
      "As Democrats continue to face questions about how the party can recover and win back voters, Mamdani's run for mayor may provide a telling guide of sorts for the kind of authentic messaging and grassroots campaigning that the left has struggled to cultivate on a national stage outside of Sanders' 2016 and 2020 presidential runs.",
      "Speaking at the late October Mamdani rally, Sanders said \"a victory here in New York will give hope and inspiration to people throughout our country and throughout the world.\"",
      "\"That is what this election is about. And that is why Donald Trump is paying attention to this election,\" Sanders said.",

    "story": [
      "Rep. Nancy Mace allegedly berated and cursed at police officers tasked with escorting her through Charleston International Airport in South Carolina on Thursday, allegedly saying they were \"[expletive] incompetent,\" according to an incident report.",
      "According to a police incident report, officers with the Charleston County Aviation Authority Police Department were assigned to meet the Republican congresswoman at 6:30 a.m. Thursday to escort her from the curb to her flight. The officers were told she would be arriving in a white BMW at the ticketing curb area.",
      "At around 6:35 a.m., they were told she was running late and they kept waiting. According to the report, the officers never saw the car arrive.",
      "Surveillance video from the airport obtained by CBS News via the Freedom of Information Act shows Mace arrive at a sidewalk entrance in a dark-colored sedan around 6:50 a.m. No one else was visible in the vehicle.",
      "Around 7 a.m., the officers were informed that Mace, 47, was at the entrance for the Known Crewmember program \u2013 a trusted access lane overseen by the Transportation Security Administration and intended for flight crew members. The report said the officers made their way over \"in less than a minute.\"",
      "A separate surveillance video from the airport appeared to show Mace at the TSA security checkpoint speaking with airport officials. \u00a0It took about seven minutes from the time Mace first appeared at the TSA entrance to when the escorting officers arrived, according to the video.",
      "When the officers met Mace to escort her, they said she \"began loudly cursing and making derogatory comments to us and about the department. She repeatedly stated we were '(expletive) incompetent\"' and 'this is no way to treat a (expletive) US Representative',\" the report states.",
      "\"She also said we would never treat (U.S. Sen.) Tim Scott like this,\" the officer tasked with escorting Mace says in the report.",
      "Police said Mace allegedly cursed and complained at the officers and into her phone during the entire walk to her gate. After she boarded her flight, an airline employee and several other TSA agents said they were shocked and upset by her behavior at the security checkpoint and gate, the officer says in the report.",
      "\"Any other person in the airport acting and talking the way she did, our department would have been dispatched, and we would have addressed the behavior,\" the officer said in the report.",
      "On X, Mace appeared to respond to part of the story, sharing the surveillance video showing her arrival at the airport, followed by her standing in the TSA screening area \"with no security.\"",
      "\"And for the FAKE NEWS: This is the entrance ALL Members of Congress use at the airport,\" she wrote. \"Are you going to write that Senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott use the same entrance or no?\"",
      "The congresswoman's director of operations, Cameron Morabito, told CBS News in a short statement on Saturday that \"apparently, simply arriving at an airport now makes for a worthy headline.\"",
      "\"We are forced to take the Congresswoman's safety extremely seriously. After the world watched\u00a0Charlie Kirk's\u00a0assassination, the threats against her have only intensified,\" the statement said. \"Our security procedures are based solely on legitimate safety concerns, and any attempt to politicize this reality is both dangerous and reckless.\"",
      "Morabito's statement did not address the alleged comments made by Mace to the police escort officers.",
      "An aide with Mace's office told CBS News that these travel and security arrangements are routine and that the situation has been \"blown out of proportion.\" A phone text exchange viewed by CBS News showed the coordination messages between Mace's staff and airport security officials, which said that she would be arriving curbside in a silver BMW at 6:30 a.m. It also showed the exchange when Mace was delayed.",
      "When asked about Mace's alleged comments to the police officers, the aide referred CBS News to remarks the congresswoman gave to the New York Times.",
      "In that interview, Mace said she has been on high alert since Kirk's assassination and said she \"100% yes\" complained at the airport. She told the newspaper it was partly because the death threats she has received in recent weeks have intensified.",
      "\"We all get frustrated when it's not taken seriously,\" she told the Times.",
      "Mace said some of the recent threats had rattled her.",
      "\"One guy had a bunch of electronics in his car,\" she told the newspaper. \"Someone followed me home. We're dealing with all of these things on a daily basis.\"",

    "summary": "Two federal judges on Friday said the Trump administration must tap into contingency funds to make SNAP payments during the government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Two federal judges on Friday said the Trump administration must tap into contingency funds to make payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during the government shutdown, ruling against the government in a pair of suits over the imminent benefits lapse. Roughly 42 million Americans\u00a0rely on SNAP\u00a0to help buy food.",
      "In a case brought by a coalition of states in federal court in Massachusetts, Judge Indira Talwani ruled that the government is required by law to tap into the emergency money to make at least partial payments, and gave the administration until Monday to tell the court whether it planned to do so.",
      "In Rhode Island, Judge John J. McConnell, Jr.   granted a request for a temporary restraining order from a group of municipalities and nonprofits that sued to block the imminent funding freeze, according to attorneys for Democracy Forward, the group leading the suit. The ruling was made from the bench. An entry on the case docket said the court \"orders the USDA to distribute contingency funds\" and report back to the court by noon on Monday.",
      "McConnell on Saturday ordered the Trump administration to pay SNAP benefits in full by Monday and to report to the court by noon regarding the status of the distribution. In the order, the judge said that if the government chooses to use its discretion and decides not to use other funds to make a full payment, then it must make a partial payment using the total amount of the contingency funds. The order said the contingency funds must be used to make a partial payment by Wednesday.",
      "In her ruling, Talwani stopped short of ordering the administration to send SNAP payments on Saturday, but she rejected the government's argument that the $5 billion contingency fund cannot be used to fund benefits during the lapse in appropriations.",
      "\"At core, Defendants' conclusion that USDA is statutorily prohibited from funding SNAP because Congress has not enacted new appropriations for the current fiscal year is erroneous,\" Talwani wrote. \"To the contrary, Defendants are statutorily mandated to use the previously appropriated SNAP contingency reserve when necessary and also have discretion to use other previously appropriated funds.\"",
      "Talwani wrote that \"the court will allow Defendants to consider whether they will authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November, and report back to the court no later than\" Monday.",
      "SNAP benefits provide eligible families with an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card for food purchases. Many families rely on those benefits as their main source of money for food. The Trump administration said money for the program was due to expire on Saturday because of the ongoing government shutdown, now on its 31st day.",
      "In a post Friday night on Truth Social, President Trump\u00a0wrote that he has \"instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible.\" The president blamed Democrats for causing any delay to the funding and added, \"If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.\"",
      "The suit in Massachusetts was brought by two dozen states and the District of Columbia earlier this week. They asked the court to require the administration to tap into the emergency funds to keep SNAP money flowing to states, which administer food stamp programs. The states argued that the administration's decision to cut off payments was unlawful and threatened to deprive millions of Americans of essential food benefits that help protect against food insecurity and hunger.",
      "\"Shutting off SNAP benefits will cause deterioration of public health and well-being,\" state officials wrote in their lawsuit. \"Ultimately, the States will bear costs associated with many of these harms. The loss of SNAP benefits leads to food insecurity, hunger, and malnutrition, which are associated with numerous negative health outcomes in children, such as poor concentration, decreased cognitive function, fatigue, depression, and behavioral problems.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, said in a memo last week that \"the well has run dry\" and that November benefits would not be paid without an end to the shutdown. Administration officials and Republicans in Congress have said that the roughly $5 billion in the contingency fund could not legally be used to cover the shortfall.",
      "\"By law, the contingency fund can only flow when the underlying fund is flowing,\" Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said at the Capitol on Friday.",
      "Talwani, the judge in Massachusetts, rejected that argument in her ruling: \"[U]nder Defendants' statutory construction, the use of the separately appropriated contingent reserve to fund SNAP benefits is somehow predicated on Congress's annual appropriation of funds to the SNAP program. Congress placed no such restrictions in the 2024 Consolidated Appropriations Act.\"",
      "She wrote that the suspension of SNAP payments to the states was \"based on the erroneous conclusion that the Contingency Funds could not be used to ensure continuation of SNAP payments.\"",
      "\"This court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP program,\" the judge wrote. \"And while these contingency funds reportedly are insufficient to cover the entire cost of SNAP for November, Defendants also may supplement the Contingency Funds by authorizing a transfer of additional funds ... to avoid any reductions.\"",

      "The previous lowest refugee ceiling was set by the first Trump administration in 2020, when it allocated 15,000 spots for fiscal year 2021.",
      "The announcement Thursday is the latest effort by Mr. Trump and his top aides to dramatically scale back the decades-old U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, a humanitarian policy for vulnerable people fleeing war and violence across the world that once enjoyed robust bipartisan support.",
      "Mr. Trump suspended the U.S. refugee program hours after taking office for a second time earlier this year, citing strains on American communities receiving the refugees and concerns about the vetting process. Weeks later, his administration made an exemption for Afrikaners, calling them victims of racial oppression.",
      "In an order posted on the federal government's journal of regulations, Mr. Trump said the 7,500 refugee spots for fiscal year 2026 would \"primarily be allocated among Afrikaners\" and \"other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.\" Fiscal year 2026 started on Oct. 1 and culminates at the end of September 2026.",

      "The prioritization of Afrikaners \u2014 while refugees from places like Afghanistan, Myanmar and Sudan plagued by ethnic violence and armed conflict are being blocked from entering the U.S. \u2014 has led to accusations of preferential treatment among refugee advocates.",

      "Before the second Trump administration took office, refugees were typically referred to the U.S. by United Nations officials and spent months or years in third-party countries undergoing interviews, as well as security and medical checks, before being granted entry into the U.S. The process is distinct from the asylum system, which can be accessed by foreigners already on American soil, including those who enter the U.S. illegally.",
      "Over the past decades, most of those admitted into the U.S. as refugees have come from countries in Africa and Asia plagued by war, ethnic strife or repression of minority groups, State Department figures show.",

    "summary": "President Trump's call to terminate the filibuster could alter the ways the Senate and congressional dealmaking operate.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is calling on the Senate to scrap the filibuster, so that the Republican majority can bypass Democrats and reopen the federal government.",
      "\"THE CHOICE IS CLEAR \u2014 INITIATE THE 'NUCLEAR OPTION,' GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER,\" Trump posted Thursday night on his social media site, Truth Social.",
      "The filibuster is a long-standing tactic in the Senate to delay or block votes on legislation by keeping the debate running. It requires 60 votes in a full Senate to overcome a filibuster, giving Democrats a check on the 53-seat Republican majority that led to the start of the Oct. 1 shutdown when the new fiscal year began.",
      "Mr. Trump's call to terminate the filibuster could alter the ways the Senate and congressional dealmaking operate, with the president saying in his post that he gave a \"great deal\" of thought to the choice on his flight back from Asia on Thursday.",
      "\"Leader Thune's position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged,\" Ryan Wrasse, a spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader John Thune, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Thune has previously stated he is in favor of upholding the filibuster, saying earlier this month that it has \"been a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening to the country.\"",
      "The Senate adjourned on Thursday and is not schedule to meet again until Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump spent the past week with foreign leaders in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, where he met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",
      "The president declared the trip a success because of a trade truce with China and foreign investment planned for American industries, but he said one question kept coming up during his time there about why did \"powerful Republicans allow\" the Democrats to shut down parts of the government.",
      "His call to end the filibuster came at a moment when certain senators and House Speaker Mike Johnson believed it was time for the government shutdown to come to an end. It's unclear if lawmakers will follow Mr. Trump's lead, rather than finding ways to negotiate with Democrats.",
      "From coast to coast, fallout from a shuttered federal government is hitting home: Alaskans are stockpiling moose, caribou and fish for winter, even before SNAP food aid is scheduled to shut off. Mainers are filling up their home-heating oil tanks, but waiting on the federal subsidies that are nowhere in sight.",
      "Flights are being delayed with holiday travel around the corner. Workers are going without paychecks. And Americans are getting a first glimpse of the skyrocketing health care insurance costs that are at the center of the stalemate on Capitol Hill.",
      "\"People are stressing,\" said Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as food options in her state grow scarce.",
      "\"We are well past time to have this behind us.\"",
      "While quiet talks are underway, particularly among bipartisan senators, the shutdown is not expected to end before Saturday's deadline when Americans' deep food insecurity \u2014 one in eight people depend on the government to have enough to eat \u2014 could become starkly apparent if federal SNAP funds run dry.",

    "summary": "Republican Jack Ciattarelli has a shot at winning 2025 New Jersey governor's race against Mikie Sherrill, after Democrats have held the office for two terms.",
    "story": [
      "New Jersey Republican Jack Ciattarelli may have a chance in the race against Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill to win back the governor's office from Democrats after a surprisingly close election four years ago.",
      "But a national political environment that may serve as a referendum on Republican President Trump's first year in office could close that window for the GOP.",
      "Mr. Trump has supported Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, and backed him as he faced a competitive primary, even going as far as to hold a telephone rally for him recently. Ciattarelli is running for governor for a third time, after falling short in a surprisingly close race against Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in 2021.",
      "Sherrill says Ciattarelli has shown \"zero signs of standing up\" to Trump",
      "On the Democratic side, Sherrill, who represents New Jersey's 11th District in Congress, has a favorable national political environment, but is contending with potential political fatigue within the state about her party's back-to-back terms controlling the governor's office. Sherrill has been adamant about tying Ciattarelli to President Trump and focusing her campaign on affordability.",
      "\"He's shown zero signs of standing up to this president. In fact, the president himself called Jack 100% MAGA,\" Sherrill said during a debate.",
      "Ciattarelli faults Democrats for being \"out of touch and ruining our state\"",
      "Ciattarelli has faulted Sherrill for relying on generalities and platitudes while also centering his argument for change on New Jersey Democrats' lengthy tenure in control of state government.",
      "\"Trenton Democrats: out of touch and ruining our state. They push offshore wind while our electric bills skyrocket. They raise tolls and fees but haven't fixed our roads and they care more about pronouns than property taxes,\" Ciattarelli said in one campaign advertisement. \"Had enough? Me too.\"",
      "Sherrill was not the most progressive candidate in this year's New Jersey primary race, and she may also have to contend with the Democratic brand issues that have haunted national Democrats in the wake of 2024, due to her career in Congress.",
      "Democrats' winning streak in the state could also give Republicans an anti-incumbency argument, and it wasn't long ago that a Republican led the state. From the 1970s onwards, neither party has been able to win the New Jersey governor's race three straight times.",
      "The final stretch",
      "Sherrill is getting campaign support before Election Day from former President Barack Obama, in another signal of the importance the contest has for a party still facing a vacuum of leadership at the national level. And Mr. Trump held a tele-rally for Ciattarelli before Election Day, as Republicans look to return a GOP candidate to the governor's office for the first time since Chris Christie led the state.",
      "Back in 2021, Ciattarelli narrowly lost the New Jersey governor's race to incumbent Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy. The race, occurring early in Democratic President Joe Biden's tenure, was far closer than was expected, given the state's more reliable Democratic lean, with Murphy winning out over Ciattarelli by around three points.",
      "In a close race, New Jersey's Latino voters may also play an influential role for either candidate. Democrats have a voter registration advantage over Republicans in the state, although their numbers have dipped as of late. Statistics show that since the start of the year the number of registered Democrats in New Jersey has fallen by more than 12,000 but remains above 2.5 million in the state. Republican voter registration has grown by close to 29,000 but still trails Democrats by more than 855,000, with around 1.67 million registered to the GOP. Unaffiliated voters still make up a larger share of the state's voters than the GOP and only narrowly trail the Democratic party's numbers.",

    "story": [
      "The government shutdown has dragged on for more than four weeks, and there are no signs that Congress will resolve the impasse soon, as members of both parties continue to blame each other and push their opponents to fold.",
      "Senate Democrats want to extend a slate of expiring health insurance subsidies in exchange for their votes to reopen the government, but Republicans have pressed to end the shutdown with no strings attached before negotiating on health care. Meanwhile, thousands of federal employees are missing out on paychecks, and tens of millions of food aid recipients are set to lose their benefits starting this weekend.",
      "With both sides still dug in, CBS News spoke with lawmakers and politicians about what they're doing to resolve the second-longest funding lapse in modern U.S. history.",
      "Schumer: \"There will be increased pressure on Republicans\"",

      "Open enrollment for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act begins on Nov. 1, which is when the disappearance of enhanced Biden-era insurance subsidies could first show up for many American households.",
      "\"On November 1,\" Schumer told CBS News on Tuesday, \"people in more than 30 states are going to be aghast when they see their bills and they're going to cry out, and I believe there will be increased pressure on Republicans to negotiate with us.\"",
      "Vance: \"We just need five more reasonable Democrats\"",
      "During a visit to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Vice President JD Vance put the onus on Senate Democrats to vote to end the shutdown.  \"We just need five more reasonable Democrats to do what the American people want us to do, to open up the government,\" he told reporters.",
      "In recent weeks, two moderate Democrats, Sens. John Fetterman and Catherine Cortez Masto, and an independent, Sen. Angus King, have voted with almost all Republicans in favor of a House-passed stopgap measure that would extend government funding at existing levels until mid-November, allowing the shutdown to end.",
      "But that bill is still five votes short of the 60-vote threshold needed to pass the Senate, and after more than a dozen rounds of voting, no additional Democrats have budged.",

      "Jeffries also blasted the Trump administration over the expected end to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits on Saturday, saying Republicans \"can't find a dime to make sure that 42 million Americans, including 16 million children, don't go hungry.\"",
      "Democrats have suggested tapping into a $5 billion contingency fund to keep SNAP benefits flowing, but Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins told CBS News the agency doesn't have the legal authority to use that money.",
      "Lummis: Democrats are in control",

      "\"I have voted over 13 times to open the government with a clean continuing resolution, and when the Democrats were in control, I voted to open the government with a clean continuing resolution,\" said Lummis, who also noted that she's supported piecemeal bills to fund parts of the government. \"So the question you're asking should be asked of the Democrats, because they are in control of how this goes.\"",
      "Raskin: Republicans should return to D.C.",
      "Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland took a swipe at House Republicans, who have kept the chamber out of session since the shutdown began.",
      "\"Everything we've been doing here, and the whole reason that we're in Washington, even though the Republicans are not, is to demand that they come back, reopen the government, restore health care to everybody, and get past this crisis,\" Raskin said.",
      "House GOP leaders argue they don't need to return because the chamber has already passed a continuing resolution to keep the government open, and it's up to the Senate to follow suit.",
      "Raskin represents scores of federal workers in the D.C. suburbs who have faced missed paychecks and the threat of layoffs during the shutdown. He said he's \"fighting to oppose all the violations of the rights of federal workers, to make sure that people are paid fairly, and people are not fired unfairly outside of the requirements of the civil service.\"",
      "Hawley: \"This has reached the point of insanity\"",

      "The senator has called for Congress to pass his standalone bill to restore funding for SNAP benefits. He said he's \"available to talk to anybody who wants to talk on any subject.\" Senate Democrats have also introduced a measure to fully fund SNAP and WIC, the Women, Children and Infants nutritional program, for the duration of the shutdown.",

    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date.

      "With the Senate out of town, the government shutdown is almost certain to extend through at least Monday, as millions of Americans begin to feel its effects. Among them are those who rely on Head Start, a free early childhood development program for low-income families.",
      "The Southwestern Wisconsin Community Action Program is shuttering nine Head Start centers in early November because of the shutdown. A program in Richland Center, Wisconsin, is closing its doors Friday. Stephanie Wallace, who has taught at the center for 13 years and has now been temporarily laid off, said goodbye to her students this week.",
      "\"Some of the kids already knew,\" she said. \"We told them, you know, we're not going to see you for a little bit.\"",
      "According to the National Head Start Association, approximately 140 Head Start programs nationwide, serving roughly 65,000 children, will stop receiving federal funding beginning Nov. 1. In addition to educational support, Head Start also provides screenings, health and dental care and nutrition for children from low-income families.",
      "Tawny Hardyman, the director of Southwest CAP Head Start, told CBS News, \"I think families are going to feel like the rug is being yanked out from underneath them.\"",
      "Jennie Mauer, the executive director of the Wisconsin Head Start Association, ran through the broader implications of the government funding pause.",
      "\"In Wisconsin, we know that the majority of our Head Start Families are working in our communities, and when parents don't have safe child care, they struggle to get to work,\" Mauer said, adding, \"These Head Start programs are cornerstones of their local communities \u2014 helping folks get to work, employing people and spending money with local trades.\"",
      "Roughly 75% of the families at the Richland Center facility also rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps. Community organizers say losing child care and food assistance at the same time could compound the challenges faced by low-income families during the government shutdown. SNAP benefits are set to expire Saturday, although half the states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration this week to stop its\u00a0suspension.",
      "\"Hunger in our community will go up 100%,\" said Chris Frakes, the senior director of the Southwest Wisconsin Community Action Program. \"So, we're doing what we can to make sure that we don't have kids who aren't eating for days on end.\"",
      "Senators have taken over a dozen failed votes on funding the government, but left Washington, D.C., for the weekend. This essentially guarantees the 2025 shutdown will last at least 34 days, tying the record for the longest shutdown ever. Republicans and Democrats are blaming each other for the impasse.",
      "Asked by CBS News whether the Senate should be leaving town now, with SNAP benefits expiring, GOP Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa replied, \"Well, we would love the Democrats to open the government.\"",
      "President Trump has an idea for ending the standoff, telling Senate Republicans in a social media post Thursday to \"play their TRUMP CARD\" and go \"nuclear\" \u2014 that is, to \"get rid of the Filibuster.\"",
      "The Senate requires only a simple majority to pass most legislation, but its filibuster rule effectively requires nearly all legislation \u2014 including the continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government \u2014 to reach a 60-vote threshold first. A single senator may delay a bill during debate by invoking a filibuster, which can only be ended if 60 senators vote to end debate.",
      "Eliminating the filibuster rule would only require a simple majority, and it would enable Republicans to approve the House-passed continuing resolution without Democrats and reopen the government. But most GOP senators have long been opposed to doing away with the 60-vote threshold, arguing that it encourages bipartisan compromise.",
      "Democrats have their eyes on yet another key deadline this weekend: Open enrollment begins for the Affordable Care Act, and it could show soaring health insurance premiums for the 24 million Americans who buy their health insurance through the program. Democrats are betting that sticker shock will bring Republicans back to negotiations to extend expiring tax credits that offset the insurance costs.",
      "So far, Republicans have said Democrats must vote to open the government first.",

    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A coalition of officials from half of the states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration on Tuesday over the suspension of food stamp benefits amid the ongoing government shutdown, as millions of Americans brace for a disruption in federal food aid in the coming days.",
      "The states, which include California, New York and Pennsylvania, are asking a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the Department of Agriculture to provide benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\u00a0for November, including by tapping into a contingency fund to ensure the assistance continues to flow to more than 25 million people living within their borders.",
      "They argue that the administration's decision to cut off food stamp payments, which are provided to roughly 42 million people nationwide, is unlawful and threatens to deprive millions of Americans of essential food benefits that help protect against food insecurity and hunger.",
      "\"Shutting off SNAP benefits will cause deterioration of public health and well-being,\" state officials wrote in their lawsuit. \"Ultimately, the States will bear costs associated with many of these harms. The loss of SNAP benefits leads to food insecurity, hunger, and malnutrition, which are associated with numerous negative health outcomes in children, such as poor concentration, decreased cognitive function, fatigue, depression, and behavioral problems.\"",
      "The states involved in the suit are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania,\u202fRhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.",
      "As the government shutdown continues to drag on, the Trump administration announced last week that federal food aid would not go out on Nov. 1 after the Department of Agriculture declined to tap into roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits through the food stamp program flowing.",
      "The agency blamed Democrats for failing to back a House-passed stopgap bill to fund the government, writing on its website that \"the well has run dry.\"",
      "\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats,\" a spokesperson for the USDA said in response to the lawsuit. \"Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments.\"",
      "The agency's plan for a lapse in funding, issued Sept. 30, said that multi-year contingency funds could be used for state administrative expenses to ensure states could continue SNAP operations during a shutdown and were also available \"to fund participant benefits in the event\" of a funding lapse.",
      "But a memo from the USDA issued last week said \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits\" and are instead meant for things like assisting people in disaster areas. The document cited Hurricane Melissa, which made landfall Tuesday in Jamaica as one of the strongest Atlantic storms ever recorded.",
      "Still, state officials argued in their lawsuit that the USDA's claim that the contingency funds can't be used to fund food benefits during a lapse in federal funding violates the text of congressional appropriations law and is a \"dramatic change\" in its own policy.",
      "They noted that during the last shutdown, USDA said in guidance in January 2019 that said that \"limited funding is available from the contingency that can be used to provide benefits for February.\"",
      "\"Millions of Americans are about to go hungry because the federal government has chosen to withhold food assistance it is legally obligated to provide,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. \"SNAP is one of our nation's most effective tools to fight hunger, and the USDA has the money to keep it running. There is no excuse for this administration to abandon families who rely on SNAP, or food stamps, as a lifeline. The federal government must do its job to protect families.\"",
      "The Trump administration has attempted to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to reopen the government, announcing cancellations of federal funding for programs in blue states and issuing layoff-notices to thousands of federal workers.",
      "The ongoing shutdown, which is in its 28th day, is now the second-longest on record.",
      "Ahead of the approaching halt to food stamp payments, some states have said they will work to keep the assistance going to beneficiaries. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans receive food stamps, and recipients receive, on average, a payment of $187 on prepaid cards that can be used to buy groceries.",
      "The impending lapse in food stamps has raised concerns among Republicans and Democrats. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced legislation last week that aims to ensure continued funding for the food assistance program during the shutdown. The plan has garnered support from 10 other Republican senators and Democratic Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont.",
      "Democrats have separately urged Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to use the agency's reserve funds to help cover food stamp benefits next month, though she has declined to do so.",

These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

    "summary": "The United Nations human rights chief says the Trump administration \"must halt\" strikes on alleged drug boats to prevent \"extrajudicial killing.\"",
    "story": [
      "Geneva \u2014\u00a0The United Nations human rights chief said Friday that U.S. military strikes against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean allegedly carrying illegal drugs from South America are \"unacceptable\" and must stop.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T\u00fcrk called for an investigation into the strikes, in what appeared to mark the first such condemnation of its kind from a U.N. organization.",
      "Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for T\u00fcrk's office, relayed his message on Friday at a regular U.N. briefing: \"These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable. The U.S. must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.\"",
      "She said T\u00fcrk believed \"airstrikes by the United States of America on boats in the Caribbean and in the Pacific violate international human rights law.\"",
      "President Trump has justified the attacks on what his administration calls \"narco-trafficking vessels\" as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the U.S., but the campaign against drug cartels has been divisive among countries in the region.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the latest U.S. military strike in the campaign on Wednesday. He said it targeted a boat carrying drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Four people on board the vessel were killed. It was the 14th strike and the 15th boat destroyed since the campaign began in early September, while the death toll has grown to at least 61.",
      "In some but not all of the strikes, U.S. officials have said\u00a0the boats were linked to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which the Trump administration has designated a terrorist organization.",
      "The administration announced just weeks ago that it had determined the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations, including Tren de Aargua.",
      "The administration announced that determination in a notification to Congress in September, after the first couple strikes on alleged drug boats in the Mediterranean. That notice referred to three individuals killed in a Sept. 15 strike as \"unlawful combatants,\" which is the same term former President George W. Bush's administration used to describe members of al-Qaeda and other terrorist networks.",
      "After Sept. 11, 2001, the U.S. Congress authorized the use of military force against the terrorist organizations responsible for the terrorist attacks carried out that day. Congress has not yet authorized the use of military force to target drug cartels, and many details of the operations remain unclear, including which U.S. forces are carrying out the strikes, based on what specific intelligence, and with what weapons.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro has been among the most vocal critics of the strikes, questioning their legality under international law, and their efficacy in combating the gangs that traffic narcotics during an interview with CBS News. The Trump administration sanctioned Petro last week, saying he had allowed \"drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.\"",
      "Shamdasani noted the U.S. explanations of the efforts as an anti-drug and counter-terrorism campaign, but said countries have long agreed that the fight against illicit drug trafficking is a law-enforcement matter governed by \"careful limits\" placed on the use of lethal force.",
      "Intentional use of lethal force is allowed only as a last resort against someone representing \"an imminent threat to life,\" she said. \"Otherwise, it would amount to a violation of the right of life and constitute extrajudicial killings.\"",
      "The strikes are taking place \"outside the context\" of armed conflict or active hostilities, Shamdasani said.",

    "summary": "The 2025 governor's race between Spanberger and Earle-Sears offers both parties a chance to start charting a path forward after last year's 2024 presidential election.",
    "story": [
      "This fall's race for Virginia governor offers Democrats a chance to start recovering from stinging losses in last year's presidential election.",
      "It also brings the risk that the party could slip further into the doldrums that hurt its brand with voters around the country in 2024.",
      "The Nov. 4 elections for governor of Virginia \u2014 pitting former Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger against Republican Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears \u2014 will serve as one of Democrats' first major opportunities to rebound from the setbacks they suffered in the 2024 presidential election, when they also lost control of the Senate and failed to retake control of the House.",
      "Spanberger to rally with Obama",
      "Spanberger is set to rally with former President Barack Obama on the weekend before Election Day. President Trump, however, has had little involvement as Earle-Sears looks to succeed Gov. Glenn Youngkin and become the first GOP candidate since 1997 to succeed a fellow Republican as governor of the commonwealth.",
      "Under Virginia law, a governor cannot serve for two consecutive terms, which has resulted in open races for the office without the advantage of incumbency. Regardless of who wins between the two in November, Spanberger or Earle-Sears will become the Commonwealth's first ever female governor.",
      "The Trump administration's impact on the federal workforce and the ongoing shutdown may also be on voters' minds in the coming days, as they get their say in a contest that historically has been fraught with prospect of serving as a rebuke to the incumbent in the White House.",
      "\"It is because of the trade wars and the retaliatory tariff policies and the attack on Virginia, our economy and our people, that we recognize the possibility of November 4, that we recognize how important it is to have a governor who will stand up for Virginians,\" Spanberger said at a recent event.",
      "State of the race",
      "Spanberger headed into the start of early voting in September with a clear advantage in the contest. That momentum threatened to be impacted, however, by a controversy that has made its way through Virginia politics. She has faced difficult political questions in attempting to respond to violent text messages, authored by Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee in the Virginia Attorney General's race, about a Republican leader.",
      "\"I'm asking my opponent to please, ask him to get out of the race,\" Earle-Sears said during the lone debate between the two candidates. \"Have some political courage. What you have done is you are taking political calculations about your future as governor. Well as governor, you have to make hard choices, and that means telling Jay Jones to leave the race.\"",
      "Spanberger has denounced Jones' words, which were made public after the start of early voting, where he wrote in the past about a fantasy hypothetical situation involving the shooting of a Virginia state House Republican leader.",
      "Jones however has not left the race, and is still running as the Democratic attorney general candidate in the Nov. 4 election.",
      "That dynamic has provided Virginia Republicans with an issue against Democrats that could alienate moderates and independents at a time where concerns about political violence are rampant. Virginia Democrats are also mounting a last-minute effort to redraw congressional districts in the state to help the left counter Mr. Trump's successful push in a series of red states to undertake an overhaul of district maps in hopes of helping Republicans hold on to the House in next year's midterm elections.",

No documents formalizing the agreements have been released yet, however.",
      "Mr. Trump also said he would trim fentanyl-related tariffs on China. These moves should ease tensions between the two superpowers for now, though the president did not mention any long-term deals had been reached.",

      "Tariff rates on imports from China",
      "Mr. Trump said he agreed to reduce tariffs on Chinese goods by 10%, which he said would bring the rate from 57% to 47%. The president told reporters he expects to sign an agreement on trade \"pretty soon,\" although he also said he's likely to renegotiate it in future years.",
      "The president said he's easing tariffs because China pledged to work with him on the deadly fentanyl crisis. China is the world's largest exporter of the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl, which has been a longstanding complaint of the president. Levying 47% tariffs on Chinese imports would still mean China has one of the highest tariff rates.",

      "Soybeans have been a serious point of contention between the U.S. and China, after China, typically the largest buyer of U.S. soybeans, stopped buying them altogether as a rebuke of Mr. Trump's tariff regime.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business on Thursday that China has pledged to return to regular levels of soybean purchases each year for the next three years, and that China agreed to purchase 12 million metric tons of soybeans this season.",
      "No paper deal on TikTok",
      "Mr. Trump did not make any announcements about a finalized agreement to keep TikTok running in the U.S., although Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said they received Chinese approval of a deal to transfer ownership of the company, so it's no longer under the umbrella of a Chinese company. Still, Bessent said the matter would be resolved in the coming weeks or months.",
      "\"In Kuala Lumpur, we finalized the TikTok agreement in terms of getting Chinese approval,\" Bessent said on Fox Business. \"And I would expect that that would go forward in the coming weeks and months, and we'll finally see a resolution to that.\"",
      "On Sunday, Bessent told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the administration was close to a deal to separate TikTok from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, and that Mr. Trump and Xi would sign something Thursday. No announcement on this came after the meeting, though.",
      "CBS News has asked the Treasury Department for clarification on Bessent's remarks about securing Chinese approval.",
      "\"China will work with the U.S. to properly resolve issues related to TikTok,\" China's Commerce Ministry said after the meeting, the Associated Press reported.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly delayed enforcing a law Congress passed banning TikTok from operating in the U.S. as long as it's operating under its China-based parent company, and the Supreme Court upheld that ban.",
      "On chips",
      "Mr. Trump said he and Xi \"did discuss chips,\" and Xi would be \"talking with Nvidia and others. Mr. Trump said he'd speak with Nvidia CEO Jensen Hugan, as China seeks to buy U.S.-made chips.",
      "The president said whether China purchases chips from Nvidia is largely up to Nvidia and Beijing, after the U.S. imposed restrictions on China's purchase of U.S.-made chips, citing national security reasons. Chips could be used to promote China's military and artificial intelligence capabilities.",
      "\"I said that's going to be between you and Nvidia, but we're sort of the arbitrator and the referee,\" Mr. Trump said.",

      "The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation Inc., which is a separate entity from the Black Lives Matter protest movement, has long been accused by right-wing critics of not being transparent enough with how it spends its donations. Part of that criticism came when the group used more than $6 million to buy a house in Los Angeles.",
      "The group defended the purchase in a 2022 post on its website, writing that the house \"serves as a space for Black folks to share their gifts with the world and hone their craft as they see fit, under the conditions that work best for them and in a safe space free from systems of oppression that exist in various creative industries.\"",
      "The national Black Lives Matter foundation raised more than $90 million in 2020, the organization disclosed in a 2020 report. The group had over $28 million in assets as of June 2024, according to recent financial disclosures.",
      "It is unclear specifically when the investigation into Black Lives Matter was launched, but it is being run out of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, which handles cases in or near Los Angeles, the source said.",
      "The Associated Press was first to report the existence of an investigation into the nonprofit foundation.",
      "In a statement, Black Lives Matter said that it \"is not a target of any federal criminal investigation.\"",
      "\"We remain committed to full transparency, accountability, and the responsible stewardship of resources dedicated to building a better future for Black communities,\" the group continued.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump directed the Pentagon on Wednesday to resume testing of nuclear weapons \"on an equal basis\" with other countries' tests, possibly ending a decades-long U.S. pause that stretches back to the end of the Cold War.",
      "The announcement came moments before Mr. Trump walked into a high-stakes meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea.",
      "\"Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,\" the president wrote on Truth Social, using his administration's preferred term for the Defense Department. \"That process will begin immediately.\"",
      "It's not clear when or if the military will carry out a test, or what the president meant by restarting tests \"on an equal basis.\"",
      "The U.S. conducted its last nuclear weapons test in Nevada in 1992. President George H.W. Bush then imposed a moratorium on testing in the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union, according to the National Nuclear Security Administration.",
      "China has not tested a nuclear weapon since 1996, and Russia \u2014 or the then-Soviet Union \u2014 hasn't carried out such a test since 1990, though Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday his country had tested a new nuclear-powered drone, which came shortly after a test of a new nuclear-capable and powered cruise missile.",
      "But China has rapidly expanded its nuclear arsenal in recent years, a trend that the Pentagon expects to continue for the rest of the decade.",
      "Mr. Trump's meeting with Xi is expected to primarily focus on trade and tariffs, but security concerns still lurk in the U.S.-China relationship.",
      "The U.S. military is discussing a missile launch this week in a \"show of force\" against recent Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, CBS News reported earlier Wednesday. And some Trump allies have encouraged the U.S. president to recognize Taiwanese independence, a move that Beijing has long viewed as unacceptable.",

    "story": [
      "A former high-ranking homeland security official in the first Trump administration is launching a new online hub Wednesday to facilitate protests and other resistance efforts against President Trump and his policies.",
      "Miles Taylor, a former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, is leading a group of dozens of former national security officials, whistleblowers and a bipartisan group of former elected officials to create a website called defiance.org.",
      "In its mission statement, the bipartisan group says the tool is \"designed to help Americans push back peacefully, lawfully, and defiantly against presidential abuses of power.\"",
      "Taylor told CBS News, \"There are many organizations and a million efforts, but there has not been a clearinghouse for people who regularly seek ways to engage. This is a 'Google' for defiance, where people can go to see their options to push back lawfully, peacefully and defiantly.\"",
      "In September 2018, Taylor wrote an anonymous opinion piece in the New York Times that said there was a \"quiet resistance\" to President Trump within his own administration, made up of people \"working diligently\" to block what he called the president's \"worst inclinations.\" He disclosed two years later that he had written the op-ed.",
      "The announcement of the new site is intended to capitalize on momentum from the October \"No Kings\" rallies earlier this month, which attracted participants across the country.",
      "The site launched Wednesday with a video of actor Robert DeNiro, a staunch Trump critic, urging protesters and critics to join forces.",
      "\"You can't just sit on your ass and wait for the insanity and cruelty to pass. No,\" DeNiro says in the video. \"You gotta stand up and fight.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement, \"Further proof that Miles Taylor's entire identity is being a TDS clown. If he actually cared about workers being paid and families receiving benefits, he would urge Democrats to reopen the government \u2013 just like the President has been doing. Democrats could end the shutdown today but Myles (sic) is too blinded by his TDS rage to accept the truth.\" (\"TDS\" is often used by Mr. Trump and his supporters as an initialism for \"Trump Derangement Syndrome,\" a phrase describing some of his critics)",
      "In April, Mr. Trump signed an executive memo targeting Taylor, accusing him of manufacturing stories to sell a book, and ordered DHS, the Justice Department and other government agencies to investigate him and revoke his security clearances, as well as for those who worked closely with him. Mr. Trump also ordered an investigation into the alleged dissemination of classified documents while Taylor worked for the government. Taylor denies he leaked any such material.",
      "Defiance.org is described in its mission statement as a \"nationwide 'mutual aid' pact to defend those under attack.\" It aims to support nonprofit partners, and says it will join \"peaceful protests and legal defense efforts.\"",
      "Taylor told CBS News supporters of the effort include Stephanie Grisham, a press secretary from the first Trump administration, and former aide Olivia Troye, both of whom have become vocal critics of the president.",
      "Dozens of former elected leaders and Trump critics, including former Republican congressmen Reid Ribble, Denver Riggleman and Joe Walsh, are also supporting the new portal.",
      "Taylor said the mutual aid feature of the portal is intended to help those targeted by the administration. He said a future effort could include rallying legal, political and community leaders to support Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who is under investigation by the Justice Department, if he is charged. Taylor said the Defiance.org hub would be used to galvanize and organize legal help, courthouse supporters and public statements in support of Schiff or against the Trump administration.",
      "Riggleman told CBS News the group would seek to \"protect Americans against political overreach and targeted retaliation.\"",
      "The White House has harshly criticized Taylor in the past, including in this statement in April.",
      "\"While serving as an administrative staff assistant at the Department of Homeland Security, Taylor stoked dissension by manufacturing sensationalist reports on the existence of a supposed 'resistance' within the federal government that 'vowed' to undermine and render effective (sic) a sitting President,\" the White House said.",

    "summary": "The discovery \"rewrites decades of research on Earth's most famous predator,\" the study's co-author said.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have long puzzled over the origins of a mysterious dinosaur excavated in the 1940s: Was it a young T. rex or another type of dinosaur?",
      "At first, researchers had only a tyrannosaur skull to go by, making it hard to tell if it belonged to a child or adult. Another skull and skeleton nicknamed Jane added to the debate, but didn't settle the controversy.",
      "Now, a research team says new evidence resolves the case. The latest clue comes from a complete skeleton \u2014 first uncovered in Montana in 2006 \u2014 that scientists say identifies the mystery reptile as its own species and not a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex.",
      "The discovery \"rewrites decades of research on Earth's most famous predator,\" said study co-author Lindsay Zanno with the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and North Carolina State University.",
      "Growth rings within the bones found in Montana's Hell Creek Formation told scientists the new dinosaur was an adult about half the size of a fully fledged T. rex. From growth comparisons to other reptiles like crocodiles, they also found that the major differences between the creature's skull and an adult T. rex's \u2014 changes in bone structure, nerve patterns and sinuses \u2014 were unlikely to form from simply going through puberty.",
      "Signs pointed to a dinosaur that's a distant T. rex cousin known as Nanotyrannus lancensis, the researchers reported in a study published Thursday in the journal Nature, calling it a rival species.",
      "\"Nanotyrannus is a small-bodied predator designed for speed. It's very agile and has long powerful arms [that are] larger than those of the T. rex,\"\u00a0Zanno told Nature.",
      "There's now \"more support and evidence than there ever has been\" that this T. rex relative could exist, said Holly Woodward, a fossil bone expert from Oklahoma State University who had no role in the new study. But she's not yet convinced that the other mystery skeletons like Jane are something new.",
      "Case of mistaken identity",
      "Other independent scientists also said the debate isn't over. The new skeleton is indeed an adult, but it could be a sister species to T. rex and not a distant relative, said vertebrate paleontologist Thomas Carr of Carthage College.",
      "There are similarities between the shape of T. rex's skull and the mystery specimens that keep him from switching camps.",
      "\"I don't think this study settles everything,\" he said.",
      "Resolving this case of mistaken identity is important to understanding how T. rex grew up, said study co-author James Napoli with Stony Brook University. Another big question is whether T. rex was the main predator prowling toward the end of the age of dinosaurs 67 million years ago \u2014 or whether a tinier, but still mighty predator also roamed.",
      "\"I suspect that these two species would have occasionally come into conflict, as predators tend to do, but the long legs of Nanotyrannus, and its small size, suggest that it mostly hunted smaller, faster prey than Tyrannosaurus,\" Napoli told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The new skeleton is dubbed \"Dueling Dinosaurs\" because it was found intertwined with the bones of a Triceratops, and is currently on display at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.",
      "The study comes just days after new research suggested dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before the asteroid strike. The evidence came from analyzing a portion of the Kirtland Formation in northern New Mexico that's been known for around 100 years to contain several interesting dinosaur fossils.",
      "In June, scientists identified a smaller-bodied ancestor of the T. rex that roamed the plains of Mongolia as a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",

      "\"It was astronomical, and you don't know how many rounds you're going to need,\" Quinn said.",
      "With limited insurance coverage, the Florida couple started researching what's known as \"fertility tourism,\" where patients travel abroad for more affordable fertility care.",
      "Ricardo, who is originally from Colombia, found a clinic in the country's capital of Bogota offering a dramatic price difference\u2014a package of four IVF rounds in Colombia for $11,000 compared to around $60,000 for four rounds in the U.S. Medication costs were also less than half of those in the U.S.",
      "\"It's a no-brainer, especially because I'm from there,\" Escobar said. \"We found that the clinic had an excellent rating and really good results.\"",
      "At the clinic, called Inser, the couple met with Dr. Juan Luis Giraldo, who treats patients from around the world. He said nearly half of his clients come from outside Colombia, and about 15% are from the United States.",
      "\"From the U.S., they mainly come for two things,\" Giraldo said. \"The first is cost, and the second is personalized treatment. It's really common that patients there feel they don't have a close relationship with their doctor.\"",
      "The couple made several trips to Colombia, where their first IVF round produced four viable embryos. After multiple embryo transfers, Quinn became pregnant and gave birth to their son, Lorenzo, in 2023. They returned the following year for another round and are now expecting again.",
      "Quinn estimates they saved between $15,000 and $20,000 per round. Her flexible work schedule made the travel possible, and some bloodwork and ultrasounds were completed in Florida.",
      "Dr. Sangita Jindal, with the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, advises Americans pursuing fertility treatment abroad to carefully review local laws.",
      "\"I would want to know that there is a flexible legal framework that would allow me to bring my embryos back to the U.S. for transfer to my uterus,\" Jindal said. \"Some countries may have prohibitive laws around that.\"",
      "The global fertility-tourism market has grown by more than $50 million in the past year and is projected to reach $800 million by 2030.",
      "For Quinn and Escobar, who became pregnant again after two rounds of IVF, the journey has been more emotional.",

    "summary": "The Murray cod, named Arnie after Australia's recently retired Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus, was first tagged in 2022.",
    "story": [
      "An Australian freshwater Murray cod has surprised scientists by swimming a marathon 530 miles along a major river system, believed to be a record for the species.",
      "The fish, named Arnie after Australia's recently retired Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus, was first tagged in early 2022 in Mullaroo Creek, about a 13-hour drive west of Sydney, said Arthur Rylah Institute researcher Zeb Tonkin.",
      "Four years old and weighing in at 3.7 pounds at the time, it \"took off\" when floods hit the area in the spring of that year, Tonkin said, traveling an initial 470 miles upstream in fewer than two months.",
      "The scaly river dweller, an apex water predator, was able to cover longer distances because barriers had been removed along the Murray River to let flood waters pass through.",
      "\"It basically provided free passage for fish,\" said Tonkin.",
      "Arnie then turned around at some point in the past 12 months, swimming another 60 miles downstream toward home.",
      "Researchers only discovered the extent of the fish's travels when sharing data with colleagues a couple of weeks ago.",
      "\"We've been working on these species for decades ... and we haven't come across that sort of scale of movement beforehand,\" Tonkin said. \"Probably the best we have seen a Murray cod do is around 160 kilometers (100 miles).\"",
      "Understanding Murray cod allows researchers to adapt water flows to protect their environment, said Tonkin, whose institute is part of the state of Victoria's department of energy, environment and climate action.",
      "The fish \u2014 not related to ocean cod species \u2014 can live more than 48 years, grow to about 6 feet and weigh more than 180 pounds, according to the government's survey of Australian fish stocks.",
      "\"If we see this species breeding, growing well, migrating well, it's a pretty good indication that the ecosystem in general is pretty healthy,\" Tonkin said.",
      "The decade-long fish tagging project works closely with the Mallee Catchment Management Authority. It is funded by the state-financed Living Murray program, managed by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority.",
      "According to the Australian Museum, the Murray cod has a concave snout with a large mouth and small eyes. It preys on fish, mollusks, turtles and some small terrestrial animals, including birds, mammals and snakes.",
      "Murray cod are listed as \"vulnerable\" under Australia's Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The species' populations have declined dramatically, according to the Australian Museum, initially because of commercial fishing.",
      "\"More recently, overfishing, river degradation and human modification of the environment have caused major population declines,\" the museum says. \"Murray Cod are now relatively uncommon in most areas.\"",

      "Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center \u2014\u00a0China launched its Shenzhou-21 spacecraft on Friday, carrying a new three-person crew to man the country's Tiangong space station on a mission focused on scientific research. The replacement crew includes China's youngest-ever taikonaut \u2014 as China's space program calls its astronauts \u2014   and, for the first time since Beijing launched its program, it will also include live mammals.",
      "The Shenzhou-21 and its crew blasted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China atop a Long March-2F rocket just before midnight on Friday, or about 11 a.m. Eastern.",
      "The taikonauts on board \u2014 Zhang Lu, Wu Fei, and Zhang Hongzhang \u2014 will rotate in so the trio currently on board the Chinese space station from the Shenzhou-20 mission, which launched on April 24, can come back home after their six-months in space. The exact date of their return has yet to be announced.",
      "The Shenzhou-21 crew are scheduled to conduct a total of 27 scientific and applied research projects during their mission, focusing on multiple fields including space life sciences, biotechnology, space medicine, space materials science, microgravity fluid physics and combustion and new space technologies, according to information provided by the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).",
      "Along with the taikonauts, Shenzhou-21 is carrying four mice \u2014 two females and two males \u2014 the first live mammals ever carried by China into space. Two previous missions to the Tiangong station carried live fish.",
      "The taikonauts will study the effects of microgravity and confined space conditions on the behavioral patterns of mice.",
      "The Shenzhou-21 crew, with Lu as their commander are scheduled to live aboard the space station for approximately six months, just like the crew they are replacing.",
      "It won't be the first visit to the station for Lu, who previously served on the Shenzhou-15 mission.",
      "The other two crew members are making their first spaceflight, and Flight Engineer Wu, born in 1993, will be the youngest taikonaut ever sent into space by his nation.",
      "\"I feel incomparably lucky,\" he told reporters Thursday. \"Being able to integrate my personal dreams into the glorious journey of China's space program is the greatest fortune this era has bestowed upon me.\"",
      "Crowds gathered around the Jiuquan launch site on Friday ahead of the countdown, and a man who identified himself to CBS News only as Mr. Zhao said he was \"very excited\" to be there with his 7-year-old son, \"hoping to plant the seed of a space dream into his heart.\"",
      "China's growing \"space dream\"",
      "China has ramped up its space program unilaterally since being excluded from the International Space Station project \u2014   largely over the U.S. government's concerns about the Chinese military's full control over its program \u2014   to achieve its \"space dream\" under President Xi Jinping.",
      "It has manned the Tiangong station since 2021, and there are now plans to bring the first non-Chinese crewmember aboard the facility.",
      "China will arrange for one Pakistani national to undertake a short-term space mission in the future, the CMSA has said, following the signing of a cooperation agreement between the two countries in February.",
      "The process to select a Pakistani national for training has already begun, along with planning for training programs and to prepare logistical support for Pakistanis under consideration.",
      "Following the selection process, two Pakistani nationals will travel to China to train alongside Chinese taikonauts for future missions, the CMSA said.",
      "CMSA spokesperson Zhang Jingbo said during a news conference this week ahead of the Shenzhou-21 launch that China would welcome international partners to participate in missions aboard its space station.",
      "The work done on China's space station coincides with and often compliments the nation's efforts to be the first nation to land a person on the moon's surface in more than 40 years. Chinese officials have made it a public goal to land taikonauts on the moon's surface by 2030, and eventually to build a lunar base.",
      "China has already landed unmanned probes on the moon, including the first ever to land and collect samples from the celestial body's far side just last year.",
      "\"Overall, the research and construction has been running smoothly, with China aiming to achieve the goal of landing Chinese astronauts on the moon before 2030,\" Zhang said this week ahead of the looming Shenzhou launch, indicating that the CMSA remains on track to meet its lunar goals.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 14:05:38 -0400",
    "summary": "Elon Musk's partisan stances and foray into politics in recent years have dented the electric vehicle maker's business, Yale researchers say.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk is widely recognized as an electric car pioneer. Yet the Tesla CEO has also single-handedly chilled the automaker's sales, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at Yale University.",
      "Public controversy over Musk's role as leader of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), as well as his acquisition of social media platform Twitter (now known as X) in 2022, reduced Tesla's sales by up to 1.2 million vehicles over a three-year period, the researchers estimated in a working paper published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research that aimed to measure the effect of Musk's politics on Tesla's business.",
      "\"This study highlights just how impactful a CEO's partisan actions can be,\" the researchers wrote. \"We show that Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization, had a dramatic effect on Tesla sales due to his politically partisan activities unrelated to Tesla's core business.\"",
      "Musk's adverse impact on Tesla's business became visible starting in mid-2022, with sales especially dropping in Democratic-leaning states and counties, the study further concludes.",
      "\"Musk's actions antagonized his most loyal customer base, for, as we show, Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to purchase a Tesla,\" the researchers said.",
      "The study's lead author is energy and environmental economist Kenneth Gillingham, who is the senior associate dean of academic affairs at the Yale School of the Environment. His research focuses on consumer behavior and policy in the transportation and energy sectors.",
      "Musk announced in May that he was pulling back from DOGE, which the Trump administration formed to shrink the federal government and cut spending.",
      "Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the paper's findings.",
      "Musk's foray into politics and emergence as a prominent adviser to President Trump early in his second term raised the entrepreneur's visibility but alienated some potential Tesla customers, Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, previously told CBS News.",
      "Tesla last week reported third-quarter earnings of $1.4 billion, down 37% from the year-ago period, citing higher costs and tariff-related headwinds. Tesla's vehicle sales fell 1% in 2024 despite a 7% increase in EV sales across the car industry.",
      "Tesla's stock fell 27% in February, a period of time that coincided with Mr. Trump's first full month in the White House. But the shares have rebounded and are now up roughly 14% on the year, with investors betting on growth in the company's fledgling robotaxi business, autonomous driving technology and plans to build AI-powered humanoid robots.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\"\u00a0Wedbush Securities technology analyst Dan Ives said in a recent report, adding that he expects the Trump administration to fast-track such initiatives.",
      "Another measure of Musk's perceived value to Tesla is the enormous pay package shareholders are preparing to vote on for the executive. That total package could be worth up to $1 trillion in a decade, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history.",
      "For Musk to earn the full amount, Tesla would have to hit certain profitability and production targets, as well as reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion \u2014 nearly six times its current value \u2014 in 10 years.",
      "Robyn Denholm, chairman of Tesla's board of directors, is urging shareholders to approve Musk's proposed compensation. \"Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become: a transformative force reimagining the fundamental building blocks of mobility, energy and labor,\"\u00a0 Denholm said in the letter.",

      "Amazon is \"investing quite expansively\" in generative AI technology, Jassy said earlier this year. The the company has plans to invest $10 billion in a new AI \"innovation campus\" in North Carolina.

    "story": [
      "Daylight saving time is coming to an end for 2025. This Sunday, Nov. 2, clocks \"fall back\" and we gain an hour. Here's what to know about the seasonal time change.",
      "When does the time change for the end of daylight saving 2025?",
      "Daylight saving time comes to an end on Sunday, Nov. 2, at 2 a.m., when the time goes back to 1 a.m.",
      "Daylight saving time\u00a0began last spring\u00a0on March 9. Clocks will \"spring forward\" next year on March 8, 2026, when daylight saving time returns.",
      "Do we lose or gain an hour when daylight saving time ends?",
      "People will gain an hour as clocks fall back on Sunday. For most Americans, that means an extra hour of sleep.",
      "Many digital clocks will automatically reset overnight, but remember to change any watches or clocks that need to be manually adjusted.",
      "After the time change, darkness will arrive earlier in the evening, and sunrise in the morning will also come earlier.",
      "Why was daylight saving created in the first place?",
      "Annual clock changes have been around for decades, but the origins of the practice remain something of a mystery. People have pointed toward farmers wanting more daylight or cited various proponents of getting up earlier in the day, but some of those theories are disputed.",
      "Germany began observing daylight saving time in 1916 during World War I, with the thought that it would save energy. Other European countries and the U.S. followed suit in the next few years.",
      "There was some debate around the practice in the decades that followed, but eventually, daylight saving time was enacted in the U.S. as a legal requirement by the Uniform Time Act of 1966, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.",
      "Which states don't do daylight saving time?",
      "While clocks will change for most of the U.S., there are two states and several territories that do not observe daylight saving time. Clocks will not change in Hawaii or Arizona (except for in Navajo Nation), American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to the Department of Transportation, which oversees the nation's time zones",
      "States can opt out of observing daylight saving time, but they cannot choose to permanently be on daylight saving time.",
      "Most countries around the world do not observe daylight saving, with the U.S. and most of Europe being the exception rather than the rule, according to Pew Research Center. Among countries that do change their clocks, most of them rolled back an hour in October, according to timeanddate.com.",
      "The debate over daylight saving time today",
      "A 2022 CBS News/YouGov poll found that nearly 80% of Americans supported changing the current system, with more Americans preferring daylight saving time to standard time.",
      "That same year, the Senate passed a bill called the Sunshine Protection Act that would have made daylight saving time permanent, but it never advanced in the House of Representatives.",
      "President Trump, before his return to office for his second term, said he'd push to eliminate the time change.",
      "\"The Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate Daylight Saving Time, which has a small but strong constituency, but shouldn't! Daylight Saving Time is inconvenient, and very costly to our Nation,\" he wrote on Truth Social in December of last year.",
      "While his December comment called for the elimination of daylight saving time, Mr. Trump has, in the past, called for permanent daylight saving \u2014 that is, keeping clocks shifted one hour ahead.",
      "There have been a number of studies finding that changing clocks twice a year can be disruptive for people's health. In addition to impacting mood and mental health,\u00a0researchers at Stanford Medicine this year said that falling back and springing forward may lead to an increase in heart attacks, obesity and strokes.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-mamdani-talk-as-election-day-approaches-new-york-city-mayors-race/",
    "published": "Sat, 01 Nov 2025 17:39:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Zohran Mamdani is viewed as the leading candidate to become the next mayor of New York City, even as the contest has divided the normal partisan lines between Republicans and Democrats.",
    "story": [
      "New York \u2014 With just days to go before polls close in New York City's fractious race for mayor, frontrunner Zohran Mamdani spoke Saturday with former President Barack Obama, even as some major Democrats have taken a cautious political approach when it comes to the democratic socialist.",
      "A source familiar confirmed their call, first reported by the New York Times. In a statement to CBS News, a spokeswoman for Mamdani's campaign said the candidate \"appreciated President Obama's words of support and their conversation on the importance of bringing a new kind of politics to our city.\"",
      "Mamdani's win in June over former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo in a crowded mayoral Democratic primary was arguably the most significant progressive primary victory since now-Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated a Democratic incumbent congressman in 2018. The win by Mamdani upended Democratic party politics in a year where the national party has struggled to repair its brand issues after a disastrous 2024 election cycle.",
      "While Mamdani's success so far has brought the 34-year-old politician praise, it has also led to more focused criticism for his record, or lack thereof.",
      "Even after Mamdani's summer primary win, some national Democrats have either been slow to publicly embrace him, or have avoided doing so altogether.",
      "In Tuesday's general election contest, Mamdani is facing off against Cuomo, now running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries waited until Oct. 24, the eve of early voting, to endorse Mamdani. Meanwhile, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, have not endorsed in the race.",
      "At a rally last week with Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mamdani said his opponents, Cuomo and Sliwa, possess \"the playbook of the past.\"",
      "\"New York, our work has only just begun,\" Mamdani said as the rally ended. \"On [Tuesday] November 4th we set ourselves free.\"",
      "And in these final days of the contest, Democrats aren't the only ones making political decisions that don't follow normal party lines.",
      "In an interview earlier this week with CBS News, Republican Rep. Nick Langworthy of New York, a former state GOP chair, said of Cuomo that \"no one was a fiercer critic of his time as governor than I was.\"",
      "\"We fought him tooth and nail every step of the way,\" said Langworthy, who is supporting Cuomo for mayor. \"But he would be a far superior choice for the people of New York than Zohran Mamdani.\"",
      "Langworthy also expressed concern about the implications of a Mamdani victory, saying Mamdani's policies would become \"contagious around the country if he has a platform to talk to vast sums of people.\"",
      "The national impact of the race isn't lost on either major party given what a Mamdani victory could mean for control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterms, where Republicans are attempting to defend a narrow majority. Whichever party holds the House will likely play a major role in how Washington functions in the final two years of President Trump's term.",
      "Moderate Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York backed Cuomo late last month, saying in a social media post, \"I'm a Democratic Capitalist, not a Democratic Socialist. I endorse Andrew Cuomo. I can not back a declared socialist with a thin resume to run the most complex city in America.\"",
      "As Democrats continue to face questions about how the party can recover and win back voters, Mamdani's run for mayor may provide a telling guide of sorts for the kind of authentic messaging and grassroots campaigning that the left has struggled to cultivate on a national stage outside of Sanders' 2016 and 2020 presidential runs.",
      "Speaking at the late October Mamdani rally, Sanders said \"a victory here in New York will give hope and inspiration to people throughout our country and throughout the world.\"",
      "\"That is what this election is about. And that is why Donald Trump is paying attention to this election,\" Sanders said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Two federal judges on Friday said the Trump administration must tap into contingency funds to make payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during the government shutdown, ruling against the government in a pair of suits over the imminent benefits lapse. Roughly 42 million Americans\u00a0rely on SNAP\u00a0to help buy food.",
      "In a case brought by a coalition of states in federal court in Massachusetts, Judge Indira Talwani ruled that the government is required by law to tap into the emergency money to make at least partial payments, and gave the administration until Monday to tell the court whether it planned to do so.",
      "In Rhode Island, Judge John J. McConnell, Jr.   granted a request for a temporary restraining order from a group of municipalities and nonprofits that sued to block the imminent funding freeze, according to attorneys for Democracy Forward, the group leading the suit. The ruling was made from the bench. An entry on the case docket said the court \"orders the USDA to distribute contingency funds\" and report back to the court by noon on Monday.",
      "McConnell on Saturday ordered the Trump administration to pay SNAP benefits in full by Monday and to report to the court by noon regarding the status of the distribution. In the order, the judge said that if the government chooses to use its discretion and decides not to use other funds to make a full payment, then it must make a partial payment using the total amount of the contingency funds. The order said the contingency funds must be used to make a partial payment by Wednesday.",
      "In her ruling, Talwani stopped short of ordering the administration to send SNAP payments on Saturday, but she rejected the government's argument that the $5 billion contingency fund cannot be used to fund benefits during the lapse in appropriations.",
      "\"At core, Defendants' conclusion that USDA is statutorily prohibited from funding SNAP because Congress has not enacted new appropriations for the current fiscal year is erroneous,\" Talwani wrote. \"To the contrary, Defendants are statutorily mandated to use the previously appropriated SNAP contingency reserve when necessary and also have discretion to use other previously appropriated funds.\"",
      "Talwani wrote that \"the court will allow Defendants to consider whether they will authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November, and report back to the court no later than\" Monday.",
      "SNAP benefits provide eligible families with an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card for food purchases. Many families rely on those benefits as their main source of money for food. The Trump administration said money for the program was due to expire on Saturday because of the ongoing government shutdown, now on its 31st day.",
      "In a post Friday night on Truth Social, President Trump\u00a0wrote that he has \"instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible.\" The president blamed Democrats for causing any delay to the funding and added, \"If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.\"",
      "The suit in Massachusetts was brought by two dozen states and the District of Columbia earlier this week. They asked the court to require the administration to tap into the emergency funds to keep SNAP money flowing to states, which administer food stamp programs. The states argued that the administration's decision to cut off payments was unlawful and threatened to deprive millions of Americans of essential food benefits that help protect against food insecurity and hunger.",
      "\"Shutting off SNAP benefits will cause deterioration of public health and well-being,\" state officials wrote in their lawsuit. \"Ultimately, the States will bear costs associated with many of these harms. The loss of SNAP benefits leads to food insecurity, hunger, and malnutrition, which are associated with numerous negative health outcomes in children, such as poor concentration, decreased cognitive function, fatigue, depression, and behavioral problems.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, said in a memo last week that \"the well has run dry\" and that November benefits would not be paid without an end to the shutdown. Administration officials and Republicans in Congress have said that the roughly $5 billion in the contingency fund could not legally be used to cover the shortfall.",
      "\"By law, the contingency fund can only flow when the underlying fund is flowing,\" Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said at the Capitol on Friday.",
      "Talwani, the judge in Massachusetts, rejected that argument in her ruling: \"[U]nder Defendants' statutory construction, the use of the separately appropriated contingent reserve to fund SNAP benefits is somehow predicated on Congress's annual appropriation of funds to the SNAP program. Congress placed no such restrictions in the 2024 Consolidated Appropriations Act.\"",
      "She wrote that the suspension of SNAP payments to the states was \"based on the erroneous conclusion that the Contingency Funds could not be used to ensure continuation of SNAP payments.\"",
      "\"This court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP program,\" the judge wrote. \"And while these contingency funds reportedly are insufficient to cover the entire cost of SNAP for November, Defendants also may supplement the Contingency Funds by authorizing a transfer of additional funds ... to avoid any reductions.\"",

    "summary": "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" said one mother of two about a looming freeze in food aid.",
    "story": [
      "Roughly 42 million Americans rely on food stamps that arrive every month on their electronic benefit transfer cards. On Nov. 1, that aid is set to abruptly stop amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, potentially leaving households scrambling to figure out how to put food on the table.",
      "People enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, told CBS News they're bracing for some tough financial choices. Kasey McBlais, a 42-year-old single mother living in Buckfield, Maine, said she's planning to delay paying her electric and credit card bills to make sure her two children have enough to eat.",
      "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" McBlais, who works for a Maine social services agency and who draws about $600 a month in SNAP benefits, said. \"My children won't go hungry.\"",
      "The suspension of food aid comes as Democratic and Republican lawmakers continue to trade blame over the\u00a0government shutdown, which now stands as the second-longest funding lapse in U.S. history. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds the SNAP program, warned earlier this month that there would be insufficient funding to pay full November benefits if the shutdown continued, prompting local governments to post notices on their websites about the potential interruption in payments.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the USDA said in a memo\u00a0posted Sunday on its website. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.\"",
      "A stoppage in SNAP payments on Saturday isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday, Oct. 31, that the Trump administration is required by law to\u00a0use contingency funds\u00a0to pay at least partial SNAP benefits.",
      "The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have asked the USDA to use contingency funds to cover most of next month's SNAP benefits, but an agency memo surfaced on Friday that says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "That means beginning Nov. 1, the government will halt about $8 billion in monthly SNAP payments, cutting off food assistance for the one in eight Americans who are enrolled in the program. Recipients, who include households in every state, typically get about $187 a month on a prepaid card to help cover the cost of groceries.",
      "Unused benefits on SNAP recipients' cards will roll over into November.",
      "\"That's money that's already been appropriated. It's been put on their card,\" Mackenzie Libbey, a staff attorney with Community Legal Services, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"So we definitely do not want people rushing out to try to use up their benefits at the end of October thinking they're not going to be able to buy anything in November.\"",
      "The USDA said it is incumbent on Democrats in Congress to end the government shutdown.",
      "\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely\" SNAP benefits and other federal food aid, the agency said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Some U.S. states, including Louisiana, Vermont and Virginia, have vowed to continue disbursing SNAP benefits even if the federal government suspends payments. New York on Monday\u00a0pledged $30 million in emergency food assistance, while also recently committing to provide millions more in support for food banks. The USDA memo stipulates that states won't be reimbursed for temporarily providing food aid to residents, raising questions about the viability of that approach.",
      "Other states are taking legal action.",
      "A coalition of 25 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday\u00a0sued the Trump administration, alleging that the suspension of food stamps is unlawful and threatens the health and well-being of millions. The states are asking a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the USDA to provide SNAP benefits in November by tapping into a contingency fund, which is estimated to hold around $5 billion.",
      "\"Where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sharlene Sutton, a 45-year-old single mother of four in Dorchester, Massachusetts, who left her job as a security officer last month to care for one of her children, who has epilepsy, said she relies on the $549 she gets in monthly SNAP benefits to feed her family.",
      "\"I was freaking out because I'm like, 'Oh my god, now I don't have a job,'\" she told CBS News. \"I'm not worried about myself that much. It's about the kids. Like, where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sutton said she's looking for a food bank to help fill the gap if her food aid is cut off. But experts warn that the non-profit organizations alone aren't capable of filling the $8 billion monthly hole left by a looming SNAP suspension.",
      "\"The charitable food system and food banks don't have the resources to replace all those food dollars,\" John Sayles, CEO of Vermont Foodbank in Barre, Vermont, told CBS News.",
      "Already, food banks are getting an influx of calls from SNAP recipients who are worried about the payment freeze, and food shelves could see long lines next month if the shutdown persists, Sayles said.",
      "\"There is no safety net after SNAP other than the food shelf,\" he added.",
      "Albuquerque, New Mexico's Roadrunner Food Bank, which typically serves 83,000 households per week, is \"seeing panic\" among residents due to the SNAP halt, said Katy Anderson, vice president of strategy, partnerships and advocacy at the nonprofit organization.",
      "George Matysik, executive director of the Share Food Program in Philadelphia, has also noticed an uptick in demand. He told CBS News in a text message that some of the pantries the hunger relief nonprofit works with have reported 12-fold increases in new registrations week to week.",
      "Even before this new surge in demand, food banks were already facing pressures because of the growing number of people seeking their services, aggravated this year by\u00a0persistent inflation\u00a0and funding constraints. In March, the\u00a0USDA said it was nixing $420 million in funding\u00a0for a program that allows food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "Broader economic impact",
      "A temporary halt in $8 billion in monthly food aid could also impact local businesses, from grocers to farm stands, said Sayles of Vermont Foodbank. Each $1 in SNAP benefits provides an economic benefit of $1.60, he said, referring to the so-called\u00a0multiplier effect\u00a0in which dollars flowing through the local economy help support spending, jobs and growth.",
      "\"SNAP is the foundation of economic support for a lot of food retailers, like those smaller places in rural areas and the corner store in our cities,\" said Kate Bauer, an associate professor of nutritional services at the University of Michigan. \"So this has far-reaching impacts beyond just the people who get SNAP.\"",
      "SNAP is designed to provide supplemental aid for a family's grocery budget, but some families depend on it as their main source of income to buy food, Bauer noted. For those living paycheck to paycheck, even a short disruption in benefits can have immediate consequences, experts said.",
      "The loss of SNAP funding threatens some of the most vulnerable people in the U.S., with the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities noting that two-thirds of food-stamp recipients are children, seniors or people with disabilities.",
      "For McBlais, the single mom, the issue isn't political. Rather, it's about making sure families can eat in an economy where many are already struggling to afford rent, utilities and basic groceries, she told CBS News.",
      "\"Everybody needs food \u2014 SNAP recipients are Democratic, Republicans and everything in between,\" McBlais said.",

      "The prolonged U.S.\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0is putting millions of Americans at risk of missing their November food stamp benefits, a vital lifeline for low-income households.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, stated in a memo on Sunday that no benefits will be issued on Nov. 1, leaving the program's roughly 42 million beneficiaries uncertain about how they'll pay for groceries next month.",
      "SNAP recipients receive an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card, and many families rely on those benefits as their main source of money for food. Many of those registered with the program are asking if they will still be able to use the remaining dollars on their cards once funding is suspended and if they'll receive their November benefits retroactively, should lawmakers reach a deal to reopen the government.",
      "A stoppage in SNAP payments on Nov. 1 isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday, Oct. 31, that the Trump administration is required by law to\u00a0use contingency funds\u00a0to pay at least partial SNAP benefits.",
      "The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "With just days to go before a potential suspension in SNAP funding, here's what to know.",
      "Will current SNAP benefits roll over to November?",
      "While SNAP benefits will not be disbursed as scheduled in November, program recipients can use existing funds on their EBT cards to make purchases. If someone enrolled in the program hasn't spent all their October EBT dollars, for example, those benefits would roll over into November.",
      "Some states are advising recipients to use their remaining food stamps wisely, given the stalemate over funding the federal government.",
      "\"If you have remaining balances from previous months, we encourage you to plan your shopping carefully and purchase essential food items when needed,\" Hawaii's Department of Human Services said on its website.",
      "Will SNAP recipients get paid retroactively for missed payments?",
      "The USDA hasn't indicated whether SNAP benefits would be paid retroactively once the government shutdown ends.",
      "But social service experts who spoke with CBS News said they expect the USDA to pay the delayed November benefits once federal funding resumes.",
      "\"It is our understanding that SNAP benefits will be issued retroactively when the shutdown ends,\" said Lizbeth Ginsburg, a managing attorney in the welfare law unit at Greater Boston Legal Services.",
      "Federal rules\u00a0governing the food-stamp program stipulate that SNAP recipients are entitled to their benefits, and that they should receive them if there's a disruption, said Gina Plata-Nino, interim SNAP director at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on ending hunger.",
      "\"That's why many state agencies have done a very good job of saying, 'Your benefits will be delayed,' versus, 'You are not getting benefits,'\" she told CBS News.",
      "Can states step in to fund SNAP?",
      "While SNAP is federally funded and overseen by the USDA, each state is responsible for administering the program to its residents.",
      "Some states are taking action, with Democratic lawmakers\u00a0urging\u00a0Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to tap into an estimated $5 billion in contingency funds to cover SNAP benefits next month. On Tuesday, a coalition of officials from 25 states and the District of Columbia\u00a0sued the Trump administration\u00a0over the suspension of benefits, arguing that it is unlawful. The\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0notes that this would mark the first delay in SNAP benefits in the program's history.",
      "In recent days, several states have pledged to step in to ensure SNAP recipients can afford food in November. Their approaches vary, with some states promising to dispatch troops to support food banks, while others are allocating funds for general hunger relief.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry\u00a0signed an emergency declaration on Oct. 24 intended to fund SNAP benefits for people who rely on the program, while Vermont lawmakers on Oct. 29 approved a plan to cover its residents' food stamp benefits through Nov. 15.",
      "Other states say they plan to ramp up support for local food banks by providing on-site personnel and additional funding. California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0said\u00a0last week he would deploy National Guard troops to assist food bank operations and fast-track $80 million to keep the state's food banks stocked.",
      "In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul said she is providing $30 million in state funding to support 16 million meals. Roughly 3 million people in New York are on food stamps.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Nov 2025 07:32:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Jordan Goudreau was arrested last year on weapons smuggling charges tied to the failed coup attempt undertaken during the first Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Tampa has ordered the arrest of a former Green Beret accused of plotting to invade Venezuela in 2020 after he failed to show up to court for a hearing on whether he should be taken back into custody for violating the conditions of his pre-trial release.",
      "Jordan Goudreau, 49, was arrested last year on weapons smuggling charges tied to the failed coup attempt undertaken during the first Trump administration.",
      "He was released after a few weeks in jail when filmmaker Jen Gatien pledged her $2 million Manhattan apartment where the combat veteran was living as collateral for a bond. In testimony this week, Gatien detailed how the three-time Bronze Star recipient turned abusive, alleging he threatened to harm her and others and sent text messages saying he wouldn't go back to jail.",
      "\"I believe he intends one day to leave this country,\" Gatien said, noting that Goudreau previously lived on a sailboat in Mexico.",
      "Judge Christopher Tuite issued an arrest warrant Friday after waiting 30 minutes for Goudreau to show up for the third day of the bond hearing. A probation officer said the ankle monitor Goudreau was supposed to wear was still located in the Tampa area, where Goudreau was living while undergoing equine-assisted therapy supervised by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.",
      "\"I'm at a loss,\" Goudreau's attorney Marissel Descalzo told the judge. \"I have not spoken to him as to why he's not here.\"",
      "Documentary about Venezuela raid",
      "Gatien's new documentary, \"Men of War,\" is a largely sympathetic look at Goudreau's slapdash plan to train a mercenary force of Venezuelan army deserters in neighboring Colombia to carry out a cross-border raid that aimed to spark a popular rebellion and remove President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "The plot, exposed by The Associated Press two days before the incursion, never stood a chance against Maduro's far superior security forces and ended with several would-be freedom fighters killed and two of Goudreau's U.S. Special Forces buddies locked away in a Venezuelan prison.",
      "Since the movie's release last month, the relationship between the two has soured and in the weeks leading up to the bond hearing the filmmaker in court filings accused Goudreau of deceit, financial coercion and threatening conduct.",
      "Specifically, Gatien accused Goudreau of reneging on a promise - described by prosecutors as an \"undisclosed side agreement\" - to pledge his sizable reserves of cash, gold coins and cryptocurrency to mitigate the filmmaker's financial risk as his sole bond guarantor.",
      "She also shared with the court screenshots of angry text messages, sometimes incoherent and full of profanity, in which he claims \"I'm not going back to prison\" - a statement prosecutors say indicates his intention to flee.",
      "\"I would have gotten zero if he fled,\" Gatien testified. \"All I got was broken promises for the past year.\"",
      "Search for assault rifles",
      "Among those scheduled to testify at the hearing for the government was an Oklahoma couple which was storing some of Goudreau's belongings, including two assault rifles an associate recently tried to retrieve in possible violation of a court order against possessing firearms while on bond.",
      "In a sworn affidavit, Brande and Jason Woolems explained that Goudreau had called them last month pressuring them to make false accusations against Gatien to block her from backing out of the bond.",
      "The couple said in their sworn statement that Goudreau asked them to sign statements that accused Gatien of misconduct.",
      "\"When we declined, he called us 'Judas' and accused us of betrayal, yelling repeatedly in anger,\" they said in the statement.",
      "Bay of Piglets",
      "The 2020 invasion, which came to be known as the Bay of Piglets, stands as a cautionary tale of the often amateurish way the Trump administration has pursued regime change in Venezuela.",
      "Those criticisms have grown stronger in recent weeks as a naval flotilla deployed by Trump has carried out multiple deadly strikes on suspected drug smuggling boats departing Venezuela and the president authorized the CIA to carry out covert actions inside the South American country.",
      "The United Nations human rights chief said Friday that U.S. must stop its military strikes against boats in the region \u00a0to prevent \"extrajudicial killing.\"",
      "Amid growing concern about a potential U.S. invasion, Goudreau has reemerged as a media pundit popular with Trump supporters and \"radical leftist\" critics alike.",
      "In recent interviews, Goudreau has at times lashed out at an array of purported deep-state actors - the CIA and State Department among them - that he blames for \"sabotaging\" his clandestine mission, which he insists was blessed with a wink from the first Trump administration.",
      "Many of those same actors are once again trying to derail Trump's foreign policy agenda, he said. Meanwhile, he called Trump's allegations that Maduro is the leader of the so-called Suns Cartel of drug-running military officials a \"fabrication of the CIA.\"",
      "\"If we do invade Venezuela what's next?\" he recently told Russian state-owned RT. \"The truth of the matter is the Venezuelan opposition is as ruthless and tyrannical as the Venezuelan regime under Nicolas Maduro.\"",
      "Days after Goudreau's failed raid, Venezuela's government detained two other Americans on suspicion of plotting to topple Maduro's government.",
      "Plot aimed to oust president",
      "Goudreau, who was born in Canada, said he became a believer in the cause of Venezuelan democracy after working security at a benefit concert held in Colombia to deliver humanitarian aid across the border.",
      "Despite a lack of Spanish, he drew close to several exiled allies of opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3, who the U.S. then recognized as Venezuela's legitimate leader. Over several months, a plan was hatched to invade Venezuela with the goal of sparking a popular rebellion. As part of that effort, Goudreau signed a contract with the Guaid\u00f3 team, although the two sides split months before the raid was carried out under new leadership possibly infiltrated by Maduro's intelligence services.",
      "Goudreau was scheduled to go on trial in February on charges of failing to obtain an export license to ship roughly 60 AR-15 rifles to clandestine camps where would-be freedom fighters were being trained.",
      "According to U.S. officials, Goudreau and others \"conspired to export AR-type firearms, night vision devices, laser sights and other equipment from the United States to Colombia without obtaining the required export licenses. These unlicensed exports were undertaken to carry out activities in Venezuela.\"",
      "Two of the rifles seized in Colombia contain traces of Goudreau's DNA, while suppressors, night-vision goggles and other equipment had serial numbers matching those purchased by Goudreau and his Melbourne, Florida-based security firm Silvercorp, according to prosecutors.",
      "Gatien registered a Florida production company with Goudreau in 2021 and was described in court records as his girlfriend. In testimony Gatien denied being anything more than good friends with Goudreau, who lived with her for two years while attending the New York Film Academy.",

      "\"It was up on the roof, the spare cars we had in the parking lot ... We had to do something,\" Heflin Police Chief Ross McGlaughn said.",
      "So after the \"attack\" on his station last month, McGlaughn took to social media to send a message to the perpetrators.",
      "\"We think that rolling the police department was a little uncalled for, but as we enter into Halloween season, we dont want to hear any crying when we load up like we are going to serve a search warrant and go full out tactical ninja style old school rolling at your place next month,\" McGlaughn wrote. \"We know who you are and while you just put the play station controller down for a week, we are children of the 80s and 90s who perfected this craft years ago.\"",
      "The Heflin Police Department then got to work on an operation that was supported by officers from multiple jurisdictions, all armed to the teeth with toilet paper.",
      "It was an unusual approach to policing, to say the least. But McGlaughn did get permission from the parents in advance. And he said he has his reasons for encouraging the kids like this.",
      "\"As long as they're doing this, they're not getting into trouble doing something else,\" McGlaughn said. \"I haven't seen any types of drugs or alcohol involved. You know, I think they're spending all their money on toilet paper.\"",
      "The kids have definitely taken to the prank war.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Oct 2025 20:09:49 -0400",
    "summary": "\"I'm wondering how I'm going to be able to afford everything\" if federal food aid is halted, one single mom said.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans are sliding toward a financial cliff as the\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0stretches into a second month, with four federal assistance programs for low-income families set to run out of funding on Nov. 1.",
      "Some families could lose access to multiple sources of government support. Ashley Trent, a 37-year-old single mother of six, expressed concern she could soon be without aid provided under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), better known as food stamps, and the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program, which provides food aid for mothers of young children.",
      "\"I'm wondering how I'm going to be able to afford everything,\" Trent, a Bloomington, Ill., resident who works full-time as a housing navigator, told CBS News. \"It's very stressful \u2014 what bills will I have to put off? I have a car note, I have insurance, I have clothes I have to get my kids because it's getting colder.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds SNAP and WIC, has said it will halt payments for the anti-hunger programs on Nov. 1 due to the government shutdown. Head Start programs serving 65,000 low-income children will also lose federal funding on Saturday, potentially disrupting preschool for thousands of families,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Head Start Association.",
      "The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps struggling households heat their homes, could be next to run short of funding.",
      "Halting funding for these programs \u2014 which help cover food, education, and energy costs \u2014 could have lasting consequences for poor families already strained by high grocery and utility prices, said Ailen Arreaza, executive director of the advocacy group ParentsTogether Action.",
      "Although funding will resume once Congress passes legislation to reopen the government, she warned that the damage to households could persist.",
      "\"What we are hearing from parents is desperation \u2014 parents going without meals, making impossible decisions about not paying bills or going without medication,\" Arreaza told CBS News. \"This has so many implications, because these kids need these programs to get ahead.\"",
      "Experts note that hunger can hinder children's ability to learn, while parents who fall behind on bills may face utility shutoffs or other lasting setbacks.",
      "Food stamps",
      "The USDA is set to\u00a0halt SNAP payments on Nov. 1, leaving about 42 million Americans uncertain how they'll afford groceries next month. Recipients receive an average of about $187 a month on prepaid cards that can be used to buy food at grocery stores, farmers' markets and other retailers.",
      "A prolonged cessation in food-stamp funding isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday that the Trump administration is required by law to use contingency funds to pay at least partial SNAP benefits. The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "Meanwhile, more than a dozen states are trying to fill the gap by using state funds to support food aid or local food banks. But food bank leaders say charities can't make up for a cutoff in food stamps.",
      "\"It's going to hurt us really bad,\" said Taylour Grant, 29, a Tampa medical assistant who relies on $970 a month in SNAP benefits to feed her four children, plus WIC support for her youngest, who is 1-year-old. \"It's really scary because I know I'll go without to make sure my kids are fed.\"",
      "Grant said many people misunderstand who relies on SNAP. \"We're not on it because we want to be \u2014 no one makes enough to live off these days. That help is really needed,\" she said.",
      "WIC",
      "Nearly 7 million low-income pregnant women, new mothers and children under 5 who receive WIC could lose federal aid in November because of the government shutdown.",
      "Unlike food stamps, WIC provides funds specifically to purchase formula and nutritious foods for pregnant women and young children, though many families rely on both programs, said Georgia Machell, CEO of the National WIC Association.",
      "\"None of these programs operate in a vacuum,\" she said. \"Often, if a family is participating in WIC, they're also participating in SNAP.\"",
      "WIC continued paying benefits in October after the Trump administration tapped\u00a0$300 million\u00a0in leftover tariff revenue from the previous fiscal year. But with the stalemate in Congress continuing into November, that funding could run out.",
      "The USDA didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about whether it could tap additional tariff revenue to fund the program. At this point, the program is set to delay payments on Nov. 1, according to the National WIC Association.",
      "WIC has been able to maintain funding during previous shutdowns in its 50-year history, according to the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on stopping hunger. \"The disruptions we're concerned about would be fairly historic,\" Machell said.",
      "Some states have pledged to use their own funds to keep WIC running, but many lack the budget, according to FRAC.",
      "Head Start",
      "About 140 Head Start programs in 41 states and Puerto Rico will lose federal funding with the shutdown set to extend past Nov. 1, affecting roughly 65,000 children, according to the National Head Start Association. Nationwide, about 750,000 children are enrolled in Head Start.",
      "Some programs may not be able to stay open, regional program directors warn.",
      "\"Everybody is trying to do everything they can to keep children in classrooms and families at work,\" Michelle Haimowitz, executive director of the Massachusetts Head Start Association,\u00a0told CBS News Boston. \"But it is incredibly difficult to operate without those federal funds.\"",
      "Minnesota mother Jaycee Chrudimsky said she fears that the closure of her local Head Start program could force her to miss work and affect her 4-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It would impact her, and that's the thing I worry about the most, because she looks forward to coming to school every single day and seeing her friends and being a part of the program,\" Chrudimsky\u00a0told\u00a0CBS News Minnesota this week.",
      "LIHEAP",
      "Another program threatened by the shutdown is the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). The program helps about 6 million low-income households pay their energy bills.",
      "\"We are now at a point where the government shutdown is going to cause serious delays in the release of LIHEAP funds,\" Wolfe told CBS News.",
      "The delay could leave millions of families behind on utility bills and facing power shutoffs just as\u00a0energy prices are skyrocketing, he added.",
      "NEADA projects the\u00a0average cost for people to heat a home this winter\u00a0will rise nearly 8%.",
      "\"It's a perfect storm of misery for low- and middle-income households,\" Wolfe said.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Oct 2025 18:19:31 -0400",
    "summary": "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol doesn't expect AI to replace baristas as the coffee chain focuses on improving the \"human-to-human experience\" for customers.",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol took the helm in September 2024, inheriting a company facing its first revenue decline in four years amid customer complaints about high prices and long wait times. A year later, the coffee giant has halted the slide but faces fresh pressures, from surging coffee bean costs to store closures.",
      "Coffee prices\u00a0jumped 30% from January through September, squeezing Starbucks' profit margins even as Niccol vowed not to raise menu costs this year. The restaurant chain said last month it would spend $1 billion to close underperforming stores and cut 900 jobs.",
      "As Niccol told CBS News' Jo Ling Kent, the retail chain can't rule out price hikes in 2026 due to rising coffee prices, although he described this step as a \"last resort.\" At the same time, Niccol noted that Starbucks has no plans to introduce a value menu like McDonald's and other fast-food chains appealing to budget-conscious patrons.",
      "\"We have a huge point of difference and that is, I think, that customer connection and the experience you get in our stores,\" Niccol told CBS News. \"I just believe, at the end of the day, the experience sets us apart from everybody else.\"",
      "He added, \"Pricing would be one of those things that we do as a last resort, and we do it very surgically. To say never, you know, I don't think you can do that in this environment.\"",
      "\"Human-to-human\"",
      "Starbucks' reboot involves what the company calls its \"Green Apron service model,\" which aims to hire more baristas, improve customer service and cut down on customer wait times.",
      "\"What we're doing right now is making sure that we're staffed correctly,\" Niccol said. \"The teams are trained correctly for the demand that we know we have in the morning, and we know that we're growing in the afternoon.\"",
      "While other companies are turning to artificial intelligence to replace some workers, Niccol said he doesn't envision AI supplanting baristas. He said the technology could be useful for behind-the-scenes tasks, such as managing the company's supply chain.",
      "\"I don't see [AI] replacing our baristas \u2014 that human-to-human experience is just too important,\" Niccol said. \"And I think it really separates our experience from everybody else.\"",
      "While Starbucks is bolstering its barista ranks, it also faces the threat of strikes from Starbucks Workers United, which represents 9,500 workers in some 550 Starbucks cafes across the country. Overall, the company has roughly 201,000 employees working in 10,000 stores across North America.",
      "Niccol said he's open to talking with union members, but also described his company's pay and benefits as generous, adding that their demands \"to date have been unreasonable.\"",
      "\"We already give them the best job in retail. We have the lowest turnover in the industry \u2014 it's below 50%,\" Niccol told CBS News. \"We also have the best benefits in the industry, and we actually have the best wages in the industry.\"",
      "Although other companies have noted a pullback from low- or middle-income consumers as inflation continues to tick upwards, Niccols said Starbucks patrons are still opening their wallets.",
      "\"Transactions are up, our sales are up,\" Niccol said. \"What we hear from them is they love the experience and they think it's a great value proposition, so I think they're being much more judicious in where they want to spend their money.\"",
      "He added, \"And I think it's really important that you give them a great experience so that it justifies why they chose to spend money with you.\"",

      "Member's Mark Super Greens Powder Supplements, which were sold at the discount chain's stores nationwide and online, have been pulled from store shelves because they contain moringa leaf powder that may be contaminated with Salmonella bacteria, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an alert posted on its website.",
      "\"If you have any of the products listed below in your home, throw them out or return them to the store,\" the agency said, while noting that the product has not been recalled.",
      "Three of the people who contracted Salmonella were hospitalized, according to the agency. Illnesses, which were reported between May and September, were confirmed in Florida, Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina, New York, South Carolina and Virginia.",
      "The source of the Salmonella was traced to a single lot of organic moringa leaf powder imported from Vallon Farm Direct in Jodhpur, India, according to an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration.

    "summary": "Jeffrey Epstein's schedule, flight logs and personal calendars detail his connections with high-profile people including Woody Allen and leaders in finance and public affairs.",
    "story": [
      "Many of the famous and powerful people who have long sought to publicly downplay their connections to Jeffrey Epstein in fact had more involved relationships than they've acknowledged, according to documents recently made public by Congress.",
      "Detailed calendars, daily schedules and flight manifests were among more than 8,000 pages of documents reviewed by CBS News, providing a glimpse into Epstein's habits and relationships.",
      "Some of those relationships spanned years and involved dozens of meetings, events, meals and travel, and now records of those interactions are spilling out into public view. Several prominent people continued to spend time with Epstein up until his arrest in 2019, even as sex trafficking accusations intensified after his 2008 \"sweetheart deal\" with prosecutors in Florida, which allowed Epstein to maintain his jet-set status relatively unscathed.",
      "The exact nature of the relationships are hard, if not impossible, to characterize based on the documents. What is clear is that Epstein's life had many dimensions beyond his criminal activity \u2014 including complex financial transactions and philanthropic activity that would have attracted many suitors. And he appears to have been a prolific networker.",
      "Among those spending considerable time in Epstein's orbit was filmmaker Woody Allen, who has said previously that his ties to Epstein were limited to social events at Epstein's home, always with Allen's wife present. Another recurring contact, Kathryn Ruemmler, a Goldman Sachs executive who was President Barack Obama's White House counsel, has said she only met with Epstein in a professional capacity.",
      "Appointment calendars through 2019 show several meetings with self-help guru Deepak Chopra and longevity expert Dr. Peter Attia. Details from Epstein's appointments during the final two years of his life had not previously been made public. They show he continued to plan meetings with people like political strategist Steve Bannon and Hyatt executive chairman Tom Pritzker.",
      "A love of cinema, with Woody Allen friendship at forefront",
      "Film screenings appear frequently on Epstein's calendar. He'd attend them and would also invite friends to watch movies in his home screening room. Among the most frequent of Epstein's social companions in the years leading up to his death was filmmaker Woody Allen and his wife, Soon-Yi Previn. Epstein often went to Manhattan Film Center on Park Avenue in New York City to screen Allen's movies or watch him edit, documents show.",
      "The records show nearly 100 instances between 2014 and 2019 in which Allen and Epstein \u2014 almost always joined by Allen's wife \u2014 were scheduled to meet or spend time together. The documents show that Allen and Previn were among Epstein's most regular social companions during that period.",
      "A spokesperson for Allen told the Wall Street Journal in 2023 he \"never had a business meeting with Epstein and not once spent time with him without Soon-Yi also being present.\"",
      "When contacted by CBS News about the most recent calendar entries in Epstein's diary through 2019, Allen's spokesperson said no comment would be provided.",
      "Epstein's calendar notes travel with Allen and Previn at least nine times, including to his ranch in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and to his residence in Palm Beach, Florida. No allegations have been made that Allen or Previn knew about or were involved in any wrongdoing. In interviews, Allen has said that Epstein always had a girlfriend around him, but he did not believe those women were underage.",
      "A source familiar with the flight logs told CBS News that some of the flights with Allen and Previn also include the names of known victims who frequently traveled with Epstein, but those passenger names are redacted in the logs that were released.",
      "Allen provided film editing lessons to Epstein and others, according to Epstein's calendar. The calendar has a scheduled visit with Allen to the artist Jeff Koons' studio in New Jersey, though Koons told CBS News the visit never occurred. Epstein visited film sets where Allen was directing in New York and Rhode Island. Allen, Previn and Epstein were even scheduled to have dinner together on Valentine's Day in Paris one year.",
      "Epstein, Allen and Previn's final dinner together was May 9, 2019; the guest list included Kathy Ruemmler and another guest. Two months later, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport on federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "Politics and business mixed in Epstein's calendar",
      "Epstein was known for being a connector; he frequently met with executives, CEOs and CFOs, and helped bring others together. On his calendar, he had meetings with business titans such as Barry Sternlicht, president of Starwood Hotels & Resorts, although a spokesperson for Sternlicht told CBS News the meeting never happened and he only attended one group dinner. He was scheduled to meet with Hyatt's Tom Pritzker 28 times between 2013 and 2018. Billionaire banker Ariane de Rothschild and the investor Leon Black and were also listed.",
      "Epstein also pulled politicians and operatives into the mix. The late New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson maintained a relationship with Epstein at least through Sept. 19, 2016, when they were scheduled to meet for dinner. He appears on Epstein's calendar and flight logs showing travel to Epstein's New Mexico ranch.",
      "A previously unreported log shows Richardson travelled in 2011 on Epstein's helicopter from the British Virgin Islands to the U.S. Virgin Islands. That flight log also lists Epstein and Brian Condit, Richardson's chief of staff, as a passenger, as well as three of Epstein's alleged victims, as identified by the House Oversight Committee, one with U.K. citizenship and two U.S. citizens.",
      "Condit told CBS News the chopper flight was from Richard Branson's island to the U.S. Virgin Islands. They did not visit the private property Epstein owned there, he said.\u00a0 He doesn't remember who else was on the helicopter. Richardson died at age 75 in 2023.",
      "Epstein was also in frequent contact with Ruemmler, the former Obama White House counsel who is currently chief legal officer and general counsel at the world's largest investment bank, Goldman Sachs. She has previously said, \"I regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein.\"",
      "Ruemmler was a partner at the law firm Latham & Watkins during the period she spent time with Epstein. Known for courting powerful people, Epstein often helped arrange business relationships. A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs has said previously that was the extent of Ruemmler's cultivation of Epstein, leveraging him for business contacts and referrals.",
      "Epstein's calendar shows dozens of scheduled meetings and events involving Ruemmler. One note, for Feb. 6, 2018, says, \"Kathy Ruemmler to have the Glam Squad to her NY apt for 9am!\" It's unclear why Epstein was making note of the apparent hair and makeup appointment. Ruemmler declined to comment for this story.",
      "A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs told CBS News, \"As we've said before, and has been repeatedly reported, Ms. Ruemmler had a professional relationship with Mr. Epstein when she was the global chair of the white collar defense and investigations practice at Latham & Watkins.\"",
      "\"He referred business to her and they shared a common client that originated as an Epstein referral,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Their more than 50 scheduled meetings included appointments in Paris and St. Lucia and gatherings with some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the world, including tech billionaire Peter Thiel, Bill Gates, former Sen. Bob Kerrey and Bannon. A spokesperson for Ruemmler denied she had ever flown with him and said she never met with Epstein outside of the U.S.",
      "Epstein's appointment calendar does not specify a purpose for his meetings with Bannon, a former White House chief strategist in the first Trump administration. Bannon has since said he filmed hours of interviews with Epstein as part of a planned documentary. A source who was close to Epstein in his final weeks told CBS News that Epstein was eager to portray himself in a redemptive light.",
      "Epstein's schedule remained packed with powerful and famous people even as federal agents closed in. In one week in April 2019, three months before his arrest, Epstein's calendar included meetings with Ruemmler, Bannon, investment banker and commentator Robert Kuhn and lunch with Chopra. Ruemmler's last appointments with Epstein were on May 6 and May 7, 2019.",
      "An obsession with longevity and medicine",
      "Epstein had a deep interest in medicine, science and longevity, both on a personal level and for business. Records obtained by CBS News show he had planned as early as 2012 to launch a company focused on gene sequencing.",
      "Chopra, the physician and prominent integrative medicine advocate, appears in Epstein's calendar at least a dozen times in 2016, 2017 and 2019.",
      "They were scheduled to meet one-on-one on some occasions \u2014 including at least one appointment in Paris in November 2016 \u2014 and in groups on other dates. Epstein was invited to a 25th anniversary event for Skeptic Magazine, in which Chopra was featured as a discussion panelist. Two months later, Epstein invited Chopra to a dinner with Allen and his wife.",
      "Chopra told CBS News in a statement, \"Jeffrey Epstein was introduced to me by Barnaby Marsh, former CEO of the Templeton Foundation, as someone who could potentially fund research on the brain and consciousness.\"",
      "Chopra said their appointments were primarily related to treatment for Epstein's struggles with sleep.",
      "\"After meeting, he shared he suffered from insomnia and expressed interest in learning meditation, which I taught him. Our meetings, focused solely on practicing meditation, lasted about 30 minutes each,\" Chopra said. \"At my suggestion, he also visited Dr. V.S. Ramachandran's lab at [the University of California San Diego] to learn about ongoing brain research.",
      "\"While several of these institutions had received some funding from him, no projects were ever initiated as a result of our interactions. He later introduced me to Joichi Ito at the MIT Media Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Ultimately, no research project was ever pursued.\"",
      "Epstein's difficulty sleeping is documented in jail records from the weeks before his death. He was provided a sleep apnea breathing device, commonly known as a CPAP machine, by the jail.",
      "Epstein also repeatedly met Peter Attia, a doctor specializing in longevity whose books have sold millions of copies.",
      "Attia's later appointments suggest Epstein was a patient. The schedule includes notations for blood draws and follow-ups over several years. Attia was also scheduled to attend what appears to be a business meeting with a medical entrepreneur and an investor associated with the Harvard Corporation, the powerful board that runs the university. CBS News has reached out to Attia for comment.",
      "Editor's note:\u00a0This story has been updated to include a statement from Ruemmler's spokesperson saying she never met with Epstein outside the country.",

    "story": [
      "The federal government is now in the midst of its second-longest shutdown, after Congress has repeatedly failed to pass a bill to fund the government on a temporary basis. The 2025 shutdown is a few days shy of the record set by the 2018-2019 shutdown, which lasted 34 days and took place during President Trump's first administration.",
      "On Sept. 19, the House passed a measure that would have kept the government running through Nov. 21, but the bill failed to make it out of the GOP-led Senate the same day. Since government funding lapsed on Oct. 1, the Senate has held a number of votes, but Republicans have not been able to garner the support they need from Democrats to advance the bill.",
      "Here's the government shutdown by the numbers:",

      "Since just before the shutdown began on Oct. 1, the Senate has voted 13 times on a House-passed resolution to fund the government until Nov. 21. There are 53 Republicans in the Senate, 45 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the Democrats. When all senators are present, there have been 55 votes in favor of funding the government, five short of the 60 needed to move the bill forward.",
      "The Senate, which has 100 senators, requires only a simple majority to pass most legislation. But the Senate's filibuster rule effectively requires nearly all legislation \u2014 including the continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government \u2014 to reach a 60-vote threshold first. A single senator may delay a bill during debate by invoking a filibuster, which can only be ended if a supermajority of 60 senators vote to end debate.",

      "43: Senate Democrats/independents opposed, plus 1 Republican",
      "GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is the lone Republican joining most Democratic senators in voting against advancing the resolution to fund the government. He opposes the measure because it adds to the nation's rising debt.",

On Nov. 1, that aid is set to abruptly stop amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. On Oct. 28, 25 states asked a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the Agriculture Department to provide benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for November, including by tapping into a contingency fund to ensure the assistance continues to flow to more than 25 million people living within their borders.",

      "That nine-figure check likely isn't enough to cover the military's entire payroll. There are around 1.3 million active-duty service members, so the donation comes out to roughly $100 per person.",
      "At least $7 billion: The economic cost of the shutdown",
      "The shutdown could temporarily cut the nation's economic output by billions of dollars as unpaid federal workers curtail their spending and SNAP benefits are paused, leading to a 1-percentage-point GDP drop if the shutdown lasts four weeks and a 2-point dip if it drags on for eight weeks, the Congressional Budget Office said in an Oct. 29 estimate.",
      "Much of that decline will be reversed after the government reopens and the spigot of federal spending turns back on \u2014 but not all of it.

    "published": "Thu, 30 Oct 2025 13:47:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The discovery \"rewrites decades of research on Earth's most famous predator,\" the study's co-author said.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have long puzzled over the origins of a mysterious dinosaur excavated in the 1940s: Was it a young T. rex or another type of dinosaur?",
      "At first, researchers had only a tyrannosaur skull to go by, making it hard to tell if it belonged to a child or adult. Another skull and skeleton nicknamed Jane added to the debate, but didn't settle the controversy.",
      "Now, a research team says new evidence resolves the case. The latest clue comes from a complete skeleton \u2014 first uncovered in Montana in 2006 \u2014 that scientists say identifies the mystery reptile as its own species and not a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex.",
      "The discovery \"rewrites decades of research on Earth's most famous predator,\" said study co-author Lindsay Zanno with the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and North Carolina State University.",
      "Growth rings within the bones found in Montana's Hell Creek Formation told scientists the new dinosaur was an adult about half the size of a fully fledged T. rex. From growth comparisons to other reptiles like crocodiles, they also found that the major differences between the creature's skull and an adult T. rex's \u2014 changes in bone structure, nerve patterns and sinuses \u2014 were unlikely to form from simply going through puberty.",
      "Signs pointed to a dinosaur that's a distant T. rex cousin known as Nanotyrannus lancensis, the researchers reported in a study published Thursday in the journal Nature, calling it a rival species.",
      "\"Nanotyrannus is a small-bodied predator designed for speed. It's very agile and has long powerful arms [that are] larger than those of the T. rex,\"\u00a0Zanno told Nature.",
      "There's now \"more support and evidence than there ever has been\" that this T. rex relative could exist, said Holly Woodward, a fossil bone expert from Oklahoma State University who had no role in the new study. But she's not yet convinced that the other mystery skeletons like Jane are something new.",
      "Case of mistaken identity",
      "Other independent scientists also said the debate isn't over. The new skeleton is indeed an adult, but it could be a sister species to T. rex and not a distant relative, said vertebrate paleontologist Thomas Carr of Carthage College.",
      "There are similarities between the shape of T. rex's skull and the mystery specimens that keep him from switching camps.",
      "\"I don't think this study settles everything,\" he said.",
      "Resolving this case of mistaken identity is important to understanding how T. rex grew up, said study co-author James Napoli with Stony Brook University. Another big question is whether T. rex was the main predator prowling toward the end of the age of dinosaurs 67 million years ago \u2014 or whether a tinier, but still mighty predator also roamed.",
      "\"I suspect that these two species would have occasionally come into conflict, as predators tend to do, but the long legs of Nanotyrannus, and its small size, suggest that it mostly hunted smaller, faster prey than Tyrannosaurus,\" Napoli told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The new skeleton is dubbed \"Dueling Dinosaurs\" because it was found intertwined with the bones of a Triceratops, and is currently on display at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.",
      "The study comes just days after new research suggested dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before the asteroid strike.

    "summary": "The new site is intended to \"help Americans push back peacefully, lawfully, and defiantly against presidential abuses of power.\"",
    "story": [
      "A former high-ranking homeland security official in the first Trump administration is launching a new online hub Wednesday to facilitate protests and other resistance efforts against President Trump and his policies.",
      "Miles Taylor, a former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, is leading a group of dozens of former national security officials, whistleblowers and a bipartisan group of former elected officials to create a website called defiance.org.",
      "In its mission statement, the bipartisan group says the tool is \"designed to help Americans push back peacefully, lawfully, and defiantly against presidential abuses of power.\"",
      "Taylor told CBS News, \"There are many organizations and a million efforts, but there has not been a clearinghouse for people who regularly seek ways to engage. This is a 'Google' for defiance, where people can go to see their options to push back lawfully, peacefully and defiantly.\"",
      "In September 2018, Taylor wrote an anonymous opinion piece in the New York Times that said there was a \"quiet resistance\" to President Trump within his own administration, made up of people \"working diligently\" to block what he called the president's \"worst inclinations.\" He disclosed two years later that he had written the op-ed.",
      "The announcement of the new site is intended to capitalize on momentum from the October \"No Kings\" rallies earlier this month, which attracted participants across the country.",
      "The site launched Wednesday with a video of actor Robert DeNiro, a staunch Trump critic, urging protesters and critics to join forces.",
      "\"You can't just sit on your ass and wait for the insanity and cruelty to pass. No,\" DeNiro says in the video. \"You gotta stand up and fight.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement, \"Further proof that Miles Taylor's entire identity is being a TDS clown. If he actually cared about workers being paid and families receiving benefits, he would urge Democrats to reopen the government \u2013 just like the President has been doing. Democrats could end the shutdown today but Myles (sic) is too blinded by his TDS rage to accept the truth.\" (\"TDS\" is often used by Mr. Trump and his supporters as an initialism for \"Trump Derangement Syndrome,\" a phrase describing some of his critics)",
      "In April, Mr. Trump signed an executive memo targeting Taylor, accusing him of manufacturing stories to sell a book, and ordered DHS, the Justice Department and other government agencies to investigate him and revoke his security clearances, as well as for those who worked closely with him. Mr. Trump also ordered an investigation into the alleged dissemination of classified documents while Taylor worked for the government. Taylor denies he leaked any such material.",
      "Defiance.org is described in its mission statement as a \"nationwide 'mutual aid' pact to defend those under attack.\" It aims to support nonprofit partners, and says it will join \"peaceful protests and legal defense efforts.\"",
      "Taylor told CBS News supporters of the effort include Stephanie Grisham, a press secretary from the first Trump administration, and former aide Olivia Troye, both of whom have become vocal critics of the president.",
      "Dozens of former elected leaders and Trump critics, including former Republican congressmen Reid Ribble, Denver Riggleman and Joe Walsh, are also supporting the new portal.",
      "Taylor said the mutual aid feature of the portal is intended to help those targeted by the administration. He said a future effort could include rallying legal, political and community leaders to support Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who is under investigation by the Justice Department, if he is charged. Taylor said the Defiance.org hub would be used to galvanize and organize legal help, courthouse supporters and public statements in support of Schiff or against the Trump administration.",
      "Riggleman told CBS News the group would seek to \"protect Americans against political overreach and targeted retaliation.\"",
      "The White House has harshly criticized Taylor in the past, including in this statement in April.",
      "\"While serving as an administrative staff assistant at the Department of Homeland Security, Taylor stoked dissension by manufacturing sensationalist reports on the existence of a supposed 'resistance' within the federal government that 'vowed' to undermine and render effective (sic) a sitting President,\" the White House said.",

      "HUR said its forces struck the Koltsevoy pipeline, which spans 250 miles and supplies the Russian army with gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from refineries in Ryazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Moscow.",
      "The operation, which targeted infrastructure near the Ramensky district, destroyed all three fuel lines, HUR said.",
      "The pipeline was capable of transporting up to 3 million tons of jet fuel, 2.8 million tons of diesel and 1.6 million tons of gasoline annually, HUR said.",
      "\"Our strikes have had more impact than sanctions,\" said Kyrylo Budanov, the head of HUR, referring to international sanctions on Russia\u00a0imposed over its all-out war and the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Moscow strains to take key eastern city",
      "Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry on Saturday claimed its forces defeated a team of Ukrainian special forces that were rushed to the eastern frontline hot spot of Pokrovsk in a bid to stop Russian troops from pushing farther into the city.",
      "It later posted videos showing two men it said were Ukrainians who surrendered in the embattled city. The videos show the men, one dressed in fatigues and the other in a dark green jacket, sat against a peeling wall in a dark room, as they speak of fierce fighting and encirclement by Russian forces. The videos' authenticity could not be independently verified, and there was no immediate public comment from Kyiv on the Russian ministry's claims.",
      "Russia and Ukraine have presented conflicting accounts of what is happening in Pokrovsk, a key Ukrainian stronghold in the eastern Donetsk region. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed last week that his forces had encircled the city's Ukrainian defenders.",
      "But Ukraine's army chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Saturday that while the situation in Pokrovsk remains \"hardest\" for Ukrainian forces, who are trying to push Russian troops out of the city, there is no encirclement or blockade as Moscow has maintained.",
      "\"A comprehensive operation to destroy and push out enemy forces from Pokrovsk is ongoing. The main burden lies on the shoulders of the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, particularly UAV operators and assault units,\" Syrskyi said in a statement on Telegram.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy acknowledged on Friday that some Russian units had infiltrated Pokrovsk, but insisted that Ukraine is weeding them out.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Russia had deployed around 170,000 troops in Donetsk in a major push to capture the city and claim a major battlefield victory.",
      "Putin is trying to persuade the United States, which wants him to seek a peace deal, that Ukraine can't hold out against Russian military superiority. He has also stressed what he says is Russia's improving nuclear capability as he refuses to budge from what he says are his country's legitimate war aims.",
      "A key goal for Moscow has been to take all of Ukraine's industrial heartland of Donbas, made up of the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk provinces. Kyiv still controls about a 10th of the coal-rich region.",
      "Russian nighttime strikes kill 1,\u00a0wound dozens",
      "Elsewhere, a civilian died and 19 more were wounded, including a 9-year-old girl, when Russia struck the southern Mykolaiv region with an Iskander ballistic missile on Saturday morning, local official Vitaliy Kim said.",
      "Another Russian strike early Saturday sparked a fire at a gas plant in the central Poltava region, Ukraine's emergency service reported.",
      "The strikes came as Russia pressed large drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, bringing power outages and restrictions across the country earlier this week in what Kyiv described as a \"systematic energy terror.\"",
      "Moscow launched 223 drones at Ukraine overnight into Saturday, 206 of which were shot down, according to the Ukrainian air force. Seventeen struck targets in seven Ukrainian regions, the air force said, without providing details.",
      "Russia also hit an agricultural enterprise in Ukraine's northern Chernihiv region, injuring a 66-year old woman, according to a Telegram update by regional government official Viacheslav Chaus.",
      "Russian forces during the night shot down or intercepted 98 Ukrainian drones over the country, including six on the approach to Moscow, the Russian Defense Ministry said Saturday.",
      "There were no immediate reports of casualties, but local authorities reported a rare large-scale power outage in a Russian city of over 100,000 people. The municipal administration of Zhukovsky, 25 miles southeast of Moscow, in a Telegram update blamed the blackout on an \"automatic equipment shutdown.\"",

    "summary": "Prime Minister Mark Carney also told Ontario's Premier Doug Ford not to run the ad.",
    "story": [
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he told Ontario's premier not to run an anti-tariff ad that prompted President Trump to\u00a0end trade talks with Canada.",
      "Carney also confirmed that he apologized to the president during a dinner at\u00a0the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit this week because Mr. Trump was \"offended.\"",
      "Ontario's television advertisement that aired in the U.S. criticizes Mr. Trump's tariffs by citing a speech from former U.S.\u00a0President Ronald Reagan.",
      "The ad infuriated Mr. Trump, who ended trade talks with Canada and said he plans to hike tariffs on imports of Canadian goods by an extra 10%.",
      "When asked on Saturday what Ontario Premier Doug Ford's response was to being asked not to run the ad, Carney said, \"Well, you saw what came of it.\"",
      "\"It's not something I would have done,\" Carney added at a news conference as he wrapped a nine-day trip to Asia.",
      "Ford is a populist Conservative, while Carney is a Liberal. As premier, Ford is the equivalent of a U.S. governor.",
      "\"I'm the one who is responsible, in my role as prime minister, for the relationship with the president of the U.S., and the federal government is responsible for the foreign relationship with the U.S. government,\" Carney said.",
      "A spokesperson for Ford didn't immediately respond when asked if Carney told Ford not to run the ad.",
      "Ford previously said Carney and Carney's chief of staff watched the ad before it was released.",
      "Ford pulled the ad last Monday but allowed it to be shown in the first two games of the World Series, where the Toronto Blue Jays are playing the Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "Mr. Trump said the ad misrepresented the position of Reagan, a two-term president and a beloved figure in the Republican Party. But Reagan was wary of tariffs and used much of the 1987 address featured in Ontario's ad, spelling out the case against them, saying tariffs work \"only for a short time\" and \"hurt every American worker and consumer.\"",
      "\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,\" Reagan\u00a0said, as quoted by the ad.",
      "Mr. Trump has complained that the ad was aimed at influencing the U.S. Supreme Court ahead of arguments scheduled this month that could decide whether Mr. Trump has the power to impose his sweeping tariffs, a key part of his economic strategy. Lower courts had ruled he had exceeded his authority.",
      "Carney met with Mr. Trump at the White House last month and has been trying to secure a trade deal to lower some tariffs on sectors like steel and aluminum. Tariffs are taking a toll on the aluminum, steel, auto and lumber sectors.",
      "More than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly 3.6 billion Canadian dollars ($2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border daily.",
      "On Wednesday, the Senate voted to approve a resolution that would block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Canada. In a 50 to 40 vote, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve the measure, which would terminate the national emergency used to impose tariffs on some goods from Canada.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Nov 2025 13:18:31 -0400",
    "summary": "The Grand Egyptian Museum has taken 30 years to become a reality, but finally opened its doors, with an equally grand opening ceremony.",
    "story": [
      "Cairo \u2014\u00a0Egypt's government hosted dozens of foreign leaders and dignitaries on Saturday as it held an official opening ceremony for the Grand Egyptian Museum, a $1 billion project decades in the making that was plagued by multiple delays and a ballooning of the budget.",
      "The GEM is one of the largest museums in the world, and the largest dedicated to a single civilization: ancient Egypt. Its subject matter spans some 7,000 years, from prehistory to the end of the Greek and Roman eras around 400 A.D.",
      "\"It is a great day for Egypt and for humanity. This is Egypt's gift to the world. It's a dream come true, after all these years, the GEM is finally and officially open,\" Nevine El-Aref, media adviser to the Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, told CBS News.",
      "The initial cost for the more than 5-million-square-foot, triangular-themed structure about a mile from the iconic pyramids of Giza was estimated at $500 million, but the final price tag was more than double that. Costing over $1 billion, the\u00a0project was funded through Egyptian resources and international cooperation.",
      "In front of the main entrance stands the imposing 53-foot-high Hanging Obelisk, the only such structure in the world. The obelisk itself is about 3,500 years old, but it sits suspended overhead on a modern structure with a glass floor, so visitors can peer up and view its ancient inscriptions from an angle never before possible.",
      "Beyond is the Grand Staircase, with 108 steps bringing people up the equivalent of six floors to the main galleries, with colossal statues on view the whole way up.",
      "The GEM has 12 primary exhibition halls, covering about 194,000 square feet.",
      "The number of artifacts on display has nearly doubled initial expectations thanks to Egypt's wealth of antiquities, with officials saying about 100,000 items will be housed in the halls.",
      "To put that in perspective, if a visitor were to spend one minute looking at each artifact on display in the museum, it would take almost 70 sleepless days to view the entire collection.",
      "The museum's triangular architecture radiates outward from its entrance toward the three main pyramids of Giza, aligning perfectly with their positions. Its walls and sloping ceilings follow the same lines, rising toward the pyramids' highest points, but not exceeding the height of the ancient structures, out of respect for their builders.",
      "The museum's interior offers stunning panoramic views of the pyramids. The concept may sound simple, but it required a significant reshaping of the local topography, including the excavation and removal of some 79 million cubic feet of sand, which took workers seven months.",
      "King Ramses II was there first",
      "In the entrance courtyard of the GEM, stands a massive, 3,200-year-old statue of King Ramses II. The statue was moved in 2006 from a busy square in central Cairo to a site near the Great Pyramids, where it stood awaiting the new landmark museum's construction.",
      "The 83-ton statue's journey took 10 hours, processing slowly through the streets of Egypt under heavy security as people watched on TV.",
      "Later Ramses was moved to a new permanent home, about 400 yards away, and the museum was built around it.",
      "King Tut's complete collection",
      "The GEM's main attraction, it could be argued, is the complete collection of the famous King Tutankhamun, the golden boy.",
      "All 5,398 items from the tomb of the 13th pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of ancient Egypt, who ruled from around 1333 to 1323 B.C., will be displayed together in one place for the first time since they were discovered by Howard Carter in 1922.",
      "The new showroom is six times the size of the one that previously housed much of the Tut collection, at the old Egyptian Museum in central Cairo.",
      "King Khufu's Boats",
      "The GEM also boasts the King Khufu's Boats Museum, showing the 4,500-year-old the boats that were designed to be used in the journey to the afterlife.",
      "The two royal boats were discovered in 1954 near the Pyramid of Khufu. It took experts more than 10 years to reassemble the first boat. It is now fully reconstructed and was moved to the museum in 2021. Visitors of the museum can also view the conservation work underway on the second one.",
      "Scholars believe they were either used in Khufu's funeral procession or they were intended for his journey with the sun god Re in the afterlife.",
      "The long road to the Grand Egyptian Museum",
      "The idea for a grand museum on this site in Egypt dates back more than 32 years. The government first allocated 117 acres for the project at the location in 1992.",
      "At the very beginning of 2002, Egypt launched a massive international architectural competition to find a winning design for the museum. A total of 2,227 architects from 103 countries applied to submit designs, and by August of that year, 1,550 from 83 countries had submitted conceptual drawings.",
      "A couple months later officials had whittled the options down to only 20 designs to put forward for a second stage. In July 2003, the prize - and the massive contract - was awarded to the Irish architectural firm Heneghan Peng.",
      "The plan was originally for the museum to open in 2010, but a series of events, including financial crises, political uprisings, the COVID-19 pandemic and regional wars, delayed the curtain raising.",
      "A total of 79 official delegations are expected to participate in the opening ceremony, including 39 delegations headed by kings, princes, and heads of state and government, a spokesman for the presidency said.",
      "Egyptian officials hope the new museum will boost the country's tourism industry, and with it, the still-struggling economy. They have predicted that the GEM will attract some 5 million visitors per year.",

      "The incident occurred at the Swamy Venkateswara Temple in the Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh state where hundreds of devotees had gathered to mark one of Hinduism's sacred days, \"Ekadashi,\" senior police officer K. V. Maheswra Reddy told the Associated Press.",
      "On this day, the devotees fast and offer prayers to Lord Vishnu, a key Hindu deity known as the preserver and protector of the universe, according\u00a0to BBC News.",
      "An initial investigation suggests that an iron grille meant to maintain the queue of worshippers at the temple broke, leading to the uncontrolled crowd surge, Reddy said.",

      "She has been charged with complicity in organized theft and criminal conspiracy with a view to committing a crime.",
      "The 38-year-old woman was in tears as she confirmed that she lives in the northern La Courneuve suburb of Paris, an AFP journalist said.",
      "At the request of the prosecution, the hearing continued behind closed doors.",
      "Earlier Saturday, the Paris public prosecutor's office did not specify how many suspects would be brought before the court.",
      "Last month, thieves wielding power tools raided the Louvre, the world's most visited art museum, in broad daylight, taking just seven minutes to steal jewelry worth an estimated $102 million.",
      "French authorities initially announced the arrest of two suspects, and this week prosecutors said that police had arrested five more people, including a prime suspect. The five detentions took place in and around Paris, particularly in Seine-Saint-Denis north of Paris.",
      "One of the five people arrested this week was released without charge on Friday, said his lawyers, Sofia Bougrine and Noemie Gorin.",
      "\"In these serious crime cases, we find that waves of arrests look more like drift nets,\" Bougrine told AFP on Saturday, pointing to what she said was the indiscriminate nature of some of the arrests.",

The second suspect is a 39-year-old unlicensed taxi driver from the Paris suburb of Aubervilliers. Both were known to the police for having committed thefts.",
      "The first was arrested as he was about to board a plane for Algeria at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport. The second was apprehended shortly after near his home, and there was no evidence to suggest that he was planning to go abroad, prosecutors said.",

      "Master jeweler and Parisian gem appraiser Stephen Portier told CBS News it would be difficult to sell the gems.",

    "summary": "The unidentified remains of the three people were returned late Friday to Israel, where they were being examined overnight.",
    "story": [
      "The remains of three people handed over by Hamas to the Red Cross this week did not belong to any of the hostages, an Israeli source told CBS News on Saturday. It is the latest setback that could undermine the U.S.-brokered ceasefire between\u00a0Israel and Hamas.",
      "The unidentified remains of the three people were returned late Friday to Israel, where they were examined overnight. At the time, a military official told the Associated Press that Israeli intelligence suggested they did not belong to any of the hostages taken by Hamas terrorists during the Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack in southern Israel that sparked the war. The Israeli official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office on Saturday confirmed that the remains did not belong to any of the hostages, without giving further details, the Associated Press reported. CBS News has reached out to Netanyahu's office for additional comment.",
      "The Israeli army declined to comment to CBS News on Saturday, saying it did not announce it received the bodies.",
      "\"The reports in question were not issued by us, therefore, we won't confirm their accuracy,\" an IDF spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "Hamas' armed wing said in a subsequent statement on Saturday that it had offered to hand over samples on Friday of unidentified bodies, but that Israel had refused to receive them and asked for the remains for examination.",
      "\"We handed the bodies over to stop the claims of Israel,\" the statement said.",
      "It's unclear who the remains belonged to.",
      "Since the\u00a0U.S.-brokered ceasefire\u00a0between Israel and Hamas took effect on Oct. 10, Palestinian militants have released the remains of 17 hostages that were held in Gaza for the past two years.",
      "But the process of returning the bodies of the last 11 remaining hostages, as called for under the truce deal, is progressing slowly, with militants releasing just one or two bodies every few days.",
      "The total number of Palestinian bodies returned by Israel since the ceasefire began stands at 225. Only 75 of those have been identified by families, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry. It is unclear if those returned were killed in Israel during the Oct. 7, 2023 attack, whether they died in Israeli custody as detainees or were recovered from Gaza by troops during the war.",
      "Under the ceasefire deal, Hamas released\u00a0all living Israeli hostages in return for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and wartime detainees. Israel pulled back its troops to a designated line within Gaza, halted its military offensive and increased aid into the territory.",
      "The fragile truce faced its\u00a0biggest challenge\u00a0earlier this week when Israel carried out strikes across Gaza that killed more than 100 people, following the killing of an Israeli soldier in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, and the incomplete return of hostages.",

      "Selling for nearly $1,000 a cup, a cafe in Dubai is offering the world's most expensive coffee, brewed from Panamanian beans sold at a premium price.",
      "The wealthy emirate is known for its extravagant ventures, including an enormous mall with an indoor ski area, the world's tallest building and an artificial island dotted with five-star hotels.",
      "\"The wait is finally over,\" Serkan Sagsoz, co-founder of the Julith cafe with the pricey offering,\u00a0said in a Facebook video. \"The world's most celebrated and highest graded coffee of all time has arrived at Julith.\"",
      "Located in an industrial neighborhood that has become a hotspot for coffee lovers, Julith plans to serve \"around 400 cups\" of the precious beverage starting on Saturday, Sagsoz told AFP.",
      "\"We felt Dubai was the perfect place for our investment,\" Sagsoz said.",
      "For a price tag of 3,600 dirhams (around $980), the brew offers an experience of floral and fruity flavors reminiscent of tea.",
      "\"There are white floral notes like jasmine, citrus flavors like orange and bergamot and a hint of apricot and peach,\" said Sagsoz, who previously ran a cafe in his native Turkey.",
      "\"It's like honey, delicate and sweet,\" he said.",
      "Dubai notched a Guinness World Record for the world's most expensive cup of coffee last month, when Roasters offered one for 2,500 dirhams.",
      "The new record staggered some people, though residents also said it was par for the course for the desert city with a luxury lifestyle.",
      "\"It's very shocking but at the same time, it's Dubai,\" said Ines, who did not give her last name.",
      "\"For wealthy people, it's just another experience they can boast about,\" added another resident, Maeva.",
      "The Julith cafe bought its beans at an auction in Panama after a tough battle that lasted many hours and drew hundreds of bids.",
      "It claimed to have paid the highest price ever for coffee.",
      "Twenty kilograms of the beans went for around 2.2 million dirhams, or $600,000, Julith said in a press release.",
      "Asian buyers, Emirati coffee enthusiasts and coffee bean collectors have since reached out to the cafe in the hopes of securing some of the \"Nido 7 Geisha\" beans, which are grown on a plantation near Panama's Baru volcano.",
      "But the cafe said it does not plan to share its treasure, beyond a small amount reserved for Dubai's ruling family.",
      "Coffee prices surging in U.S.",
      "The pricey cup of coffee is being offered as the cost of roasted coffee has jumped 18.9% in the U.S., according to the most recent Consumer Price Index data for September.",
      "The average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee reached a record high of $9.14 per pound in September, labor\u00a0data\u00a0shows. That's well over double the price from December 2019, when a pound of ground coffee cost just over $4.",
      "Several factors are driving this increase. First, volatile weather, including both heavy rain and droughts in major coffee-producing countries, such as Brazil and Colombia, is depressing crop yields, Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru, told CBS News.",
      "Lempert also said American tariffs on foreign imports are having an impact on domestic coffee prices. As of 2023, the U.S. imported about 80% its unroasted beans from Latin America,\u00a0according\u00a0to the USDA, with Hawaii and Puerto Rico the only U.S. states or territories that produce much coffee.",
      "The Trump administration this year has imposed new tariffs on several major coffee producers that export to the U.S. That includes a 50% levy on Brazil, which has led producers there to withhold shipments as they negotiate with American roasters over who will absorb the added costs, according to investment bank UBS.",
      "In a September\u00a0report, the International Coffee Organization cited uncertainty around coffee tariffs as one catalyst impacting supply in the U.S. Coffee \"cannot be produced in the U.S. on a large enough scale to meet domestic demand,\" the trade group noted.",

    "story": [
      "Spanish police said Friday they have busted an international ring suspected of smuggling nitrous oxide, commonly known as \"laughing gas,\" and contraband tobacco.",
      "Officers confiscated 5,184 liters of nitrous oxide from a warehouse and the home of the suspected owner of the trucks used by the ring in the southern province of Malaga, police said in a statement.",
      "Authorities also seized more than 2.5 million contraband cigarettes from a truck in the eastern province of Alicante while members of the group were unloading the cargo, the statement added. Police released a video showing officers unloading dozens of boxes from the truck as well as footage of a warehouse holding hundreds of canisters.",
      "Authorities said the network, composed of Spanish and Eastern European nationals, used legitimate shipments to France and other European countries to transport the nitrous oxide and contraband tobacco.",

CBS News Confirmed found dozens of videos depicting people inhaling nitrous oxide on TikTok, YouTube and X with views in the hundreds of thousands. In some videos, the gas is inhaled as part of a challenge or social media dare. Other videos feature songs dedicated to the high from the gas.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Thursday announced it would set the lowest refugee admissions cap in U.S. history, allocating just 7,500 spots for this fiscal year, mostly for Afrikaners who it has claimed are facing racial discrimination in South Africa for being White.",
      "The previous lowest refugee ceiling was set by the first Trump administration in 2020, when it allocated 15,000 spots for fiscal year 2021.",
      "The announcement Thursday is the latest effort by Mr. Trump and his top aides to dramatically scale back the decades-old U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, a humanitarian policy for vulnerable people fleeing war and violence across the world that once enjoyed robust bipartisan support.",
      "Mr. Trump suspended the U.S. refugee program hours after taking office for a second time earlier this year, citing strains on American communities receiving the refugees and concerns about the vetting process. Weeks later, his administration made an exemption for Afrikaners, calling them victims of racial oppression.",
      "In an order posted on the federal government's journal of regulations, Mr. Trump said the 7,500 refugee spots for fiscal year 2026 would \"primarily be allocated among Afrikaners\" and \"other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.\" Fiscal year 2026 started on Oct. 1 and culminates at the end of September 2026.",
      "The South African government has vehemently denied Afrikaners and other White South Africans are being persecuted. Before the 1990s, White South Africans enforced a brutal system of apartheid over the country's Black majority.",
      "Afrikaners are an ethnic group in South Africa made up of descendants of European settlers and colonists, mostly from the Netherlands, who first arrived there in the 1600s. The Trump administration welcomed the first group of Afrikaners granted refugee status in May.",
      "The prioritization of Afrikaners \u2014 while refugees from places like Afghanistan, Myanmar and Sudan plagued by ethnic violence and armed conflict are being blocked from entering the U.S. \u2014 has led to accusations of preferential treatment among refugee advocates.",
      "Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president of Global Refuge, one of several national groups that traditionally have worked with the U.S. government to resettle refugees, said Mr. Trump's decision \"lowers our moral standing.\"",
      "\"At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the program's purpose as well as its credibility,\" she added.",
      "Officially created in 1980, the U.S. refugee program was designed to offer a safe harbor to people abroad fleeing persecution because of their race, religion, political views or membership in a social group.",
      "Before the second Trump administration took office, refugees were typically referred to the U.S. by United Nations officials and spent months or years in third-party countries undergoing interviews, as well as security and medical checks, before being granted entry into the U.S. The process is distinct from the asylum system, which can be accessed by foreigners already on American soil, including those who enter the U.S. illegally.",
      "Over the past decades, most of those admitted into the U.S. as refugees have come from countries in Africa and Asia plagued by war, ethnic strife or repression of minority groups, State Department figures show.",
      "After refugee admissions plummeted to a record low of 11,000 in fiscal year 2021 \u2014 mostly due to Trump-era cuts and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 the Biden administration dramatically expanded the program.",
      "In fiscal year 2024, the Biden administration welcomed more than 100,000 refugees, the highest level since the 1990s, according to government data. Officials stopped publishing refugee admissions data after Mr. Trump returned to the White House.",

      "The storm's wind speeds dropped after its landfalls over Jamaica and Cuba, and its winds had weakened further to 90 mph when the hurricane center issued its 2 a.m. EDT advisory Friday. That made Melissa a Category 1, the lowest on the\u00a0Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Melissa still had 90 mph winds three hours later.",
      "By that time, the NHC said, Melissa's core was about 255 miles north of Bermuda and it was hurrying northeast at 41 mph through the Atlantic's cooler waters.",
      "The storm is expected to pass to the south of Newfoundland, Canada, as a post-tropical cyclone and continue to weaken over the weekend.",
      "High swells generated by Melissa will continue to affect portions of Hispaniola (the island shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti), Cuba, the Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands and Bermuda during the next couple of days, and will also reach the Northeast U.S. coast. The hurricane center warns of the risk of \"life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\"",
      "Climate change has been fueling the storm",
      "Above-average Atlantic Ocean temperatures, made worse by climate change, helped Melissa rapidly intensify into a major hurricane, according to climate scientists.",
      "\"That part of the Atlantic is extremely warm right now \u2014 around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 2 to 3 degrees Celsius above normal,\" Akshay Deoras, a meteorologist at the University of Reading in the U.K., told The Associated Press. \"And it's not just the surface. The deeper layers of the ocean are also unusually warm, providing a vast reservoir of energy for the storm.\"",
      "Stronger winds, heavier rainfall and higher sea level rise make storm surge more intense.",
      "Preliminary data from Climate Central, a nonprofit group of scientists monitoring the effects of climate change, suggests that climate change increased Melissa's wind speed by 10 mph.",
      "\"Climate change is fundamentally changing our weather. It does not mean that every single tropical cyclone is going to go through rapid or super-rapid intensification. However, in our warmer world, it will continue to increase the likelihood of storms going through rapid and super-rapid intensification,\" Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central, told the AP.",

    "story": [
      "Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center \u2014\u00a0China launched its Shenzhou-21 spacecraft on Friday, carrying a new three-person crew to man the country's Tiangong space station on a mission focused on scientific research. The replacement crew includes China's youngest-ever taikonaut \u2014 as China's space program calls its astronauts \u2014   and, for the first time since Beijing launched its program, it will also include live mammals.",
      "The Shenzhou-21 and its crew blasted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China atop a Long March-2F rocket just before midnight on Friday, or about 11 a.m. Eastern.",
      "The taikonauts on board \u2014 Zhang Lu, Wu Fei, and Zhang Hongzhang \u2014 will rotate in so the trio currently on board the Chinese space station from the Shenzhou-20 mission, which launched on April 24, can come back home after their six-months in space. The exact date of their return has yet to be announced.",
      "The Shenzhou-21 crew are scheduled to conduct a total of 27 scientific and applied research projects during their mission, focusing on multiple fields including space life sciences, biotechnology, space medicine, space materials science, microgravity fluid physics and combustion and new space technologies, according to information provided by the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).",
      "Along with the taikonauts, Shenzhou-21 is carrying four mice \u2014 two females and two males \u2014 the first live mammals ever carried by China into space. Two previous missions to the Tiangong station carried live fish.",
      "The taikonauts will study the effects of microgravity and confined space conditions on the behavioral patterns of mice.",
      "The Shenzhou-21 crew, with Lu as their commander are scheduled to live aboard the space station for approximately six months, just like the crew they are replacing.",
      "It won't be the first visit to the station for Lu, who previously served on the Shenzhou-15 mission.",
      "The other two crew members are making their first spaceflight, and Flight Engineer Wu, born in 1993, will be the youngest taikonaut ever sent into space by his nation.",
      "\"I feel incomparably lucky,\" he told reporters Thursday. \"Being able to integrate my personal dreams into the glorious journey of China's space program is the greatest fortune this era has bestowed upon me.\"",
      "Crowds gathered around the Jiuquan launch site on Friday ahead of the countdown, and a man who identified himself to CBS News only as Mr. Zhao said he was \"very excited\" to be there with his 7-year-old son, \"hoping to plant the seed of a space dream into his heart.\"",
      "China's growing \"space dream\"",
      "China has ramped up its space program unilaterally since being excluded from the International Space Station project \u2014   largely over the U.S. government's concerns about the Chinese military's full control over its program \u2014   to achieve its \"space dream\" under President Xi Jinping.",
      "It has manned the Tiangong station since 2021, and there are now plans to bring the first non-Chinese crewmember aboard the facility.",
      "China will arrange for one Pakistani national to undertake a short-term space mission in the future, the CMSA has said, following the signing of a cooperation agreement between the two countries in February.",
      "The process to select a Pakistani national for training has already begun, along with planning for training programs and to prepare logistical support for Pakistanis under consideration.",
      "Following the selection process, two Pakistani nationals will travel to China to train alongside Chinese taikonauts for future missions, the CMSA said.",
      "CMSA spokesperson Zhang Jingbo said during a news conference this week ahead of the Shenzhou-21 launch that China would welcome international partners to participate in missions aboard its space station.",
      "The work done on China's space station coincides with and often compliments the nation's efforts to be the first nation to land a person on the moon's surface in more than 40 years. Chinese officials have made it a public goal to land taikonauts on the moon's surface by 2030, and eventually to build a lunar base.",
      "China has already landed unmanned probes on the moon, including the first ever to land and collect samples from the celestial body's far side just last year.",
      "\"Overall, the research and construction has been running smoothly, with China aiming to achieve the goal of landing Chinese astronauts on the moon before 2030,\" Zhang said this week ahead of the looming Shenzhou launch, indicating that the CMSA remains on track to meet its lunar goals.",

      "In the ruins of Black River, which the Jamaican government has described as Hurricane Melissa's \"ground zero,\" people are scrambling for relief.",
      "\"People are hungry,\" said Monique Powell as she stood watch over a stash of groceries and household items for herself and a group of residents from another hurricane-torn community nearby.",
      "Melissa came ashore just west of Black River on Tuesday as\u00a0one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes on record, leaving up to 90% of all structures in the town without roofs as it snapped power lines and toppled concrete structures.",
      "The storm was being blamed for at least 51 deaths, mostly in Haiti and Jamaica. It also hit Cuba hard. Authorities said 19 people were killed in Jamaica, at least 31 in Haiti and at least one in the Dominican Republic.",
      "Melissa was over the open waters of the Atlantic after racing past Bermuda\u00a0early Friday, packing 90 mph maximum sustained winds, the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said. It became a post-tropical cyclone by late Friday morning, the center said.",
      "In Jamaica, helicopters hovered over isolated communities, dropping food as crews rushed to reopen roads.",
      "\"You are not forgotten,\" said Daryl Vaz, energy and transport minister.",
      "Christopher Boxe, a restaurant owner in Kingston, Jamaica, noted the stark differences in how various parts of the island fared.",
      "\"This morning has felt like we live in two Jamaicas, you know, Jamaica, where, like most people are going to work in Kingston and their homes have minimal damage, and then you have the other half, which looks just devastated. And it's heartbreaking,\" he told CBS News.",
      "More than 7,000 people remained in shelters, with 66% of the island without power and around half of the nation's water systems offline, officials said at a news conference Friday. People clutched cash as they formed long lines at the few gas stations and supermarkets open in affected areas.",
      "Officials said the dead in Jamaica included a child, and they expected the death toll to keep rising. In one isolated community, residents pleaded with officials to remove the body of a victim tangled in a tree. On Thursday, dozens of U.S. search-and-rescue experts landed in Jamaica along with their dogs.",
      "No reported deaths but Cuba far from spared",
      "In Cuba, heavy equipment began to clear blocked roads and highways and the military helped rescue people trapped in isolated communities and at risk from landslides.",
      "No deaths were reported after the Civil Defense evacuated more than 735,000 people across eastern Cuba ahead of the storm. Residents were slowly starting to return home Thursday.",
      "The town of El Cobre in the eastern province of Santiago de Cuba was one of the hardest hit. Home to some 7,000 people, it is also the site of the Basilica of Our Lady of Charity, the patron saint of Cuba who is deeply venerated by Catholics and practitioners of Santer\u00eda, an Afro-Cuban religion.",
      "\"We went through this very badly. So much wind, so much wind. Zinc roofs were torn off. Some houses completely collapsed. It was a disaster,\" said Odalys Ojeda, a 61-year-old retiree, as she looked up at the sky from her living room, where the roof and other parts of the house were torn away.",
      "Even the basilica was hit.",
      "\"Here at the sanctuary, the carpentry, stained glass and even the masonry suffered extensive damage,\" Father Rogelio Dean Puerta said.",
      "A televised Civil Defense meeting chaired by President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel didn't provide an official estimate of the damage. However, officials from the affected provinces \u2014 Santiago, Granma, Holgu\u00edn, Guant\u00e1namo and Las Tunas \u2014 reported losses of roofs, power lines and fiber optic telecommunications cables, as well as roads cut off, isolating communities, and heavy losses in banana, cassava and coffee plantations.",
      "Many communities were still without electricity, internet and telephone service because of downed transformers and power lines.",
      "In an unusual statement on Thursday, the U.S. State Department said Washington was \"ready to assist the Cuban people.\" It said the U.S. \"is prepared to provide immediate humanitarian assistance directly and through local partners who can deliver it more effectively to those in need.\"",
      "The statement didn't specify how the cooperation would be coordinated or whether contact had been made with the Cuban government, with which it maintains a bitter conflict that includes six decades of economic and financial sanctions.",
      "Haiti reeling",
      "Melissa also unleashed catastrophic flooding in Haiti, where authorities reported at least 31 people killed and 21 others missing, mostly in the country's southern region. More than 15,000 people also remained in shelters.",
      "\"It is a sad moment for the country,\" said Laurent Saint-Cyr, president of Haiti's transitional presidential council.",
      "He said officials expect the death toll to rise and noted that the government was mobilizing resources to search for people and provide emergency relief.",

      "But in the U.S., the song took 17 more years and being featured in the movie \"Wayne's World\" to turn into a mega hit. Today, it has almost 3 billion streams on Spotify, which is the most for any 20th century song.",
      "\"It changed the dynamics of music\"",
      "The hit song came to life in the Welsh countryside at Rockfield Studios, which was set up in the 1960s by two farmers and musicians, Charles and Kingsley Ward.",
      "Queen's band members \u2014 Freddie Mercury, John Deacon, Roger Taylor and Brian May \u2014 lived at Rockfield for two weeks in 1975, working on their fourth album, \"A Night at the Opera.\"",

      "In the main studio, which is still in use, Queen laid down the song in three sections \u2014 choral, hard rock and opera. The sound was revolutionary, as was the length of the track at almost six minutes.",
      "\"It's probably the greatest record ever made, a rock record, because it changed the dynamics of music, and people now realize they can do anything with music,\" Ward said.",

    "story": [
      "Around 700 people have been killed in three days of election protests in Tanzania, the main opposition party said Friday, with protesters still on the streets in the midst of an internet blackout.",
      "President Samia Suluhu Hassan had sought to cement her position and silence critics in her party with an emphatic win in Wednesday's election, in which her main challengers were either jailed or barred from standing.",
      "But the vote descended into chaos as crowds took to the streets of Dar es Salaam and other cities, tearing down her posters and attacking police and polling stations, leading to an internet shutdown and curfew.",
      "With foreign journalists largely banned from covering the election and a communications blackout entering its third day, information from the ground has been scarce.",
      "The main opposition party, Chadema, said clashes continued between protesters and security forces in the commercial hub on Friday.",
      "\"As we speak the figure for deaths in Dar (es Salaam) is around 350 and for Mwanza it is 200-plus. Added to figures from other places around the country, the overall figure is around 700,\" Chadema spokesman John Kitoka told the French news agency AFP.",
      "\"The death toll could be much higher,\" he warned, saying killings could be happening during the nighttime curfew.",
      "A security source told AFP they were hearing reports of more than 500 dead: \"Maybe 700-800 in the whole country.\"",
      "\"We are talking hundreds of deaths,\" a diplomatic source told AFP.",
      "The United Nations said \"credible reports\" indicated 10 dead, in the first information released by an international body.",
      "\"We are alarmed by the deaths and injuries that have occurred in the ongoing election-related protests in Tanzania. Reports we have received indicate that at least 10 people were killed,\" U.N. human rights office spokesperson Seif Magango said, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Amnesty International said it had information about at least 100 people being killed.",
      "Multiple hospitals and health clinics were too afraid to talk directly to AFP.",
      "Hassan had yet to comment on the unrest and local news sites had not been updated since Wednesday.",
      "The only official statement came from army chief Jacob Mkunda late Thursday, who called the protesters \"criminals.\"",
      "In Zanzibar, a tourist hotspot island with its own semi-autonomous government, a spokesman for Hassan's Revolution Party (Chama Cha Mapinduzi, or CCM) said internet access would be restored when the situation calmed down.",
      "\"The government knows why they have shut the internet. There are people who have tried creating tension in Dar es Salaam and they have destroyed a lot of things,\" party spokesman Hamis Mbeto told reporters.",
      "'They have robbed the people'",
      "In Zanzibar, the CCM had already been declared winners of the local vote on Thursday. The opposition party, ACT-Wazalendo, rejected the result, however, saying: \"They have robbed the people of Zanzibar of their voice ... The only solution to deliver justice is through a fresh election.\"",
      "A senior party official told AFP that ballot boxes had been stuffed, people allowed to vote multiple times without showing IDs and election observers kicked out of counting rooms.",
      "At a meeting place for opposition supporters in Zanzibar, there was dismay and fear.",
      "\"There has never been a credible election since 1995,\" said a 70-year-old man, referring to Tanzania's first multi-party vote.",
      "None of those interviewed gave their names.",
      "\"We are afraid of speaking because they might come to our houses and pick us up,\" said another.",
      "Analysts say Hassan wanted an emphatic victory in this week's election to cement her position, and the authorities banned the main opposition party, Chadema, and put its leader on trial for treason.",
      "In the run-up to the vote, rights groups condemned a \"wave of terror\" in the east African nation, including a string of high-profile abductions that escalated in the final days.",

      "Benedetti said that the aviation refueling company at Barajas was afraid of breaching U.S. sanctions on Petro.",
      "\"The companies that sell fuel or provide cleaning services or the boarding stairs (at airports) are almost always American,\" Benedetti said.",

    "summary": "NATO and U.S. allies try to assuage fears over bolstering Russia as the Pentagon announces a U.S. troop reduction in Eastern Europe.",
    "story": [
      "NATO and some of America's allies in the transatlantic alliance have sought to ease concerns over the Trump administration's move to reduce the U.S. military's presence in Europe amid Russia's ongoing assault on Ukraine and as it's accused of ramping up hybrid warfare against NATO nations.",
      "The Pentagon announced Thursday that it was reducing the number of U.S. troops deployed in Eastern Europe. U.S. officials told CBS News that around 700 U.S. airborne troops who have been deployed in Germany, Romania and Poland\u00a0would come home and not be replaced.",
      "In a statement, the U.S. Army Europe and Africa said it was part of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's \"deliberate process to ensure a balanced U.S. military force posture,\" and \"not an American withdrawal from Europe or a signal of lessened commitment to NATO and Article 5. Rather this is a positive sign of increased European capability and responsibility.\"",
      "\"Our NATO allies are meeting President Trump's call to take primary responsibility for the conventional defense of Europe,\" the Army said. \"This force posture adjustment will not change the security environment in Europe.\"",
      "NATO and allies stress \"U.S.'s continued commitment\" to Europe",
      "On Thursday, appearing keen to ease such concerns, Estonian Minister of Defense Hanno Pevkur said in a statement that the U.S. had \"made a significant decision to maintain its military presence in Estonia, reaffirming the U.S.'s continued commitment to the defense of the region and\u00a0NATO's entire eastern flank.\"",
      "\"We are working to further strengthen the U.S. military presence in our region,\" he added.",
      "In September, Estonia said Russian military jets had violated the country's airspace for\u00a012 minutes, just days after Poland said more than 20 Russian drones\u00a0entered its airspace. This week, Lithuania closed its border with Russia's close ally Belarus, after accusing both countries of a \"deliberate escalation of hybrid warfare.\"",
      "NATO says deterrence measures along its eastern flank have been \"massively reinforced\" over the last decade \"as a direct result of Russia's behavior.\" That boundary runs from the Arctic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south.",
      "The reinforcements include U.S. troops, but the Trump administration has pushed its European NATO allies hard to take more responsibility \u2014 and bear more of the financial burden \u2014 for their own security, announcing earlier this year that it would make the Indo-Pacific a primary foreign policy focus, rather than Europe, despite the ongoing war in Ukraine.",
      "\"The decision was expected,\" Romania's Ministry of Defense said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0Wednesday, referring to the announcement of the U.S. troop reduction.",
      "U.S. Ambassador to NATO\u00a0Matthew Whitaker said\u00a0in a social media post that America's partnership with Romania \"remains stronger than ever,\" and reiterated the Pentagon's message that it was in response to European forces' increased capacities.",
      "The reassurances have not quelled debate about whether the move could be just the beginning of a wider U.S. withdrawal from Europe. The Ukrainian newspaper\u00a0Kyiv Post\u00a0reported Friday that further American troop reductions are expected, with troops to be pulled from Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary by the end of the year.",
      "There was no immediate public response to the report from the Pentagon or the Trump administration.",
      "NATO has also sought to ease concerns, with a senior military official from the alliance telling CBS News on Thursday that, \"even with this adjustment, the U.S. force posture in Europe remains larger than it has been for many years.\"",
      "\"U.S. commitment to NATO is clear,\" the official said. \"President Trump and his administration have reiterated this time and again. NATO has robust defense plans in place and we are working to ensure we maintain the right forces and capabilities in place to deter and defend each other.\"",
      "Concern in Washington, from both sides of the aisle",
      "The announcement drew bipartisan criticism in Washington, with some senior lawmakers warning it could embolden Russia and undermine the NATO alliance.",
      "In a\u00a0joint statement\u00a0issued Thursday by the U.S. House Armed Services Committee, the chairmen of that committee and the corresponding Senate body \u2014 both Republicans \u2014 said they strongly opposed the change in the U.S. deployment in Romania, which they said \"appears uncoordinated and directly at odds with the President's strategy.\"",
      "Senator Roger Wicker and Representative Mike Rogers, in the statement, also indicated that they believed the Pentagon could make further reductions to the U.S. deployment in Europe.",
      "\"We strongly oppose the decision not to maintain the rotational U.S. brigade in Romania and the Pentagon's process for its ongoing force posture review that may result in further drawdowns of U.S. forces from Eastern Europe,\" said the Republican lawmakers.",
      "\"On March 19, we\u00a0stated\u00a0that we will not accept significant changes to our warfighting structure that are made without a rigorous interagency process, coordination with combatant commanders and the Joint Staff, and collaboration with Congress,\" said Wicker and Rogers. \"Unfortunately, this appears to be exactly what is being attempted.\"",
      "On Thursday, Rep. Mike Turner, also a Republican and the head of the U.S. delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, said he was \"concerned by reports of reductions of US forces in Romania.\"",
      "\"Congress has been clear that US force posture across Europe must remain robust and resolute. Russia's aggressive actions against Eastern Flank countries through intentional airspace incursions underscores Russia's ambition beyond Ukraine,\" said Turner. \"It is in our national security interests to support our NATO Allies as they rightly ramp up their investments in their defense capabilities.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,\u00a0called the decision\u00a0to reduce the U.S. presence in the region \"deeply misguided\" in a statement released Thursday.",

    "story": [
      "Geneva \u2014\u00a0The United Nations human rights chief said Friday that U.S. military strikes against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean allegedly carrying illegal drugs from South America are \"unacceptable\" and must stop.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T\u00fcrk called for an investigation into the strikes, in what appeared to mark the first such condemnation of its kind from a U.N. organization.",
      "Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for T\u00fcrk's office, relayed his message on Friday at a regular U.N. briefing: \"These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable. The U.S. must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.\"",
      "She said T\u00fcrk believed \"airstrikes by the United States of America on boats in the Caribbean and in the Pacific violate international human rights law.\"",
      "President Trump has justified the attacks on what his administration calls \"narco-trafficking vessels\" as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the U.S., but the campaign against drug cartels has been divisive among countries in the region.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the latest U.S. military strike in the campaign on Wednesday. He said it targeted a boat carrying drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Four people on board the vessel were killed. It was the 14th strike and the 15th boat destroyed since the campaign began in early September, while the death toll has grown to at least 61.",
      "In some but not all of the strikes, U.S. officials have said\u00a0the boats were linked to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which the Trump administration has designated a terrorist organization.",
      "The administration announced just weeks ago that it had determined the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations, including Tren de Aargua.",
      "The administration announced that determination in a notification to Congress in September, after the first couple strikes on alleged drug boats in the Mediterranean. That notice referred to three individuals killed in a Sept. 15 strike as \"unlawful combatants,\" which is the same term former President George W. Bush's administration used to describe members of al-Qaeda and other terrorist networks.",
      "After Sept. 11, 2001, the U.S. Congress authorized the use of military force against the terrorist organizations responsible for the terrorist attacks carried out that day. Congress has not yet authorized the use of military force to target drug cartels, and many details of the operations remain unclear, including which U.S. forces are carrying out the strikes, based on what specific intelligence, and with what weapons.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro has been among the most vocal critics of the strikes, questioning their legality under international law, and their efficacy in combating the gangs that traffic narcotics during an interview with CBS News. The Trump administration sanctioned Petro last week, saying he had allowed \"drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.\"",
      "Shamdasani noted the U.S. explanations of the efforts as an anti-drug and counter-terrorism campaign, but said countries have long agreed that the fight against illicit drug trafficking is a law-enforcement matter governed by \"careful limits\" placed on the use of lethal force.",
      "Intentional use of lethal force is allowed only as a last resort against someone representing \"an imminent threat to life,\" she said. \"Otherwise, it would amount to a violation of the right of life and constitute extrajudicial killings.\"",
      "The strikes are taking place \"outside the context\" of armed conflict or active hostilities, Shamdasani said.",

      "None of the French crown jewels stolen in the brazen daytime robbery of the landmark Louvre Museum had been located 10 days after the heist, the Paris prosecutor said Wednesday, and\u00a0two suspects detained so far\u00a0were formally charged with theft and conspiracy to commit a crime.",
      "\"I want to remain hopeful that [the jewels] will be found and they can be brought back to the Louvre, and more broadly to the nation,\" Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau told reporters.",
      "She said the two suspects, who were arrested Saturday, partially admitted to a role in the heist.",
      "The jewels date back hundreds of years and are considered national treasures with an estimated value of some $102 million. Experts have told CBS News the elaborate pieces of jewelry may have already been broken down into their component parts, greatly diminishing their value, and they may never be found.",
      "At least four people in total were seen on security camera video taking part in the robbery on Oct. 19, and Beccuau said at a news conference in the French capital on Wednesday afternoon that her office could not rule out the culprits being part of a larger criminal gang.",
      "Dozens of detectives have been on the trail of the four thieves, who used a cherry picker lift and cutting gear to break into a first-floor gallery at the world-renowned museum and then fled with the jewels.",
      "But few details have emerged so far about how investigators have managed to track down the culprits, some of whom wore balaclavas and high-visibility vests.",
      "The two men charged in connection with the heist will remain in custody and await a trial.",
      "A source close to the case this weekend said the men in their 30s were known to the police for committing thefts, and Beccuau said they were believed to be the ones who actually broke into the museum gallery, based, in part, on DNA evidence.",
      "The two men hailed from Seine-Saint-Denis, a region just outside Paris, and one was arrested as he was about to board a plane for Algeria, the source said, requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.",

      "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel joins \u2018Fox News Live\u2019 to discuss the peanut allergy study and his new book, 'The Miracles Among Us.'",
      "Early peanut introduction could help to curb allergies in kids, new research suggests.",
      "Exposing children to peanuts when they are 4 to 11 months old \u2014 instead of waiting until they are 3, as previously recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics \u2014 appears to be making a dent in the number of peanut allergy diagnoses, the study published in Pediatrics suggests.",

      "Hill, one of the study authors, noted that new-onset food allergies overall dropped by 36% in that age group.",
      "Peanuts are one of the primary causes of serious allergic reactions in children. These reactions happen when the body\u2019s immune system overreacts to peanuts by producing a substance called immunoglobulin E (IgE), which can lead to anaphylaxis \u2014 a severe, sometimes life-threatening allergic response, the researchers noted in a news release.",
      "Early peanut introduction could help to curb allergies in kids, new research published in Pediatrics suggests. (iStock)",
      "About 4% of children are affected by these types of food allergies, which can cause hives, difficulty breathing, swelling and vomiting. These symptoms can be immediate and life-threatening, experts told Fox News Digital.",
      "Beyond peanuts, other common food allergens include milk, egg and wheat, according to the report.",
      "Evolving advice",
      "Before 2015, it was standard practice to caution parents about peanut exposure for children under 3 years of age. Then in 2015, a landmark study \u2014 the Learning Early About Peanut Allergy (LEAP) trial \u2014 sparked a change in clinical practice.",
      "The study found that for infants who had severe eczema or an egg allergy, exposing them to peanuts when they were between 4 and 11 months old could reduce peanut allergy risk by 81%.",
      "Exposing children to peanuts when they are 4 to 11 months old \u2014 instead of waiting until they are 3, as previously recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics \u2014 appears to be reducing the number of peanut allergy diagnoses. (iStock)",
      "Based on the LEAP trial, leading organizations in pediatric allergy and immunology revised their guidelines for clinical practice in 2015 and 2017, allowing early exposure to peanuts for high-risk children.",
      "\"It just seems like there's this window of tolerance during early infancy.\"",
      "The guidelines were updated again in 2021, encouraging the introduction of peanut, egg and other major food allergens as early as 4 to 6 months for all children \u2014 including those without a history of prior reaction, according to health experts.",
      "\"It just seems like there's this window of tolerance during early infancy, so if we introduced the foods during that window, you will prevent food allergy,\" Dr. Susan Schuval, chief of the Division of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology at Stony Brook Children's Hospital in New York, told Fox News Digital.",
      "EATING BLUEBERRIES EARLIER IN LIFE COULD EASE ALLERGIES, STRENGTHEN IMMUNITY, NEW STUDY FINDS",
      "\"If you wait until after that window, the child will be more predisposed to having a food allergy,\" added Schuval, who was not part of the study.",
      "Positive outcomes",
      "Hill and his team of researchers focused on the effects of the revised practice guidelines from 2015 and 2017 but did not include the 2021 revisions. They analyzed electronic health records from multiple clinics in several states to determine whether the policy changes were having an effect.",

      "Food allergies can cause hives, difficulty breathing, swelling and vomiting, which can be immediate and life-threatening. (iStock)",

      "Hill told Fox News Digital he's \"hopeful that our findings will help to spread awareness that early allergen introduction is safe and effective.\"",
      "While early exposure may not completely eliminate allergies to peanuts and other foods, the drop in rates of food allergy diagnoses is promising, the researchers said. They also emphasized the importance of consistent early introduction in clinical practice settings.",

      "\"Our findings have relevance [for] those of us who treat patients [and] those caring for infants \u2014 and more awareness, education and advocacy could further increase the positive results we observed in this study,\" Hill said.",
      "Not all parents may be comfortable with these revised guidelines, health experts told Fox News Digital.",
      "Parents are encouraged to discuss any concerns with their pediatrician before introducing potential food allergens. (iStock)",

      "These effects can sometimes linger even after the person has recovered from the infection.

It\u2019s a very common sentiment. There\u2019s social media accounts dedicated to tracking whether Trump has died.\"",
      "Brennen VanderVeen, program counsel with the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said that one issue with the charges in Stinson\u2019s case was that it was not clear whom Stinson was soliciting to carry out the crime.",
      "\"Solicitation is when it\u2019s directly tied to the crime.

(He explained in a lengthy public memo that he did so because the press movant were seeking record that Pence himself had discussed publicly.)",

      "In the TikTok clip, filmed at the Naval Observatory residence, Vance opens the door in a dark suit and red tie, smiling as he tells trick-or-treaters, \"Happy Halloween, kids ... remember, say thank you!\" The line is a playful callback to the \"you didn\u2019t say thank you\" meme before he spins under purple lights to the eerie \"Twilight Zone\" theme.",
      "The 41-year-old vice president\u2019s video racked up more than 250,000 likes and 14 million views within hours, an extraordinary number for a political post, and drew thousands of comments across Instagram, X and Facebook.",
      "Vance first became the butt of the \"fat JD with curly hair\" meme after a tense White House exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February. Critics edited a photo of Vance with exaggerated features and wild hair, pairing it with captions like, \"you didn\u2019t say please\" or \"you didn\u2019t say thank you.\"",
      "VANCE PAUSES NORTH CAROLINA SPEECH FOR BOY WHO SAID HE \u2018SKIPPED SCHOOL\u2019 TO ASK FOR A SELFIE",
      "Vance shared a close-up selfie on X of himself as the viral 'fat JD' meme that quickly racked up millions of views this Halloween. (@JDVance via X)",
      "Rather than ignore the ridicule, Vance embraced it. Earlier this week, the White House X account joined the online fun, posting mock \"costume package\" images of political figures, including a \"JD Vance Costume\" that jokingly \"does not include the fat JD curly hair.\" Vance\u2019s own Halloween post essentially completed the gag by adding that missing piece himself.",
      "Within hours, the vice president\u2019s post was trending. Screenshots flooded social media, with one user calling him \"the best VP ever\" and another saying, \"JD just won 2028.\" Elon Musk responded simply with a laughing emoji.",
      "Even some critics gave credit. One commenter on X said, \"he did the meme lol.\" Users quickly remixed the Halloween look with the original meme, adding jump cuts and effects as it spread across platforms.",

      "For a White House that thrives on viral content, Vance\u2019s light-hearted stunt fits seamlessly into the Trump administration\u2019s digital playbook. The comms shop for President Trump has long embraced meme culture and rapid-fire online humor, sometimes even powered by AI.",

Most of the content in the deep web is legal but simply restricted to specific users.",
      "The dark web, however, is where anonymity and illegality intersect. It requires special software such as Tor to access, and much of its activity happens behind encryption and invitation-only walls. Tor, short for The Onion Router, was originally developed by the U.S. Navy for secure communication but has since become a haven for both privacy advocates and criminals.",
      "It anonymizes users by routing traffic through multiple encrypted layers, making it almost impossible to trace where a request truly came from. This anonymity allows criminals to communicate, sell data and conduct illegal trade with reduced risk of exposure.",
      "Over time, the dark web has become a hub for criminal commerce. Marketplaces once operated like eBay for illegal goods, offering everything from drugs and stolen credit card data to hacking tools and fake identities. Many of these platforms have been shut down, but the trade continues on smaller, more private channels, including encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram. Vendors use aliases, ratings and escrow systems to build credibility.",
      "Ironically, even among criminals, trust is a critical part of business. Forums often have administrators, verified sellers and mediators to settle disputes. Members who cheat others or fail to deliver are quickly blacklisted, and reputation becomes the main currency that determines who can be trusted.",
      "The criminal economy and how scams are born",
      "Every major cyberattack or data leak often traces back to the dark web's underground economy. A single attack typically involves several layers of specialists. It begins with information stealers, malware designed to capture credentials, cookies and device fingerprints from infected machines. The stolen data is then bundled and sold in dark web markets by data suppliers. Each bundle, known as a log, might contain login credentials, browser sessions and even authentication tokens, often selling for less than $20.",
      "Another group of criminals, known as initial access brokers, purchases these logs to gain entry into corporate systems. With that access, they can impersonate legitimate users and bypass security measures such as multi-factor authentication by mimicking the victim's usual device or browser. Once inside, these brokers sometimes auction their access to larger criminal gangs or ransomware operators who are capable of exploiting it further.",
      "Some of these auctions are run as competitions, while others are flash sales where well-funded groups can buy access immediately without bidding. Eventually, this chain of transactions ends with a ransomware attack or an extortion demand, as attackers encrypt sensitive data or threaten to leak it publicly.",
      "Interestingly, even within these illegal spaces, scams are common. New vendors often post fake listings for stolen data or hacking tools, collect payments and disappear. Others impersonate trusted members or set up counterfeit escrow services to lure buyers.",
      "Despite all the encryption and reputation systems, no one is truly safe from fraud, not even the criminals themselves. This constant cycle of deception forces dark web communities to build internal rules, verification processes and penalties to keep their operations somewhat functional.",
      "What you can do to stay ahead of dark web-driven threats",
      "For ordinary people and businesses, understanding how these networks operate is key to preventing their effects. Many scams that appear in your inbox or on social media originate from credentials or data first stolen and sold on the dark web. That is why basic digital hygiene goes a long way. Below are some steps you can take to stay protected.",

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "One of the easiest ways to stay safe online is to use unique, complex passwords for every account you own. Many breaches happen because people reuse the same password across multiple services. When one site is hacked, cybercriminals take those leaked credentials and try them elsewhere, a technique known as credential stuffing. A password manager eliminates this problem by generating strong, random passwords and securely storing them for you.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Antivirus software remains one of the most effective ways to detect and block malicious programs before they can steal your information. Modern antivirus solutions do far more than just scan for viruses. They monitor system behavior, detect phishing attempts and prevent infostealer malware from sending your credentials or personal data to attackers.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Outdated software is one of the biggest entry points for attackers. Cybercriminals often exploit known vulnerabilities in operating systems, browsers and plugins to deliver malware or gain access to systems. Installing updates as soon as they are available is one of the simplest yet most effective forms of defense. Enable automatic updates for your operating system, browsers and critical applications.",
      "Even if your password gets leaked or stolen,\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an additional barrier for attackers. With 2FA, logging in requires both your password and a secondary verification method. This includes code from an authentication app or a hardware security key.",
      "Identity theft protection can provide early warnings if your personal information appears in data breaches or on dark web marketplaces. These services monitor your sensitive data, such as Social Security numbers, bank details or email addresses. If anything suspicious is detected, they alert you. Many providers also offer recovery assistance, helping you restore stolen identities or close fraudulent accounts. While no service can prevent identity theft entirely, these tools can shorten your response time and limit potential damage if your data is compromised.",

      "Starcloud aims to build the first orbital data centers, cutting emissions and speeding up global computing. (Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images)",
      "Why space data centers matter for the future",
      "Every time you send a message, store a file in the cloud or use AI, large computers on Earth handle the work. These data centers use massive amounts of electricity and water to stay cool. They also release heat, noise and greenhouse gases that affect local communities.",
      "Space offers a different environment. Solar energy is abundant, and cooling happens naturally in the cold vacuum.\u00a0\"The only environmental cost is the launch,\" said Starcloud CEO Philip Johnston.\u00a0\"After that, we could save ten times the carbon emissions compared with running data centers on Earth.\"",
      "For a world searching for greener technology, that goal matters.",
      "How the NVIDIA GPU will work in orbit",
      "The Starcloud-1 satellite, about the size of a small refrigerator, will carry NVIDIA's H100 GPU. It is nearly one hundred times more powerful than any chip ever sent into orbit.",
      "Once in space, the GPU will process huge amounts of satellite data. It will study images of Earth to identify wildfires, track crops and monitor weather. Normally, satellites send this data back to Earth for processing, which can cause long delays. Doing the analysis in orbit allows faster results and better decisions on the ground.",

      "Starcloud hopes this is only the beginning. The company plans to build larger data centers in space powered by sunlight and cooled by the natural chill of orbit. Future systems will include the next generation of NVIDIA GPUs called Blackwell, which promise even higher performance.",
      "Starcloud's long-term goal is to create a five-gigawatt orbital data center about 2.5 miles wide (around 13,000 feet across). It could handle massive AI workloads while cutting costs and carbon emissions. As launch prices continue to fall, building data centers beyond Earth could soon become practical.",
      "Johnston believes that by the 2030s, many new data centers will operate in orbit instead of on land.",
      "What this space mission means for you",
      "If this works, the technology that powers your apps, games and AI tools might soon be running in space. This change could make cloud services faster, more efficient and less harmful to the planet.",

      "Nike has taken a bold step into the future with Project Amplify, the world's first motor-powered footwear system made for people who love to move. Created with robotics partner Dephy, the design combines a carbon-plated running shoe with a motorized cuff and drive belt that add a gentle push to every stride.",
      "Unlike performance tech built for pros, Project Amplify is designed for everyday movers such as runners, walkers and commuters. It helps anyone who wants to go a little faster and a little farther with less effort. Think of it like the running world's version of an e-bike. It makes movement simpler, smoother and more fun for everyone.",

      "SKECHERS\u2019 AIRTAG SHOES LET YOU TRACK YOUR KIDS\u2019 STEPS",
      "How Project Amplify works",
      "At the center of Project Amplify is a small but powerful motor. It connects to a rechargeable cuff that wraps comfortably around your calf. The cuff links to a carbon plate inside the shoe. Together, they provide natural assistance with each step.",
      "Nike\u2019s Project Amplify pairs sleek design with advanced robotics to help every step feel lighter and smoother. (Nike)",
      "Testing in the Nike Sport Research Lab has been extensive. More than 400 athletes have taken over 2.4 million steps during trials. According to testers, the system makes uphill running feel like flat ground. Some even said it helped them go from a 12-minute mile to a 10-minute mile with less effort.",
      "NIKE IS NOW ON AMAZON: SHOP WALKING SHOES, JOGGERS, SOCKS AND SHORTS TODAY",
      "Because of this, Nike says Project Amplify isn't about competition. The company's focus is on making movement easier and more approachable for a wider range of people. Whether someone is new to running or wants to fit more walking into daily life, the technology is designed to offer gentle support without taking over the effort.",
      "Innovation made accessible",
      "Nike's VP of Emerging Sport and Innovation Michael Donaghu described the idea behind Project Amplify as this, \"What if we could help athletes move faster and farther with less energy and a lot more fun?\"",
      "HUMANOID ROBOT TURNS HEADS AT NYC SNEAKER STORE",
      "That question inspired years of research and collaboration between Nike and Dephy. Together, they combined robotics, biomechanics and motion algorithms to create a powered shoe that feels natural to wear.",
      "Like e-bikes transformed cycling, Project Amplify could do the same for running and walking. It aims to help people stay active more often and enjoy movement in new ways. Through this approach, Nike is showing how innovation can make fitness more accessible to everyone.",
      "Early testing shows the powered cuff and drive system give runners steady support on every stride. (Nike)",
      "What this means for you",
      "AFFORDABLE 3D-PRINTED BIONIC ARM USES MUSCLE SIGNALS TO MOVE",
      "Imagine finishing a run with energy to spare. Picture walking an extra mile without feeling tired. Project Amplify makes that possible. Its gentle mechanical assist feels like an extra set of calf muscles that supports your natural stride.",
      "For casual runners, this means more miles with less strain. For commuters, it could make daily travel faster and more efficient. Overall, it gives you the power to enjoy movement again. The goal is not to do less. The goal is to get more from every step.",

      "With Project Amplify, Nike is blending art, science and sport to change how movement feels. This new technology aims to enhance natural motion rather than replace it. As testing moves forward, one thing is clear: Project Amplify could completely change how we think about running, walking and human performance.",

      "A massive online leak has exposed more than 183 million stolen email passwords gathered from years of malware infections, phishing campaigns and older data breaches. Cybersecurity experts say it is one of the largest compilations of stolen credentials ever discovered.",
      "Security researcher Troy Hunt, who runs\u00a0the website Have I Been Pwned, found the 3.5-terabyte dataset online. The credentials came from infostealer malware and credential stuffing lists. This malware secretly collects usernames, passwords and website logins from infected devices.",
      "Researchers say the data contains both old and newly discovered credentials. Hunt confirmed that 91% of the data had appeared in previous breaches, but about 16.4 million email addresses were completely new to any known dataset.",

      "The real risk behind the password leak",
      "The leak puts millions of users at risk. Hackers often collect stolen logins from multiple sources and combine them into large databases that circulate on dark web forums, Telegram channels and Discord servers.",
      "If you have reused passwords across multiple sites, attackers can use this data to break into your accounts through credential stuffing. This method tests stolen username and password pairs on many different platforms.",
      "The risk remains real for anyone using old or repeated credentials. One compromised password can unlock social media, banking and cloud accounts.",
      "GOOGLE CONFIRMS DATA STOLEN IN BREACH BY KNOWN HACKER GROUP",
      "Researcher Troy Hunt traced the leak to malware that secretly steals passwords from infected devices. (Jens B\u00fcttner/picture alliance via Getty Images)",

      "Google confirmed there was no Gmail data breach. In a post on X, the company stated \"reports of a Gmail security breach impacting millions of users are false. Gmail\u2019s defenses are strong, and users remain protected.\"",
      "Google clarified that the leak came from infostealer databases that compile years of stolen credentials from across the web. These databases are often mistaken for new breaches when, in fact, they represent ongoing theft activity. Troy Hunt also confirmed the dataset originated from Synthient\u2019s collection of infostealer logs, not from a single platform or recent attack. While no new breach occurred, experts warn that leaked credentials remain dangerous because cybercriminals reuse them for future attacks.",
      "How to check if you were exposed",
      "To see if your email was affected, visit\u00a0Have I Been Pwned. It is the first and official source for this newly added dataset. Enter your email address to find out if your information appears in the Synthient leak.",
      "Many password managers also include built-in breach scanners that use the same data sources. However, they may not yet include this new collection until their databases update.",
      "If your address shows up, treat it as compromised. Change your passwords immediately and turn on stronger security features to protect your accounts.",

      "9 steps to protect yourself now",
      "Protecting your online life starts with consistent action. Each step below adds another layer of defense against hackers, malware and credential theft.",
      "Start with your most important accounts, such as email and banking. Use strong, unique passwords with letters, numbers and symbols. Avoid predictable choices like names or birthdays.",
      "Never reuse passwords. One stolen password can unlock multiple accounts. Each login should be unique to protect your data.",
      "A password manager makes this simple. It stores complex passwords securely and helps you create new ones. Many managers also scan for breaches to see if your current passwords have been exposed.",
      "Next, check whether your email has been caught in a recent credential leak. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in Breach Scanner that searches trusted databases, including the newly added Synthient data from\u00a0Have I Been Pwned. It helps you find out if your email or passwords have appeared in any known leaks. If you see a match, change any reused passwords right away and secure those accounts with strong, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Turn on 2FA wherever possible. It adds a powerful second layer of defense that blocks intruders even if they have your password. You will receive a code by text, app or security key. That code ensures only you can log in to your accounts.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. It's a smart way to stay one step ahead of hackers.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Infostealer malware hides inside fake downloads and phishing attachments. A strong antivirus software scans your devices to stop threats before they spread. Keep your antivirus updated and run frequent scans. Even one unprotected device can put your whole digital life at risk.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Browsers are convenient but risky. Infostealer malware often targets saved passwords in your web browser.",
      "Updates fix security flaws that hackers exploit. Turn on automatic updates for your operating system, antivirus and apps. Staying current keeps threats out.",
      "Avoid unknown websites that offer free downloads. Fake apps and files often contain hidden malware. Use official app stores or verified company websites.",
      "Check your accounts regularly for unusual logins or device connections. Many platforms show a login history. If something looks off, change your password and enable\u00a02FA immediately.",
      "The massive leak of 183 million credentials shows just how far your personal information can spread and how easily it can resurface years later in aggregated hacker databases. Even if your passwords were part of an old breach, data like your name, email, phone number or address may still be available through data broker sites. Personal data removal services can help reduce your exposure by scrubbing this information from hundreds of these sites.",
      "While no service can guarantee total removal, they drastically reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to cross-reference leaked credentials with public data to impersonate or target you. These services monitor and automatically remove your personal info over time, which gives me peace of mind in today's threat landscape.",

The evaluation came from Nauto, Inc., creator of the Visually Enhanced Risk Assessment, or VERA Score. This system uses AI to measure fleet safety on a scale of 1 to 100.",
      "The Kodiak Driver earned a remarkable score of 98. That result placed it beside the safest human fleets in Nauto's global network. The findings sparked discussion across the trucking industry and raised new questions about the role of automation in freight transport.",

      "WILL AUTONOMOUS TRUCKS REPLACE DRIVERS BY 2027?",
      "The Kodiak Driver, an autonomous trucking system powered by AI, earned a top VERA Score of 98 in a new safety evaluation. (Kodiak)",
      "Kodiak Driver's autonomous truck safety evaluation results",
      "Kodiak's VERA Score of 98 matched the highest rating among all fleets evaluated. Fleets with Nauto's safety technology average a score of 78, while those without the technology average only 63.",
      "The Kodiak Driver achieved perfect scores of 100 in inattentive driving, high-risk driving and traffic violations. Its lowest score, 95, came in aggressive driving. The VERA Score combines over 20 vision-based AI variables into one clear safety rating.",
      "Nauto found that every 10-point increase in VERA Score cuts collision risk by about 21%. A near-perfect score like Kodiak's represents a strong improvement over typical human performance on the road.",
      "The strong results didn't come as a surprise to Kodiak's leadership. Don Burnette, founder and CEO of Kodiak, told CyberGuy: \"Achieving the top safety score among more than 1,000 commercial fleets in Nauto's Visually Enhanced Risk Assessment (VERA Score\u00ae) proprietary safety benchmark is a testament to the Kodiak's focus on safety. Safety is at the foundation of everything Kodiak builds. Our core value is \u2018safety first and always.\u2019 We believe independent safety evaluations like Nauto's help to validate what we already know: the Kodiak Driver is already among the safest drivers on American highways. They also help to establish and build public awareness around how safe our technology truly is.\"",
      "FOX NEWS AI NEWSLETTER: TRUMP, MUSK AIM FOR DOMINANCE",
      "The growing impact of AI on truck driving safety",
      "Nauto equipped the trucks with advanced monitoring and hazard detection systems. These tools track both the driving environment and vehicle behavior in real time. Removing human factors such as distraction, fatigue and delayed reaction directly improves safety.",
      "Burnette said in a company statement that the system \"is never drowsy, never drunk, and always paying attention.\" That constant awareness allows the Kodiak Driver to operate defensively and predictably, two traits linked to safe driving.",
      "The VERA Score also gives fleets a consistent way to measure safety. Companies can now shift from reacting to crashes to preventing them.",
      "Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration data support the trend. U.S. commercial truck crashes dropped from more than 124,000 in 2024 to roughly 104,000 this year. Fewer crashes mean fewer fatalities and safer highways overall.",

      "Concerns about autonomous truck safety",
      "Not everyone is ready to hand over the wheel to artificial intelligence. Some industry experts point out that while systems like the Kodiak Driver perform well in controlled evaluations, real-world roads can still pose unpredictable challenges. Weather, human drivers and mechanical issues remain complex variables for autonomous systems to manage.",
      "Others worry about the impact on jobs. As AI takes on more driving responsibilities, professional drivers wonder what the shift will mean for employment and pay across the trucking industry.",
      "Safety advocates also call for clearer regulations and public transparency.",

      "What this means for you",
      "If you work in logistics, fleet management or transportation tech, this news hits close to home. The Kodiak Driver's near-perfect score proves that autonomous systems aren't just catching up to human drivers; they're starting to edge ahead in safety.",
      "Businesses could see big gains. AI-powered safety tools help cut liability, lower costs and keep fleets running smoothly. The technology doesn't need rest breaks or reminders to stay focused, which makes every mile more efficient.",
      "Regulators are also paying attention. Verified data like this builds trust and clears the way for safer, wider use of autonomous trucks. It's proof that technology can deliver real-world safety, not just promise it.",
      "Drivers on everyday roads benefit too. Fewer crashes mean safer highways and more reliable deliveries. When trucks drive smarter, everyone shares the reward. Human drivers aren't going anywhere soon, but AI is quickly becoming their most reliable partner. It helps prevent fatigue, distraction and those risky split-second decisions that lead to trouble.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "A new study in\u00a0The New England Journal of Medicine revealed that the PRIMA brain computer interface (BCI) retinal implant helped people with advanced age-related macular degeneration regain some central vision. The device uses a tiny 2 millimeter by 2 millimeter photovoltaic implant that is only 30 micrometers thick, and thinner than a strand of hair. It sits beneath the retina and works with a special pair of smart glasses. The glasses capture images and send them as near-infrared light to the implant. The implant converts that light into small electrical signals that stimulate the optic nerve. This process mimics how healthy retinal cells normally send visual information to the brain.",
      "The study followed 38 participants, 32 of whom completed one year of follow-up. Twenty-six patients experienced measurable improvement in vision, which equals about 80% of the group. Many participants could read letters, numbers and even full pages of text again. Although the restored vision is black and white and slightly blurry, the results are remarkable for people who once believed they would never see clearly again.",

      "Why this matters for AMD treatment",
      "Age-related macular degeneration, often called AMD, is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness in older adults. Until now, available treatments could only slow down vision loss. None of them could restore what had already been lost.",
      "The PRIMA implant works with smart glasses to bring central vision back to life. (PRIMA by Science)",
      "The PRIMA implant takes a different approach. It directly replaces the missing function of the retina by turning light into electrical signals. Patients can still use their natural peripheral vision while the implant restores some central vision. This combination creates a more complete visual experience.",
      "The trial showed that the surgery is generally safe. Most side effects occurred within the first two months and resolved soon after. Importantly, the implant did not reduce the patients' remaining natural peripheral vision. Researchers call this a major step toward restoring sight rather than only slowing its decline.",
      "The PRIMA implant was developed by Science Corporation, a brain-computer interface company founded by Max Hodak, who previously cofounded Neuralink. Science Corporation acquired the PRIMA technology from the French firm Pixium Vision, continuing its development toward clinical use.",
      "EYE DROPS MAY REPLACE READING GLASSES FOR THOSE STRUGGLING WITH AGE-RELATED VISION LOSS",
      "The tiny chip sits under the retina and turns light into visual signals. (PRIMA by Science)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you or someone you love lives with late-stage AMD, this breakthrough may offer real hope. For the first time, there is a device that can restore some sight instead of only preserving what remains. You may want to talk with your ophthalmologist about upcoming trials or future approval of the PRIMA system in your area. The company behind the technology has already applied for European approval, and a process with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is underway.",
      "Regaining even partial central vision can make a big difference. Reading text, recognizing faces or simply moving independently becomes possible again. This progress also shows how fast medical innovation is moving. Patients who were once told that nothing could help may soon have a chance to see again.",
      "It is also a reminder to stay informed. Treatments that were once experimental are becoming available sooner than expected. Discussing new technologies with your doctor helps you understand timing, eligibility and what kind of results you can realistically expect.",

      "The PRIMA retinal implant represents a shift in how scientists and doctors think about blindness caused by AMD. For decades, the focus was on slowing down the disease. Now, researchers are proving that restoration is possible. While this generation of the implant provides limited black and white vision, it gives real, functional sight to people who had none. That alone changes lives. More work remains to improve image clarity, color perception and comfort. Still, this is only the beginning. Future versions of the device and smart glasses may make vision restoration even more effective and accessible.",

    "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/how-use-passkeys-keep-your-computer-safe",
    "published": "Tue, 28 Oct 2025 10:48:36 -0400",
    "summary": "Learn how to use passkeys on Windows and Mac computers without cameras or fingerprint readers. Discover secure authentication methods that replace passwords.",
    "story": [
      "With one trick, you won't have to worry about forgetting passwords on your iPhone again.",
      "Keeping your computer secure is more important than ever. Cyberattacks target computers, accounts and sensitive data daily. Traditional passwords have long been the cornerstone of security, but they come with real challenges. Many of us reuse passwords across sites, and even strong passwords can be compromised in data breaches.",
      "Passkeys offer a safer and more convenient way to authenticate. However, they're still relatively new, and many of us are still trying to figure out how they work. For example, Peter recently reached out asking, \"How do I get a passkey from a PC desktop that doesn't have a camera or fingerprint device?\"",
      "That's a great question, Peter, and you're not alone in wondering about this. The good news is that passkeys are designed to work on virtually any device, whether or not it has biometric hardware like a fingerprint reader or camera. Let's explore what passkeys are, why they're worth using and how to set them up on both Windows and Mac, regardless of your hardware setup.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",
      "Passkeys make signing in faster and safer by replacing traditional passwords with encrypted keys. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What are passkeys?",
      "Passkeys use cryptography to prove who you are. When you create a passkey, your device makes two keys, one public and one private. The public key goes to the website, and your private key stays on your device. During login, your device confirms your identity with the private key. The website never sees or stores it.",
      "This process blocks phishing and password theft. It also makes sign-in faster. You don't need to remember or type long passwords anymore.",
      "While passkeys simplify authentication, they don't eliminate the need for a secure password manager. Password managers can safely store and sync your passkeys, just as they do with passwords, allowing you to access your credentials across devices and browsers \u2014 even if those devices don't natively sync passkeys, such as between Windows and Apple systems. Using a password manager alongside passkeys creates a bridge between platforms and provides an additional layer of security and convenience.",
      "Can you use passkeys without biometrics?",
      "Yes, you can. A PC or Mac without a camera or fingerprint reader can still use passkeys. On Windows, you unlock them with your Windows Hello PIN. On Apple devices, you can use Touch ID, Face ID or your passcode. The key is having an updated operating system and browser that support passkeys.",
      "If you manage multiple accounts or devices, a password manager that supports passkeys can act as your central vault. This lets you use passkeys even on systems that don't directly support syncing through iCloud or Google Password Manager. It's an easy way to ensure you always have access to your credentials, no matter what kind of device you use.",
      "Why you still need passwords",
      "Not every website supports passkeys yet. Some services still rely on passwords. Keep strong, unique passwords for those accounts. Passwords also serve as backup if you lose a device or can't use your passkey. Over time, more sites will support password-free logins.",
      "This is where password managers continue to play an important role. They bridge the gap between old and new authentication methods, allowing you to store both traditional passwords and passkeys in one secure place. Until the web is fully passkey-ready, combining the two provides both convenience and resilience, giving you a seamless experience across multiple devices and services.",
      "Passkeys also prevent phishing because your private key never leaves your device during sign-in. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Passkey support by platform",
      "Works on\u00a0Windows 10 and 11.Windows 11 version 22H2 (KB5030310+) includes passkey management.Unlock with\u00a0Windows Hello PIN, face, or fingerprint.",

      "Windows 11 version 22H2 (KB5030310+) includes passkey management.",

      "If your browser or operating system doesn't yet sync passkeys automatically, a third-party password manager with passkey support can store them for cross-platform access.",
      "Works on\u00a0macOS 13 Ventura or later and\u00a0iOS/iPadOS 16 or later.Passkeys sync through\u00a0iCloud Keychain with end-to-end encryption.Two-factor authentication must be turned on.Use\u00a0Touch ID, Face ID or your device passcode to confirm logins.",

      "Use\u00a0Touch ID, Face ID or your device passcode to confirm logins.",

      "Tesla is making headlines again with the return of its Mad Max mode in Full Self-Driving (Supervised). This feature, designed to make the car drive more aggressively, has arrived just as the automaker faces new scrutiny from regulators and ongoing lawsuits from customers.",

      "Mad Max Mode returns in Tesla's latest FSD update",
      "Tesla recently launched its FSD v14.1.2 update. The update follows last year's major FSD v14 release, which introduced \"Sloth Mode\" for slower, more cautious driving. The latest update moves to the opposite end of the spectrum with Mad Max mode.",
      "According to Tesla's release notes, this profile allows higher speeds and more frequent lane changes than Hurry mode. The update has sparked mixed reactions. Some Tesla fans praise it for making driving feel more natural. Critics argue that it invites risky behavior at a time when regulators like the NHTSA and California DMV are already investigating Tesla's advanced driver-assist systems.",
      "TESLA'S SELF-DRIVING CARS UNDER FIRE AGAIN",
      "A new Mad Max speed profile is now included in Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving interface. (Tesla)",
      "History of Tesla's Mad Max mode since 2018",
      "The Mad Max setting isn't new. Tesla first introduced it in 2018 for the original Autopilot system. At the time, Elon Musk described it as ideal for handling aggressive city traffic. The name, borrowed from the post-apocalyptic movie series, immediately drew attention for its bold tone.",
      "Now, the feature is back in Tesla's latest FSD version. Within hours of release, drivers reported seeing cars equipped with Mad Max mode rolling stop signs and driving over the speed limit. These early reports highlight how the mode may behave more assertively than before.",
      "Why Tesla brought back its Mad Max mode",
      "Bringing back Mad Max mode may serve several purposes for Tesla. It helps demonstrate the company's continuous development of FSD software while appealing to drivers who prefer faster, more decisive movement in traffic. It also acts as a signal that Tesla is still chasing the goal of Level 4 autonomy, even though its system remains classified as Level 2, requiring constant driver supervision.",
      "Tesla owners can access Mad Max mode through the car's settings under Speed Profiles.\u00a0 (Chesnot/Getty Images)",
      "For Tesla, this feature shows confidence in its progress. For observers, it raises concerns about timing. With multiple investigations and lawsuits in progress, many expected Tesla to focus on safety rather than on more aggressive driving profiles.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you own a Tesla with Full Self-Driving (Supervised), you can access Mad Max mode through the car's settings under Speed Profiles. This mode provides a more assertive driving experience that includes quicker acceleration, more lane changes, and less hesitation.",
      "However, remember that Tesla's Full Self-Driving system still requires active driver attention. You must keep your hands on the wheel and remain ready to take control at any moment. While the name suggests thrill and speed, safety and awareness should remain your top priority.",
      "Tesla\u2019s speed-profile menu includes the toggle options of Chill, Standard, Hurry, and Mad Max profiles to customize how aggressively their car responds in traffic.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Mike Blake)",
      "If you share the road with Teslas, it's smart to stay alert. Vehicles using Mad Max mode may accelerate or change lanes more quickly than expected. Giving Teslas a little extra space can help reduce surprises and keep everyone safer on the road.",

      "WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Tesla's decision to reintroduce Mad Max mode is both strategic and provocative. It revives a feature from its early Autopilot days while reigniting debate over the balance between innovation and responsibility. The mode's return reminds everyone that Tesla continues to test the limits of driver-assist technology and public tolerance for it.",

The best way to stay safe is to create strong digital habits that protect your information and your peace of mind. Here are the top ways to defend yourself against phishing threats and financial fraud.",
      "Adding two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) creates an extra layer of protection. Even if a scammer gets your password through a fake American Express email, they cannot access your account without your verification code. Most banks and credit card companies offer this free feature in their security settings. Enable it today and make your login stronger.",
      "Data removal services help clean up your personal information from data broker websites that collect and sell your details to advertisers, marketers and even scammers. Reducing your digital footprint limits the amount of information that phishing attackers can use to make fake emails look convincing. In the case of fake American Express messages, less personal data online means fewer details criminals can use to target you directly.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Outdated browsers and antivirus programs leave gaps that scammers can exploit. Regular updates close those gaps and strengthen your defense against phishing links and malicious downloads. Set your software to update automatically so you are always protected when opening emails or clicking links.",
      "Make it a habit to log into your credit card accounts directly from the official website, not from email links. Scan your statements for unfamiliar transactions. Early detection helps you report fraud fast and recover funds before more damage is done.",
      "Phishing emails thrive on urgency. Before clicking, take a deep breath and ask yourself: Does this message feel pressured or suspicious? Instead of clicking \"verify now,\" open a new browser tab and visit the official credit card website to check your account. This one simple pause can stop a scam in its tracks.",
      "Good antivirus software not only blocks viruses but also warns you when a site or email is unsafe. Choose a program that includes phishing detection, real-time web protection and email scanning. These tools can automatically block fraudulent look-alike emails before you even open them.",

      "Identity monitoring services keep watch over the dark web and alert you if your personal information, such as your email address, password, or credit card number, appears in stolen data. If scammers gain access to this information, they often use it to create realistic phishing attempts, like the fake American Express \"account restricted\" email. Early detection through identity monitoring allows you to take action, such as changing passwords, freezing credit, or alerting your bank before real damage occurs.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Legitimate companies like American Express will never ask for full account numbers, passwords, or security codes by email. Familiarize yourself with how real messages from your bank look and sound. If something feels off, forward the message to the company's official fraud department and delete it immediately.",
      "If a phishing attack installs malware on your computer, it can lock or delete files. Keep secure backups on an external drive or a trusted cloud service. That way, even if scammers target your system, you will not lose access to your information.",
      "If an email feels wrong, it probably is. Your intuition is one of your strongest defenses against scams. Combine it with these habits to stay ahead of cybercriminals and keep your personal and financial information safe.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Phishing scams are becoming more advanced, but your awareness is your best defense. When you know how to spot fake emails and stay calm under pressure, you protect both your money and your peace of mind. So next time you get an \"urgent\" message about your account, ask yourself: Would your bank really contact you this way?",

      "A Swedish appeals court\u2019s decision not to deport a convicted rapist because his assault on a 16-year-old girl was not deemed \"exceptionally grave\" has ignited outrage, fueling a backlash against Sweden\u2019s justice system.",
      "The Court of Appeal for northern Norrland confirmed to Fox News Digital that the defendant, an Eritrean national and illegal immigrant, Yezied Mohamed, was sentenced to three years in prison for raping the 16-year-old girl from the northern town of Skellefte\u00e5, on Sept. 1, 2024. The court acknowledged that while the crime was serious, it did not meet the threshold for deportation because of its nature and short duration.",
      "The ruling prompted swift condemnation from Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, who released a video promising stricter deportation laws. \"No one should have to worry about meeting their attacker or rapist on the street,\" Kristersson said. \"Those who commit serious crimes in Sweden and are not Swedish citizens must leave the country.\"",
      "In a written response to Fox News Digital, Judge Lars Viktorsson said the court considered both the nature and duration of the act, noting there was no use of weapon, and there wasn\u2019t intercourse, and that \"the duration of the incident had been short.\" \"It is true that the duration of the rape was of significance in the assessment of the matter of deportation,\" Viktorsson stated, \"However, the nature of the offense was at least as significant.\"",

      "The District Court initially acquitted him, accepting that a rape had occurred but finding insufficient evidence that he was the perpetrator. After an appeal, the Court of Appeal overturned that ruling, concluding that Mohamed matched the description given by the victim and a witness, and that forensic evidence placed him near the scene.",
      "The court sentenced him to three years in prison, the minimum for rape in Sweden, and ordered him to pay 240,000 Swedish krona, about $25,600, in damages.

      "It\u2019s now become the site of the second largest measles outbreak in the U.S. this year, behind the outbreak that extended from West Texas into New Mexico, which sickened at least 862 people and killed three. Two were young girls.",
      "Vaccination rates have fallen precipitously in both outbreak areas in recent years and, from the outside, the two have similarities. Both outbreaks took hold in communities that are deeply skeptical of government intervention and mainstream medicine. And both outbreaks largely impacted people with strong ties to religious sects: Mennonites in West Texas and (mostly former) members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (FLDS) in Short Creek.",
      "But the Short Creek community is also grappling with its recent past \u2014 one of polygamy, child removal and a cultlike leader now imprisoned for the sexual assault of minors.",
      "\u201cWe had so much trauma,\u201d said Donia Jessop, the mayor of Hildale and a former FLDS member. \u201cGetting kids vaccinated or a booster was not the first thing on our mind.\u201d",
      "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints outlawed polygamy more than 100 years ago. Some members, however, continued to believe that multiple wives benefited men in the afterlife and broke away, becoming the FLDS. One of the places where members settled was Short Creek.",
      "Jessop fondly recalls growing up in the 1970s and \u201880s in the tight-knit community with two moms and scores of brothers,  sisters and cousins who were her best friends.",
      "\u201cI had an ideal childhood,\u201d she said. \u201cI was guaranteed a spanking or a meal from any mom in town, because we were raised like a village.\u201d",
      "But polygamy was and is illegal. The practice prompted two federal government raids in Short Creek \u2014 one in 1953 and another in 2008. Both times, government officials forcibly took children away from their families temporarily in an attempt to determine whether kids were being abused or neglected.",
      "Children were returned, but the trauma endured. \u201cThat made a lot of us FLDS kids very scared of police officers,\u201d said Gloria Steed, who was 14 years old during the 2008 raid. \u201cAfterward, we were extremely hesitant about being told what to do.\u201d",
      "Steed said her mother was born around the time of the 1953 raid and grew up with anti-government and, in turn, anti-vaccine tendencies. \u201cIt really impacted her faith and trust in the systems,\u201d said Steed, who wasn't vaccinated as a child.",
      "Still, there was never a specific religious mandate against the shots, Jessop said. She was vaccinated as a child. (No major religions expressly oppose vaccinations.)",
      "Things changed, Jessop and other former FLDS members said, in 2002. That\u2019s the year Warren Jeffs, the now-incarcerated cultlike leader, became their prophet. An FLDS prophet is considered to be the direct voice of God. He often has dozens of wives.",
      "Briell Decker, Jeffs\u2019 65th wife, said he spread lies about immunizations.",
      "He \u201csaid that vaccines are bad and have stuff in them that makes it so you can\u2019t have children,\u201d Decker, who has since left the FLDS lifestyle, said. The ability to procreate and have lots and lots of babies is critical to keep the community going, Decker and other former members said.",
      "Jeffs exerted more control over the Short Creek community than previous prophets, ex-FLDS members said. He took ownership of their land and homes, they said, even reassigning wives and children to different husbands and fathers, breaking apart families and stripping them of the ability to contact one another.",
      "Jessop, who wasn\u2019t mayor when Jeffs was prophet, also said that Jeffs restricted access to the town\u2019s medical clinics for people he deemed unworthy before shutting the health care system down altogether.",
      "Jeffs was on the FBI\u2019s Most Wanted List before he was arrested in 2006. He is serving life in prison for sexual assault of minors within the FLDS community.",
      "Wounds from the Jeffs\u2019 era in Short Creek run deep. The area has had to work to re-establish the basics: running water, schools and a health care system, including routine medical checkups.",
      "With so much to put back together, making sure kids were caught up on vaccines fell on the list of priorities, Jessop said.",
      "While there are two medical clinics in Short Creek, businesses touting natural and herbal remedies have emerged as a popular stand-in for medical care.",
      "At Paty\u2019s Place, a popular health food store in the area, a store employee said some folks had come in to seek advice for treating measles. The store\u2019s owner, Paty LeBaron, did not respond to NBC News\u2019 requests for comment, but wrote on Facebook that she has never \u201cmade claims about knowing how to cure measles\u201d and encouraged people \u201cto seek reliable, science-based medical advice from qualified healthcare professionals regarding measles or any other serious health condition.\u201d",
      "A similar phenomenon was seen in West Texas: In the city of Seminole, parents of children sick with measles flocked to Health 2 U for cod liver oil, an unproven remedy touted by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "The Covid pandemic made efforts to get routine health care back up and running even more difficult, said Aaron Hunt, a public health expert with the Utah State University Extension Program.",
      "\u201cParents are trying to do what they think is best for their child,\u201d Hunt said, \u201cbut since Covid, they\u2019ve been exposed to a lot of misinformation.\u201d",
      "That makes moms and dads fearful of even rare side effects of vaccines, said Hunt, who works with health care providers across Utah to help them battle vaccine misinformation. (The drop in vaccinations hasn\u2019t just opened the door to measles; whooping cough is also spreading throughout the state.)",
      "\u201cYou want to have honest conversations with people and give them the power to make their own decisions for them and their families,\u201d Hunt said.",
      "But now that measles is spreading through the Short Creek community, folks appear to be embracing vaccines. Jessop, the Hildale mayor, said there\u2019s been a \u201csharp rise\u201d in vaccinations since the outbreak began.",
      "David Heaton, a spokesperson for the Southwest Utah Public Health Department, said the area saw a 14% increase in vaccinations during July through September of this year, compared to the same time period in 2024.",
      "A spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Health Services, however, said current MMR vaccination rates are on par with 2024.",
      "The spread of the virus isn\u2019t contained to the Short Creek area. In the past few weeks, measles exposures have also been reported in the Utah towns of St. George and Hurricane. On Wednesday, Salt Lake County public health officials said it had a probable case, but couldn\u2019t confirm it because the person in question refused to be tested.",
      "Becky Goimarac lives in St. George, about 45 miles from Hildale. Her teenage son was exposed to the virus at a high school cycling event in Park City, Utah, in August. That was the first indication of a measles outbreak in the state.",
      "\u201cI personally wasn\u2019t concerned because my kids are vaccinated,\u201d Goimarac said. \u201cI was more sad that we even have to worry about any of that kind of stuff.\u201d",
      "Steed, the former FLDS member who is now 31, remembers being sick with whooping cough and chickenpox as a child. But she still has reservations about the shots meant to prevent those illnesses.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t trust the system,\u201d Steed said. \u201cI feel like the doctors are pushing too many vaccines too soon.\u201d The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, along with the American Academy of Pediatrics, maintains that the childhood vaccine schedule is scrupulously researched to offer the most robust protection in the fewest amount of shots.",
      "Still, Steed allowed her 9-year-old son, Jhonde, to get a few of the shots that she felt were most important so he wouldn\u2019t have to suffer like she did. \u201cI thought that anything I got as a kid, I would be doing my son a favor to get those,\u201d she said. In addition to the chickenpox and whooping cough vaccines, Jhonde got one dose of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine as a baby. Two doses are recommended for 97% protection.",
      "When the measles outbreak began in Short Creek in late summer, Steed got the MMR shot because she was on a journey to become a surrogate mother. Measles during pregnancy is a strong risk factor for miscarriage or preterm birth. Jhonde got his second MMR dose the same day, Steed said, based on her trust of local doctors and nurses who also grew up in Short Creek.",
      "Steed sees firsthand the benefit of MMR vaccines as the outbreak has grown in her community.",
      "\u201cThe vaccines are working. It\u2019s been a blessing to see that,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cIt really comes down to having doctors and nurses willing to listen to the individual experiences of the patients, instead of always trying to pressure them into something because they think that they\u2019re better or smarter,\u201d Steed said. \u201cThe medical field can be a bit like a cult, you know.\u201d"

      "Travel delays were adding up at airports across the U.S. on Friday as the government shutdown drags on, putting even more pressure on air traffic controllers who have been working without pay for a month.",
      "U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has been warning that travelers will start to see more flight disruptions the longer controllers go without a paycheck.",
      "\u201cEvery day there\u2019s going to be more challenges,\u201d Duffy told reporters Thursday outside the White House after a closed-door meeting with Vice President JD Vance and aviation industry leaders to talk about the shutdown\u2019s impact on U.S. travel.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration on Friday reported staffing shortages that were causing flight delays at a number of airports, including in Boston, Phoenix, San Francisco, Nashville, Houston, Dallas and the Washington, D.C. area. Airports serving the New York City area \u2014 John F. Kennedy International Airport, LaGuardia Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport \u2014 were also experiencing delays averaging around two hours, according to the FAA.",
      "\u201cCurrently nearly 50 percent of major air traffic control facilities are experiencing staffing shortages, and nearly 90 percent of air traffic controllers are out at New York\u2013area facilities,\u201d the FAA said in a statement posted on X on Friday evening.",
      "Staffing shortages can occur both in regional control centers that manage multiple airports and in individual airport towers, but they don\u2019t always lead to flight disruptions. According to aviation analytics firm Cirium, flight data showed strong on-time performance at most major U.S. airports for the month of October despite isolated staffing problems that surfaced throughout the month.",
      "But Cirium said the data also showed a \u201cbroader slowdown\u201d Thursday across the nation\u2019s aviation system for the first time since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, suggesting staffing-related disruptions may be spreading.",
      "According to Cirium, many major U.S. airports on Thursday saw below-average on-time performance, with fewer flights departing within 15 minutes of their scheduled departure times. Staffing-related delays at Orlando\u2019s airport on Thursday, for example, averaged nearly four and a half hours for some time. The data does not distinguish between the different causes of delays, such as staffing shortages or bad weather.",
      "Last weekend, a shortage of controllers also led to the FAA issuing a brief ground stop at Los Angeles International Airport, one of the busiest in the world. Flights were held at their originating airports for about two hours Sunday until the FAA lifted the ground stop.",
      "Most controllers are continuing to work mandatory overtime six days a week during the shutdown, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association said. That leaves little time for a side job to help cover bills, mortgage payments and other expenses unless controllers call out.",
      "Duffy said controllers are also struggling to get to work because they can\u2019t afford to fill up their cars with gas. Controllers missed their first full paychecks on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cFor this nation\u2019s air traffic controllers, missing just one paycheck can be a significant hardship, as it is for all working Americans. Asking them to go without a full month\u2019s pay or more is simply not sustainable,\u201d Nick Daniels, president of NATCA, said Friday in a statement.",
      "Some U.S. airports have stepped in to provide food donations and other support for federal aviation employees working without pay, including controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents.",
      "Before the shutdown, the FAA was already dealing with a long-standing shortage of about 3,000 air traffic controllers."

    "summary": "SNAP food assistance was set to lapse in November because of the government shutdown. But on Friday, a judge ordered that contingency funds be used to maintain the benefits.",
    "story": [
      "It has been a tumultuous week for the roughly 42 million people across the country who rely on federal food assistance.",
      "Some breathed a tentative sigh of relief Friday afternoon after a Rhode Island judge ordered the Trump administration to keep funding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, nationwide.",
      "The Agriculture Department had warned that it would no longer pay for the benefits, commonly known as food stamps, starting Nov. 1 because Congress has failed to pass legislation to fund the government. The judge, however, told the administration it must distribute contingency funding for the program as soon as possible.",
      "But much remains unknown: President Donald Trump said Friday evening on Truth Social that he had \u201cinstructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible.\u201d Even if the federal government issues the funding, many states are already behind schedule, and it's highly unlikely that anyone who was expecting their SNAP benefits to renew this weekend will get them on time.",
      "After the stressful week they\u2019ve spent rationing food, collecting donations at food banks and preparing their families to survive on less, several SNAP recipients said they\u2019re not yet changing course.",
      "\u201cPeople still have to figure out ways to do things while this all blows over,\u201d said Danielle Sulton, a single mother of five in Mississippi, who would face an $833 gap without SNAP. She\u2019s picking up gig shifts delivering Amazon packages this weekend to make sure her family doesn\u2019t go without.",
      "\u201cWe have been back and forth with Trump,\u201d Sulton said.",
      "In interviews over the last week, 18 SNAP recipients across 11 states \u2014 including a preschool teacher, a disabled father, a pregnant mother and a Navy veteran \u2014 told NBC News about the painful choices they would have to make if they lost food assistance. Never before have so many households faced the sudden threat that their benefits will be disrupted; the SNAP program has not lapsed during previous government shutdowns.",
      "In Wisconsin, Carmen Hernandez told her four children that they may need to get by on just beans and tortillas. In Mississippi, Valerie Buck collected donations from a food pantry to feed her family of 10. In Indiana, Matthew Corbett, who has $1.04 left in his SNAP account, was prepared to sell his TV for food money.",
      "\u201cWhy do I have to pick between paying for day care or paying for a meal for my daughter?\u201d said Lucia Graves, a single mother in Lebanon, New Hampshire.",
      "Shrinking meals and growing food pantry lines",
      "The threat of a SNAP cutoff has brought renewed attention to the desperate, day-to-day struggle to make ends meet for America\u2019s most vulnerable people. To qualify, recipients\u2019 incomes must generally be at or below 130% of the federal poverty line \u2014 less than $35,000 a year for a family of three. At least 12% of the population relies on this food assistance, including many elderly and disabled people, as well as low-income parents working full or part time.",
      "The federal budget at the heart of the standoff between Republicans and Democrats in Congress includes $186 billion in cuts to SNAP programs over the next decade, the largest funding reductions in the program\u2019s history. Nonprofit organizations have already been straining to fill the gaps amid higher food prices and recent cuts to federal funding by the Trump administration.",
      "Many of the SNAP recipients interviewed said that without their benefits, they would only have enough food for about two or three days before they\u2019d need to turn to charities or put off paying bills."

      "The most common refrain so far this corporate earnings season is  that the U.S. economy is increasingly divided between wealthy consumers and everyone else.",
      "While many Americans tighten their belts amid rising costs and a weakening job market, a fortunate few are still spending freely, insulated by a financial cushion of stock market gains and years of rising home values.",
      "The split is having an outsize impact on consumer-facing companies, but those effects aren\u2019t being felt evenly across brands.",
      "McDonald\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski said the \u201ctwo-tier economy\u201d was a major factor in the fast-food giant\u2019s decision to revive its \u201cExtra Value Meal\u201d combos last month.",
      "\u201cTraffic for lower-income consumers is down double digits,\u201d Kempczinski told CNBC in September. \u201cWe needed to step in.\u201d",
      "Coca-Cola\u2019s chief operating officer, Henrique Braun, said the company continued to see \u201cdivergency in spending between the income groups\u201d last quarter. \u201cThe pressure on middle- and low-end-income consumers is still there.\u201d",
      "The widening K",
      "The U.S. economy has been turning more \u201cK\u201d-shaped for decades, with the high-earner cohort doing better and better while others fall further down the economic ladder.",
      "In 1989, the top 10% of U.S. wealth holders already controlled about 61% of the total wealth in the economy, according to Federal Reserve data. Today, it\u2019s about 67%.",
      "While inequality has grown throughout this period, its rate of growth has ebbed and risen.",
      "For example, signs of bifurcation blared louder during the first six months of the Covid-19 pandemic. As the stock market began to recover its early losses, huge parts of the economy remained shut down.",
      "But these signs receded somewhat in the following years, as government stimulus checks and loan-payment forbearance helped boost the fortunes of lower-income households.",
      "Five years on, worrying signals of inequality are roaring back into view. This time, the cracks appear to be hardening.",
      "Average worker pay only barely outpaces inflation \u2014 which remains above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target. But the pace of that wage growth is higher for salaried workers than for those paid by the hour, according to data from the Atlanta Federal Reserve.",
      "For nearly all workers, the employment outlook is uncertain, with mass layoffs in the news and AI doing work that people used to do.",
      "\u201cWhile upper-income consumers are doing great and benefiting from the wealth effect of owning their home and having a stock portfolio, anyone renting or who doesn\u2019t own stocks is not,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at OnePoint BFG Wealth Partners. \u201cAt best, their wages are only keeping up. They\u2019re doing a lot of running in place.\u201d",
      "Two kinds of consumers",
      "The same K shape that characterizes widening income inequality is reflected in consumer spending.",
      "As a result, the volume of companies reporting evidence of a two-tiered economy among their customers surged in recent weeks.",
      "Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright said the restaurant chain had seen the divide among its customers deepen just in the past few months.",
      "\u201cEarlier this year, as consumer sentiment declined sharply, we saw a broad-based pullback in frequency [of restaurant visits] across all income\u201d levels, he said on Chipotle\u2019s earnings call Wednesday.",
      "\u201cSince then, the gap has widened, with low- to middle-income guests further reducing frequency\u201d of their visits, he said.",
      "Younger adults ages 25 to 35 are being particularly hard hit, said Boatwright. \u201cThis group is facing several headwinds, including unemployment, increased student loan repayment and slower real wage growth.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just fast-casual dining that\u2019s feeling the loss of lower-income customers.",
      "On Tuesday, the CEO of snack giant Mondelez said the company saw weakness in its cookie and cracker segment last quarter partly due to \u201cvalue-seeking consumers increasingly turning to discounters and club stores.\u201d",
      "Yet a decline in consumers willing to pay for name-brand snacks like Oreos and Chips Ahoy is only part of the challenge, said chief executive Dirk Van de Put.",
      "\u201cHigher-income consumers increasingly are choosing premium and better-for-you products,\u201d he said, a category that excludes many of Mondelez\u2019s biggest sellers.",
      "The twin issues, he said, were starting to affect the company\u2019s bottom line.",
      "Washington is watching",
      "The growing inequality between a small percentage of consumers and everyone else has caught the attention of the Federal Reserve.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he had noticed the surge in consumer-oriented companies reporting split-screen spending patterns.",
      "They \u201care saying there is a bifurcated economy there, and that consumers at the lower end are struggling and buying less and shifting to lower-cost products,\u201d Powell said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cBut at the top, people are spending, at the higher income and wealth,\u201d said Powell. \u201cSo, we think there is something there.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are part of the equation, too, Fed governor Christopher Waller told CNBC.",
      "Rising prices on a subset of consumer goods hit with tariffs has contributed to a \u201ctwo-tier\u201d spending scenario where higher-income shoppers had become virtually \u201cprice insensitive,\u201d he said.",
      "Meanwhile, lower-income customers will simply \u201cwalk out the door\u201d if they see higher prices, Waller said.",
      "The wealthy keep shopping",
      "As lower-income consumers pull back, spending by the top half of the K is increasingly helping to keep the economy humming.",
      "The top 10% of earners account for about half of all consumer spending, according to recent estimates from Moody\u2019s Analytics.",
      "This month, American Express reported that spending by its typically higher-income card holders accelerated by 8%. The number of newly opened \u201cPlatinum Card\u201d accounts doubled,  partly due to a recent \u201crefresh\u201d of the card\u2019s perks.",
      "Automakers and airlines have likewise expanded their higher-end offerings \u2014 with stellar results.",
      "Delta Air Lines now expects sales of premium seats like Comfort-Plus to exceed sales of main cabin seats for the first time, starting next year.",

      "Likewise, Ford and GM both reported booming sales for their largest and most expensive SUVs.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s auto market is being driven by wealthier households who have access to capital, good loan rates and are propping up the higher end of the market,\u201d Erin Keating, an executive analyst at Cox Automotive, wrote in September.",
      "Beyond consumer spending",
      "Simply looking at consumer behavior may not capture the full financial picture of American households, said Chris Wheat, managing director at JPMorganChase & Co. and president of the the bank\u2019s research institute.",
      "\u201cJust looking at spending, do you really have the full picture of \u2018How K-shaped is the K?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThere are other ways people might be taking advantage of some of the economic growth we\u2019ve been experiencing.\u201d",
      "For example, there are signs that more lower-income households are investing in the stock market than a decade ago.",
      "As of May 2025, the share of people with below-median incomes transferring funds to investment accounts was about five times higher than the average seen between 2010 and 2015, according to data from the JPMorganChase Institute.",
      "Meanwhile, there is evidence that the K may be flattening for the rich.",
      "Upper-income households face new financial pressures today in a rapidly changing labor market that\u2019s witnessing an unprecedented slowdown in the growth of traditionally higher-paying white-collar jobs.",
      "Credit delinquencies among individuals making $150,000 or more have doubled since 2023, according to credit modeler VantageScore.",
      "During the same period, delinquencies for people making between $45,000 and $150,000 rose 58%, and just 17% for borrowers earning less than $45,000.",
      "The key distinction is annual income versus total wealth, said Rikard Bandebo, VantageScore\u2019s chief economist.",
      "Today, the share of jobs being created that are considered high-income has fallen to its lowest level since at least 2015, he said.",
      "This suggests that even a well-paying job is no longer a reliable source of financial stability compared with owning assets like stocks and real estate.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing more people in the U.S. economy struggling to make ends meet \u2014 and even seeing people in the higher-income range struggling,\u201d said Bandebo.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as income being the differentiator here \u2014 it\u2019s wealth being more the driver,\u201d he said."

      "\"Ironically, this week has been the busiest week since leaving the villa,\" Nic tells TODAY.com. \"I have a marathon to train for, so of course the week of is going to be the busiest.\"",
      "Nic, who will be running the marathon with Team Strava, says he decided to run the race just a few months ago, \"which I know is a bit later in the training process,\" he admits with a laugh. The registered nurse already has two marathons under his belt \u2014 one of which was part of an Ironman race.",
      "\"Hopefully it won't be too hard,\" he says of the NYC race.",

      "Just over a week before the marathon, Nic was in Miami for a launch party hosted by Celsius. There, he met up with Rob and Kendall from the show's breakout Season 6. Because they have shared \"lore,\" as Nic puts it, they didn't end up talking much about what happened during their time in \"Love Island\" villa.",

      "\"They don't go hand in hand,\" he says of his busy schedule and training. \"But after doing the events at night it's nice to wake up early in the morning and get the run done. It's definitely a way to clear the mind.\"",

      "\"I think at this point we're looking for just a breath of a fresh air from all the hectic-ness,\" he says.",
      "\"I've said this before, like I want to go on our hot air balloon date, I want to do all these things \u2014\u00a0but at this point, I'm like, I just want to sit on a couch and do nothing with her,\" he adds. \"That sounds elite.\""

      "Chmerkovskiy then clarified that he doesn't let \"feelings and emotion\" cloud his \"commentary on dance.\"",
      "\u201cIt just comes with (a) completely different range of reasoning. And, you know, I'm that guy. And so I would like to explain myself, like I said. I would like this to be personal because this is crazy to me,\u201d he said.",
      "Chmerkovskiy's wife, brother Val Chmerkovskiy and sister-in-law Jenna Johnson have all appeared as professional dancers on \"DWTS.\" During his video message, the 45-year-old said many people reached out to him after his comments about Ravnik to criticize him for only winning the show once.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t really hurt my feelings by saying, \u2018Look at you, loser. You only won once.\u2019 Blah, blah, blah. Yes, I know that more than anybody else. I\u2019m also very well aware that every single member of my family has won 'Dancing with the Stars' more than I have. They are much better at 'Dancing with the Stars than me,'\u201d he said.",
      "Chmerkovskiy explained that he always had a hard time mastering one important element of the competition: public perception and what people think of him.",
      "\"Fundamentally, I don\u2019t care, and I lead with that. And because I lead with that, I\u2019m not fighting for anybody\u2019s votes,\u201d he said.  \u201cAnd so in a platform where that\u2019s important, I\u2019m not the guy.\u201d",
      "Chmerkovskiy said he was motivated to apologize to Ravnik publicly after doing some soul searching, not because of the public's criticism.",
      "\u201c(When) I realize something about myself, I realize it. It\u2019s not going to be because somebody says that to me, it\u2019s because I finally understood that for myself,\u201d he said.",
      "At the end of his video, the professional dancer sent a message to social media users, saying, \"Let\u2019s not defend someone by attacking somebody else. That\u2019s all I\u2019m gonna say.\u201d",
      "After being eliminated from \"DWTS\" on Oct. 28, Ravnik addressed Chmerkovskiy's podcast comments during an interview with \"Entertainment Tonight.\"",
      "\"I have no comment on that. Look, I got all the love on this show. All the praise from the judges also, like everyone gave me so much love,\" he said. \"Whoever is saying, outside, the people who (are) trying to stay relevant and spreading the hate, this is not a way to do it. And I never will spread or take the hate.\""

      "Rogers, who has portrayed Salem staple Maggie Horton for 52 years, opened up about her cancer diagnosis during an interview with TV Insider published Oct. 30, revealing that her health struggles are the reason for her absence from the show.",
      "The 82-year-old actor told the entertainment outlet that she decided to make an appointment with her doctor after feeling that something \u201cwasn\u2019t quite right\u201d despite getting routine colonoscopies. She had another and the surgeon suggested that she return for an MRI, PET scan and biopsy after seeing her results.",
      "\u201cAnd the minute he said that I knew that it was something more,\u201d she recalled.",
      "She learned after another procedure that she had Stage 2 colorectal cancer. Her doctor informed her, \u201c\u2018You have cancer and you have to start treatment,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Rogers added, \u201cIt was all a shock. I mean, I think I was in a shock for several days because I take pretty good care of myself. But he said, \u2018It\u2019s a good thing you caught it in time.\u2019\u201d",
      "She underwent treatment this summer after \u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d finished filming in June.",
      "\u201cIt was radiation every day and chemo every day for six weeks and it was tough,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cIt was tough knowing you had to do it five days a week and then you had off Saturday and Sunday. I thoroughly enjoyed my weekends because I didn\u2019t have to go to and see a doctor. I was so tired of seeing doctors.\u201d",
      "Although she initially didn\u2019t disclose her diagnosis, she later turned to co-star Linsey Godfrey, who plays her on-screen daughter Sarah Horton, for support. She revealed Godfrey held her hand during one of her infusions, and that other co-stars, like Paul Telfer, Mary Beth Evans, Stephen Nichols, Greg Rikaart and AnnaLynne McCord, were there for her, too. Producers also told her to prioritize her health and that she could resume portraying Rogers when she improved.",
      "Her treatment ended on July 31. \u201cI\u2019m feeling really good,\u201d she told TV Insider. \u201cI start back to work next week, so we\u2019ll see how that goes.\u201d",
      "She continued, \u201cNow, I\u2019m feeling anxious like I do any time I get scripts because I want to do my very best and you don\u2019t want to hold up anybody. So that\u2019s the only anxiousness I feel. It\u2019s not because of my illness, let\u2019s put it that way.\u201d",
      "Rogers said that her recent health struggles have changed her perspective on life. \u201cIt\u2019s so funny because I used to worry about some silly things,\u201d she shared. \u201cAnd when you go through this, it kind of takes you a while to say, \u2018OK, well, this is what I have, and I will do my very best to fight it and to get through it.\u2019 And that\u2019s what I did. The prayers and the good wishes from my friends and my family helped me stay positive and stay on top of it and beat this.\u201d",
      "Her \u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d family posted a message on Instagram about Rogers\u2019 diagnosis Oct 30 and told viewers they can expect to see Maggie on their televisions again soon.",
      "The show wrote, \u201cWe are delighted that Suzanne has come through this challenge with her trademark grace and strength. Fans will be glad to know that \u2018Maggie\u2019 will remain a constant presence in Salem.\u201d",

      "\u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d had previously commented on Rogers taking a hiatus from the show in July. The soap shared a statement with Soap Opera Digest at the time that addressed rumors Rogers was leaving, writing that the speculation, \u201ccould not be further from the truth, Maggie and Suzanne are integral to the show\u2019s history, present storylines, and now, on the heels of our pick-up, the future! Neither are going anywhere.\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve always had the dream to have, to write and to work on an album, almost to the point that it became a little bit of a nightmare because I had a lot of expectations,\u201d the 30-year-old Venezuelan singer-songwriter tells TODAY.com. \u201cI was pressuring myself a lot, and it wasn\u2019t the moment for it, but I would keep (telling) myself, \u2018It\u2019s going to come and be awesome.\u2019",
      "\u201cI just had no clue what it was going to be,\u201d she adds, having now accomplished her dream with \u201cBendito Verano.\u201d",
      "An acclaimed Grammy and multi-Latin Grammy nominee, Elena Rose \u2014 whose given name is Andrea Elena Mangiamarchi \u2014 has penned hit songs for artists like Bad Bunny, even receiving a Grammy nod for her work on \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti,\" which became the first Spanish-language album to be nominated for album of the year.",

      "When it came to her own album, Elena Rose was inspired by her love of summer, a \"heavenly\" playlist, an Italian getaway and most importantly, trusting her intuition.",
      "The result was a deeply personal 12-track, genre-blending album that Elena Rose says made her \u201cfeel proud\" \u2014 and \u201ctranscended music.\u201d",
      "The \u201cfirst name that came to mind\u201d for her creation was Holy Summer, which she translated to Spanish.",
      "\u201cSummer is my favorite time of the year,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I think of summer, I think of a sunset, I think of the beach, I think of the breeze, I think of happiness. I think of dancing and just having a lot of moments where you\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, this place is beautiful. Wow. I love the people I\u2019m with. Thank you, God, for my life. Thank you for the present.\u2019\u201d",

      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "I think after (my 2024 song) \u201cMe Lo Merezco\u201d (\u201cI Deserve It\u201d) was born, I was like, \u201cThis is where I\u2019m feeling the best,\u201d because it transcended the music and it became more about the message and what it was doing in people\u2019s lives.",
      "It was that feeling of, \u201cLook at everything we\u2019ve gone through and we made it. We\u2019re here at the beach, let\u2019s just have fun and dance.\u201d Mixing that feeling of what summer means to me and then asking the question of, \u201cIf there were to be a summer in heaven, what playlist would they play?\u201d",
      "Which is why we have sax, we have trumpets because I would picture angels performing in heaven. (I wanted this album) to help us remember the things that really matter ... and it would be about love.",
      "We have elements like Afro that make me feel freedom, that make me feel at peace, joy and be in the present. There\u2019s a lot of roots feelings when I listen to a bass line, or when I listen to the drums that remind me that I come from amazing people that have done amazing things in order for me to be here.",
      "But then I have my message, which is where I really come in and put like my little grain of salt. I speak about mental health and awareness and emotional responsibility and real and unconditional love.",
      "We went to Italy to record all the visuals. Every song has a visual. The first time I went to Italy, it was right after I picked up my relationship with my father. We hadn\u2019t spoken in like five years and my father is half Chilean, half Italian, but grew up in Venezuela.",
      "My last name is Italian, and I had always wanted to go to Italy, and I\u2019m grateful it happened right after we hugged it out. Visually, the woman that I saw in Italy was a woman hugging everything about where she comes from and who she is. (Someone) who never lost her essence, but really worked on the woman that she wants to be and who she wants to be for the world and her industry and her craft. I\u2019m grateful to see that visually. I needed to see it. And in a place like Italy, in Lake Como, the first thing that I thought was, \"If God wakes up in the morning and opens the window of his bedroom, this is the view.\"",
      "And then we recorded everything in Italy, aesthetically with this woman that you see vulnerability and innocence, but then you also see her strength and her resilience.",
      "The album opens up with a mantra that I wrote with my life coach that repeats, \"I am, I am.\" It\u2019s just one minute. I want people to start the days like that. It's how I start my days.",
      "The interlude was my best friend. I asked him, \u201cIf you could describe the warrior of light, how would you describe her?\u201d",
      "And then it closes with a song that I wrote to my inner child. It begins with my mom and my grandmother singing. So it\u2019s very, very intentional, just a big ball of love.",
      "I think every song has something like \u201cLuna de Miel\u201d (with Rawayana), to me, is the wedding song of the album. \u201cLa de Dios\u201d is the moment to connect with the purest part of your heart, your inner child, and also to connect with God. It\u2019s a reminder in a world that right now is in a lot of chaos.",
      "\u201cAleluya!\u201d tells you, love without fear. \u201cAlma\u201d tells you, look at everything that you\u2019ve gone through. You\u2019ve always had everything and if you lose whatever you have, you\u2019re losing nothing.",
      "\u201cAm\u00e9n Beb\u00e9,\u201d you have a partner and you build something together, a best friend, a boyfriend, a dog, celebrate life. There\u2019s a little bit of everything. I\u2019m just grateful that I have an album that I think you can listen from beginning to end, and it\u2019s gonna be an experience.",
      "I\u2019m excited, happy. This is my first US tour. We\u2019re going to be presenting the album. We\u2019re preparing a very intimate show, which is how I like it. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s gonna be way too long and people are gonna tell me, \u201cYou guys have to leave.\u201d And we\u2019re all gonna be like, \u201cNo!\u201d",
      "I\u2019m excited to see my warriors of light. They\u2019re everything to me. We feed each other and we exchange energy. We elevate each other, and I\u2019m bringing now a work that I put all my heart and soul (into), and I can\u2019t wait for you guys to listen to it."

Experts estimate tens of thousands have been killed in the past week.",
      "With the key regional capital under a communications blackout, it has been left to eyewitness accounts as well as satellite imagery and video shared on social media to reveal the scale of what is unfolding in el-Fasher and the surrounding Darfur region, prompting humanitarian organizations to warn that the northeast African nation is returning to its genocidal past.",

      "Inside each ampule is the substance at the heart of the geopolitical strife between the United States and China: fentanyl, the deadly opioid at the center of a deal outlined by Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping on Thursday.",
      "NBC News got exclusive access to the headquarters of Yichang Humanwell Pharmaceutical, the largest producer of the drug in China, and indeed Asia, at its sprawling complex in the central city of Yichang.",
      "Humanwell says that it only supplies fentanyl for use in hospitals and that it does not export any medication to the United States, Mexico or Canada. In 51 years of operating, \u201cwe have never had a single incident of a drug going missing \u2014 not a single dose has ever been lost,\u201d its president, Du Wentao, said in an interview inside his factory, which is surrounded by high fences wrapped in concertina wire and electric sensors.",
      "Humanwell is one of only five companies in China licensed to produce fentanyl for use in hospitals, and it makes around 100 million doses of fentanyl variants each year.",
      "After a strict registration process to get past the main gate, all visitors and staff alike \u2014 including the CEO \u2014 are required to wear blue hospital caps, shoe covers and lab coats to ensure they do not contaminate the workspace.",
      "Most of the production line is automated to limit human contact, with the vials being washed and sterilized and then filled with fentanyl using long rubber tubes.",
      "Two staffers in protective gear supervised the process, with an alarm pinging every 10 minutes to remind them to spray their gloved hands with disinfectant. The vials are then inspected using flashes of light, stamped, boxed up and shipped out via a warehouse.",
      "Trump pressed Xi for a crackdown on fentanyl at a meeting in South Korea on Thursday, the last stop of his three-country Asian tour. The president said he would reduce his fentanyl tariff on China to 10% from 20%, effective immediately, after Xi agreed to intensify China\u2019s efforts to stem the illicit international flow of precursor chemicals for the deadly opioid.",
      "American officials say the Chinese government hasn\u2019t done enough to stem the illicit international flow of precursor chemicals for fentanyl, which are then processed into the highly addictive opioid in Mexican labs and smuggled across the border to the United States. Though deaths appear to be declining in the U.S., fentanyl and other synthetic opioids have killed hundreds of thousands of Americans in recent years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "China has previously defended its anti-fentanyl efforts and says unrelenting American demand for the drug is to blame for the crisis.",
      "But a State Department report to Congress last month accused the ruling Chinese Communist Party of continuing to \u201csubsidize and otherwise incentivize China-based companies to export synthetic drug precursors, including through tax rebates, monetary grants and awards, and official site visits.\u201d It accused companies controlled by the Communist Party of being \u201ccomplicit in this illicit trade.\u201d",
      "Under pressure from Trump, China made fentanyl a controlled substance in 2019, banning its use outside of medical prescriptions. That slowed the influx of Chinese fentanyl into the U.S., but the \u201cprolific export of chemical precursors and other illicit narcotics remains,\u201d the State Department report said.",
      "Chinese officials rejected that narrative. \u201cChina expresses sympathy for the American people suffering from the fentanyl crisis,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters in Beijing on Wednesday.",
      "But he added that \u201cChina is the country most resolute in drug control, with the most comprehensive policies and the best track record. It is also one of the countries with the largest number of controlled substances and the strictest regulations in the world.\u201d",
      "Du, the president of Humanwell Healthcare, which produces 100 million doses annually of fentanyl-based products, says that the meticulously clean, automated and controlled operation observed by NBC News was no facade.",
      "\u201cThe management of fentanyl drugs in China is among the strictest in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is absolutely no possibility that any dose from our company has flowed to the United States. I can state this with full confidence and certainty \u2014 there is no issue whatsoever.\u201d",
      "He derided the \"many statements in the U.S. claiming that the fentanyl crisis originates from China,\" saying that is impossible \"given how strict our controls are.\"",
      "As well as the visit to Humanwell, NBC News gained exclusive access to the National Narcotics Intelligence Center in Beijing, which had been sanctioned by Washington in 2020 but saw those measures lifted three years later during the Biden administration as the two countries agreed to resume cooperation on fentanyl.",
      "There, Chinese security officials said the two sides are again exchanging information on how smugglers alter their tactics.",
      "Fentanyl precursors are \"indeed one of our main concerns because drug synthesis techniques and methods are constantly evolving,\" lab director Hua Zhendong told NBC News.",
      "\"We have not found such processing plants domestically,\" he said, so \"most of the relevant information comes from technical exchanges with U.S. counterparts.\"",
      "Hua said the latest precursor chemicals identified by the U.S. \u201care added to our monitoring list so we can strengthen our attention to these substances.\"",
      "He said that banning all fentanyl products outside medical use in 2019 had \"effectively curbed illegal production and trafficking.\"",
      "U.S. officials say that's not the case. As Washington and Beijing seek common ground on the issue, experts say halting the illicit flow of fentanyl components is easier said than done.",
      "\u201cI think there is an assumption here that if the Chinese really wanted to shut off these precursors, they could do it,\u201d said Michael Swaine, a senior research fellow in the East Asia Program at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a Washington-based think tank, speaking ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting.",
      "The problem, he said, is that there is no \u201cset number\u201d of precursors to fentanyl.",
      "\u201cYou don't have a clear list of specific items that you would be able to easily interdict,\u201d Swaine said. \u201cAnd a lot of them, of course, are very dual-use items.\u201d",
      "So while there might be a \u201csymbolic effort\u201d to deal with the fentanyl issue after the Trump-Xi meeting, he said, \u201cI don't think that this is going to go completely away.\u201d"

The galleries, displaying mostly pieces never seen by the public, will hold its grand opening ceremony on Saturday.",
      "Details about the event are a closely guarded secret, but on a behind-the-scenes visit to the museum\u2019s Conservation Center earlier this month, general director Hussein Kamal told NBC News that it will be the first time since Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered over a century ago that all the items are stored in one place.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d he said, adding that he was particularly excited by the exhibition featuring King Tut\u2019s armor. The piece made from textiles and leather was \u201cunique throughout ancient Egyptian civilization,\u201d he said.",
      "Kamal said the items, previously held in a storeroom, were painstakingly restored since 2017 by some of the center\u2019s 150 conservators.",
      "\u201cWe tried to reshape it from the original,\u201d he said, adding that it was a challenge because they did not have anything to compare it to and had to depend on \u201cinvestigation and analysis to know the original structure of the armor.\u201d",
      "Believed to have become pharaoh when he was 8 or 9 years old, in around 1334 B.C., Tutankhamun ruled until his death 10 years later. He is believed to have suffered from numerous illnesses and disabilities, including circulatory problems, malaria, bone disease and a club foot.",
      "Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered in November 1922 in the Valley of the Kings by the British archaeologist Howard Carter, undisturbed by grave robbers and almost completely intact, nearly 400 miles south of Egypt\u2019s most famous archeological treasures in Giza.",
      "Now the artifacts recovered from that tomb will sit in the largest museum in the world dedicated to a single civilization \u2014 the Grand Egyptian Museum's grounds cover 117 acres, or the equivalent of 80 football fields, just over a mile north of the Great Pyramids of Giza outside Cairo.",
      "The collection also includes the 4,000-year-old funerary boat, also known as the Cheops ship, of Pharaoh Khufu.",
      "While the museum will officially open Tuesday, limited tours have been available since 2023, and the public is allowed access to most of its main galleries since October.",
      "Alongside the Tutankhamun exhibition, the museum holds artifacts from the prehistoric era, dating from 700,000 B.C., to the Roman era of the fourth century A.D., arranged around themes of kingship, society and beliefs.",
      "Statues, sarcophagi and stelae also offer a glimpse into the life of Egypt\u2019s ancient elite and how they prepared themselves for the afterlife.",
      "At the museum\u2019s center sits the six-story Grand Staircase with a view of the pyramids and an atrium containing monuments, pharaonic statues and sarcophagi.",
      "The opening ceremony will be the culmination of a project first announced in 1992. Construction officially began in 2005 and has been hit by repeated delays due to the Arab Spring in the early 2010s and the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Ahmed Ezz, the chairman of Ezz Steel, which provided all of the steel rebar needed for the project, said in an interview this week that the museum not only reflects his country\u2019s past but is \u201calso part of an architectural renaissance of Egypt.\u201d",

      "The most catastrophic storms \u2014 those with the most intense winds and soaking rains \u2014 were once rare, but they are becoming more likely because of climate change. And similarities are emerging among these powerful hurricanes\u2019 behavior and timing, too.",
      "Before Melissa hit Jamaica as a Category 5 monster, it churned over especially warm waters \u2014 as did other hurricanes over the past decade. This allowed it to strengthen at blistering pace, becoming the most powerful of this year\u2019s Atlantic season and tying the record for strongest landfall ever in the Atlantic.",
      "Then the storm slowed to a crawl, giving it more time to dump rain on Jamaica, another hallmark of hurricanes on a warming planet. Melissa\u2019s timing, too, was notable: It formed late in the season \u2014 hurricane activity has typically been thought to peak in early September \u2014 as ocean heat lingered into the fall.",
      "Taken together, this behavior makes Melissa a kind of poster child for the new normal of hurricanes, experts said.",

      "Climate change is increasing the risk of this \u201crapid intensification\u201d pattern, which the National Hurricane Center defines as an increase in sustained wind speeds of at least 35 mph over 24 hours.",
      "In Melissa\u2019s case, Winkley said, unusually warm sea-surface temperatures in the Caribbean and high levels of moisture in the atmosphere caused an \u201cextreme rapid intensification.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten really good at forecasting and understanding when hurricanes are going to make a big boost in intensity, but with Melissa, it even exceeded the best forecast that we can make for it in terms of wind speed,\u201d he said.",
      "Winkley added that the storm passed over Caribbean waters that were 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than usual \u2014 conditions that climate change made up to 700 times more likely.",
      "Two-and-a-half degrees Fahrenheit may not sound like a lot when it comes to a giant hurricane, but small temperature differences can really make a big impact,\u201d Winkley said.",
      "Many other recent storms have undergone rapid intensification. Last year, Hurricane Milton\u2019s wind speed increased by 90 mph in roughly 25 hours, and in 2022 Hurricane Ian went through two rounds of rapid intensification before making landfall in Florida. The list goes on: Hurricanes Idalia in 2023, Ida in 2021 and Harvey in 2017 all underwent rapid intensification, too.",
      "Fewer hurricanes, higher impact",
      "In the past 35 years, the number of hurricanes and tropical cyclones that form annually has been decreasing.",
      "\u201cWe find that the number of hurricanes globally, including typhoons, has gone down significantly since 1990,\u201d said Phil Klotzbach, an atmospheric scientist who studies hurricanes at Colorado State University.",
      "But that overall decrease is largely due to a drop in cyclone activity in the Pacific, Klotzbach said; Atlantic hurricane activity has risen, primarily as a result of a decades-long trend toward La Ni\u00f1a, a seasonal circulation pattern that tends to weaken the high-altitude winds that discourage hurricane formation.",
      "\u201cLa Ni\u00f1a is good for the Atlantic if you like hurricanes,\u201d Klotzbach said.",
      "When hurricanes do develop, they\u2019re more likely to turn into major storms as the seas warm.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increase of those reaching Category 4 and 5,\u201d Klotzbach said.",
      "Melissa was the third Category 5 hurricane this year \u2014 the first time in two decades that more than two storms of such power have formed in the same season.",
      "Zachary Handlos, an atmospheric scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said that although warmer seas in the future will be more conducive to hurricanes, a warmer atmosphere will force changes to the high-altitude winds that can prevent or destroy hurricanes. These winds could strengthen in some locations and weaken in others, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a very straightforward answer.\u201d",
      "How these trends will play out remains an active area of research and scientific dispute.",
      "A longer hurricane season",
      "It\u2019s not lost on experts that the strongest hurricane of the season hit just days before Halloween.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re pretty late into the season at this point. Things should be starting to wind down,\u201d said Derrick Herndon, a researcher in the Tropical Cyclone Research Group at the University of Wisconsin.",
      "The Caribbean has always been a hotspot for powerful, late-season hurricanes, but they\u2019re becoming even more likely, Klotzbach said \u2014 he recently submitted research showing the trend for peer review. At the same time, hurricane data in the era of satellite observations (from 1971 to 2022) suggests that hurricane season is beginning earlier in the year, too.",
      "The fall hurricane pattern has been fueled by the long-term trend toward the La Ni\u00f1a pattern, Klotzbach added, which itself is likely the result of a combination of climate change and natural variability.",
      "La Ni\u00f1a weakens high-altitude winds at a time when Caribbean waters are still hot, setting the stage for storms in late October and early November, he said: \u201cIt loads the dice toward these robust hurricanes.\u201d",
      "Hurricane Melissa was exacerbated by warmer-than-usual waters off Jamaica\u2019s southern coast.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to get a really intense hurricane in the Atlantic, it\u2019s going to probably be in this part of the world,\u201d Herndon said.",
      "In the past, such a storm would typically have churned up cold water from below the surface and stifled its own growth, according to Andy Hazelton, a hurricane modeler and associate scientist with the University of Miami\u2019s Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies. But this year, ocean heat is elevated both at the surface and as deep as 200 feet below, he said, so Melissa simply churned up more heat and energy.",
      "Storms are stalling",
      "Just before or after landfall, hurricanes are now more likely to stall and dump immense amounts of rain, according to a study published last year. Other research suggests their forward speed has gotten slower overall, though this remains a topic of debate.",
      "Hurricane Melissa followed the pattern, stalling off the coast of Jamaica as it continued to build intensity. On Tuesday morning, the day of its first landfall, the storm was moving at just around 2 mph. Forecasters expected up to 30 inches of rainfall in parts of Jamaica, which is more than a third of its annual average.",
      "Scientists have not reached a consensus about why some storms are moving more slowly, but some have theorized that it\u2019s because climate change has weakened atmospheric circulation patterns.",
      "Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was a dramatic example of the consequences of such stalling: When it parked over Houston, the storm dropped about 5 feet of rain in some locations. The pattern is particularly problematic because a warmer atmosphere can absorb and deliver more rainfall.",
      "\u201cFor every 1 degree Fahrenheit of warming, the atmosphere can hold onto 4% more moisture,\u201d Winkley said. \u201cWarmer oceans not only boost the intensity of hurricanes, but it allows for more evaporation, so it\u2019s putting more of that rain-making moisture into the atmosphere for these hurricanes to absorb and then unleash.\""

    "story": [
      "Extending the length of your daily walks can benefit your heart, new research suggests.",
      "In a study conducted among healthy adults, people who accumulated most of their daily steps in bouts of 15 minutes or longer had significantly lower risks of heart disease and death nearly a decade later than those who got in several shorter walks throughout the day. The study was published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.",
      "What\u2019s more, adults who had been less active in the past and went on longer walks showed the greatest health gains.",
      "An international team of scientists looked at the daily movements of 33,560 adults aged 62 on average and living in the U.K., using information collected from 2013 through 2015 in a medical research database called the UK Biobank. For three to seven days, participants wore an accelerometer on their wrist that recorded their physical activity.",
      "Researchers divided the people into four groups, based on how they logged most of their steps each day: in bouts shorter than five minutes, five to less than 10 minutes, 10 to less than 15 minutes and 15 minutes or longer. The largest group \u2014 42.9% of participants \u2014 fell into the under-five-minute category.",
      "After about 9\u00bd years of follow up, the researchers found that people who had walked in spurts of 15 minutes or longer had the lowest likelihood of dying during the study period, while people who took walks shorter than five minutes had the highest risk.",
      "People who walked in longer bouts also had lower risks of heart disease during the follow-up period, with risk increasing as walk duration shortened.",
      "Co-lead study author Borja del Pozo Cruz, a professor and researcher in the department of sports sciences at Universidad Europea de Madrid, calls the four walk durations \u201cdoses.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a clear dose response,\u201d del Pozo Cruz said. \u201cThe longer the bout, the better it is for the different health outcomes that we analyzed.\u201d",
      "The decision to study people\u2019s health via step accumulation patterns, as opposed to total number of steps or intensity of physical activity, was intentional, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to translate; everyone understands steps,\u201d del Pozo Cruz said. \u201cEveryone can essentially measure steps with their smartwatches or smartphones or pedometers or whatever. We thought focusing on steps would be much more impactful because their translation is immediate.\u201d",
      "Forget \u2018exercise snacks\u2019 and 10,000 steps a day",
      "The notion that adults should strive for 10,000 steps a day is more a marketing ploy to sell fitness trackers than a scientific guideline, according to Steven Riechman, a professor in the department of kinesiology and sport management at Texas A&M University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.",
      "Riechman said that the body goes through a number of adaptations as it shifts from rest mode to exercise mode \u2014 changes that take a bit of time. That could explain why people who walked in bouts shorter than five minutes didn\u2019t see as strong health gains, he said.",
      "\u201cYou need to get all the systems engaged and fully operational, and that\u2019s where the health benefits come from,\u201d Riechman said. \u201cThe one I particularly thought of, [which] the article did not mention, is that the increase in body temperature is probably not going to occur in less than five minutes of walking.\u201d",
      "Despite mixed research on the health benefits of 10,000 steps a day, the study considered people who achieved an average daily step count under 8,000 to be \u201csuboptimally active.\u201d All study participants logged fewer than 8,000 steps a day, and those who logged fewer than 5,000 were deemed sedentary. The median activity of all participants was 5,165 steps a day.",
      "The link between longer walking bouts and lower risks of early death and heart disease was more notable among sedentary participants, researchers found. Within this group, people who walked in bouts shorter than five minutes had a 5.13% risk of death during the study period, compared to a 0.86% risk for people who walked in bouts exceeding 15 minutes. Their risk of developing heart disease during the decade-long study period was 15.39% and 6.89%, respectively.",
      "\u201cYou have big returns from zero to something,\u201d Riechman said. \u201cThen you keep getting benefits, but they\u2019re just lower and lower. By the time you get to 10,000 [steps], you\u2019re not accumulating too many more benefits.\u201d",
      "The study is at odds with previous research that touts the merits of \u201cexercise snacks,\u201d or spurts of physical activity lasting less than five minutes. For instance, a study published earlier this month in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that exercise snacks improved the fitness levels of physically inactive adults. However, that study defined short spurts as structured, moderate-to-vigorous activity. The short spurts in del Pozo Cruz\u2019s study, on the other hand, included the unstructured, low-intensity steps one might accumulate throughout the course of the day.",
      "\u201cEvery step counts,\u201d according to the American Heart Association, a mantra Riechman supports. Some physical activity is always better than none.",
      "\u201cGetting out and getting some of the steps, for sure, there\u2019s definitely a benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, you\u2019re just not optimizing the benefits.\u201d",
      "\u2018Never too late\u2019 to start walking",
      "The study had several limitations, including that 97% of participants were white.",
      "Another research constraint is that participants\u2019 walking patterns represent a snapshot in time, and people\u2019s exercise habits may fluctuate over the years. Even so, the study\u2019s large sample size likely stabilized such variation, said Carmen Swain, director of the health and exercise science program at the Ohio State University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research.",
      "One of the study\u2019s biggest strengths, she said, is participants\u2019 average age: 62. It\u2019s a time of life when people may assume they\u2019re past the point of lowering their risk of heart disease and early death.",
      "\u201cYou can start [walking] at any age; it\u2019s not too late,\u201d Swain said. \u201cThe physiological adaptations that occur for a 20-year-old are also going to happen for a 60-year-old.\u201d",
      "Yes, a 60-year-old may already bear underlying signs of heart disease, she said, which is why it\u2019s even more important for older adults to maintain a walking regimen.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s often a challenge for this population to start because they haven\u2019t done it for so long,\u201d said Swain, who lectures her students on the power of walking. \u201cThere has to be motivation.\u201d",
      "With heart disease being the No. 1 killer of men and women in the U.S., Swain hopes the heart-health benefits of walking will be motivation enough.",
      "\u201cWalking is so democratic. You can just do it wherever you want, whenever you want, however you want,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good form of exercise.\u201d",
      "CORRECTION (Oct. 28, 2025, 11:12 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated Steven Riechman's title. He is professor, not an associate professor."

      "But what\u2019s known as the International Stabilization Force (ISF) is far from a reality, and so far it lacks a detailed mission, confirmed participants and sources of funding. So as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire frays \u2014 Israel carried out airstrikes in Gaza on Tuesday after, it said, Hamas fighters attacked its forces \u2014 several experts questioned its viability in interviews with NBC News.",
      "A key question is who would provide the soldiers required for the force.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re able to take care of it \u2014 very substantial nations,\u201d President Donald Trump said about the force and its future participants aboard Air Force One on Saturday. \u201cAnd we have Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, the three, and then you have many behind them. ... If you look, Turkey\u2019s involved. Indonesia is involved. Jordan, Egypt.",

      "Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah has said his country\u2019s troops wouldn\u2019t operate inside Gaza.",
      "Although Turkey has stated its willingness to commit forces, it has also said there needs to be a defined mission before it proceeds. And Israel has ruled out Ankara\u2019s involvement. (Turkey is an outspoken supporter of the Palestinians and a vocal critic of the war in Gaza.)",
      "The stakes could hardly be higher: Without stability, the Israeli military could resume its assault on the enclave \u2014 where nearly 70,000 Palestinians and hundreds of Israeli soldiers have already been killed \u2014 and Hamas could continue rearming and asserting its control over the shattered territory.",
      "Daniel B. Shapiro, who was the U.S. ambassador to Israel from 2011 to 2017, said that as an idea, the ISF was essential.",
      "It was \u201ccritical to have a transition security force,\u201d he told NBC News last week. \u201cOtherwise, there would be a complete vacuum.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio also stressed its importance last week during a trip to Israel.",
      "\u201cThere is no plan B,\u201d he said.",
      "While the Trump administration has repeatedly ruled out sending American soldiers into Gaza, Rubio said \u201ca lot of countries have expressed interest\u201d in joining the force, including Indonesia and Azerbaijan.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019d want to know what\u2019s the mandate, what\u2019s the mission, what are the rules of engagement, what is this force supposed to do,\u201d he said, adding that Israelis would be \u201cin this force.\u201d",
      "NBC News has reached out to embassies of the countries Trump and Rubio most recently mentioned as possible participants \u2014 Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, Turkey, Indonesia and Azerbaijan \u2014 and none replied to questions about the ISF.",
      "Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto did say in a speech at the United Nations in September that his country was ready to deploy troops to Gaza.",
      "According to Rubio, one complication is that many of the countries that have said they are willing to send troops, money or both would require a United Nations resolution or an international agreement to authorize their involvement. Israel has long been deeply critical of the role the U.N. plays in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, accusing it of bias and of perpetuating the conflict by maintaining Palestinians in a permanent refugee status.",
      "Hamas, which hasn\u2019t commented on the ISF plans, is also a wild card.",
      "Even in the \u201cbest case scenario,\u201d it would most likely take months to establish any kind of international stabilization force in the enclave, especially if Hamas doesn\u2019t agree to lay down its weapons, said Shapiro, who is a fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic Council think tank, pointing to a key stipulation of Trump\u2019s plan and a long-standing demand from Israel.",
      "Natan Sachs, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute think tank, said, \u201cIf a security force was charged with disarming [Hamas] and dislodging them as the Trump plan detailed, there is no question to my mind that they would resist that and resist that with force.\u201d",
      "As well as the makeup and number of troops, it isn\u2019t clear how the force would be funded, although Matthew Duss, the executive vice president of the Center for International Policy, a Washington-based think tank, said he thought \u201cthe presumption is that the Arab states, the Saudis, others would be paying for this.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs much as it\u2019s being talked about, there\u2019s very little in the way of details that have been worked out yet,\u201d said Duss, a former foreign policy adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.",
      "Although he was \u201cvery skeptical\u201d about the plan, Duss said an international, U.N.-backed force \u201cbrought stability\u201d in the Balkans after the breakup of the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s.",
      "But at a regional level, he said, the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) hadn\u2019t \u201cworked as well.\u201d Tasked with keeping the peace between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group, which, like Hamas, is funded by Iran, UNIFIL peacekeepers have on many occasions been caught in the crossfire or come under attack themselves.",
      "\u201cYou need a force there that is just going to create some measure of law and order,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven that the Gaza Strip has been utterly devastated, this is an enormous task \u2014 even the most committed and efficient military would have trouble in this scenario.

      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said he apologized to President Donald Trump for an Ontario government ad that used Ronald Reagan\u2019s words to criticize Trump\u2019s trade policy.",
      "\u201cI did apologize,\u201d Carney told reporters on Saturday after attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Gyeongju, South Korea.",
      "Trump \u201cwas offended\u201d by the ad, he added, saying that the TV ad, which was not sponsored by the Canadian government, was \u201cnot something I would have done\u201d and that he told Ontario Premier Doug Ford that he did not want him to use it.",
      "The ad, which used clips of Reagan in order to criticize Trump\u2019s trade policy, so angered Trump that last week he announced a halt to trade talks with Canada, one of America\u2019s biggest trading partners.",
      "He also accused Canada\u2019s government \u2014 which did not sponsor the ad \u2014 of what he called \u201cegregious behavior\u201d that was intended to \u201cinterfere with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, and other courts\u201d on tariffs.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments next month in a case challenging many of Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "The president said Friday that Carney had apologized, telling reporters aboard Air Force One that he had a \u201cvery good relationship\u201d with the leader, \u201cbut what he did was wrong.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was very nice \u2014 he apologized for what they did with the commercial because it was a very false commercial,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The ad, which Ford ran on TV during the World Series, used genuine but rearranged lines from a speech Reagan gave in 1987 while president.",
      "The ad starts with Reagan saying, \u201cWhen someone says, \u2018Let\u2019s impose tariffs on foreign imports,\u2019 it looks like they\u2019re doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs, and sometimes for a short while it works, but only for a short time.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer,\u201d he continues in the ad. \u201cThen the worst happens: Markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down, and millions of people lose their jobs.\u201d",
      "Reagan was a staunch free trade advocate. The purpose of the speech was to explain why \u2014 despite his strong dislike of tariffs \u2014 he had imposed retaliatory import duties on certain Japanese products."

      "Andrew Mountbatten Windsor: No longer a prince, but is he no longer a threat to the British monarchy?",
      "King Charles III's move to banish his brother was largely welcomed Friday by the British media, politicians and royal observers as a necessary, if overdue, intervention.",
      "It\u2019s the fourth attempt by Buckingham Palace to shield itself from the scandal over Andrew's ties to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and the king will be hoping it is the last.",
      "Andrew, who just two weeks ago announced he would relinquish the use of his Duke of York title, has now been formally stripped of it and all his other royal titles, and effectively evicted from the 30-room mansion where he has lived for more than 20 years. It marks a dramatic culmination of a saga that has proved so damaging for the institution as it navigates waning popularity, family feuds and health crises.",
      "\"The king realized that it wasn't enough for him to just say that he would no longer use his title Duke of York, but more action had to be taken,\" NBC News royal contributor Emily Nash said. \"He understood that this was really getting to a point where it was doing very serious damage to the royal family.\"",
      "Nash pointed to just how rare a step Charles has taken \u2014 the last prince to be stripped of his title was punished for fighting for  Germany in World War 1.",
      "Andrew first stepped back from royal duties in 2019 after his disastrous BBC interview in which he cited an inability to sweat that he said contradicted allegations against him, and in 2022, Queen Elizabeth II stripped him of his royal and military patronages.",
      "The move two weeks ago appeared designed to head off fallout from a renewed wave of revelations. But instead they appeared to open the floodgates.",
      "The token rent of \"one peppercorn\u201d that Andrew has reportedly paid on his sprawling Royal Lodge home since funding its renovation two decades ago drew outrage not just from the press, but also in Parliament, as the scandal threatened to break long-standing norms that helped shield the monarchy from public scrutiny.",
      "On Monday, Charles was heckled by a protester who shouted about whether he had \u201casked the police to cover up\u201d for his brother, and how long he had known about Andrew and Epstein.",
      "Then came the statement from Buckingham Palace. \"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,\" it read.",
      "The measures taken by the king received approving coverage Friday in much of the tabloid media, and were welcomed \"warmly\" by a government minister, as well as the leaders of the opposition Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties.",
      "\u201cThe monarchy can see that the PR war has been lost until now, and to win it, they need to show distaste for what Andrew has done and show solidarity with the victims,\u201d said royal historian Andrew Lownie, author of a recent biography of Andrew and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson.",
      "Lownie said he believed there may even be grounds for a criminal investigation.",
      "The publication of late Epstein survivor Virginia Roberts Giuffre\u2019s posthumous memoir, which added new detail to her allegations that Andrew had sex with her on at least three occasions, had intensified the pressure on the royals.",
      "Giuffre, with whom Andrew settled a suit in 2022 for an undisclosed amount after she accused him of sexually assaulting her when she was 17 years old, committed suicide in April. Andrew has repeatedly denied having met her and previously denied that a photograph of the two of them is real.",
      "In his statement two weeks ago, Andrew cited \u201cthe continued accusations about me\u201d as a distraction. \u201cAs I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me,\u201d he said.",
      "Charles' expression of solidarity with Epstein's victims, \"stood in total contrast,\" to this, said Craig Prescott, who teaches law at Royal Holloway, University of London, and specializes in the constitutional and political role of the monarchy.",
      "\"That difference speaks volumes,\" he said. \"This is the most drastic move the king could have made.\"",
      "Charles\u2019 order comes with immediate effect and Andrew will be forced to leave Royal Lodge as soon as is practicable. He will move to a property on the royal family\u2019s private estate 140 miles away in Sandringham, though it is understood that Ferguson will not be joining him.",
      "Buckingham Palace said the king\u2019s decision was made with the support of the wider family, including his son and heir, Prince William \u2014 who is widely viewed as supporting a firmer stance on Andrew as he looks ahead to his own reign.",
      "But not everyone is satisfied by Andrew being cast out from the royal family.",
      "\"Being told that you have to live in your own house and being called by your name is not a punishment,\" said Graham Smith, the chief executive of the anti-monarchy campaign group, Republic.",
      "Smith called for a proper investigation into Andrew's ties with Epstein and the role the rest of the family may have played in the scandal.",
      "He added that Republic was pursuing a private prosecution, which could culminate in the public prosecutor taking over the case if there's deemed to be enough merit.",
      "Lownie said Charles may have decided to kick Andrew out now because, \u201cthey\u2019re worried new revelations might come out about his relationship with Epstein.\u201d",

The arrangement was revealed in a Freedom of Information Act request by The Times newspaper last week.",
      "The palace said: \"His lease on Royal Lodge has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation.\"",

      "Legal documents published by The Times, not verified by NBC News, indicated that Andrew paid 1 million pounds for the lease when he moved into the property in 2004, also paying 7.5 million pounds for refurbishment works. The palace and Andrew did not previously comment on the reports.",

      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, wrote that she had sex with the prince on three occasions, including an \u201corgy\u201d involving \u201ceight other young girls\u201d who \u201cappeared to be under the age of 18 and didn\u2019t really speak English.\u201d",

      "\"Today, an ordinary American girl from an ordinary American family, brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage,\" Giuffre's family said in a statement Thursday after the statement from Buckingham Palace was released. \"Virginia Roberts Giuffre, our sister, a child when she was sexually assaulted by Andrew, never stopped fighting for accountability for what had happened to her and to countless other survivors like her.

      "Trump appeared to relish his reception from leaders of Asian allies and partners who sought every possible opportunity to flatter and delight him even as their countries are reeling from the impact of his tariffs and other policies.",
      "Putting his arms literally and figuratively around Japan\u2019s newly elected Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Trump in Tokyo promised a \u201cnew golden age\u201d of U.S.-Japan relations and accepted a gift of cherry blossom trees and a putter that belonged to his friend, the late former Japanese leader Shinzo Abe.",
      "Takaichi was the second Asian leader on this trip to say she would nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize he so highly covets, after Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, whose ceasefire agreement with Thailand was brokered in part by Trump.",
      "In Gyeongju, Trump received a large golden crown, a replica of the crown of the ancient Korean kingdom of Silla, from South Korean President Lee Jae Myung. Trump and Lee were pictured in a gift shop at the Gyeongju National Museum, where items on display included a red \u201cUSA\u201d hat, Trump-branded sneakers and a shirt bearing the president\u2019s mug shot.",
      "A fighter jet escort and traditional dancers greeted Trump as he arrived Sunday in Malaysia, the first stop on his trip. After joining Trump in his motorcade, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim cracked a joke about a shared commonality, a reminder of some of the challenges faced by the American president before his election last November.",
      "\u201cI was in prison, but you almost got there,\u201d Ibrahim quipped.",
      "Even Xi, before sitting down with Trump in South Korea for their first meeting since Trump returned to office, told the president that China\u2019s development \u201cgoes hand in hand with your vision to make America great again.\u201d",
      "Trump said the meeting with Xi, which lasted about an hour and 40 minutes, was \u201camazing,\u201d rating it a \u201c12\u201d on a scale of zero to 10.",
      "The warm embrace of Trump during the trip marked a contrast to the months of tense negotiations that preceded it. The administration had pushed ahead with a series of punishing tariffs as part of a broader effort to reset trade relationships.",
      "Rates for key U.S. allies Japan and South Korea, now at 15%, are below those imposed on other countries but still high by historical standards, and have greatly strained ties.",
      "\u201cThe agreement that was signed between the Japanese government and the American government on tariffs is so unbelievably one-sided,\u201d said Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus. \u201cAnd the American side has sort of been trumpeting that fact.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, a South Korean mayor flew to Washington to protest Trump\u2019s tariffs outside the White House, saying 50% levies on steel in particular were pushing his steelmaking hub of Pohang to the brink of collapse.",
      "Pohang is only about 30 minutes from Gyeongju, where Trump met with South Korean officials Wednesday to finalize a trade deal with the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy. Trump said that a trade deal had been \u201cpretty much finalized,\u201d the details of which were later confirmed by a senior South Korean official.",
      "The U.S.-South Korea trade deal comes less than two months after more than 300 South Korean workers were escorted in chains from a Hyundai plant in Georgia during a raid by U.S. immigration officials, a shocking sight that humiliated Koreans.",
      "The image aired continuously on news programs in South Korea, which only weeks earlier had pledged $350 billion in U.S. investment. The workers later returned home without charges to cheers and protests, and a conciliatory message from Trump, who said he wanted foreign companies \u201cto bring their people of expertise\u201d into the country and didn\u2019t want to \u201cfrighten off\u201d investment.",
      "Leaders this week signaled that they were ready to move past the friction. Takaichi signed framework agreements with the U.S. to secure a supply of rare earths and on nuclear power reactors, and even told Trump that she is considering a purchase of Ford F-150s for government work even though they are widely considered too big for Japanese streets. Trump responded by offering her \u201canything you want.\u201d",
      "Addressing business executives in Gyeongju, Trump reflected on the differences between corporate dealmaking and heads-of-state diplomacy. He said he never believed in the idea of a win-win deal, but has since learned to search for balance.",
      "\u201cIt really is a little bit different than you\u2019re doing a business deal, and you want to just rip their hearts out,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut when you have nations, it\u2019s a little bit different. You\u2019ve got to all balance out a little bit.\u201d",

      "Trump said he trusts Xi will \u201cwork very hard\u201d to stop the illicit flow of fentanyl precursors, the chemicals used to make the deadly opioid, from China to other countries. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see a big difference,\u201d he said.",
      "U.S. officials say China has not done enough to stop the illegal export of the precursor ingredients, which are processed into fentanyl in Mexican labs and then smuggled into the United States.",
      "China has rejected the accusations, calling its anti-fentanyl efforts the \u201cmost relentless\u201d in the world.",
      "Rare earth materials",
      "A key issue in U.S.-China trade negotiations has been rare earth materials, which are crucial for making magnets that go in everything from turbines to electric vehicles.",
      "China, which has a near-monopoly on the global supply, rattled automakers around the world when it imposed strict export controls on the materials, saying it was trying to snuff out their military use, and it has since used them as a powerful bargaining chip in trade talks.",
      "Trump said Xi had agreed to a one-year reprieve on the curbs that is likely to be \u201croutinely extended.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll of the rare earth has been settled, and that\u2019s for the world,\u201d he said. A White House official standing alongside him said Trump and Xi had come to \u201can understanding\u201d and that China is \u201cnot going to impose the rare earth controls that they proposed.\u201d",
      "Analysts say even though the United States is pushing to reduce its reliance on China for the materials \u2014 with Trump signing critical minerals agreements with Thailand, Malaysia and Japan on this trip \u2014 it will be a while before that happens.",
      "\u201cBuilding new mines and, especially, expanding processing capacity \u2014 which is the real bottleneck \u2014 requires years of sustained effort and substantial investment,\u201d Patrik Andersson, an analyst at the Swedish National China Centre at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, told NBC News.",
      "Soybeans",
      "Trump said China, which resumed purchases of U.S. soybeans ahead of the meeting after having boycotted them for months, would purchase \u201clarge, tremendous amounts of soybeans and other farm products.\u201d",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said China would buy 12 million metric tons of soybeans from the United States between now and January as part of an agreement to purchase 25 million metric tons annually for three years.",
      "The halt in purchases from China, the biggest market for U.S. soybeans, has been a major pain point for American farmers, who have been pressing the Trump administration to resolve the issue.",
      "China had not purchased any U.S. soybeans since May, sourcing instead from South American countries such as Argentina and Brazil.",
      "\"Our great soybean farmers, who the Chinese used as political pawns, that\u2019s off the table, and they should prosper in the years to come,\u201d Bessent said in an interview on Fox Business Network\u2019s \u201cMornings with Maria.\u201d",

      "GYEONGJU, South Korea \u2014 President Donald Trump said Thursday after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping that he was lowering tariffs in exchange for a crackdown on fentanyl and that he would visit China in April.",
      "Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on his way back to Washington, Trump said he would reduce his fentanyl tariff on China to 10% from 20%, effective immediately, after Xi agreed to intensify China\u2019s efforts to stem the illicit international flow of precursor chemicals for the deadly opioid.",
      "He said his meeting with Xi was \u201camazing,\u201d rating it a \u201c12\u201d on a scale of one to 10, and said that with few major obstacles remaining, a sweeping trade deal would soon be ready.",
      "Trump said he would visit China in April, and that Xi would visit the United States \u201csome time after that,\u201d either at Mar-a-Lago or in Washington.",
      "Xi told Trump that the U.S. and China should maintain \u201ccommunication at all levels\u201d to avoid a \u201cvicious cycle of retaliation.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrade should remain the ballast and propeller of China-U.S. relations, not a stumbling block or source of conflict,\u201d Xi said according to a readout released by Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency.",
      "The meeting in South Korea between the two leaders, their first since Trump returned to the White House, lasted about an hour and 40 minutes and was the climax of Trump\u2019s three-country Asia tour.",
      "Some issues were not addressed at all, Trump said, including the status of Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "Ahead of the meeting, some White House aides had worried that Trump might shift long-standing U.S. policy on the island in exchange for concessions from China, NBC News reported earlier this week.",
      "Before the meeting, Trump called Xi a longtime friend and \u201ctough negotiator.\u201d His Chinese counterpart acknowledged \u201cfrictions\u201d between the world\u2019s two biggest economies, saying that \u201cgiven our different national conditions, we do not always see eye to eye.\u201d",
      "Other tariffs remain, a White House official said.",
      "Earlier in the week, Bessent said a TikTok deal may be finalized during the meeting between Trump and Xi. Trump didn't mention a deal on the popular Chinese-owned app, whose U.S. operations are required to be sold to a U.S. owner under a law that was passed last year based on national security concerns. But Bessent told Fox Business Network after the meeting that China had approved a deal during talks in Kuala Lumpur, and that other finalizations for the deal would occur over the next weeks and months.",
      "After the meeting, the spokesperson for China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement that the country agreed \u201cto work with the US to properly resolve issues related to TikTok,\u201d according to a translation.",
      "Both Trump and Xi wanted the optics and tactical aspect of this meeting to go well, a person familiar with the planning said beforehand.",
      "Still, Trump is continuing a long-standing practice of meeting with allies before Beijing, which former Assistant Secretary of State Dave Stilwell said indicates that the U.S. is not going to trade its alliance commitments for a deal with China.",
      "During Trump\u2019s five-day trip to Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, he signed agreements with all three countries, as well as Thailand and Cambodia; made new foreign investment announcements; and proclaimed that tariff leverage can drive warring parties to stand down.",
      "Reflecting on his approach, Trump said going against the grain can sometimes deliver results.",
      "\u201cOftentimes you\u2019ll go the opposite way of almost everybody, and you\u2019ll be the one that\u2019s right, and the others will be the one that\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said in Gyeongju, South Korea, offering a peek into his thinking. \u201cThat\u2019s where you have your greatest successes.\u201d",
      "Miles Yu, a former State Department adviser on China, said the U.S. and Beijing are \u201csizing each other out\u201d with trade now a key battleground issue. Washington is pushing for concrete steps on fentanyl, market access and more, he said, while China \u201cstonewalls and foot-drags\u201d and offers only broad \u201cframeworks.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the root cause of the five rounds of futile negotiations so far with China without a breakthrough,\u201d Yu said, adding that the administration is trying to shift China\u2019s approach by rallying its neighbors, a strategy that he said \u201cmay or may not work.\u201d",
      "After talks with Chinese counterparts in Malaysia last weekend, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said negotiators had shaped a framework for Trump and Xi to consider that spanned tariffs, trade, fentanyl, rare earths and \u201csubstantial\u201d purchases of U.S. agricultural products.",
      "He credited Trump\u2019s threat of an additional 100% tariff with creating leverage and said he believed that the framework would avoid that outcome and open space for tackling other issues.",
      "Xi said Thursday that the framework agreed to in Malaysia had \u201cprovided the necessary conditions for our meeting today.\u201d",
      "Dan Caldwell, a former senior adviser to U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, said Trump deserved credit for pursuing a pragmatic China policy that maintained what he said was strategic ambiguity while taking steps to restore important military capabilities to deter Chinese aggression.",
      "\u201cA lot of folks wanted to assume that he was going to be reflexively hawkish on China,\u201d Caldwell said of Trump. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t been the case.\u201d",
      "But Caldwell cautioned against expecting a breakthrough in Busan. \u201cI don\u2019t think the overall push hinges on one meeting,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cIdeally, these go well, but the whole thing does not hinge on just one set of talks.\u201d",
      "In other words, the goal was to make enough progress to get to the next date between the two leaders.",
      "Analysts in the region, too, saw limited room for a sweeping agreement this week.",
      "\u201cSome sort of consensus and agreements are very possible,\u201d said Zeng Jinghan, a professor of international relations at the City University of Hong Kong, given that both sides want \u201ca little bit of de-escalation.\u201d",
      "But Trump and Xi were unlikely to reach a comprehensive deal that settles the long-term structural differences between their countries, he said.",
      "The hope instead is for \u201cless aggressive\u201d rhetoric, Zeng said, with both Beijing and Washington likely to come back and declare the meeting a success."

Xi has for months pushed for a shift in the U.S. position on Taiwan from the current one, which is that the United States does \u201cnot support\u201d its independence, to saying the United States \u201copposes\u201d it.",
      "While many Americans might see that as a different way of saying the same thing, were Trump to say the United States opposes Taiwan\u2019s independence or even that independence is not a good idea at this time, it would send shock waves across Asia and be seen as a huge gift to Xi.",
      "Openly expressing opposition to Taiwan\u2019s independence would be seen as moving the United States from a neutral position on the issue to clearly standing on the side of China. For decades, U.S. administrations have adopted a policy of strategic ambiguity toward Taiwan, known as the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, and presidents have taken the public position of not supporting its independence.",

      "Asked what the Trump administration\u2019s policy on Taiwan\u2019s independence was, a senior State Department official said, \u201cThe policy on Taiwan hasn\u2019t changed one bit.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s as consistent as it\u2019s been for decades,\u201d the official said Monday.",
      "China sees democratic and self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that must be reunited with the mainland by military force if necessary. Taipei rejects Beijing\u2019s claims of sovereignty and seeks to maintain its de facto independence even if it is not formally recognized by most countries.",
      "\u201cThe Taiwan question is at the core of China\u2019s core interests, and the first red line that cannot be crossed in China-US relations,\u201d Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said by email when he was asked for comment.",
      "\u201cThere is but one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China\u2019s territory. This is a consensus of the international community and a political commitment made by the U.S. to China,\u201d Liu said.",
      "Taiwanese officials are also uneasy about the upcoming Trump-Xi meeting and have expressed their own concerns to State Department officials that Trump could abandon Taiwan to secure a win from the meeting, one of the people familiar with the discussions said.",
      "Asked by reporters about Taiwan\u2019s apprehension, Secretary of State Marco Rubio brushed the concerns aside.",
      "\u201cWhat people are worried about is we\u2019re going to get some trade deal where we\u2019re going to get favorable treatment on trade in exchange for walking away from Taiwan,\u201d Rubio said Saturday en route to Asia for this week\u2019s meetings. \u201cNo one is contemplating that.\u201d",
      "Taiwan\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry took to social media soon after, expressing its appreciation to Rubio for \u201creaffirming no one is contemplating walking away from Taiwan.\u201d",
      "Abigail Williams, Courtney Kube, Carol E. Lee and Monica Alba reported from Washington and Katherine Doyle from Tokyo."

      "Canada is on track to lose its measles elimination status as an outbreak that began a year ago continues to spread.",
      "The United States could follow in the coming months.",
      "The Canadian outbreak began in October 2024 in New Brunswick, a province on the country\u2019s eastern seaboard. As of Tuesday, more than 5,000 cases had been reported. Two babies have died.",
      "Canada eliminated measles in 1998. The U.S. followed two years later, in 2000.",
      "There are multiple criteria for losing an official measles elimination status, including the declines in vaccination rates observed in both countries.",
      "But the most significant factor is having ongoing measles transmission for a full year.",
      "\u201cTo really say that a country has lost the status, it takes 12 months of continuous transmission with the same genotype and the same strain of the virus,\u201d said Daniel Salas, an immunization expert with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).",
      "Canada hit that mark this week.",
      "PAHO, which is part of the World Health Organization, is the group charged with determining whether a country in North, South or Central America has eliminated measles. It is set to convene next week in Mexico City to analyze measles data through the end of October.",
      "If a country loses its measles elimination status, \u201ca corrective action plan will be requested to guide efforts to regain elimination,\u201d according to a PAHO spokesman.",
      "It\u2019s highly unlikely that the U.S. will lose its elimination status during the upcoming meeting, Salas said, because the ongoing outbreak began in January.",
      "In the U.S., at least 1,618 measles cases have been logged so far this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The outbreak that threatens the U.S. elimination status began in West Texas in late January. More than 800 people in Texas and New Mexico have been infected, and the outbreak has spread to other states. Three people died, including two young girls.",
      "It will take time to analyze whether ongoing spread in Arizona, Utah and South Carolina is linked to the West Texas outbreak.",
      "The elimination of measles in the U.S. and Canada \u201cwas a huge achievement,\u201d Salas said. \u201cWhen we say that we sustain the elimination as a region, we are also acknowledging each country for their efforts.\u201d",
      "The possibility of elimination status in Canada is \u201ca wake-up call that we need to do better in vaccinating our general public so we don\u2019t have outbreaks like this,\u201d Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Toronto, said in an interview this week with CTV Television Network in Toronto.",
      "The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is extraordinarily effective, according to the CDC. Two doses, usually given around ages 1 and 5, are 97% effective at preventing infection."
