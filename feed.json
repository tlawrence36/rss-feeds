      "King Charles III has led his family to church on foot ahead of his annual Christmas Day speech that is expected to focus on pilgrimage",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 King Charles III led his family to church on foot Thursday, hours before his annual Christmas Day speech to the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth was expected to focus on the theme of pilgrimage.",
      "Charles and Queen Camilla, along with the Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Kate, and their children, Princes George and Louis and Princess Charlotte, and extended family walked to St. Mary Magdalene Church on the king's private Sandringham Estate.",
      "The location is about 100 miles north of London, where Charles recorded the address from Westminster Abbey, the landmark known for the lavish coronations and royal weddings it has hosted for more than 1,000 years.",
      "The abbey is also the focus of an annual pilgrimage to the tomb of Edward the Confessor, which lies at the heart of the church. Edward, a monk-like monarch, was canonized as a saint in 1161.",
      "The monarch\u2019s annual holiday message is watched by millions of people in the U.K. and across the Commonwealth, a voluntary association of 56 independent nations, most of which have historic ties to Britain. The prerecorded speech is broadcast at 3 p.m., when many families are enjoying their traditional Christmas lunch.",
      "The speech is one of the rare occasions when Charles, 77, is able to voice his own views and doesn\u2019t seek guidance from the government. It usually has a strong religious framework, reflects current issues and sometimes draws on the monarch\u2019s personal experiences.",

      "The king was diagnosed with a still undisclosed form of cancer in early 2024. Buckingham Palace says his treatment is now moving to a \u201cprecautionary phase\u201d and his condition will be monitored to ensure his continued recovery.",
      "Charles recorded last year\u2019s speech at Fitzrovia Chapel, which was once part of the now demolished Middlesex Hospital. During that address, he honored care workers around the country and gave a special thanks to the doctors and nurses who supported him after his cancer diagnosis.",
      "This year\u2019s Christmas speech will be the fourth since Charles ascended to the throne after his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, died in September 2022.",

      "He started off painting only in black and white until he was around 30 years old because of his colorblindness, a congenital condition which makes it difficult for people to tell the difference between certain colors, particularly red and green, and shades of color. There is no cure for the condition, which for D\u00e1vila also makes the colors pink, violet, turquoise and yellow-green confusing.",
      "Since the mid-1980s, D\u00e1vila has painted in color through the help of glasses developed by an ophthalmologist in New York, where D\u00e1vila was living at the time. One lens is transparent and the other is shaded red, and they help him discriminate between contrasting shades that normally blur together. With the lenses, he can see almost two-thirds of the colors, but without them he only sees around 40% of the colors.",
      "D\u00e1vila compared his condition to having a box of chocolates but only being able to eat a sample of the selection. He says he has such a strong desire to see every color.",
      "\u201cIt's something that I miss in my life, that if somebody says, \u2018Look at this flower,\u2019 which is bright, bright pink, I want to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's something that comes from my heart so passionately. I can feel the vibration of color.\u201d",

      "Attorneys for the man accused of killing iconic rapper Tupac Shakur are pushing to suppress evidence that was collected in what they say was an unlawful nighttime search",
      "LAS VEGAS -- The attorneys for the man accused of killing rap icon Tupac Shakur in 1996 are pushing to suppress evidence obtained in what they claim was an \u201cunlawful nighttime search.\u201d",
      "Las Vegas criminal defense attorneys Robert Draskovich and William Brown filed a motion this week on behalf of their client, Duane \u201cKeffe D\u201d Davis, who was charged in the drive-by shooting of the iconic rapper off the Las Vegas Strip.",
      "Davis' attorneys argue a judge relied on a \u201cmisleading portrait\u201d of Davis as a dangerous drug dealer to grant the execution of a search warrant at night, which should only be done in exceptional circumstances, such as if there\u2019s a risk that evidence will disappear if officers wait until morning.",
      "In reality, Davis, an ex- gang leader from Southern California, had left the narcotics trade in 2008 and began doing inspection work for oil refineries, his attorneys say. He was a 60-year-old retired cancer survivor with adult children and grandchildren and had been living with his wife in Henderson, a city outside of Las Vegas, for nine years at the time the warrant was executed.",
      "\u201cThe court wasn\u2019t told any of this,\u201d his attorneys wrote in the motion. \u201cAs a result, the court authorized a nighttime search based on a portrait of Davis that bore little resemblance to reality \u2014 a clearly erroneous factual determination, in other words.\u201d",
      "The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department \u2014 which conducted the search and collected Davis' electronic devices, \u201cpurported marijuana\u201d and tubs of photographs \u2014 declined to comment Friday, citing the pending litigation. At the time of the search, police said executing the warrant under the cover of darkness would allow officers to surround and secure the residence, and that if Davis barricaded himself, the darkness would allow officers to evacuate the surrounding homes with the least exposure to residents.",

      "His attorneys claim Davis\u2019 arrest stems from false public statements Davis had made in which he claimed to be present in the white Cadillac from which Shakur was shot. They say he has never offered details that would firmly corroborate his presence in the car, and that he benefited from saying he was present. He dodged drug charges by telling the story in a proffer agreement, and he has made money by repeating it in documentaries and his 2019 book, according to his attorneys.",
      "He sought to dismiss his murder charges in the Nevada Supreme Court, but in November his petition was denied.",
      "\u201cThink of it this way: Shakur\u2019s murder was essentially the entertainment world\u2019s JFK assassination \u2014 endlessly dissected, mythologized, monetized \u2014 so it\u2019s not hard to see why someone in Davis\u2019s position might falsely place himself at the center of it all for personal gain,\u201d his attorneys wrote.",

      "Spurs at Thunder, 2:30 p.m., ESPN/ABC \u2014 Victor Wembanyama and the Spurs are one of the league's up-and-coming teams, making the NBA Cup final before losing to the Knicks last week. The Thunder won a championship last season and have the league's best record this year at 25-3. Adding a little spice: The Spurs knocked the Thunder out of the NBA Cup in the semifinals earlier this month.",

      "Christian music is growing in popularity while other genres struggle to grow new listenership",
      "NEW YORK -- It is one of the most surprising music stories of the year. While streams of new music \u2014 releases from the last 18 months \u2014 were down from last year, one genre is on the rise: Christian and gospel music, according to industry data and analytics company Luminate\u2019s 2025 Midyear Report.",
      "Jaime Marconette, Luminate\u2019s vice president of music insights and industry relations, said the shift is led by acts like Forrest Frank, Brandon Lake and Elevation Worship, who are connecting with a \u201cyounger, streaming-forward fan base\u201d that's 60% female and 30% millennial. In fact, for the first time in 11 years, two contemporary Christian music songs \u2014 Frank\u2019s \u201cYour Way\u2019s Better\u201d and Lake\u2019s \u201cHard Fought Hallelujah\u201d with Jelly Roll \u2014 broke through the Billboard Hot 100's all-genre Top 40, placing them in direct competition with mainstream artists.",
      "It's also why traditionally secular artists like Jelly Roll, Killer Mike and T.I. are nominated in Christian music categories at the forthcoming 2026 Grammys \u2014 the lines are blurring.",
      "\u201cChristian music (is) unlike any other genre that\u2019s defined by a sonic component. Christian music is defined by its lyrical component,\u201d says Holly Zabka, the president of Provident Entertainment, a Sony Christian music subsidiary. \u201cIt\u2019s not limited to a narrow definition. It\u2019s a lyrical component that can appeal to anyone\u2019s musical preference.\u201d",
      "From a label perspective, she\u2019s interested in pursuing artists that \u201cdon\u2019t have to fit within that narrow lane of Christian bookstore and Christian radio. It can be rap, hip-hop, it can be rock, it can be country, and that\u2019s appealing to a broader audience because it\u2019s what they\u2019re already listening to,\u201d she says. \u201cVery few people listen in a vacuum and only listen to one genre.\u201d",
      "But for many years, CCM jas held a reputation for being unimaginative \u2014 what writer John Jeremiah Sullivan infamously referred to as \u201cexcellence-proof\u201d \u2014 for its tendency to mimic and water down popular, contemporary mainstream sounds for a religious audience.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely there\u2019s been an improvement in quality,\u201d says Zabka. \u201cWhen all the music has to live side by side on these streaming platforms, we can\u2019t just be the cheap alternative. \u2018Oh, you like Taylor Swift? You will like this lesser version offering in the Christian genre.\u2019 We want to be the greatest art.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have to imitate before you innovate,\u201d Chris Brown, singer and worship leader at Elevation Worship, jokes. \u201cThere\u2019s not as many rigid lines stylistically within Christian music as maybe there was 10 years ago or certainly like 20, 30 years ago.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was a period of time where people idealized Christian music as like, \u2018OK, we\u2019re going to have this look, we\u2019re going to sound like this,\u2019\u201d says two-time Grammy-winning Christian and pop musician Lauren Daigle. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more artistry now. People are very expressive. They\u2019re able to share their creativity. And that also comes with different types of people represented.\u201d",
      "Zabka says her genre is experiencing \u201ca special moment and \u2026 a perfect storm.\u201d Streaming and the ability to connect on social media have democratized music discovery, she says, allowing CCM to compete with secular music. That, partnered with what she views as \u201ca resurgence of faith\u201d in young people, is responsible for the interest.",
      "The number of Americans who identify as Christian has declined steadily for years, but that drop shows signs of slowing, according to a 2025 survey from the Pew Research Center. A new class of millennial and Gen Z Christian influencers, too, are aiming to connect with young people.",
      "\u201cChristian music has also shifted in its authenticity of the lyrics,\u201d Zabka adds, making the music more relatable than previous iterations of the genre, which often featured a neat message of \u201ceverything is going to be OK, just follow Jesus\u201d in 3 \u00bd minutes. Now, she says, \u201ctheir songs are much more authentic and real and honest. \u2018Life is hard. Breakups are hard. Bad things happen,\u2019 and that provides a level of hope that other music doesn\u2019t provide for the listener.\u201d",
      "Daigle points out that artists like Lake are performing in huge stadiums \u2014 categorical proof that Christian artists are growing in popularity.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of people are looking at the world and \u2026 they find fortitude in this music, and they find a sense of strength in this music, and they find truth in this music,\u201d she says.",

      "\u201cI love all kinds of music,\u201d he continues, \u201cbut if you have a song that carries that kind of message, it\u2019s just super charged, you know? It does something deeper.\u201d",

      "Jelly Roll agrees. \u201cI think there really is a revival happening in America right now where people are being re-presented the Gospel in a digestible way. And it doesn\u2019t seem as finger-waggy and \u2018You\u2019re all going to hell,\u2019 you know?\u201d he says.",

      "NEW YORK -- A planned Christmas Eve jazz concert at the Kennedy Center, a holiday tradition dating back more than 20 years, has been canceled. The show's host, musician Chuck Redd, says that he called off the performance in the wake of the White House announcing last week that President Donald Trump's name would be added to the facility.",
      "As of last Friday, the building's facade reads The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. According to the White House, the president's handpicked board approved the decision, which scholars have said violates the law. Trump had been suggesting for months he was open to changing the center's name.",
      "\u201cWhen I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,\u201d Redd told The Associated Press in an email Wednesday. Redd, a drummer and vibraphone player who has toured with everyone from Dizzy Gillespie to Ray Brown, has been presiding over holiday \u201cJazz Jams\u201d at the Kennedy Center since 2006, succeeding bassist William \u201cKeter\u201d Betts.",
      "The Kennedy Center did not immediately respond to email seeking comment. The center's website lists the show as canceled.",
      "President Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and Congress passed a law the following year naming the center as a living memorial to him. Kennedy niece Kerry Kennedy has vowed to remove Trump's name from the building once he leaves office and former House historian Ray Smock is among those who say any changes would have to be approved by Congress.",

      "The Grammys' country album category has been split into two for the 2026 award show",
      "NEW YORK -- Flashback to February. It's the 2025 Grammys, and Beyonc\u00e9 has made history. Not only was she finally awarded the top prize of album of the year, but she also became the first Black woman to win best country album, for \u201cCowboy Carter.\u201d Recent changes by the Recording Academy have made it even more monumental: She might be the last person to ever win the award.",
      "In June, the Academy announced that the Grammys' country album title was splitting into two categories. A new award was created, traditional country album. The preexisting country album category has been redefined and is now contemporary country album, reflecting the genre's ongoing sonic evolutions.",
      "The decision was divisive: Some viewed it as backlash to Beyonc\u00e9's win. Others welcomed the addition of a new award and the creative doors it might open. Some questioned how the categories would be defined in a genre where the word \u201ctraditional\u201d is loaded.",
      "Here's everything you need to know about the change \u2014 and what it could signify in the future.",
      "Charles L. Hughes, Rhodes College professor and author of \u201cCountry Soul,\u201d says Beyonc\u00e9's victory was a welcomed surprise, despite being obviously worthy. That's because her album inspired a larger conversation about reclamation, standing in opposition to the music industry's rigid power structures and \u201cindicated how significant this historical question remains of whether or not Black folks have equal access to success in a genre of music that bears such strong Black influences and has from the very beginning,\u201d Hughes said.",
      "He believes the decision to alter the country album categories was not in direct response to her win \u2014 \u201cI think it is a more complicated story,\u201d he says \u2014 but the timing might've been less than ideal, emboldening fans to view it as reactionary. He hopes the changes will open the category to more diversity of sounds and \u201cwhether this leads to a broader opening and opportunity for Black artists, especially Black women in country music,\u201d he posits.",
      "Francesca T. Royster, a DePaul University professor and author of \u201cBlack Country Music: Listening for Revolutions,\u201d views Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s victory as positively connected to this change. She wonders if artists \u2014 particularly artists of color, who never had their music recognized in country music categories, think of artists like \u201cMillie Jackson or Candi Staton, Bobby Womack\u201d \u2014 would now see their work recognized. \u201cHaving these two categories just allows for more experimentation and maybe less of a double standard,\u201d she says, \u201cin terms of artists who are often held to higher standards to conform to, or be recognizable as, meeting an idea about what country music is.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt makes sense that the Grammy categories for country would become a little bit more expansive,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause I think the music is more expansive and the audience is also more expansive than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d",
      "According to the Recording Academy's rule book, the traditional country category is defined by \u201ccountry recordings that adhere to the more traditional sound structures of the country genre, including rhythm and singing style, lyrical content, as well as traditional country instrumentation.\u201d",
      "Those are: acoustic guitar, steel guitar, fiddle, banjo, mandolin, piano, electric guitar and live drums. This is also where subgenres like outlaw country, Western and Western swing would fit.",
      "The contemporary country category description is a bit more conceptual. The rule book states that albums eligible in this category \u201cutilize a stylistic intention, song structure, lyrical content, and/or musical presentation to create a sensibility that reflects the broad spectrum of contemporary country style and culture.\u201d",
      "The hope is that those titles are \u201crelevant to the legacy of country music\u2019s culture, while also engaging in more contemporary music forms.\u201d",
      "The questions Hughes poses: \u201cWhose tradition are we talking about?\u201d And how is \u201ccountry music's culture\u201d defined?",
      "\u201cIt's almost tautology. \u2018Well, it\u2019s traditional country if it sounds like traditional country,'\u201d he says.",
      "In that reading, contemporary country could simply account for everything else.",
      "Royster says both categories seem to \u201cspeak to an aesthetic as well as political agenda, many agendas.\u201d To her, the traditional category would appeal to artists who believe that \u201cthis is a past form that needs to ... continue to be recognized and respected.\u201d Similarly, the contemporary category is \u201clinked to the culture of country but is also expansive.\u201d",

      "Adding a new genre category is not unique to country music. Consider a sister genre, R&B. In 1999, the Recording Academy also introduced a traditional category to the R&B field to spotlight artists who chose to hybridize the genre as well as those who prefer nostalgic structures.",
      "It didn't stay stagnant from there: In 2021, the Academy changed the best urban contemporary album category to best progressive R&B album, to spotlight those records that weave R&B with other genres.",
      "In the contemporary country album category, Kelsea Ballerini's \u201cPatterns\u201d faces off against Tyler Childers' \u201cSnipe Hunter,\u201d Eric Church's \u201cEvangeline vs. the Machine,\u201d Jelly Roll's \u201cBeautifully Broken,\u201d and Miranda Lambert's \u201cPostcards from Texas.\u201d",

      "Royster wonders if with this first year of nominees, \u201cthere's less risk in terms of recognizing the kind of \u2018country-ness\u2019 of these artists.\u201d Royster views the lineup as \u201cartists (whose) country creds would still be recognized even if they\u2019re also bringing in other elements. I would hope in the future there might be more room in the category.\u201d",
      "For Hughes, the nominees further confuse the distinctions. Consider this example: Zach Top's album borrows heavily from George Strait's sound, which emerged in the \u201870s as a mesh of honky-tonk traditions and contemporary country. Hip-hop also emerged in the \u201970s. They were simultaneous. \u201cBut I have a feeling we won\u2019t be seeing a lot of hip-hop-inspired artists in the traditional category,\u201d he says.",
      "But that doesn't mean it might not evolve in the future. \u201cIf the Grammys fundamentally exist to give people recognition,\u201d he says, \u201cThe more, the merrier.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnytime the pipe widens, more water gets through. And this was the pipe widening, baby,\u201d Jelly Roll, who is nominated in the inaugural best contemporary country album category, told The Associated Press. \u201cI love it. I'm happy. I\u2019m a fan of both sides. It encourages me to maybe make a traditional country album one day, you know? So, this is cool.\u201d",
      "Three-time Grammy award winner Brad Paisley has a similar stance: There's a benefit to having more country music recognitions.",
      "\u201cAwards are really tools to sort of get awareness for something that you made, you know?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re never the goal. It\u2019s always more like, \u2018Oh, cool, this might make more people listen to it.\u2019 \u2026 If this means they got to make more little gold gramophone statues to give out, and two people get them versus one, great.\u201d",
      "That said: Paisley's not sure which category he would fall into, or if the division could color an artist's creative decisions. \u201cI\u2019d almost have to think it through like, \u2018No, no, we\u2019re going for the Grammy on this. I better not do this on this record or something.\u2019 But hopefully that doesn\u2019t ever enter into it,\u201d he says.",
      "Hopefully, it's just a panel decided who belongs in which category, \u201cand then two people get to go home happy versus one. And that\u2019s good in my book,\u201d he said.",

In the first chapter, siblings Jeff (Driver) and Emily (Mayim Bialik) drive together to visit their father (Waits) for the first time in a while. In the second, a mother (Charlotte Rampling) awaits her grown daughters Tim ( Cate Blanchett ) and Lilith ( Vicky Krieps ) for their annual tea. And in the third, all that\u2019s left of Skye (Indya Moore) and Billy\u2019s (Luka Sabbat) parents are things.",
      "But these are awkward and strained hangouts, none connected to one another literally, and all in different parts of the world. Yet there are little threads throughout \u2014 Rolex watches, toasting with water, red clothing, and the idiom \u201cbob\u2019s your uncle,\u201d for instance. And then there\u2019s the more cosmically haunting realization that familiarity and closeness are not always in the cards when it comes to family. In \u201cFather Mother Sister Brother,\u201d everyone would rather be anywhere but where they are. Same same, but different, you know?",
      "The film opens with \u201cFather,\u201d and siblings Jeff and Emily reluctantly doing a kind of wellness check on theirs. They\u2019re both very buttoned up and formal, both in appearance (blazers, sweaters, combed hair) and demeanor. Waits, as their father, is very much the opposite \u2014 one might imagine that he doesn\u2019t even own a blazer, or a comb for that matter. His home is as rumpled as his zip up hoodie sweatshirt and he is a little bumbling himself, rattling off all the drugs he\u2019s not taking (anymore). The chasm between him and his children is vast and growing. Besides the death of their mother, it doesn\u2019t even seem like there was even some inciting incident that might explain some level of estrangement \u2014 they\u2019re just very, very different. And the father might not be as helpless and destitute as he\u2019s presenting to his children. After they leave, he tidies the place up and calls a friend to go out to a nice dinner.",
      "Blame it on the age of the people who get to make the movies, but the parents are often the afterthoughts, the supporting characters in the children\u2019s stories. Jarmusch slyly inverts this in the \u201cFather\u201d segment, which perfectly tees up expectations for his next entry, \u201cMother,\u201d in which Rampling is on the phone, presumably with a therapist, mentally preparing for her daughters to arrive. They all live around Dublin, but rarely see one another, making this tea a bit of a dreaded ritual. Blanchett\u2019s Tim, a quintessential first born, is very stressed about being late. Krieps\u2019 Lilith, meanwhile, is all about posturing \u2014 bragging about material things and accomplishments that she doesn\u2019t have the receipts for and knows on some level no one believes anyway. These women aren't connecting either.",
      "In the final segment, the parents are gone. They\u2019ve died and left behind only mementos in a Parisian apartment that\u2019s three months overdue on rent. This is both a puzzle and a mess that their children now have to clean up and make sense of. \u201cFather Mother Sister Brother\u201d is in some ways deeply cynical about family bonds and the possibility of ever really knowing ones' parents. It\u2019s devoid of warm, fuzzy sentiment and trite revelations, just the crushing idea that no matter what bloodlines might exist, we\u2019re all fundamentally strangers.",

      "Leaves and bodies fall in \u201cNo Other Choice,\u201d Park Chan-wook\u2019s masterfully devilish satire with a chilling autumnal wind blowing through it.",
      "\u201cCome on, fall,\u201d urges You Man-su (Lee Byung-hun) as he grills an eel for dinner for his family in the opening moments of Park's film. He's eager for the season to start but unprepared for the amount of cyclical collapse \u2014 familial, economic, even existential \u2014 that Park has in store.",
      "Man-su pronounces the very thing no movie protagonist ever should: \u201cI've got it all.\u201d He lives with his wife, Miri (Son Ye-jin), and two children (Kim Woo Seung, Choi So Yul) in a handsome modernist house in the woods, with two golden retrievers. But almost as soon as he says that, Man-su's fortunes turn. After 25 years at a paper mill, Man-su is laid off, as are many others, with little fanfare or apology. Desperation begins to set in. He's forced to sell the home he loves so dearly, including the attached greenhouse where he tends to plants and bonsai trees. They even have to, horror of horrors, cancel Netflix.",
      "Another movie might have sunk with Man-su into bankruptcy and midlife struggle, following his quest to find a new line of work and restart his life. This is not that movie. Man-su, considering his prospects, decides he needs to better his odds of new employment. After posting a fake job listing and comparing all the incoming resumes, he decides he's about the fifth best option for any new paper mill managerial jobs. He decides to kill the ones with better credentials.",
      "The concept, a Grade-A barnburner of a movie idea, is not new. \u201cNo Other Choice,\u201d South Korea's Oscar submission, is based on Donald Westlake\u2019s 1997 crime novel \u201cThe Ax,\u201d which Costa-Gavras also made into a film in 2005. But Park, the filmmaker of such diabolical movies as \u201cOldboy,\u201d \u201cThe Handmaiden\u201d and \u201cDecision to Leave,\u201d is exquisitely suited to the material. This is a director capable of conjuring menacing brutality with nothing but a hallway and hammer.",
      "And in \u201cNo Other Choice,\u201d he remains at the peak of his powers, archly and elegantly spinning a yarn about a murderous rampage that accumulates wider and wider reverberations. \u201cHitchcockian\u201d is a term that often, understandably, finds Park. He is, like Hitch, a seemingly polite and erudite man with a latently dark imagination. But for more than two decades, Park has cut his own bloody, unyieldingly meticulous path in movies that are rarely predictable, very funny and sneakily revelatory.",

      "Much of the delight of \u201cNo Other Choice,\u201d which Park co-wrote with Lee Kyoung-mi, Don McKellar and Jahye Lee, isn't just seeing how Man-su's scheme goes but how Park frames it. He is probably the preeminent filmmaker of putting wild, outrageous happenings into cleverly formal, eminently stylish imagery. As Man-su bumbles from target to target, each potential murder is a window into another family reckoning with unemployment. The way Man-su spies on them (or worse) adds delicious layers of satire. Relish, especially, the way Park uses reflections and trees.",
      "How \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d puts capitalism in the crosshairs, with a handsome house in the center, will no doubt bring to mind another Korean satire: Bong Joon Ho's \u201cParasite.\u201d Park had been wanting to make his film for almost two decades. Either way, the two movies would make one hell of a destabilizing double feature.",
      "If \u201cParasite\u201d was the feat of an ensemble, \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d belongs to Lee. His Man-su is no killer at heart, and his attempts to become one are as comical as they are Dostoyevskian. The tone is so farcical that the gruesomeness of some of Man-su's acts come slyly. How many movies have we seen about a parent driven, heroically, to extremes to defend their family? Man-su's circumstance is frightfully understandable. \u201cOur family is in a war,\u201d he says. To keep them happy \u2014 in particular Miri \u2014 Man-su thinks whatever it takes is necessary.",
      "But what makes \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d brilliant is how it shows that perceived predicament as a ubiquitous mistake of modern life. I won't spoil the incredible final minutes of Park's film, but they expand the notion of necessary termination \u2014 of a job, of a life \u2014 to automation, AI and beyond. The leaves falling in \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d aren't coming back in the spring.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet squints as he gazes out at the Manhattan shoreline. It\u2019s a few hours before the premiere of his new movie, \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d but at this moment, he\u2019s sitting on a quiet bench at the end of a West Side pier.",
      "It\u2019s brisk and there\u2019s snow on the ground, but it\u2019s sunny and Chalamet, dressed warmly in a parka, is enjoying the perspective looking back at the city. For him, it\u2019s like looking back on himself.",
      "\u201cNow in my late 20s, there should be every reason to go, \u2018All right, career\u2019s good. Let me start shilling out,\u2019\u201d says Chalamet, who turns 30 just after Christmas. \u201cBut it\u2019s like I\u2019ve quadrupled down on the original pursuit of my life. I\u2019ve gotten out of the pool and redived from a higher board.\u201d",
      "That high dive is \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d Josh Safdie\u2019s hyperkinetic 1950s-set New York tale of a singular striver. Chalamet plays Marty Mauser, a Jewish kid working at a shoe store who aspires to be the best table tennis pro in the world. The character is loosely based on a real-life player, Marty Reisman, but the movie is just as much a reflection of Chalamet and Safdie\u2019s own whatever-it-takes ambitions.",
      "\u201cThe gift of my life is this work,\u201d Chalamet says while seagulls fly overhead. \u201cYou want to honor it. Not in some Keynesian way \u2014 I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the right economist to cite. Capitalistic is not what I mean. I mean: If you\u2019re not going up, you\u2019re kind of going down. \u2018He not busy being born is busy dying,\u2019 the great Dylan quote. Ooh, is that on the money.\u201d",
      "Since his breakthrough performance in 2017\u2019s \u201cCall Me By Your Name,\u201d Chalamet has been on an ever-ascending path that seemed to reach a culmination when he, soon after finishing shooting on \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d declared that he\u2019s \u201cin pursuit of greatness\u201d while accepting the best actor award from the Screen Actors Guild for his performance as Bob Dylan in \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d",
      "But \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d is yet another new level for Chalamet. His Marty, far from a period-piece study, is a blur of forward motion. (To shoot the film\u2019s sprinting poster, Safdie closed down two blocks, so Chalamet would be up to full speed.) To make his dreams a reality, Marty uses every desperate scheme and every bit of grandiose swagger. He's a quintessentially American hustler, and it\u2019s probably the defining performance of Chalamet\u2019s young career. A year after he came so close, it may win him his first Academy Award.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like a long arc thing for me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m chasing a feeling.\u201d",
      "\u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d which opens wide Thursday, is a big test. A24 spent some $70 million on it, making it one of the indie studio\u2019s biggest budgeted movies ever. To build the hype, Chalamet has unveiled some very Marty-esque stunts, including an 18-minute video of a pseudo-Zoom call about the movie\u2019s marketing. That led to a real orange blimp, emblazoned with \u201cDream Big,\u201d flying over Los Angeles.",
      "When The Associated Press caught up with Safdie at his Chelsea office, he had recently returned from promoting the movie in London, Brazil and Los Angeles. For him, \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d could hardly be more personal. Pingpong paddles filled his office, as did an old piece of awning scrounged from Rodney Dangerfield\u2019s New York comedy club. Safdie once tried to turn pro at table tennis, himself, before moviemaking became his obsession.",
      "\u201cMy dad is the ultimate dreamer,\u201d Safdie says. \u201cHe still dreams to this day. When I was a kid, I\u2019d ask him where I came from. And he\u2019d say, \u2018You came from the stars.\u2019 It put this intense feeling inside me that there was huge future ahead of me.\u201d",
      "When Safdie and his brother, Benny, set out to make films, they had a New York hustler mentality. For their second feature, \u201cDaddy Longlegs,\u201d they approached the filmmaker Ronald Bronstein, then working as a projectionist, and told him he had to star in the film. Bronstein wasn't even an actor.",
      "\u201cI thought: This guy is made out helium and I\u2019ve had my feet stuck in lead for six years,\u201d recalls Bronstein, who co-wrote \u201cMarty Supreme.\u201d",
      "The hardscrabble life of independent filmmaking made Safdie accustomed to giving everything to get his movies made. To convince a potential financier to pay for the basketball portions of 2019's \u201cUncut Gems,\u201d Safdie, a non-drinker, remembers downing half a dozen whiskies during a meeting.",

      "When Safdie and his brother finished \u201cUncut Gems,\u201d years of pouring everything into Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler\u2019s character in the film) left him feeling purposeless. \u201cYou start to ask yourself: What is the purpose of a dream?\u201d",

      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about the guy. Some agent told me he was the next big superstar. And you hear that a lot from agents,\u201d says Safdie. \u201cBut you got the sense that he saw it. And he had a vision for it. He had this energy to him. He was Timmy Supreme.\u201d",
      "Safdie sent Chalamet a video of table tennis players from 1948 set to Peter Gabriel\u2019s \u201cI Have the Touch.\u201d The suggestion was: This is a period movie told with contemporary topspin. For years, while working on other movie sets, Chalamet built up his table tennis skills.",
      "\u201cJosh wanted me to tap into a period of my life when my audacity was all I had,\u201d Chalamet says. Immediately, he saw himself in Marty. \u201cI was singularly driven starting at 14.\u201d",
      "Safdie and Chalamet are now launching something almost anathema in theaters this holiday season: a wholly original, big-budget, R-rated movie fronted by star power. Signs suggest audiences aren\u2019t just ready, they\u2019re hungry for it. The limited opening of \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d in six cinemas, set per-screen records. There were 92 sellouts.",
      "\u201cI said this when I went to (former high school) LaGuardia last year: Don\u2019t act for other actors. Act for real audiences,\u201d Chalamet says. \u201cWhile we were shooting \u2018Dune 3\u2019 over the summer, Denis (Villeneuve) said at some point he realized it was more about pleasing real people. You look at the business structure of the film industry, how it\u2019s been contracting since the \u201980s, it\u2019s ludicrous to be focused on anything but real audiences.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to see more original movies made,\u201d adds Chalamet. \u201cThey\u2019re the most exciting ones to see. Every original film I\u2019ve seen this year, I like it before I even start it. That\u2019s a whole new mentality I\u2019ve had, just feeling like we\u2019re all in this together.\u201d",
      "\u201cMarty Supreme\u201d is also a part of the proud lineage of New York movies, and self-consciously crafted in an American movie tradition. It may feel like a millennial watershed, but its production design is by a legend of an earlier era, Jack Fisk. The 74-year-old Bronx filmmaker Abel Ferrara appears in it. They're veterans of a grittier, more handcrafted time stretching back to the 1970s that's been particularly influential to Safdie. Robert Altman\u2019s 1902-set 1971 film \u201cMcCabe and Mrs. Miller,\u201d he notes, is the exact same time difference between when it takes place and when it was shot as \u201cMarty Supreme.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe tradition, particularly of New York filmmaking, movies like \u2018French Connection,\u2019 I try to let them seep into me,\u201d Safdie says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m casting Abel Ferrara. I\u2019m trying to at least cultivate those influences.\u201d",
      "That \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d is a deeply New York film, and maybe a new classic one, is also a special point of pride for Chalamet, who grew up in Hell's Kitchen. Leaning forward as the afternoon winter light brightens the waterfront, Chalamet remembers he used to play soccer as a kid on this pier.",
      "\u201cJust to be here, back where I\u2019m from. What a dream,\u201d Chalamet says. \u201cI also feel like my artistry has grown, not as a talking point or as hyperbole, but as a humble fact of foundation.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the kind of thing Marty might say. Indeed, some of Chalamet\u2019s recent declarations have struck some like he\u2019s still in character. Asked whether he\u2019s sincere or engaging in a little Method marketing, Chalamet takes a long pause and smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s both.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A pitch-perfect Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet finds his greatest role to date in \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d a breakneck ride from director Josh Safdie",
      "\u201cEverybody wants to rule the world,\u201d goes the Tears for Fears song we hear at a key point in \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d Josh Safdie\u2019s nerve-busting adrenaline jolt of a movie starring a never-better Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet.",
      "But here\u2019s the thing: everybody may want to rule the world, but not everybody truly believes they CAN. This, one could argue, is what separates the true strivers from the rest of us.",
      "And Marty \u2014 played by Chalamet in a delicious synergy of actor, role and whatever fairy dust makes a performance feel both preordained and magically fresh \u2014 is a striver. With every fiber of his restless, wiry body. They should add him to the dictionary definition.",
      "Needless to say, Marty is a New Yorker.",
      "Also needless to say, Chalamet is a New Yorker.",
      "And so is Safdie, a writer-director Chalamet has called \u201cthe street poet of New York.\u201d So, where else could this story be set?",
      "It\u2019s 1952, on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side. Marty Mauser is a salesman in his uncle\u2019s shoe store, escaping to the storeroom for a hot tryst with his (married) girlfriend. Suddenly we\u2019re seeing footage of sperm traveling \u2014 talk about strivers! \u2014 up to an egg. Which morphs, of course, into a pingpong ball.",
      "This witty opening sequence won\u2019t be the only thing recalling \u201cUncut Gems,\u201d co-directed by Safdie with his brother Benny before the two split for solo projects. That film, which feels much like the precursor to \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d began as a trip through the shiny innards of a rare opal, only to wind up inside Adam Sandler\u2019s colon, mid-colonoscopy.",
      "Sandler\u2019s Howard Ratner was a New York striver, too, but sadder, and more troubled. Marty is young, determined, brash \u2014 with an eye always to the future. He\u2019s a great salesman: \u201cI could sell shoes to an amputee,\u201d he boasts, crassly. But what he\u2019s plotting to unveil to the world has nothing to do with shoes. It\u2019s about table tennis.",
      "How likely is it that this Jewish kid from the Lower East Side can become the very face of a sport in America, soon to be \u201cstaring at you from the cover of a Wheaties box?\u201d",
      "To Marty, perfectly likely. Still, he knows nobody in the U.S. cares about table tennis. He\u2019s so determined to prove everyone wrong, starting at the British Open in London, that when there\u2019s a snag obtaining cash for his trip, he brandishes a gun at a colleague to get it.",
      "Shaking off that sorta-armed robbery thing, Marty arrives in London, where he fast-talks his way into a suite at the Ritz. Here, he spies fellow guest Kay Stone (Gwyneth Paltrow, in a wise, stylish return to the screen), a former movie star married to an insufferable tycoon (\u201cShark Tank\u201d personality Kevin O\u2019Leary, one of many nonactors here.)",
      "Kay\u2019s skeptical, but Marty finds a way to woo her. Really, all he has to say is: \u201cCome watch me.\u201d Once she sees him play, she\u2019s sneaking into his room in a lace corselet.",

      "This would be a good time to stop and consider Chalamet\u2019s subtly transformed appearance. He is stick-thin \u2014 duh, he never stops moving. His mustache is skimpy. His skin is acne-scarred \u2014 just enough to erase any movie-star sheen. Most strikingly, his eyes, behind the round spectacles, are beady \u2014 and smaller. Definitely not those movie-star eyes.",
      "But then, nearly all the faces in \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d are extraordinary. In a movie with more than 100 characters, we have known actors (Fran Drescher, Abel Ferrara); nonacting personalities (O\u2019Leary, and an excellent Tyler Okonma (Tyler, The Creator) as Marty\u2019s friend Wally); and exciting newcomers like Odessa A\u2019Zion as Marty\u2019s feisty girlfriend Rachel.",
      "There are also a slew of nonactors in small parts, plus cameos from the likes of David Mamet and even high wire artist Philippe Petit. The dizzying array makes one curious how it all came together \u2014 is casting director Jennifer Venditti taking interns? Production notes tell us that for one hustling scene at a bowling alley, young men were recruited from a sports trading-card convention.",
      "Elsewhere on the creative team, composer Daniel Lopatin succeeds in channelling both Marty\u2019s beating heart and the ricochet of pingpong balls in his propulsive score. The script by Safdie and cowriter Ronald Bronstein, loosely based on real-life table tennis hustler Marty Reisman, beats with its own, never-stopping pulse. The same breakneck aesthetic applies to camera work by Darius Khondji.",
      "Back now to London, where Marty makes the finals against Japanese player Koto Endo (Koto Kawaguchi, like his character a deaf table tennis champion). \u201cI\u2019ll be dropping a third atom bomb on them,\u201d he brags \u2014 not his only questionable World War II quip. But Endo, with his unorthodox paddle and grip, prevails.",
      "After a stint as a side act with the Harlem Globetrotters, including pingpong games with a seal \u2014 you\u2019ll have to take our word for this, folks, we\u2019re running low on space \u2014 Marty returns home, determined to make the imminent world championships in Tokyo.",
      "But he's in trouble \u2014 remember he took cash at gunpoint? Worse, he has no money.",
      "So Marty\u2019s on the run. And he\u2019ll do anything, however messy or dangerous, to get to Japan. Even if he has to totally debase himself (mark our words), or endanger friends \u2014 or abandon loyal and brave Rachel.",
      "Is there something else for Marty, besides his obsessive goal? If so, he doesn\u2019t know it yet. But the lyrics of another song used in the film are instructive here: \u201cEverybody\u2019s got to learn sometime.\u201d",
      "So can a single-minded striver ultimately learn something new about his own life?",
      "We'll have to see. As Marty might say: \u201cCome watch me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d an A24 release, has been rated R by the Motion Picture Association \u201cfor language throughout, sexual content, some violent content/bloody images and nudity.\u201d Running time: 149 minutes. Four stars out of four.",

      "Al Michaels has reached a remarkable milestone in his broadcasting career, marking 40 years as the play-by-play announcer for the NFL\u2019s primetime games",
      "Al Michaels has achieved many milestones during his Hall of Fame broadcasting career.",
      "The one he has reached this season, though, may stand the test of time \u2014 40 years as the play-by-play announcer for one of the NFL\u2019s primetime packages.",
      "According to research from the 506 Sports Archive, the Christmas night game between the Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs on Prime Video will be his 779th NFL broadcast.",
      "\u201cI mean, it\u2019s been a fantastic ride. I mean, it\u2019s unbelievable because it came out of nowhere back in 1986,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking 40 years, you don\u2019t think in those terms when you\u2019re 40 years old, but here we are. It\u2019s hard to believe, but I am blessed and thankful.\u201d",
      "Except for two years in 1974 and \u201875, when Michaels did afternoon games for NBC and CBS, Michaels\u2019 broadcasts have been mostly in prime time. He has also called 11 Super Bowls, tying him with Pat Summerall.",
      "Michaels was the play-by-play voice for ABC\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d from 1986 until 2005. He was then traded to NBC when it launched \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d in 2006, and he called that package until 2021. This is his fourth season doing Prime Video\u2019s \u201cThursday Night Football.\u201d",
      "Michaels is the dean of NFL announcers in terms of games called. CBS\u2019 Kevin Harlan is the closest among active announcers, with 542, and would need at least 13 seasons to catch Michaels whenever he decides to retire.",
      "Michaels, who turned 81 in November, has shown no signs of slowing down.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all done so many big games at this point, but he truly gets excited when he has the opportunity to do a big game. And you can\u2019t say that for a lot of people in our business,\u201d said Fred Gaudelli, who was Michaels\u2019 producer for 23 seasons. \u201cAfter a certain amount of time, you lose that fire in your belly to really do it, and he\u2019s never lost that.\"",
      "Kirk Herbstreit, who is in his fourth season as Michaels\u2019 partner, said he has grown to appreciate Michaels\u2019 ability to manage a broadcast.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always noticed that the bigger the moment, when you really feel urgency as a broadcaster, Al gets calmer and just waits for the right time to bring his voice to that crescendo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve just been blown away by how he does his job, how organized and prepared he is, and how much he loves it. That\u2019s what really comes across to me. He is completely dialed in, loves the sport, and loves telling stories.\u201d",
      "Michaels has worked with eight analysts. Cris Collinsworth worked with him the longest, at 13 seasons, while his seven years with John Madden rank among the best booth pairings.",
      "ABC Sports executive Dennis Swanson decided to bring Michaels aboard and move Frank Gifford to the analyst spot on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d after firing O.J. Simpson and Joe Namath.",
      "Michaels had worked for ABC since 1976 and was best known for his baseball coverage and the U.S. hockey team\u2019s run to the gold medal in the 1980 Olympics.",
      "Gifford had been the main announcer from 1971 through \u201985, but Swanson wanted a more traditional play-by-play announcer at the helm of what was then the NFL\u2019s signature package.",
      "In 1987, \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d returned to a three-man booth when Dan Dierdorf joined from CBS. He, Michaels and Gifford worked together for 11 seasons, including three Super Bowls.",
      "\u201cFrank and I got along great, but I think the feeling was from Swanson and the people at ABC is that Frank had been out of the game so long that they needed to or felt they needed to bring somebody more contemporary in,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cDan was an easy fit for us. I mean, a three-man booth is never easy, and it is rough around the analysts because they have to decide who\u2019s coming in at what point, but it was a natural flow.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt was so different than anything else I\u2019ve done in my entire 50-year career,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cIt was not easy because my biggest problem was Dennis had a lot of really good lines, but if I laughed too much, I would sound like a hyena.

      "NEW YORK -- A coalition of 19 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, its secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and its inspector general over a declaration that could complicate access to gender-affirming care for young people.",
      "The declaration issued last Thursday called treatments like puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries unsafe and ineffective for children and adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria, or the distress when someone\u2019s gender expression doesn\u2019t match their sex assigned at birth. It also warned doctors that they could be excluded from federal health programs like Medicare and Medicaid if they provide those types of care.",
      "The declaration came as HHS also announced proposed rules meant to further curtail gender-affirming care for young people, although the lawsuit doesn't address those as they are not final.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Eugene, Oregon, alleges that the declaration is inaccurate and unlawful and asks the court to block its enforcement. It's the latest in a series of clashes between an administration that's cracking down on transgender health care for children, arguing it can be harmful to them, and advocates who say the care is medically necessary and shouldn't be inhibited.",
      "\u201cSecretary Kennedy cannot unilaterally change medical standards by posting a document online, and no one should lose access to medically necessary health care because their federal government tried to interfere in decisions that belong in doctors\u2019 offices,\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led the lawsuit, said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that HHS\u2019s declaration seeks to coerce providers to stop providing gender-affirming care and circumvent legal requirements for policy changes. It says federal law requires the public to be given notice and an opportunity to comment before substantively changing health policy \u2014 neither of which, the suit says, was done before the declaration was issued.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS declined to comment.",
      "HHS's declaration based its conclusions on a peer-reviewed report that the department conducted earlier this year that urged greater reliance on behavioral therapy rather than broad gender-affirming care for youths with gender dysphoria.",
      "The report questioned standards for the treatment of transgender youth issued by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health and raised concerns that adolescents may be too young to give consent to life-changing treatments that could result in future infertility.",

      "HHS on Thursday also unveiled two proposed federal rules \u2014 one to cut off federal Medicaid and Medicare funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to children, and another to prohibit federal Medicaid dollars from being used for such procedures.",
      "The proposals are not yet final or legally binding and must go through a lengthy rulemaking process and public comment before becoming permanent. But they will nonetheless likely further discourage health care providers from offering gender-affirming care to children.",

      "Decades of research show syringe programs are extremely effective at preventing infectious disease among intravenous drug users and referring them to treatment",
      "JEFFERSONVILLE, Ind. -- Inside a storage room at the Clark County Health Department are boxes with taped-on signs reading, \u201cDO NOT USE.\u201d They contain cookers and sterile water that people use to shoot up drugs.",
      "The supplies, which came from the state and were paid for with federal money, were for a program where drug users exchange dirty needles for clean ones, part of a strategy known as harm reduction. But under a July executive order from President Donald Trump, federal substance abuse grants can\u2019t pay for supplies such as cookers and tourniquets that it says \u201conly facilitate illegal drug use.\u201d Needles already couldn\u2019t be purchased with federal money.",
      "In some places, the order is galvanizing support for syringe exchange programs, which decades of research show are extremely effective at preventing disease among intravenous drug users and getting them into treatment.",
      "In others, it\u2019s fueling opposition that threatens the programs' existence.",
      "Republican-led Indiana passed a law allowing exchanges a decade ago after the tiny city of Austin became the epicenter of the worst drug-fueled HIV outbreak in U.S. history. Unless lawmakers extend it, that law is scheduled to sunset next year, and the number of exchanges has been dwindling. State officials told remaining programs to comply with Trump's order \u2014 and even to discard federally funded supplies such as cookers and tourniquets.",
      "For now, Clark County health workers have found a way to keep distributing cookers and other items: buy them with private money and package them in \u201cmystery bags,\u201d assembled by employees who aren\u2019t paid with state or federal funds.",
      "Democratic-led California, meanwhile, has continued using state funds for supplies such as pipes and syringes. California is home to a rising number of exchanges, with 70 of the more than 580 listed by the North American Syringe Exchange Network.",
      "Some public health experts lament that syringe services programs have become subject to growing politicization and dissent.",
      "Clark County Health Officer Dr. Eric Yazel says IV drug users will likely inject themselves with or without clean supplies. Exchanges prevent people from sharing needles and spreading disease, he said, \u201cdecreasing the public health risk for the whole population.\u201d",
      "But Curtis Hill, a Republican former Indiana attorney general, is among critics who raise the same concern Trump\u2019s order does: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get into a situation where we\u2019re promoting drug use.\u201d",
      "When participants arrive at the Clark County health department, they look down at a list of services and say they are there for \u201cNo. 1.\u201d",
      "They choose from a cart with needles, bandages, sharps containers and the overdose reversal drug naloxone. They can receive testing for HIV and hepatitis C; information on drug treatment; and flyers on food banks, housing, and job placement.

      "A new Department of Health and Human Services report reveals Medicaid programs made over $200 million in improper payments to health care providers between 2021 and 2022 for people who had already died",
      "WASHINGTON -- Medicaid programs made more than $200 million in improper payments to health care providers between 2021 and 2022 for people who had already died, according to a new report from the independent watchdog for the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "But the department's Office of Inspector General said it expects a new provision in Republicans\u2019 One Big Beautiful Bill requiring states to audit their Medicaid beneficiary lists may help reduce these improper payments in the future.",
      "These kinds of improper payments are \u201cnot unique to one state, and the issue continues to be persistent,\u201d Aner Sanchez, deputy regional inspector general in the Office of Audit Services told The Associated Press. Sanchez has been researching this issue for a decade.",
      "The watchdog report released Tuesday said more than $207.5 million in managed care payments were made on behalf of deceased enrollees between July 2021 to July 2022. The office recommends that the federal government share more information with state governments to recover the incorrect payments \u2014 including a Social Security database known as the Full Death Master File, which contains more than 142 million records going back to 1899.",
      "Sharing the Full Death Master File data has been tightly restricted due to privacy laws which protect against identity theft and fraud.",
      "The massive tax and spending bill that was signed into law by President Donald Trump this summer expands how the Full Death Master File can be used by mandating Medicaid agencies to quarterly audit their provider and beneficiary lists against the file, beginning in 2027. The intent is to stop payments to dead people and improve accuracy.",

Since 2016, HHS' inspector general has conducted 18 audits on a selection of state programs and had identified that Medicaid agencies had improperly made managed care payments on behalf of deceased enrollees totaling approximately $289 million.",
      "The government had some success using the Full Death Master File to prevent improper payments earlier this year. In January, the Treasury Department reported that it had clawed back more than $31 million in federal payments that improperly went to dead people as part of a five-month pilot program after Congress gave Treasury temporary access to the file for three years as part of the 2021 appropriations bill.",
      "Meanwhile, the SSA has been making unusual updates to the file itself, adding and removing records, and complicating its use. For instance, the Trump administration in April moved to classify thousands of living immigrants as dead and cancel their Social Security numbers to crack down on immigrants who had been temporarily allowed to live in the U.S. under programs started during the Biden administration.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s government said it plans to end its waning foreign adoptions of Korean children, while United Nations investigators voiced \u201cserious concern\u201d over what they described as Seoul\u2019s failure to ensure truth-finding and reparations for widespread human rights violations tied to decades of mass overseas adoptions.",
      "The announcement Friday came hours after the United Nations human rights office released South Korea\u2019s response to investigators urging Seoul to spell out concrete plans to address the grievances of adoptees sent abroad with falsified records or abused by foreign parents.",
      "The issue had rarely been discussed at the U.N. level, even as South Korea faces growing pressure to confront widespread fraud and abuse that plagued its adoption program, particularly during a boom in the 1970s and 1980s when it annually sent thousands of children to the West.",
      "The country will phase out foreign adoptions over a five-year period, aiming to reach zero by 2029 at the latest as it tightens welfare policies for children in need of care, Vice Minister of Health and Welfare Lee Seuran said during a briefing.",
      "South Korea approved foreign adoptions of 24 children in 2025, down from around 2,000 in 2005 and an annual average of more than 6,000 during the 1980s.",
      "In the health ministry\u2019s briefing and response to the U.N., officials focused on future improvements rather than past problems.",
      "\u201cAdoptions were mainly handled by private adoption agencies before, and while they presumably prioritized the best interests of the child, there may have also been other competing interests,\u201d Lee said.",
      "\u201cNow, with the adoption system being restructured into a public framework, and with the Health Ministry and the government having a larger role in the process for approving adoptions, we have an opportunity to reassess whether international adoption is truly a necessary option,\u201d she added, citing efforts to promote domestic adoptions.",
      "U.N. investigators, including special rapporteurs on trafficking, enforced or involuntary disappearances and child abuse, raised the adoption issue with Seoul after months of communication with Yooree Kim. The 52-year-old was sent to a French family in 1984 without her biological parents\u2019 consent, based on documents falsely describing her as an abandoned orphan.",
      "Kim said she endured severe physical and sexual abuse by her adopters and petitioned the U.N. as part of a broader effort to seek accountability from governments and adoption agencies in South Korea and France.",
      "Citing broader systemic issues and Kim\u2019s case, U.N. investigators criticized South Korea for failing to give adoptees effective access to remedies for serious abuses and for the \u201cpossible denial of their rights to truth, reparations, and memorialization.\u201d",
      "They also voiced concern over the suspension of a government fact-finding investigation into past adoption abuses and fraud, despite reports of grave violations including cases that may amount to enforced disappearances.",

      "Choi Jung Kyu, a human rights lawyer representing Kim, called South Korea\u2019s response \u201cperfunctory.\u201d He noted promises of stronger reparations, which were meant to reduce the need for victims to litigate, are not clearly spelled out in draft bills proposing a relaunch of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses.",
      "The government also vetoed a bill in April that would have removed the statute of limitations for state-related human rights violations, although that was before President Lee Jae Myung took office in June. Lee issued an apology in October over past adoption problems, as recommended by the truth commission.",

The fate of the remaining 311 cases, either deferred or incompletely reviewed, hinges on whether lawmakers establish a new truth commission through legislation.",
      "The commission\u2019s findings acknowledged state responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption program rife with fraud and abuse. The program was driven by efforts to reduce welfare costs and enabled by private agencies that often manipulated children\u2019s backgrounds and origins. The findings largely aligned with previous reporting by The Associated Press.",

      "\u201cThis Christmas is a different one because of the anti-terror and the terrorist attack motivated by ISIS and antisemitism,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cBut at the same time as we have seen the worst of humanity, we have seen the bravery and kindness and compassion ... from those who rushed to danger.\u201d",

      "Zia, a former housewife, came to politics after her husband, former military chief and then President Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in a military coup in 1981.

      "The holiday season will soon come to a close, but the busiest time of the year for product returns is just beginning.",
      "The National Retail Federation estimates 17% of holiday purchases will be sent back this year. More retailers are reporting extended return windows and increased holiday staff to handle the rush this year.",
      "A major driver for returns is uncertainty. When we buy for other people, finding what they want is a bit of a guessing game. Online purchases have higher return rates because finding the right size and color is tough when you're just staring at images on screens.",
      "\u201cClothing and footwear, as you can imagine, because fit is such an important criteria, they have higher rates of returns,\u201d said Saskia van Gendt, chief sustainability officer at Blue Yonder, which sells software designed to improve companies' supply chain management.",
      "Returns come with an environmental cost, but there's a lot consumers and companies are doing to minimize it.",
      "If a company sells a thing, it's probably packaged in plastic. Plastic is made from oil, and oil production releases emissions that warm the planet. If that thing is bought online, it's put on a plane or a train or a truck that usually uses oil-based fuel.",
      "If you buy a thing and return it, it goes through most or all of that all over again.",
      "And once those products are back with the retailer, they may be sent along to a refurbisher, liquidator, recycler or landfill. All these steps require more travel, packaging and energy, ultimately translating to more emissions. Joseph Sarkis, who teaches supply chain management at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, estimates that returning an item increases its impact on the planet by 25% to 30%.",
      "Roughly a third of the time, those returns don't make their way to another consumer. Because frequently, it's not worth reselling.",
      "If, for example, you get a phone, but you send it back because you don't like the color, the seller has to pay for the fuel and equipment to get the phone back, and then has to pay for the labor to assess whether it has been damaged since leaving the facility.",
      "\u201cIt can be quite expensive,\u201d said Sarkis. \u201cAnd if you send it out to a new customer and the phone is bad, imagine the reputational hit you\u2019ll get. You\u2019ll get another return and you\u2019ll lose a customer who\u2019s unhappy with the product or material. So the companies are hesitant to take that chance.\u201d",
      "Something as expensive as a phone might get sold to a secondary or refurbishment market. But that $6 silicone spatula you got off Amazon? Probably not worth it. Plus, some stuff \u2014 think a bathing suit or a bra \u2014 is less attractive to customers if there's a chance it's been resold. The companies know that.",
      "And that's where the costs of returns are more than just environmental \u2014 and consumers wind up paying. Even free returns aren't really free.",
      "\u201cRefurbishment, inspection, repackaging, all of these things get factored into the retail price,\u201d said Christopher Faires, assistant professor of logistics and supply chain management at Georgia Southern University.",
      "If you want to reduce the impact of your returns, the first move is to increase their chances of resale. Be careful not to damage it, and reuse the packaging to send it back, said Cardiff University logistics and operations management lecturer Danni Zhang.",
      "If you have to return something, do it quickly. That ugly Christmas sweater you got at the white elephant office party has a much better chance of selling on Dec. 20 than it does on Jan. 5. Zhang said it's not worth the cost to the company to store that sweater once it's gone out of season.",

      "Another tip: in-person shopping is better than online because purchases get returned less often, and in-person returns are better, too \u2014 because those items get resold more often. Zhang said it reduces landfill waste. Sarkis said it reduces emissions because companies with brick-and-mortar locations spread out across the country and closer to consumers thus move restocked goods shorter distances.",
      "\u201cIf I can return in-store, then I definitely will,\" Zhang said. \u201cThe managers can put that stuff back to the market as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "Obviously the best thing consumers can do is minimize returns. Many shoppers engage in \u201cbracketing behavior,\u201d or buying multiple sizes of the same item, keeping what fits, and returning the rest.",
      "\u201cThis behavior of bringing the dressing room to our homes is not sustainable,\u201d said Faires.",
      "If you're buying for someone else, you can also consider taking the guesswork out of the equation and going for a gift card.",
      "\u201cI know we do really want to pick up something really nice to express our love for our friends or our family. But if we are more sustainable, probably the gift card will be much better than just purchasing the product,\u201d Zhang said.",
      "Sarkis wants to see companies provide more information in product descriptions about the environmental impact of returning an item, or how much of the purchase price factors in return costs.",
      "\u201cBut I don\u2019t know if they want to send a negative message,\" he said. \u201cIf you're telling someone to stop something because of negative results, that's not going to sell.\u201d",
      "Sarkis and Zhang both say charging for returns would help. Already Amazon is requiring customers pay in certain situations.",
      "On the tech side, Blue Yonder\u2019s recent acquisition of Optoro, a company that provides a return management system for retailers and brands, uses a software to quickly assess the condition of returned products and route them to stores that are most likely to resell them.",
      "\u201cHaving that process be more digitized, you can quickly assess the condition and put it back into inventory,\u201d said van Gendt. \u201cSo that\u2019s a big way to just avoid landfill and also all of the carbon emissions that are associated with that.\u201d",
      "Clothing is returned most often. Many sizes do not reflect specific measurements, like women's dresses, so they vary a lot between brands. Zhang said better sizing could help reduce the need for returns. On top of that, Sarkis said more 3D imaging and virtual reality programs could help customers be more accurate with their purchases, saving some returns.",

      "Dominion Energy Virginia said in its lawsuit filed late Tuesday that the government's order is \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and unconstitutional. The Richmond-based company is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, a project it says is essential to meet dramatically growing energy needs driven by dozens of new data centers.",
      "The Interior Department did not detail the security concerns in blocking the five projects on Monday. In a letter to project developers, Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management set a 90-day period \u2014 and possibly longer \u2014 \u201cto determine whether the national security threats posed by this project can be adequately mitigated.\u201d",
      "The other projects are the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind in Rhode Island and Connecticut and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind. Democratic governors in those states have vowed to fight the order, the latest action by the Trump administration to hobble offshore wind in its push against renewable energy sources.",
      "Dominion's project has been under construction since early 2024 and was scheduled to come online early next year, providing enough energy to power about 660,000 homes. The company said the delay was costing it more than $5 million a day in losses solely for the ships used in round-the-clock construction, and that customers or the company would eventually bear the cost.",
      "Dominion called this week's order \u201cthe latest in a series of irrational agency actions attacking offshore wind and then doubling down when those actions are found unlawful.\u201d",

      "That suggests that shoppers are doing more research before adding something to their shopping list, and they're being more disciplined in sticking to the lists they create, according to Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s very indicative of consumers and how conscientiously they\u2019ve purchased,\u201d Pandya said. \u201cMany of them are being very specific with how they spend their budget.\u201d",
      "From Nov. 1 to Dec. 12, returns fell 2.5% compared with last year, Adobe reported. In the seven days following Cyber Week \u2014 the five shopping days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, returns fell 0.1%.",
      "From the Nov. 1 through Dec. 12, online sales rose 6% to $187.3 billion, on track to surpass its outlook for the season, Adobe reported.",
      "Between Dec. 26 to Dec. 31, returns are expected to rise by 25% to 35% compared with returns between Nov. 1 through Dec. 12, Adobe said, and it expects returns to remain elevated through the first two weeks of January, up 8% to 15%.",
      "This is the first year that Adobe has tracked returns.",
      "Still, the last week of December sees the greatest concentration of returns: one out of every eight returns in the 2024 holiday season took place between Dec. 26 and Dec 31, a trend expected to persist this year, Adobe said.",

      "According to the coalition, between 2008 and 2016 the German automaker equipped more than 211,000 diesel passenger cars and vans with software devices that optimized emission controls during tests but reduced the controls during normal operations. The devices enabled vehicles to far exceed legal limits for nitrogen oxides, a pollutant that can cause respiratory illnesses and contributes to smog.",

    "story": [
      "In a breathless year of tariffs unleashed by the administration of President Donald Trump, perhaps no one has had to live the reality of every fluctuation of trade policy than customs brokers",
      "NEW YORK -- After a half-century immersed in the world of trade, customs broker Amy Magnus thought she\u2019d seen it all, navigating mountains of regulations and all sorts of logistical hurdles to import everything from lumber and bananas to circus animals and Egyptian mummies.",
      "Then came 2025.",
      "Tariffs were imposed in ways she\u2019d never seen. New rules left her wondering what they really meant. Federal workers, always a reliable backstop, grew more elusive.",
      "\u201c2025 has changed the trade system,\u201d says Magnus. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t perfect before, but it was a functioning system. Now, it is a lot more chaotic and troubling.\u201d",
      "Once hidden cogs in the international trade machine, customs brokers are getting a rare spotlight as President Donald Trump reinvents America\u2019s commercial ties with the world. If this breathless year of tariffs amounts to a trade war, customs brokers are its front lines.",
      "Few Americans have been exposed as exhaustively to every fluctuation of trade policy as the customs broker. They were there in the opening days of Trump\u2019s second term, when tariffs were announced on Canada and Mexico, and two days later, when those same levies were paused. They were there through every rule on imports of steel and seafood, on cars and copper, on polysilicon and pharmaceuticals, and on and on. For every tariff, for every carve-out, for every order, brokers have been left to translate policy into reality, line by line and code by code, in a year when it seemed every passing week brought change.",
      "\u201cWe were used to decades of a certain way of processing, and from January to now, that universe has been turned kind of upside-down on us,\u201d says Al Raffa, a customs broker in Elizabeth, New Jersey, who helps shepherd containerloads of cargo into the U.S. packed to the brim with everything from rounds of brie to boxes of chocolate.",
      "Each arrival of products imported to the country requires filings with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and often, other agencies. Importers often turn to brokers to handle the regulatory legwork and, with a spate of new trade rules unleashed by the Trump administration, they\u2019ve seen their demand grow alongside their workloads.",
      "Many shipments that entered duty free now are tariffed. Other imports that had minimal levies that might cost a company a few hundred dollars have had their bills balloon to thousands. For Raffa and his crew, the ever-expanding list of tariffs means a given product could be subjected to taxes under multiple separate tariff lines.",
      "\u201cThat one line item of cheese that previously was just one tariff, now it could be two, three, in some cases five tariff numbers,\u201d says 53-year-old Raffa, who has had jobs in trade since he was a teenager and who has a button emblazoned with \u201cMake Trade Boring Again.\u201d",
      "Government regulations have always been a reality for brokers, and the very reason for their existence. When thick tomes of trade rules changed in the past, though, they typically were issued long ahead of their effective dates, with periods for comment and review, each word of policy crafted in an attempt to project clarity and definition.",
      "With Trump, word of a major change in trade rules might come in a Truth Social post or an oversized chart clutched by the president in a Rose Garden appearance.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019d be remiss not to be looking at the White House website on a daily basis, multiple times a day, just to see what executive order is going to be announced,\u201d Raffa says.",
      "Each announcement sends brokerage firms into a scramble to attempt to dissect the rules, update their systems to reflect them and alert their customers who may have shipments en route and for whom any shift in tariffs could mean a major hit to their bottom line.",
      "JD Gonzalez, a third-generation customs broker in Laredo, Texas, and president of the National Customs Brokers and Forwarders Association of America, says the volume and speed of changes have been challenging enough. But the wording of White House orders has often left more unanswered questions than brokers are accustomed to.",
      "\u201cThe order is kind of vague sometimes, the guidance that\u2019s being provided is sometimes murky, and we\u2019re trying to make the determination,\u201d 62-year-old Gonzalez says.",

      "Gonzalez rattles off 10-digit tariff codes for alcohol and doors and recites the complicated web of rules that determine the duties on a chair with a frame made of steel produced in the U.S. but processed in Mexico. As brokers\u2019 work has grown tougher, he says some of their firms have begun charging customers more for their services because each item they\u2019re responsible for tracking on a bill of lading takes longer.",
      "\u201cYou double the time,\u201d he says.",
      "Brokers can\u2019t help but see the imprints of their work everywhere they go. Gonzalez looks at a T-shirt tag and thinks of what a broker did to get it into the country. Magnus sees Belgian chocolate or Chinese silk and is awed, despite all the things that could have kept something from landing on a store shelf, that it still arrived. Raffa walks through the supermarket, picks up a can of artichoke hearts, and considers every possible regulation that might apply to secure its import into the country.",
      "It has been heartening for brokers, who existed in the gray arcana of hidden bureaucracy unseen by most Americans, to now earn a bit more recognition.",
      "\u201cIt was maybe taken for granted how that wonderful piece of gourmet cheese got on the shelf, or that Gucci bag,\u201d says Raffa. \u201cUp until this year, people were clueless what I did.\u201d",
      "Magnus, who is in her 70s and based on Marco Island, Florida, spent 18 years at U.S. Customs before starting at a brokerage in 1992. She came to find comfort in the precision of rules governing every import she cleared the way for, from crude oil to diamonds.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t like to have any doubt, we don\u2019t like to leave anything up to interpretation,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we ourselves are struggling, trying to interpret and understand the meaning of some of these things, it is a very unsettling place to be.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just the White House orders that have complicated her work.",
      "The Department of Government Efficiency cost-cutting blitz under billionaire Elon Musk led to layoffs and retirements of trusted government workers that brokers turn to for guidance. A shutdown slowed operations at ports. And fear of being out of step with the administration has some federal employees cautious about decoding trade orders, making answers on interpretation of tariff rules sometimes tough to come by.",
      "Magnus was befuddled by moves that seemed at odds with everything she knew of trade policy. Canada as adversary? Switzerland subjected to 39% tariffs? It defied how she had come to see the choreography of cargo and what it says about the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like an incredible ballet to be able to trade with all these countries all over the world,\u201d she says. \u201cIn my own mind, I always felt that as long as we were trading and we were friendly with each other, we were reducing the chance of war and killing each other.\u201d",
      "Work has been so hectic this year that Magnus hasn\u2019t managed to take a vacation. Weekends have so frequently been upended by Friday afternoon edicts announcing a tariff is going into effect or being taken away that it has become an inside joke with colleagues.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Friday afternoon,\u201d she says. \u201cIs everybody watching?\u201d",
      "A couple hours after Magnus repeats this, the next White House order is posted, undoing a slew of tariffs on agricultural products and sending brokers into another scurry.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission on Monday said it would ban new foreign-made drones, a move that will keep new Chinese-made drones such as those from DJI and Autel out of the U.S. market.",
      "The announcement came a year after Congress passed a defense bill that raised national security concerns about Chinese-made drones, which have become a dominant player in the U.S., widely used in farming, mapping, law enforcement and filmmaking.",
      "The bill called for stopping the two Chinese companies from selling new drones in the U.S. if a review found they posed a risk to American national security. The deadline for the review was Dec. 23.",
      "The FCC said Monday the review found that all drones and critical components produced in foreign countries, not just by the two Chinese companies, posed \u201cunacceptable risks to the national security of the United States and to the safety and security of U.S. persons.\" But it said specific drones or components would be exempt if the Pentagon or Department of Homeland Security determined they did not pose such risks.",
      "The FCC cited upcoming major events, such as the 2026 World Cup, America250 celebrations and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, as reasons to address potential drone threats posed by \u201ccriminals, hostile foreign actors, and terrorists.\"",
      "Michael Robbins, president and chief executive officer of AUVSI, the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International, said in a statement that the industry group welcomes the decision. He said it's time for the U.S. not only to reduce its dependence on China but build its own drones.",

      "\u201cConcerns about DJI\u2019s data security have not been grounded in evidence and instead reflect protectionism, contrary to the principles of an open market,\u201d the company said.",
      "In Texas, Gene Robinson has a fleet of nine DJI drones that he uses for law enforcement training and forensic analyses. He said the new restrictions would hurt him and many others who have come to rely on the Chinese drones because of their versatility, high performance and affordable prices.",

We need to suck it up, and let\u2019s not have it happen again.\"",
      "Also in Texas, Arthur Erickson, chief executive officer and co-founder of the drone-making company Hylio, said the departure of DJI would provide much-needed room for American companies like his to grow. New investments are pouring in to help him ramp up production of spray drones, which farmers use to fertilize their fields, and it will bring down prices, Erickson said.",

      "NEW YORK -- It\u2019s shoppers like Quinn Kelsey who keep department store executives up at night.",
      "The 38-year-old Denver resident gets makeup ideas from TikTok videos and other social media content, not salespeople at beauty counters. She uses an AI chatbot to get product recommendations that fit her budget and to see how a certain foundation or lipstick would look on her. When she buys, it\u2019s usually from Amazon.",
      "\u201cI use Chat GPT as my personal beauty consultant,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cDepartment stores? I\u2019ll walk through one for the decor, but they\u2019ve basically lost me unless I can get the same product-research experience there that I can get scrolling through my phone at home.\u201d",
      "Once the ultimate beauty destination, department stores lost sales and their authority as skincare and makeup trendsetters starting in the late 1990s. That was when the growth of Sephora and Ulta Beauty made shopping for cosmetics more of a playful, self-service experience.",
      "But fast-changing consumer preferences have all types of retailers racing to outdo each other for a slice of the $129 billion U.S. beauty and personal care market. The competition is fiercer than ever due to the ease of e-commerce. Amazon, which has slowly added premium beauty brands to its massive selection, is the nation\u2019s largest online seller of beauty and personal care products, according to market research company Euromonitor International.",
      "Social media also has provided new sources of beauty guidance. Instead of store advisers, many consumers look to videos by influencers, beauty brand founders or dermatologists for advice. Shoppers also turn to TikTok and Instagram for information about \u201cdupes\" \u2014 drugstore versions of more expensive products.",
      "\u201cStores are more of the showroom, but the spark itself is happening in TikTok,\u201d Jake Bjorseth, founder of the Generation Z advertising agency Trndsttrs, said.",
      "To keep up, companies with both physical and online stores are investing in upgrades that are meant to give beauty fans like Kelsey an experience they can\u2019t get anywhere else. Macy\u2019s and Nordstrom, for example, renovated the beauty floors of their flagship New York stores to add more space, ultra-luxury brands and cutting-edge technology. At Nordstrom, customers can book an appointment to get robot-applied eyelash extensions for $170.",

      "Executives from Macy's and Nordstrom said the latest changes were designed to create an engaging atmosphere that encourages shoppers to stay longer and spend more. The overhaul at Macy's Herald Square included comfortable seating and skin analysis devices that help make the case for lotions and potions costing hundreds of dollars.",
      "In the Parfums de Marly section, customers sample scents while wearing a virtual reality headset meant to immerse them in an 18th century chateau the French fragrance maker cites as its inspiration.",
      "\u201cThis is the future of beauty,\u201d Nicolette Bosco, Macy's vice president of beauty, said, referring to the interactive technology the department store considers central to offering shoppers an elevated experience.",
      "The company expects to redesign the beauty departments of 40 more stores. The facelifts are intended to draw shoppers of all ages, Macy\u2019s Inc. CEO Tony Spring said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying very hard to take the idea of a department store and make it intimate and friendly and convenient,\u201d he said.",

      "Fragrances of all kinds and prices also have taken off as a popular purchase, outperforming sales of makeup and skincare in the first nine months of the year, the firm said.",
      "However, many shoppers don't want to get spritzed while wandering through a department store and don't want a salesperson's help picking out a perfume for loved ones or themselves. They may know what they want from hearing about social media trends like \u201cfragrance layering.\u201d Some enthusiasts collect scents like they might handbags and trust their own noses.",
      "Macy\u2019s requires its 10,000 beauty advisers to do weekly training. It covers new information from brands and the latest trends, such as the reemergence of matte makeup and \"juicy fruit\" fragrances. The advisers also get selling tips and tricks.",

      "Here are four things I learned:",
      "Always smile at shoppers as they walk by and try complimenting them on what they're wearing, Dervil said. If they moved on, I knew enough not to follow them. Remember the old sales adage about the importance of direct eye contact. It's more crucial than ever since many customers will be wearing earbuds or headphones and might not hear a spoken invitation to sample products.",
      "If customers stop by the counter, ask if they want help. If they say no, let them explore and don't be pushy. They often start asking questions if you let them linger a while, Dervil said.",

      "Ask shoppers what they are looking for once they indicate they want help, Dervil said. \u201cAre they looking for themselves or is it a gift for someone?\u201d is a standard approach, she said. Understanding what brought someone into the store is a way to better guide them in making a selection.",

In Dior's J'Adore line, the favorite version is the \u201ceau de parfum,\" Dervil said. If a customer think that's too strong or too light, direct them accordingly, she advised.",
      "I also learned that going up or down the spectrum doesn't always mean a more diffused or intense version of the same scent. It may lead to a different smell altogether.",
      "For example, the \u201cparfum d\u2019eau\u201d form of J'Adore smelled like a lighter version of the \u201ceau de parfum.\u201d But the line's lightest scent, J'Adore Eau Lumiere, had a citrusy scent that was totally different.",

      "Start asking open-ended questions about what they like or don't like about the scent. If they want to try other products, fold the strip and place it next to the just-sampled fragrance as a reminder of which one it was.",
      "If they're switching from scent to scent, ask them to sniff their arm or the back of their hand to clear their nostrils for the next one, Dervil said.",
      "If a customer likes a scent, discuss prices and bottle sizes, and hope to complete the sale.",

      "NEW YORK -- Consumers stepped up their spending, particularly on items like gadgets and clothing, for the first seven weeks of the holiday shopping period. But the pace was slower than a year ago amid worries about higher prices and other economic concerns, according to new data from Visa released Tuesday.",
      "From Nov. 1 through Sunday, holiday sales rose 4.2%, a slower clip from the 4.8% increase during the same period a year ago, according to the company's Visa Consulting & Analytics division, which analyzed a subset of Visa payments network data in the U.S.",
      "The figure includes all methods of payment including cash and card.",
      "The data, which exclude sales from auto dealerships, gas stations, and restaurants, are not adjusted for inflation including the impact from President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "When adjusted, retail sales rose a more modest 2.2% for that time frame, according to Visa's principal U.S. economist Michael Brown. That compares to the inflation-adjusted 3% sales gain last year.",
      "\u201cIt's certainly not a spectacular season,\u201d Brown told The Associated Press. \"It's sort of an average holiday season given concerns about macro economic growth, inflation. There's still a lot of uncertainty among the consumer population.\"",
      "Retailers have described shoppers as being selective when making holiday purchases, choosing to focus on gifts for under the tree instead of holiday decor like ornaments for the tree, for example. Many households are struggling with higher prices in groceries, rent and imported goods hit by tariffs. The latest job report, released by the Labor Department last week, also shows a souring employment picture.",
      "As a result, consumers' mood has been gloomy, though it improved last month as worries about inflation eased a bit, according to the University of Michigan.",
      "When all the numbers are in, Visa expects holiday sales data will more or less be in line with its prediction of a 4.6% sales increase for the November and December period combined.",
      "Still to come are several of the holiday shopping season's top 10 busiest days including Tuesday, the day after Christmas and the Saturday after Christmas, according to Sensormatic, which tracks retail foot traffic.",
      "The Visa data is in line with the forecast from the National Retail Federation, the nation's largest retail industry trade group. It expects sales over November and December of between $1.01 trillion and $1.02 trillion. That would be up 3.7% to 4.2% over last year.",

A big drag on October data was a drop in sales at motor vehicles and auto parts dealerships, hurt by the expiration of federal government subsidies that sliced demand for battery-powered electric cars.",
      "According to Visa, e-commerce sales rose 7.8% for the first seven weeks of the period, fueled by promotions that started early in the season.",

      "Tariffs played a key role in how shoppers bought, Brown said.",
      "Clothing and accessories sales accelerated at a 5.3% pace from Nov. 1 through Dec. 21 from a 4.1% increase last year. The category wasn't as affected by tariffs as other areas like holiday home decor, which is predominantly made in China, Brown said. That category saw a slim 0.8% sales gain.",

Most airlines operate with fewer than 200 employees per aircraft, a common benchmark of productivity.",

      "Multiple factors shape the environmental toll of a delivery. These include the distance from a fulfillment center, whether the shipment rides in a half-empty truck, how many trips a driver makes in the same area and the type of transportation used to move the package.",
      "When customers choose faster shipping and earlier delivery dates, the system shifts from optimized routing to whatever gets the package out fastest, and that means higher emissions, said Sreedevi Rajagopalan, a research scientist at MIT\u2019s Center for Transportation and Logistics. For example, trucks may leave warehouses before they\u2019re full and drivers might loop the same neighborhood multiple times a day, she said.",
      "\u201cFor the same demand, fast shipping definitely increases emissions 10 to 12%,\u201d she said.",
      "To meet tight delivery windows, retailers may rely on air freight, which produces far more emissions than other options such as trains, making it the most carbon-intensive.",
      "\u201cGiven that companies want to be competitive in terms of speed, it comes at the cost of your efficiency,\u201d Sreedevi said. \u201cVans are half full, and you make multiple rounds, multiple trips to the same location \u2026 your fuel consumption goes up, and you\u2019re not able to consolidate.\u201d",
      "One way companies like Amazon try to minimize that is by placing their supply chain closer to customers to reduce mileage and improve speed for the customer. Their goal is to make the journey fast and effective, but reduce its emissions at the same time.",
      "\u201cBy really leveraging our supply chain efficiencies that we have at scale, we\u2019re able to both offer better speed and sustainability outcomes at the same time,\u201d said Chris Atkins, director of Worldwide Operations Sustainability at Amazon.",
      "Getting items to customers\u2019 doors from a fulfillment center \u2014 referred to as the \u201clast mile\u201d or \u201clast kilometer\u201d of shipping \u2014 is one of the hardest stages to make less polluting, Sreedevi said.",
      "Emissions rise even more when customers place multiple small orders throughout the week.",
      "\u201cIf I place an order this morning and then I place an order this evening and choose fast shipping, the company might have already processed my morning order and wouldn\u2019t wait for my evening order to consolidate,\" she said.",
      "And sending more half-full trucks out on the road means more trips overall.",

      "\u201cImagine you\u2019re not only sending a half-full truck, you\u2019re also bringing back that truck empty. ... Emissions are going to go up,\" Sreedevi said.",
      "Consumers can lower emissions if they're willing to wait even a tiny bit, and they'll save money at the same time, said Christopher Faires, assistant professor of logistics and supply chain management at Georgia Southern University.",
      "Delaying delivery by one to two days can result in a 36% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, and three to four days pushes that reduction to 56%, so opting for standard or delayed shipping instead of next-day or two-day shipping helps, according to Sreedevi.",
      "Amazon's Atkins said changes to their network are cutting emissions linked to fast delivery. The company has expanded the use of electric delivery vans and shifted more packages to rail and to delivering by foot or bicycle in dense cities.",
      "\u201cAviation is very carbon-intensive relative to ground shipping,\u201d said Atkins. \u201cOne of the other things that Amazon and other logistics companies are looking at doing is: How do we mode-shift to less carbon intensive forms of transportation?\"",
      "Amazon says providing shipping options that encourage customers to consolidate orders have also helped. Data for the first nine months of 2025 shows that when customers chose a single delivery day for all items, it reduced more than 300 million delivery stops and avoided 100,000 tons (90,718 metric tons) of carbon emissions, according to Atkins.",
      "People are more likely to delay or consolidate orders once they understand the environmental impact of fast shipping, according to Sreedevi, who co-authored a 2024 study of delivery customers in Mexico.",
      "\u201cA significant number of consumers decided to wait for longer delivery or delayed their shipping when we showed them the environmental impact information in the form of trees,\u201d said Sreedevi. \u201cSo it\u2019s important that they are educated.\u201d",
      "While fast shipping isn\u2019t likely to go away, experts say its climate impacts can be meaningfully reduced through small behavior shifts, both from shoppers and companies. Bundling orders, skipping the overnight option and choosing a single weekly delivery can all make a difference.",

      "Many retirement developments serve as a tranquil refuge for older people who can no longer traveling to faraway places or engaging in bold adventures",
      "LOS GATOS, Calif. -- Like many retirement communities, The Terraces serves as a tranquil refuge for a nucleus of older people who no longer can travel to faraway places or engaging in bold adventures.",
      "But they can still be thrust back to their days of wanderlust and thrill-seeking whenever caretakers at the community in Los Gatos, California, schedule a date for residents \u2014 many of whom are in their 80s and 90s \u2014 to take turns donning virtual reality headsets.",
      "Within a matter of minutes, the headsets can transport them to Europe, immerse them in the ocean depths or soar them on breathtaking hang-gliding expeditions while they sit by each other. The selection of VR programming was curated by Rendever, a company that has turned a sometimes isolating form of technology into a catalyst for better cognition and social connections in 800 retirement communities in the United States and Canada.",
      "A group of The Terraces residents who participated in a VR session earlier this year found themselves paddling their arms alongside their chairs as they swam with a pod of dolphins while watching one of Rendever's 3D programs. \u201cWe got to go underwater and didn't even have to hold our breath!\u201d exclaimed 81-year-old Ginny Baird following the virtual submersion.",
      "During a session featuring a virtual ride in a hot-air balloon, one resident gasped, \u201cOh my God!\u201d Another shuddered, \u201cIt's hard to watch!\u201d",
      "The Rendever technology can also be used to virtually take older adults back to the places where they grew up as children. For some, it will be the first time they've seen their hometowns in decades.",
      "A virtual trip to her childhood neighborhood in New York City's Queens borough helped sell Sue Livingstone, 84, on the merits of the VR technology even though she still is able to get out more often than many residents of The Terraces, which is located in Silicon Valley about 55 miles south of San Francisco.",
      "\u201cIt isn't just about being able to see it again, it's about all the memories that it brings back,\u201d Livingstone said. \u201cThere are a few people living here who never really leave their comfort zones. But if you could entice them to come down to try out a headset, they might find that they really enjoy it.\u201d",
      "Adrian Marshall, The Terraces' community life director, said that once word about a VR experience spreads from one resident to another, more of the uninitiated typically become curious enough to try it out \u2014 even if it means missing out on playing Mexican Train, a dominoes-like board game that's popular in the community.",
      "\u201cIt turns into a conversation starter for them. It really does connect people,\u201d Marshall said of Rendever's VR programming. \u201cIt helps create a human bridge that makes them realize they share certain similarities and interests. It turns the artificial world into reality.\u201d",
      "Rendever, a privately owned company based in Somerville, Massachusetts, hopes to build upon its senior living platform with a recent grant from the National Institutes of Health that will provide nearly $4.5 million to study ways to reduce social isolation among seniors living at home and their caregivers.",
      "Some studies have found VR programming presented in a limited viewing format can help older people maintain and improve cognitive functions, burnish memories and foster social connections with their families and fellow residents of care facilities. Experts say the technology may be useful as an addition to and not a replacement for other activities.",
      "\u201cThere is always a risk of too much screen time,\" Katherine \u201cKate\u201d Dupuis, a neuropsychologist and professor who studies aging issues at Sheridan College in Canada, said. \u201cBut if you use it cautiously, with meaning and purpose, it can be very helpful. It can be an opportunity for the elderly to engage with someone and share a sense of wonder.\u201d",

      "VR headsets may be an easier way for older people to interact with technology instead of fumbling around with a smartphone or another device that requires navigating buttons or other mechanisms, said Pallabi Bhowmick, a researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who is examining the use of VR with older adults.",
      "\u201cThe stereotypes that older adults aren\u2019t willing to try new technology needs to change because they are willing and want to adapt to technologies that are meaningful to them,\u201d Bhowmick said. \"Besides helping them to relieve stress, be entertained and connect with other people, there is an intergenerational aspect that might help them build their relationships with younger people who find out they use VR and say, \u2018Grandpa is cool!\u2019\"",
      "Rendever CEO Kyle Rand's interest in helping his own grandmother deal with the emotional and mental challenges of aging pushed him down a path that led him to cofound the company in 2016 after studying neuroengineering at Duke University.",
      "\u201cWhat really fascinates me about humans is just how much our brain depends on social connection and how much we learn from others,\u201d Rand said. \u201cA group of elderly residents who don't really know each other that well can come together, spend 30 minutes in a VR experience together and then find themselves sitting down to have lunch together while continuing a conversation about the experience.\u201d",
      "It's a large enough market that another VR specialist, Dallas-based Mynd Immersive, competes against Rendever with services tailored for senior living communities.",
      "Besides helping create social connections, the VR programming from both Rendever and Mynd has been employed as a possible tool for potentially slowing down the deleterious effects of dementia. That's how another Silicon Valley retirement village, the Forum, sometimes uses the technology.",
      "Bob Rogallo, a Forum resident with dementia that has rendered him speechless, seemed to be enjoying taking a virtual hike through Glacier National Park in Montana as he nodded and smiled while celebrating his 83rd birthday with his wife of 61 years.",
      "Sallie Rogallo, who doesn't have dementia, said the experience brought back fond memories of the couple's visits to the same park during the more than 30 years they spent cruising around the U.S. in their recreational vehicle.",
      "\u201cIt made me wish I was 30 years younger so I could do it again,\u201d she said of the virtual visit to Glacier. \u201cThis lets you get out of the same environment and either go to a new place or visit places where you have been.\u201d",
      "In another session at the Forum, 93-year-old Almut Schultz laughed with delight while viewing a virtual classical music performance at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado and later seemed to want to play with a puppy frolicking around in her VR headset.",
      "\u201cThat was quite a session we had there,\u201d Schultz said with a big grin after she took off her headset and returned to reality.",

      "The Department of Homeland Security is replacing its lottery system for H-1B visas with a new approach prioritizing skilled, higher-paid foreign workers",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday it was replacing its longstanding lottery system for H-1B work visas with a new approach that prioritizes skilled, higher-paid foreign workers.",
      "The change follows a series of actions by the Trump administration aimed at reshaping a visa program that critics say has become a pipeline for overseas workers willing to work for lower pay, but supporters say drives innovation.",
      "\u201cThe existing random selection process of H-1B registrations was exploited and abused by U.S. employers who were primarily seeking to import foreign workers at lower wages than they would pay American workers,\u201d said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Matthew Tragesser.",
      "Earlier this year, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation imposing a $100,000 annual H-1B visa fee on highly skilled workers, which is being challenged in court. The president also rolled out a $1 million \u201cgold card\u201d visa as a pathway to U.S. citizenship for wealthy individuals.",
      "A press release announcing the new rule says it is \u201cin line with other key changes the administration has made, such as the Presidential Proclamation that requires employers to pay an additional $100,000 per visa as a condition of eligibility.\u201d",
      "Historically, H-1B visas have been awarded through a lottery system. This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient, with more than 10,000 visas approved, followed by Tata Consultancy Services, Microsoft, Apple and Google. California has the highest concentration of H-1B workers.",

It will go into effect Feb. 27, 2026, and will apply to the upcoming H-1B cap registration season.",
      "Supporters of the H-1B program say it is an important pathway to hiring healthcare workers and educators. They say it drives innovation and economic growth in the U.S. and allows employers to fill jobs in specialized fields.",
      "Critics argue that the visas often go to entry-level positions rather than senior roles requiring specialized skills. While the program is intended to prevent wage suppression or the displacement of U.S. workers, critics say companies can pay lower wages by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even when the workers hired have more experience.",
      "The number of new visas issued annually is capped at 65,000, plus an additional 20,000 for people with a master\u2019s degree or higher.",

      "NATO-nation intelligence services believe Russia is developing a weapon to target Starlink satellites",
      "Two NATO-nation intelligence services suspect Russia is developing a new anti-satellite weapon to target Elon Musk's Starlink constellation with destructive orbiting clouds of shrapnel, with the aim of reining in Western space superiority that has helped Ukraine on the battlefield.",
      "Intelligence findings seen by The Associated Press say the so-called \u201czone-effect\u201d weapon would seek to flood Starlink orbits with hundreds of thousands of high-density pellets, potentially disabling multiple satellites at once but also risking catastrophic collateral damage to other orbiting systems.",
      "Analysts who haven't seen the findings say they doubt such a weapon could work without causing uncontrollable chaos in space for companies and countries, including Russia and its ally China, that rely on thousands of orbiting satellites for communications, defense and other vital needs.",
      "Such repercussions, including risks to its own space systems, could steer Moscow away from deploying or using such a weapon, analysts said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t buy it. Like, I really don\u2019t,\u201d said Victoria Samson, a space-security specialist at the Secure World Foundation who leads the Colorado-based nongovernmental organization\u2019s annual study of anti-satellite systems. \u201cI would be very surprised, frankly, if they were to do something like that.\u201d",
      "But the commander of the Canadian military's Space Division, Brig. Gen. Christopher Horner, said such Russian work cannot be ruled out in light of previous U.S. allegations that Russia also has been pursuing an indiscriminate nuclear, space-based weapon.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019ve been briefed on that type of system. But it\u2019s not implausible,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the reporting on the nuclear weapons system is accurate and that they\u2019re willing to develop that and willing to go to that end, well it wouldn\u2019t strike me as shocking that something just short of that, but equally damaging, is within their wheelhouse of development.\u201d",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov didn't respond to messages from the AP seeking comment. Russia has previously called for United Nations efforts to stop the orbital deployment of weapons and President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow has no intention of deploying nuclear space weapons.",
      "The intelligence findings were shown to the AP on condition that the services involved were not identified and the news organization was not able to independently verify the findings' conclusions.",
      "The U.S. Space Force didn't respond to e-mailed questions. The French military's Space Command said in a statement to the AP that it could not comment on the findings but said, \u201cWe can inform you that Russia has, in recent years, been multiplying irresponsible, dangerous, and even hostile actions in space.\u201d",
      "Russia views Starlink in particular as a grave threat, the findings indicate. The thousands of low-orbiting satellites have been pivotal for Ukraine\u2019s survival against Russia's full-scale invasion, now in its fourth year.",
      "Starlink's high-speed internet service is used by Ukrainian forces for battlefield communications, weapons targeting and other roles and by civilians and government officials where Russian strikes have affected communications.",
      "Russian officials repeatedly have warned that commercial satellites serving Ukraine's military could be legitimate targets. This month, Russia said it has fielded a new ground-based missile system, the S-500, which is capable of hitting low-orbit targets.",
      "Unlike a missile that Russia tested in 2021 to destroy a defunct Cold War-era satellite, the new weapon in development would target multiple Starlinks at once, with pellets possibly released by yet-to-be launched formations of small satellites, the intelligence findings say.",
      "Canada's Horner said it is hard to see how clouds of pellets could be corralled to only strike Starlink and that debris from such an attack could get \u201cout of control in a hurry.\u201d",
      "\"You blow up a box full of BBs,\u201d he said. Doing that would \u201cblanket an entire orbital regime and take out every Starlink satellite and every other satellite that\u2019s in a similar regime. And I think that\u2019s the part that is incredibly troubling.\u201d",
      "The findings seen by the AP didn't say when Russia might be capable of deploying such a system nor detail whether it has been tested or how far along research is believed to be.",
      "The system is in active development and information about the timing of an expected deployment is too sensitive to share, according to an official familiar with the findings and other related intelligence that the AP did not see. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the nonpublic findings.",

      "The intelligence findings say the pellets would be so small \u2014 just millimeters across \u2014 that they would evade detection by ground- and space-based systems that scan for space objects, which could make it hard to pin blame for any attack on Moscow.",
      "Clayton Swope, who specializes in space security and weaponry at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based security and policy think tank, said if \u201cthe pellets are not trackable, that complicates things\u201d but \u201cpeople would figure it out.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf satellites start winking out with damage, I guess you could put two and two together,\" he said.",

      "\u201cMost damage would probably be done to the solar panels because they\u2019re probably the most fragile part\u201d of satellites, Swope said. \u201cThat\u2019d be enough, though, to damage a satellite and probably bring it offline.\u201d",
      "After such an attack, pellets and debris would over time fall back toward Earth, possibly damaging other orbiting systems on their way down, analysts say.",
      "Starlink's orbits are about 550 kilometers (340 miles) above the planet. China\u2019s Tiangong space station and the International Space Station operate at lower orbits, \u201cso both would face risks,\u201d according to Swope.",
      "The space chaos that such a weapon could cause might enable Moscow to threaten its adversaries without actually having to use it, Swope said.",
      "\u201cIt definitely feels like a weapon of fear, looking for some kind of deterrence or something,\u201d he said.",
      "Samson said the drawbacks of an indiscriminate pellet-weapon could steer Russia off such a path.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve invested a huge amount of time and money and human power into being, you know, a space power,\u201d she said.",
      "Using such a weapon \u201cwould effectively cut off space for them as well,\u201d Samson said. \u201dI don't know that they would be willing to give up that much.\"",

      "Instacart is ending a program where customers saw different prices for the same product ordered at the same time from the same store",
      "NEW YORK -- Instacart said Monday that it\u2019s ending a program where some customers saw different prices for the same product ordered at the same time from the same store when using the delivery company\u2019s service.",
      "The program was meant to help grocers and other retailers learn more about what kinds of prices customers would pay for items, similar to how stores offer different prices for the same products at different locations. But it raised alarms after a report from Consumer Reports and two progressive advocacy groups, Groundwork Collaborative and More Perfect Union, said Instacart offered nearly three out of every four grocery items to shoppers at multiple prices in an experiment.",
      "\u201cAt a time when families are working exceptionally hard to stretch every grocery dollar, those tests raised concerns, leaving some people questioning the prices they see on Instacart,\u201d the company said in a Monday blog post. \u201cThat\u2019s not okay \u2013 especially for a company built on trust, transparency, and affordability.\u201d",
      "Retailers will continue to set their own prices on the delivery website and they may still offer different prices at different brick-and-mortar locations, Instacart said, but \u201cfrom now on, Instacart will not support any item price testing services.\u201d",
      "Instacart said these services were neither \u201c dynamic pricing,\u201d a system where the price for something can go up when demand is high, nor \u201csurveillance pricing,\u201d where prices can be set based on a user's income, shopping history or other personal information. Instead, the company said it was offered to customers at random.",
      "Some customers would simply see a slightly higher price for an item, while others would see a slightly lower price. The experiment by Consumer Reports and the two progressive advocacy groups, for example, found that Instacart customers saw one of five different prices for the same dozen of Lucerne eggs from a Safeway store in Washington, D.C.: $3.99, $4.28, $4.59, $4.69, or $4.79.",

      "Before little Ryu was born, he developed outside his mom\u2019s womb, hidden by a basketball-sized ovarian cyst \u2014 a dangerous situation so rare that his doctors plan to write about the case for a medical journal.",
      "Just 1 in 30,000 pregnancies occur in the abdomen instead of the uterus, and those that make it to full term \u201care essentially unheard of \u2014 far, far less than 1 in a million,\u201d said Dr. John Ozimek, medical director of labor and delivery at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, where Ryu was born. \u201cI mean, this is really insane.\u201d",
      "Lopez, a 41-year-old nurse who lives in Bakersfield, California, didn\u2019t know she was pregnant with her second child until days before giving birth.",
      "When her belly began to grow earlier this year, she thought it was her ovarian cyst getting bigger. Doctors had been monitoring the mass since her 20s, leaving it in place after removing her right ovary and another cyst.",
      "Lopez experienced none of the usual pregnancy symptoms, such as morning sickness, and never felt kicks. Though she didn\u2019t have a period, her cycle is irregular and she sometimes goes years without one.",
      "For months, she and her husband, Andrew Lopez, went about their lives and traveled abroad.",
      "But gradually, the pain and pressure in her abdomen got worse, and Lopez figured it was finally time to get the 22-pound (10-kilogram) cyst removed. She needed a CT scan, which required a pregnancy test first because of the radiation exposure. To her great surprise, the test came back positive.",
      "Lopez shared the news with her husband at a Dodgers baseball game in August, handing him a package with a note and a onesie.",
      "\u201cI just saw her face,\u201d he recalled, \u201cand she just looked like she wanted to weep and smile and cry at the same time.\u201d",
      "Shortly after the game, Lopez began feeling unwell and sought help at Cedars-Sinai. It turned out she had dangerously high blood pressure, which the medical team stabilized. They also did blood work and gave her an ultrasound and an MRI. The scans found that her uterus was empty, but a nearly full-term fetus in an amniotic sac was hiding in a small space in her abdomen, near her liver.",
      "\u201cIt did not look like it was directly invading any organs,\u201d Ozimek said. \u201cIt looked like it was mostly implanted on the sidewall of the pelvis, which is also very dangerous but more manageable than being implanted in the liver.\u201d",
      "Dr. Cara Heuser, a maternal-fetal specialist in Utah not involved with the case, said almost all pregnancies that implant outside the uterus \u2014 called ectopic pregnancies \u2014 go on to rupture and hemorrhage if not removed. Most commonly, they occur in the fallopian tubes.",

The deputy also told him that \"while he was shooting towards the ground in his backyard that there was nothing behind his property to stop any bullets from traveling beyond his property and hurting someone,\" the affidavit stated. Adams' home is located approximately 0.3 miles away from the residence where the woman was shot, based on the addresses included in the affidavit.",
      "After being read his Miranda rights, Adams allegedly acknowledged that he was shooting south from his residence on Thursday with the Glock handgun, which had been loaded with approximately eight and then 10 rounds of Winchester .45 caliber ammunition, according to the affidavit.",
      "Deputies arrested Adams on Thursday evening for first-degree manslaughter after consulting with the local district attorney's office, the Stephens County Sheriff's Office said.",
      "The charging document alleges that he caused the woman's death \"by engaging in conduct with a firearm that created a situation of unreasonable risk and probability of death, or great bodily harm, to another person and demonstrated a conscious disregard for the safety of others.\"",
      "During his initial court appearance on Friday, Adams' bond was set at $100,000, according to online court records. A preliminary hearing has been scheduled for Feb. 26. ABC News was unable to reach Adams or his attorney for comment.",

      "From memes to public mishaps, 2025 was a year of nonstop viral moments.",
      "However, the most viral moments of the year did not just rack up views online -- they drove public discourse, sparked debates and highlighted just how much online moments can shape real-world trends.",
      "Labubus",
      "Arguably the most famous viral trend of 2025, Chinese Labubu dolls took the world by storm.",
      "The plush toys were created by Hong Kong-born Belgian artist Kasing Lung based on figures from Nordic mythology.",
      "The collectables made toy company Pop Mart a billion-dollar business, as Labubus sold for up to thousands of dollars on the resale market, fuled by the many celebrities toting the keychains around in public.",
      "Emily Brough, the head of licensing at Pop Mart told ABC News that \"recent Labubu drops have sold out within minutes -- both online and in-store,\" as long lines wrapping around malls.",
      "Markus Maciel, associate professor of toy design at Otis College, told ABC News that the vitality of the toy is chiefly due to blind nature of which Labubu customers receive.",

      "67 meme",
      "The biggest menace of 2025? The number 67, apparently.",
      "But what, exactly, does 67 mean?",
      "According to Dictionary.com, which selected \"67\" as its 2025 Word of the Year, \"the term is largely nonsensical\" but \"some argue it means 'so-so,' or 'maybe this, maybe that,' especially when paired with a hand gesture where both palms face up and move alternately up and down.\"",
      "It's also pronounced \"six-seven\" and never \"sixty-seven,\" Dictionary.com notes.",
      "Whatever its meaning or its origin, Generation Alpha \u2013 meaning kids born in the digital generation of the 2010s through the present \u2013 have embraced it, in part because it's \"purposefully nonsensical and all about being in on the absurdity.\"",
      "As the viral meme spread throughout the year, businesses, teachers and others tried cracking down on its use.",

      "In the nation\u2019s first such levy to help cope with a warming planet, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed legislation in May that raises tax revenue to deal with eroding shorelines, wildfires and other climate problems. Officials estimate the tax will generate nearly $100 million annually.",
      "The levy increases rates on hotel room and vacation rental stays but also imposes a new 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship\u2019s passengers, starting next year, prorated for the number of days the vessels are in Hawaii ports.",
      "Cruise Lines International Association challenged the tax in a lawsuit, along with a Honolulu company that provides supplies and provisions to cruise ships and tour businesses out of Kauai and the Big Island that rely on cruise ship passengers. Among their arguments is that the new law violates the Constitution by taxing cruise ships for the privilege of entering Hawaii ports.",

      "Holland died early Saturday morning from complications associated with kidney disease, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced on its website.",
      "Holland, who died in Salt Lake City, led a governing body called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, which helps set church policy while overseeing the many business interests of what is known widely as the Mormon church.",

      "Henry B. Eyring, who is 92 and one of Oaks' two top counselors, is now next in line for the presidency.",
      "Holland had been hospitalized during the Christmas holiday for treatment related to ongoing health complications, the church said. Experts on the faith pointed to his declining health in October when Oaks did not select Holland as a counselor. He attended several church events that month in a wheelchair.",
      "His death leaves a vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve that Oaks will fill in coming months, likely by calling a new apostle from a lower-tier leadership council. Apostles are all men in accordance with the church\u2019s all-male priesthood.",
      "Holland grew up in St. George, Utah, and worked for many years in education administration before his call to join the ranks of church leadership. He served as the ninth president of Brigham Young University, the Utah-based faith's flagship school, from 1980 to 1989 and was a commissioner of the church\u2019s global education system.",
      "Under his leadership, the Provo university worked to improve interfaith relations and established a satellite campus in Jerusalem.

      "A mysterious group called Georgians for Integrity has spent around $5 million on television ads, mailers and texts attacking Lt. Gov. Burt Jones since November",
      "ATLANTA -- It's the biggest mystery in Georgia politics right now: Who's paying for the attacks on Republican Lt. Gov. Burt Jones?",
      "Someone operating under the name \u201cGeorgians for Integrity\u201d has dumped around $5 million into television ads, mailers and texts. The attacks claim Jones, who already has President Donald Trump's endorsement in his run for governor next year, has been using his office to enrich himself.",
      "For any Georgian settling down to watch a football game, the ads have been nearly inescapable since Thanksgiving. They're the opening shot in the public battle for the Republican nomination that will be settled in May's primary election. But the ads also show how dark money is influencing politics not only at the national level but in the states, with secretive interests dropping big sums seeking to shift public opinion.",
      "The Jones campaign is hopping mad, threatening legal action against television stations if they don\u2019t stop airing ads that a lawyer calls \u201cdemonstrably false\u201d and slanderous.",
      "So far, the ads remain on air.",
      "\u201cThey want to be anonymous, spend a lot of money, and create a lot of lies about myself and my family,\u201d Jones told WSB-AM in an interview Dec. 16, calling the ads \u201cfabricated trash.\u201d",
      "Attorney General Chris Carr and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, Jones\u2019 top rivals for the Republican nomination, say they are not involved in the attacks. All three want to succeed Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who can\u2019t run again because of term limits. There are also multiple Democrats vying for the state\u2019s top office.",
      "The Georgia Republican Party has filed a complaint with the State Ethics Commission. The GOP claims the ads violate Georgia\u2019s campaign finance law against spending on an election without registering and disclosing donors.",
      "\u201cI think there are far-reaching consequences to allowing this activity to go forward unchecked,\u201d state Republican Party Chairman Josh McKoon told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd the consequences are much broader than the outcome of the May primary.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a further filtering down of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United decision, which led to dramatic increases in independent spending in U.S. elections, said Shanna Ports, senior legal counsel for the Washington, D.C.-based Campaign Legal Center, which seeks to reduce the influence of money in politics.",
      "\u201cDark money is becoming more and more the norm in races, up and down the ballot, and at early times,\u201d Ports said.",

      "Claims that Jones has been engaged in self-dealing are nothing new \u2014- Carr has been making similar attacks for months. But things escalated after Georgians for Integrity was incorporated in Delaware on Nov. 24, according to that state's corporation records. The entity identifies itself as a nonprofit social welfare organization under the federal tax code, a popular way to organize campaign spending that lets a group hide its donors.",
      "The Jones campaign says the ad falsely leads viewers to believe that Jones enabled government to take land through eminent domain to help support his family\u2019s interest in a massive data center development in Jones\u2019 home county south of Atlanta. As a state senator, Jones did vote for a 2017 law that opened a narrow exception in Georgia\u2019s law prohibiting governments from conveying property seized through condemnation proceedings to private developers. But eminent domain isn't being used to benefit the $10 billion development that government filings show could include 11 million square feet (1 million square meters) of data centers.",
      "Georgians for Integrity lists its local address as a mailbox at an Atlanta office supply store east on some paperwork submitted to television stations. A media buyer named Alex Roberts, with a Park City, Utah, address, is also listed on those papers, but he hasn't responded to an email from the AP. Neither has Kimberly Land, a Columbus, Ohio, lawyer listed on incorporation papers. After weeks of heavy spending, no one has proved who's providing the cash.",
      "The Republican Party contends Georgians for Integrity is an independent committee under Georgia law. That means it can raise and spend unlimited sums, but must register before accepting contributions and must disclose its donors.",
      "But that law identifies such committees as expending \u201cfunds either for the purpose of affecting the outcome of an election for any elected office or to advocate the election or defeat of any particular candidate.\u201d And the ads targeting Jones don't ever identify him as running for governor or mention the 2026 elections, instead urging viewers to call Jones and \u201cTell Burt, stop profiting off taxpayers.\u201d",
      "But McKoon said those are \u201csemantic games\u201d and that regular voters would definitely think the ads are designed to influence them.",
      "\u201cIf you are funding a message that is designed to impact an election \u2014 and I think it strains credulity to argue that that is not the case here \u2014 then you ought to have to comply with the campaign finance laws that the legislature has seen fit to pass,\u201d McKoon said.",

    "story": [
      "Hawaii's Big Island is banning people from feeding feral cats in an effort to protect native species, including an endangered goose",
      "KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii -- Throngs of feral cats emerge from the shade of parked trucks and bushes as soon as the familiar Subaru Forester pulls into a dump on Hawaii's Big Island. They run after the vehicle to a certain meal \u2014 a gravy train that might not be around much longer.",
      "A Hawaii County law set to take effect at the start of the new year bans feeding feral animals on county property. It's an effort to protect native species, such as an endangered goose called the nene, from a super predator introduced to the islands by Europeans in the 18th century.",
      "But the measure doesn't sit well with many cat lovers, including the driver of the Subaru, Liz Swan, who has been feeding feral felines on the Big Island for 33 years.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe the cats should be exterminated at the expense of the nene,\u201d Swan said. \u201cThey\u2019re both living creatures.\u201d",
      "It's unclear how many feral cats \u2014 abandoned pets and their descendants \u2014 live on the Big Island. Estimates range well into the tens of thousands, with pockets of dense colonies supported by people. Opponents of the ban say it will hamper their efforts to contain the population by trapping and neutering the animals \u2014 and that hungry cats will then have to hunt for food.",
      "About 200 cats live at the Kealakehe Transfer Station and Recycling Center, not far from the bustling tourist district of Kona. Swan shows up every late afternoon with water and kibble, and says she's never seen a nene anywhere near the dump. Despite living amid trash, the cats there generally appear robust, most of them missing the tip of an ear, indicating they\u2019ve been spayed or neutered.",
      "The cats threaten the native species directly \u2014 by killing them \u2014 and indirectly, biologists say. Food left out for the cats can attract native animals, bringing them into closer contact with humans. Cat feces can also spread a parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, a disease that has killed endangered Hawaiian monk seals and native birds.",
      "Last year, a male nene \u2014 pronounced \u201cneh-neh\u201d \u2014 was struck and killed by a car as it crossed a road in Hilo, on the eastern side of the island, to reach a cat feeding station. The goose's surviving mate, which also had a gosling die of toxoplasmosis in 2024, has recently taken on another partner and is nesting in a Hilo park, the state Department of Land and Natural Resources announced this month.",
      "The county's feeding ban will help protect them, the department said.",
      "State wildlife biologist Raymond McGuire recently checked for nene nesting sites among the barren black-rock fields near a shopping center at the Waikoloa resort. It's not their traditional habitat, but he has seen the geese fly in to grab food \u2014 risking getting hit by cars \u2014 and last year some nested there.",
      "As he approached, a pair of feline eyes peered out of a crack in the lava rock. Cats emerged from their nooks, perhaps mistaking him for someone who might offer food.",
      "McGuire was relieved to see there were no nene nearby \u2014 but frustrated with evidence the cats are being fed: empty water bowls and aluminum pans.",
      "He's a cat owner \u2014 \"my favorite animal is a cat\" \u2014 but as a Hawaiian whose love of nature inspired him to pursue conservation work, he believes there is no room for them where native species are struggling to survive.",
      "\u201cThere's so many birds that my kids will never see, that I got to see,\u201d he said, referring to native forest birds. \u201cI think about my ancestors and I do wonder: Are we honoring them well in what we do? Because they did take steps to protect them.\u201d",
      "Feral cats are a problem in many places, but Hawaii's sensitive ecosystem is full of species that evolved without mammalian predators, making them especially vulnerable, McGuire said.",
      "Hawaiian culture is closely tied to Hawaii\u2019s animals; aumakua, or ancestral spirit guides, can take animal form, noted Big Island Mayor Kimo Alameda. His family's aumakua is the shark, he said.",

      "The New Year's Eve ball drop in New York City will sparkle in red, white, and blue to kick off celebrations for the U.S.'s 250th birthday in 2026",
      "When the ball drops on New Year\u2019s Eve in New York City, it will sparkle in red, white and blue, ushering in 2026 and kicking off months of celebrations for the nation\u2019s upcoming 250th birthday.",
      "The patriotic touches at this year's Times Square gathering, including a second confetti drop, will offer an early glimpse of what\u2019s ahead: hundreds of events and programs, big and small, planned nationwide to mark the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m telling you right now, whatever you\u2019re imagining, it\u2019s going to be much more than that,\u201d said America250 Chair Rosie Rios, who oversees the bipartisan commission created by Congress in 2016 to organize the semiquincentennial anniversary. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be one for the ages, the most inspirational celebration this country and maybe the world has ever seen.\u201d",
      "Rios and her group worked with the Times Square Alliance business district and One Times Square, the building from where the ball is dropped, to make the changes to this year's ceremonies. They're also planning a second ball drop July 3, the eve of the nation's birthday, \u201cin the same beautiful style that Times Square knows how to do it,\" Rios said.",
      "It will mark the first time in 120 years there will be ball drop in Times Square that doesn't occur on New Year's Eve, she said.",
      "A New Year\u2019s Eve ball was first dropped in Times Square in 1907. Built by a young immigrant metalworker named Jacob Starr, the 700-pound (318-kilogram), 5-foot- (1.5-meter-) diameter ball was made of iron and wood and featured 100 25-watt light bulbs. Last year, the Constellation Ball, the ninth and largest version, was unveiled. It measured about 12 feet (3.7 meters) in diameter and weighs nearly 12,000 pounds (5,400 kilograms).",
      "The only years no ball drop occurred were 1942 and 1943, when the city instituted a nightly \u201cdimout\u201d during World War II to protect itself from attacks. Crowds instead celebrated the new year with a moment of silence followed by chimes rung from the base of One Times Square.",

    "story": [
      "A 13-year-old girl at a Louisiana middle school got into a fight with classmates who were sharing AI-generated nude images of her",
      "THIBODAUX, La. -- The teasing was relentless. Nude images of a 13-year-old girl and her friends, generated by artificial intelligence, were circulating on social media and had become the talk of a Louisiana middle school.",
      "The girls begged for help, first from a school guidance counselor and then from a sheriff\u2019s deputy assigned to their school. But the images were shared on Snapchat, an app that deletes messages seconds after they\u2019re viewed, and the adults couldn\u2019t find them. The principal had doubts they even existed.",
      "Among the kids, the pictures were still spreading. When the 13-year-old girl stepped onto the Lafourche Parish school bus at the end of the day, a classmate was showing one of them to a friend.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when I got angry,\u201d the eighth grader recalled at her discipline hearing.",
      "Fed up, she attacked a boy on the bus, inviting others to join her. She was kicked out of Sixth Ward Middle School for more than 10 weeks and sent to an alternative school. She said the boy whom she and her friends suspected of creating the images wasn\u2019t sent to that alternative school with her. The 13-year-old girl\u2019s attorneys allege he avoided school discipline altogether.",
      "When the sheriff's department looked into the case, they took the opposite actions. They charged two of the boys who'd been accused of sharing explicit images \u2014 and not the girl.",
      "The Louisiana episode highlights the nightmarish potential of AI deepfakes. They can, and do, upend children's lives \u2014 at school, and at home. And while schools are working to address artificial intelligence in classroom instruction, they often have done little to prepare for what the new tech means for cyberbullying and harassment.",
      "Once again, as kids increasingly use new tech to hurt one another, adults are behind the curve, said Sergio Alexander, a research associate at Texas Christian University focused on emerging technology.",
      "\u201cWhen we ignore the digital harm, the only moment that becomes visible is when the victim finally breaks,\u201d Alexander said.",
      "In Lafourche Parish, the school district followed all its protocols for reporting misconduct, Superintendent Jarod Martin said in a statement. He said a \u201cone-sided story\u201d had been presented of the case that fails to illustrate its \"totality and complex nature.\u201d",
      "After hearing rumors about the nude images, the 13-year-old said she marched with two friends \u2014 one nearly in tears \u2014 to the guidance counselor around 7 a.m. on Aug. 26. The Associated Press isn\u2019t naming her because she is a minor and because AP doesn\u2019t normally name victims of sexual crimes.",
      "She was there for moral support, not initially realizing there were images of her, too, according to testimony at her school disciplinary hearing.",
      "Ultimately, the weeks-long investigation at the school in Thibodaux, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) southwest of New Orleans, uncovered AI-generated nude images of eight female middle school students and two adults, the district and sheriff's office said in a joint statement.",
      "\u201cFull nudes with her face put on them\u201d is how the girl\u2019s father, Joseph Daniels, described them.",
      "Until recently, it took some technical skill to make realistic deepfakes. Technology now makes it easy to pluck a photo off social media, \u201cnudify\u201d it and create a viral nightmare for an unsuspecting classmate.",
      "Most schools are \u201cjust kind of burying their heads in the sand, hoping that this isn\u2019t happening,\u201d said Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and professor of criminology at Florida Atlantic University.",
      "Lafourche Parish School District was just starting to develop policies on artificial intelligence. The school-level AI guidance mainly addressed academics, according to documents provided through a records request. The district also hadn\u2019t updated its training on cyberbullying to reflect the threat of AI-generated, sexually explicit images. The curriculum its schools used was from 2018.",
      "Although the girls at Sixth Ward Middle School hadn\u2019t seen the images firsthand, they heard about them from boys at school. Based on those conversations, the girls accused a classmate and two students from other schools of creating and spreading the nudes on Snapchat and possibly TikTok.",
      "The principal, Danielle Coriell, said an investigation came up cold that day as no student took responsibility. The deputy assigned to the school searched social media for the images unsuccessfully, according to a recording of the disciplinary hearing.",
      "\u201cI was led to believe that this was just hearsay and rumors,\u201d the girl\u2019s father said, recounting a conversation he had that morning with the school counselor.",
      "But the girl was miserable, and a police incident report showed more girls were reporting that they were victims, too. The 13-year-old returned to the counselor in the afternoon, asking to call her father. She said she was refused.",
      "Her father says she sent a text message that said, \u201cDad,\u201d and nothing else. They didn't talk. With the mocking unrelenting, the girl texted her sister, \u201cIt\u2019s not getting handled.\u201d",
      "As the school day wound down, the principal was skeptical. At the disciplinary hearing, the girl\u2019s attorney asked why the sheriff's deputy didn\u2019t check the phone of the boy the girls were accusing and why he was allowed on the same bus as the girl.",
      "\u201cKids lie a lot,\u201d responded Coriell, the principal. \u201cThey lie about all kinds of things. They blow lots of things out of proportion on a daily basis. In 17 years, they do it all the time. So to my knowledge, at 2 o\u2019clock when I checked again, there were no pictures.\u201d",
      "When the girl stepped onto the bus 15 minutes later, the boy was showing the AI-generated images to a friend. Fake nude images of her friends were visible on the boy\u2019s phone, the girl said, a claim backed up by a photo taken on the bus. A video from the school bus showed at least a half-dozen students circulating the images, said Martin, the superintendent, at a school board meeting.",

      "She hit him a second time. Then, the principal said, the girl asked aloud: \u201cWhy am I the only one doing this?\u201d Two classmates hit the boy, the principal said, before the 13-year-old climbed over a seat and punched and stomped on him.",
      "Video of the fight was posted on Facebook. \u201cOverwhelming social media sentiment was one of outrage and a demand that the students involved in the fight be held accountable,\u201d the district and sheriff\u2019s office said in their joint statement released in November.",
      "The girl had no past disciplinary problems, but she was assigned to an alternative school as the district moved to expel her for a full semester \u2014 89 school days.",
      "It was on the day of the girl\u2019s disciplinary hearing, three weeks after the fight, that the first of the boys was charged.",
      "The student was charged with 10 counts of unlawful dissemination of images created by artificial intelligence under a new Louisiana state law, part of a wave of such legislation around the country. A second boy was charged in December with identical charges, the sheriff's department said. Neither was identified by authorities because of their ages.",
      "The girl would face no charges because of what the sheriff\u2019s office described as the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d",
      "At the disciplinary hearing, the principal refused to answer questions from the girl\u2019s attorneys about what kind of school discipline the boy would face.",
      "The district said in a statement that federal student privacy laws prohibit it from discussing individual students\u2019 disciplinary records. Gregory Miller, an attorney for the girl, said he has no knowledge of any school discipline for the classmate accused of sharing the images.",
      "Ultimately, the panel expelled the 13-year-old. She wept, her father said.",
      "\u201cShe just felt like she was victimized multiple times \u2014 by the pictures and by the school not believing her and by them putting her on a bus and then expelling her for her actions,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "After she was sent to the alternative school, the girl started skipping meals, her father said. Unable to concentrate, she completed none of the school's online work for several days before her father got her into therapy for depression and anxiety.",
      "Nobody initially noticed when she stopped doing her assignments, her father said.",
      "\u201cShe kind of got left behind,\u201d he said.",
      "Her attorneys appealed to the school board, and another hearing was scheduled for seven weeks later.",
      "By then, so much time had passed that she could have returned to her old school on probation. But because she\u2019d missed assignments before getting treated for depression, the district wanted her to remain at the alternative site another 12 weeks.",
      "For students who are suspended or expelled, the impact can last years. They're more likely to be suspended again. They become disconnected from their classmates, and they\u2019re more likely to become disengaged from school. They're more likely to have lower grades and lower graduation rates.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s already been out of school enough,\u201d one of the girl's attorneys, Matt Ory, told the board on Nov. 5. \u201cShe is a victim.",
      "\u201cShe,\u201d he repeated, \u201cis a victim.\u201d",
      "Martin, the superintendent, countered: \u201cSometimes in life we can be both victims and perpetrators.\u201d",
      "But the board was swayed. One member, Henry Lafont, said: \u201cThere are a lot of things in that video that I don\u2019t like. But I\u2019m also trying to put into perspective what she went through all day.\u201d They allowed her to return to campus immediately. Her first day back at school was Nov. 7, although she will remain on probation until Jan. 29.",
      "That means no dances, no sports and no extracurricular activities. She already missed out on basketball tryouts, meaning she won\u2019t be able to play this season, her father said. He finds the situation \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was hoping she would make great friends, they would go to the high school together and, you know, it\u2019d keep everybody out of trouble on the right tracks,\u201d her father said. \u201cI think they ruined that.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Department of Homeland Security has dropped its plan to deport a Chinese national who entered the country illegally, two rights activists said Monday, after his plight raised public concerns that the man, if deported, would be punished by Beijing for helping expose human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang region.",
      "Rayhan Asat, a human rights lawyer who assisted in the case, said Guan Heng's lawyer received a letter from DHS stating its decision to withdraw its request to send Guan to Uganda. Asat said she now expects Guan\u2019s asylum case to \u201cproceed smoothly and favorably.\u201d",

      "Knowing he could not release the video footage while in China, Guan left the mainland in 2021 for Hong Kong and then flew to Ecuador, which at the time did not require visas for Chinese nationals. He then traveled to the Bahamas, where he bought a small inflatable boat and an outboard motor before setting off for Florida, according to the nongovernmental organization Human Rights in China.",

      "Michael Abatti comes from a long line of farmers in the region bordering Arizona, and his grandfather, an Italian immigrant, was among the region\u2019s early settlers.

      "Michael Abatti said in a legal filing that he couldn\u2019t afford the increase after two bad farming years took a toll on his monthly income. He said European shifts in crop-buying to support war-plagued Ukrainian farmers and rising shipping costs were to blame along with an unusually cold and wet winter.",

      "Perry Archangelo Bamonte, longtime guitarist and keyboardist for the influential goth band The Cure, has died. He was 65.",
      "The band announced\u00a0his death on their official website on Friday.",
      "\"It is with enormous sadness that we confirm the death of our great friend and bandmate Perry Bamonte, who passed away after a short illness at home over Christmas,\" the band wrote.",
      "\"Quiet, intense, intuitive, constant and hugely creative, 'Teddy' was a warm hearted and vital part of The Cure story,\" the statement continued. \"Our thoughts and condolences are with all his family. He will be very greatly missed.\"",
      "Bamonte worked with the band in various roles from 1984 to 1989, including as a roadie and guitar tech. He officially joined the band in 1990, when keyboardist Roger O'Donnell quit. It was then that he became a full-time member of the group, playing guitar, six-string bass and keyboard.",
      "Having joined just after the band's mainstream breakthrough, 1989's \"Disintegration,\" Bamonte is featured on a number of The Cure's albums, including 1992's \"Wish\" - which features the career-defining hits \u2033Friday I'm in Love\u2033 and \"High\" - as well as the 1996's \"Wild Mood Swings,\" 2000's \"Bloodflowers\" and 2004's self-titled release.",

      "In 2019, Bamonte was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame alongside the rest of The Cure. He joined The Cure on their North American tour in 2024 when the band reduced tickets to as low as $20 after pledging to make the shows affordable for fans following complaints about exorbitant fees. \u00a0Lead singer Robert Smith said at the time he was \"sickened\" by the Ticketmaster fee debacle.",
      "His last performance with the band was on Nov. 1, 2024 in London for a special one-off event to launch their latest album and first in 16 years, \"Songs of a Lost World.\" The concert was filmed for \"The Cure: The Show of a Lost World,\" a film released in cinemas globally this month.

    "story": [
      "A planned Christmas Eve jazz concert at the Kennedy Center, a holiday tradition at the Washington, D.C., performing arts center dating back more than 20 years, has been canceled.",
      "The show's host, musician Chuck Redd, told The Associated Press he called off the performance after the White House announced last week that President Trump's name would be added to the facility \u2014 drawing pushback from Democratic lawmakers and some scholars, who say the change violates the law. According to the White House, the president's handpicked board approved the decision to rename the institution the Trump-Kennedy Center. The revised name later appeared on the building's facade.",
      "\"When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,\" Redd told The Associated Press in an email Wednesday. Redd, a drummer and vibraphone player who has toured with everyone from Dizzy Gillespie to Ray Brown, has been presiding over holiday \"Jazz Jams\" at the Kennedy Center since 2006, succeeding bassist William \"Keter\" Betts.",
      "The center's website lists the show as canceled.",
      "The Kennedy Center's vice president of public relations, Roma Daravi, told CBS News in a statement: \"Any artist cancelling their show at the Trump Kennedy Center over political differences isn't courageous or principled \u2014 they are selfish, intolerant, and have failed to meet the basic duty of a public artist: to perform for all people.\"",
      "In a letter to Redd, Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell called the cancellation a \"political stunt\" and alleged that Jazz Jams have faced \"dismal ticket sales.\" Grenell also said the center plans to seek $1 million in damages.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Redd for comment.",
      "President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and Congress passed a law naming the center as a living memorial to him.\u00a0The law explicitly prohibits the board of trustees adding any additional memorials to the site.",
      "The decision to rename the center has drawn steep criticism from congressional Democrats and some members of Kennedy's family. Democratic Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio sued over the renaming Monday, calling it a \"flagrant violation of the rule of law\" and noting that the name can't be changed without an act of Congress.",
      "Grenell, who was appointed by Mr. Trump,\u00a0has argued that the center's status as a memorial to Kennedy wasn't changed.",
      "Mr. Trump, a Republican, has been deeply involved with the center named for an iconic Democrat after mostly ignoring it during his first term. He has forced out its leadership, overhauled the board while arranging for himself to head it and personally hosted this year's Kennedy Center honors, breaking a long tradition of presidents mostly serving as spectators.",
      "Numerous artists have called off Kennedy Center performances since Mr. Trump returned to office, including Issa Rae and Peter Wolf. Lin-Manuel Miranda canceled a planned production of \"Hamilton.\"",

      "Mario Rodriguez filed the lawsuit Thursday in California, alleging Perry subjected him to repeated unwanted sexual advances over several years, including sexual battery and assault at Perry's Los Angeles home. Rodriguez is seeking at least $77 million in damages and also has sued Lionsgate, which distributed the 2016 film, accusing the studio of turning a blind eye to Perry's alleged misconduct.",
      "\"Having recently failed in another matter against Mr. Perry, the very same lawyer has now made yet another demand from more than a decade ago which will also be a failed money grab,\" Alex Spiro, an attorney for Perry, said in a statement Friday provided to CBS News.",
      "Lionsgate did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "According to the complaint, Rodriguez was approached in 2014 by a trainer at an Equinox gym in Los Angeles who said Perry wanted his phone number to discuss an acting role. Perry later encouraged Rodriguez to audition for \"Boo! A Madea Halloween,\" telling him, \"I'm not a bad person to know and have in your corner,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "After Rodriguez was cast, he was invited to Perry's home, where Perry allegedly touched him inappropriately while they watched a movie. The lawsuit describes additional alleged incidents in 2016, 2018 and 2019, including one encounter in which Perry allegedly attempted to unbuckle Rodriguez's pants and another in which Perry placed Rodriguez's hand on his genitals. The complaint says Perry gave Rodriguez $5,000 on multiple occasions following the encounters.",
      "Rodriguez says he resisted the advances and ultimately decided to file suit after learning of similar allegations made by another actor, Derek Dixon.",
      "Dixon sued Perry in June, alleging the filmmaker groped him while Dixon worked on Perry's television series \"The Oval\" and \"Ruthless.\" That lawsuit, which was originally filed in L.A. Superior Court, has reportedly since been moved to federal court in Georgia, where Perry's studio is based.",
      "Rodriguez's lawsuit includes claims of sexual assault, sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.",

    "story": [
      "King Charles III and members of the royal family \u2014 minus his disgraced brother, the former Prince Andrew \u2014 gathered for Christmas at the king's private Sandringham Estate, where they traditionally spend the holiday. In the king's annual Christmas speech, broadcast across Britain and the Commonwealth, he stressed the importance of both unity and diversity.",
      "In the morning, Charles and Queen Camilla, along with the Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Kate, their children and extended family members, walked to services at St. Mary Magdalene Church at Sandringham, in Norfolk, about 100 miles north of London.",
      "Members of the royal family also stopped to greet people in the crowd outside.",
      "Andrew was not present for the holiday gathering, BBC News reported, in the wake of the\u00a0scandal over his ties to the late sex offender\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein. He\u00a0did not attend last year either. In October, he was\u00a0stripped of his remaining titles and honors, including prince, and is now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.",
      "Later in the day, the king's annual Christmas Day speech was watched by millions of people in the U.K. and across the Commonwealth, an association of 56 nations with historic ties to Britain.",
      "\"As I meet people of different faiths, I find it enormously encouraging to hear how much we have in common, a shared longing for peace and a deep respect for all life,\" Charles said in his address, which was recorded earlier this month at Westminster Abbey.",
      "Amid \"division both at home and abroad,\" he said, there are \"values of which we must never lose sight.\"",
      "\"With the great diversity of our communities, we can find the strength to ensure that right triumphs over wrong.\"",
      "Westminster Abbey, in the heart of London, is where monarchs have been crowned since William the Conqueror in 1066, and it has also been the site of numerous royal weddings.",
      "The speech was accompanied by a video of members of the royal family, including scenes from the king's historic trip to the Vatican, where he prayed with\u00a0Pope Leo XIV in an effort to forge closer relations between the Church of England and the Catholic Church.",
      "The speech is one of the rare occasions when Charles, 77, can voice his own views and doesn't seek guidance from the government. The remarks typically have a strong religious framework, reflect current issues and sometimes draw on the monarch's personal experiences.",
      "The king's speech was followed by a performance by a Ukrainian choir and London's Royal Opera Chorus, in a sign of support for Ukraine in its war against Russia's invasion.",
      "This was Charles' fourth Christmas speech since ascending to the throne after his mother,\u00a0Queen Elizabeth II, died in September 2022.",
      "The address comes just two weeks after Charles made a deeply personal television appearance in which he said \"good news\" from his doctors meant that he would be able to reduce his treatment for cancer in the new year.",
      "The king was diagnosed with a still undisclosed form of cancer in early 2024. Buckingham Palace says his treatment is now moving to a \"precautionary phase\" and his condition will be monitored to ensure his continued recovery.",
      "During last year's Christmas address, Charles honored care workers around the country and gave a special thanks to the doctors and nurses who supported him after his cancer diagnosis.",
      "Catherine, Princess of Wales, also underwent treatment for cancer last year. She said in January that she was in remission\u00a0after going through some \"hard times\" during her recovery. Kate, as she is widely called, has not shared details about what type of cancer it was.",
      "She and her husband Prince William, the\u00a0heir to the throne, have three children: 12-year-old Prince George of Wales, 10-year-old Princess Charlotte of Wales and 7-year-old Prince Louis of Wales.",

      "Date: Aired Tuesday, Dec. 23, 2025",
      "Online stream: Available on\u00a0Paramount+",
      "George Strait, the King of Country Music",
      "With hits like \"All My Ex's Live in Texas,\" \"Amarillo by Morning\" and \"Check Yes or No,\" George Strait is known as the King of Country Music.",
      "The multiplatinum artist has won dozens of awards from the Academy of Country Music and the Country Music Association, as well as a Grammy for best country album. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2006.",
      "When Strait received a lifetime achievement award from the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in 2021, he said his father taught him the ways of the cowboy life and that he's tried to hold on to his Western heritage throughout his career. But he also said he was challenged early on to stay true to himself.",
      "\"When I first signed with MCA Records in 1981, you know, they, all the people, were going, 'Take the hat off,'\" he said, pointing at his trademark 10-gallon cowboy hat with a grin. \"Now, can you imagine if I would have done that?\"",
      "A producer also floated the idea that Strait change his name. \"My dad was so glad I didn't do that,\" Strait said.",
      "Gloria Gaynor, the Queen of Disco",
      "Gloria Gaynor's 1978 hit \"I Will Survive\" has stood the test of time, surviving far longer than disco did and crowning the New Jersey singer as the genre's queen.",
      "The song won a Grammy for best disco recording. When it was added to the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry in 2016, the library said \"I Will Survive\" became known as an \"emblem of women's empowerment\" and an anthem in the LGBTQ community.",
      "\"That song taps into the inherent survival instinct and it taps into the tenacity of the human spirit,\" Gaynor told CBS News in 2016.",
      "As she recalled recently, when she recorded the hit, she was paralyzed from the waist down while recovering from a serious spinal injury after a fall onstage.",
      "\"I had been in hospital for over three months, hoping I'd survive, you know, this trauma that I was going through, hoping that I'd survive the fact that my mother had just passed away a few years prior,\" Gaynor said. \"Yeah, I was living that song, and I was certain that I wouldn't be the only one.\"",
      "Legendary rock band Kiss",
      "This year's celebration is a bittersweet moment for the founding members of Kiss. Ace Frehley, the band's original lead guitarist, died in October, just a few weeks after he, Peter Criss, Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley were named among this year's honorees.",
      "\"The saddest thing of all is that Ace couldn't live long enough to see this amazing thing,\" Simmons told CBS News.",
      "Kiss is known as much for their hits like \"Rock and Roll All Nite,\" \"I Was Made for Lovin' You\" and \"Detroit Rock City\" as they are for their signature black-and-white face paint. The group rode the glam rock wave to stardom, selling more than 100 million records worldwide and entering the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.",
      "Simmons and Stanley's partnership has lasted for decades, overcoming the difficulties of making it in the music business.",
      "\"I don't think it's a coincidence that both of us are Jewish and from immigrants who experienced the Holocaust,\" Stanley told CBS News. \"I think that innately we have inside us compassion for other people but also a sense of survival.\"",
      "Tony winner Michael Crawford",
      "Famed composer Andrew Lloyd Webber picked Michael Crawford to play the titular role in the long-running musical \"The Phantom of the Opera\" when it first opened in London in 1986.",
      "\"When he played to me the overture, the hair stood up on the back of my neck,\" Crawford told CBS News. \"I adored playing and creating it, building him.\"",
      "After winning an Olivier Award \u2014 the U.K. equivalent of the Tony Award \u2014 for musical of the year, the show opened on Broadway in New York in 1988, winning seven Tonys, including best actor in a musical for Crawford.",
      "Crawford's career has also included roles in movies and on television, but he considered those to be auditions for his next part. For him, playing the Phantom was a gift.",
      "\"So, you want to do the eight shows a week,\" Crawford said. \"You don't want to miss one.\"",
      "American icon Sylvester Stallone",
      "Sylvester Stallone wants people to understand one thing about his classic movie \"Rocky.\"",
      "\"Even to this day, I bristle when I hear it's a sports movie,\" Stallone told CBS News. \"It's not. It's a love story. It starts with love.\"",
      "For Stallone, who received Oscar nominations for playing Rocky Balboa and writing the screenplay for what was named 1976's best picture, the film was about the love between Rocky and Talia Shire's Adrian.",
      "\"This movie will rise and fall on love, not fights,\" Stallone said. \"Everyone can sort of go, oh my God, it's the little things in life, it's the love, it's the nurturing \u2014 that's the victory.\"",
      "Stallone calls the movie his biography when at the time he felt like he couldn't win. He went into acting in his 20s after growing up with his father, who Stallone said was emotionally and physically abusive. Movies were a way for Stallone to cope, and he said the mythic heroes he saw on screen changed his life.",
      "\"I said, 'I'm going to be that guy,'\" Stallone said. \"I don't want to be what's at the house, but I do want to be this noble creature.\"",
      "New Kennedy Center Honors medallion",
      "The rainbow-colored ribbons adorned with three gold bars that have long been given to honorees were replaced this year with new gold medallions.",
      "Designed by Tiffany and Co., each medallion features an etching of the center on one side with rainbow colors running through it. The other side bears each honoree's name and when they received the award.",
      "Each medallion hangs from a ribbon that's navy blue, which the center described as \"a color associated with dignity and tradition.\"",

    "summary": "Aubrey O'Day discusses the disturbing witness affidavit involving Sean \"Diddy\" Combs in a \"CBS Mornings\" interview on Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This content discusses allegations of sexual assault, which some may find distressing.",
      "Danity Kane's Aubrey O'Day is opening up about a witness affidavit that alleged she was sexually assaulted by Sean \"Diddy\" Combs.",
      "O'Day sat down with CBS News for her first network interview since Netflix's new documentary, \"Sean Combs: The Reckoning,\" was released. A clip from the documentary shows O'Day reading from an affidavit that describes an alleged sexual assault involving her, Combs, and another man while she was \"looking very inebriated.\" She says she has no memory of the alleged incident, but it has left her with questions.",
      "O'Day left with questions after shocking affidavit",
      "\"Does this mean I was raped? Is that what this means? I don't even know if I was raped. And I don't want to know,\" said O'Day in the documentary, which has received a reported 40 million views globally in its first two weeks.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a spokesman for Combs said that the music mogul \"categorically denies the allegations in the Netflix documentary,\" saying that \"he has never sexually assaulted anyone.\" Combs plans to address these matters \"in the appropriate legal forum\" rather than \"speculation from anonymous affidavits,\" the statement continued. Combs is currently serving a 50-month sentence in a New Jersey federal prison after being\u00a0convicted on prostitution-related charges.",
      "O'Day once worked closely with Combs, who helped found\u00a0Danity Kane\u00a0on his reality show \"Making the Band\" in 2005 before he ultimately disbanded the group in 2009. Speaking about Combs in the documentary brought up a lot of painful moments for O'Day, who said she's still processing the information.",
      "She wanted to make sure the person who wrote the affidavit is \"100 percent certain\" it was her and that they didn't confuse her with another bandmate or doppelg\u00e4nger.",
      "\"The story that they have told has been consistent for two years in every area that they've been in,\" O'Day said. To this day, O'Day still doesn't know what happened.",
      "O'Day has previously emphasized the role of forgiveness in her journey through the entertainment industry, saying that it starts with forgiving yourself.",
      "\"I forgive myself. That was the hard one,\" she said. \"The feelings that I've had throughout all of this really come down to, like, forgiving myself for misplacing abuse, or attention, or acknowledgment as love. Those weren't one in the same. And so I had to forgive myself first.\"",
      "Living her purpose",
      "When it comes to forgiving Combs, O'Day said it doesn't really matter.",
      "\"Do I forgive him? I don't think that matters to the bigger picture. I think that he needs to do the work to forgive himself,\" O'Day said.",
      "Right now, O'Day said her focus is going to remain on the survivors and pushing for systematic change.",
      "\"I want to be helping people, and speaking for the underdogs, and speaking for the voices that aren't being heard. And I didn't necessarily get to spend the majority of my life yet being able to live in my purpose,\" she said.",
      "Combs is expected to be\u00a0released from prison in May 2028, according to online prison records. While some rumors have swirled about the possibility of a presidential pardon, a senior White House official called the reports \"speculation\" and told CBS News any decisions on pardons would come directly from President Trump.",
      "Marc Agnifilo, the lead attorney for Combs,\u00a0told \"CBS Mornings\" in August\u00a0that he hasn't had any conversations about a possible pardon: \"I have not spoken to the president. I have not spoken to anybody who speaks to the president about Sean Combs. I have not.\"",
      "O'Day doesn't believe Mr. Trump would pardon Combs.",
      "\"I think the only reason, in my opinion, that the president would pardon 'Diddy' is if it worked well for him in midterms, in regards to gathering a certain voting base,\" she said. \"The moves are always strategic, and the moves right now are about midterms.\"",

    "summary": "Friends and colleagues of Rob Reiner sat down with CBS News to share personal anecdotes and fond memories of him following the news of his tragic death.",
    "story": [
      "Rob Reiner's circle was wide and eclectic, spanning comedians honing punchlines and Oscar-winning actors and filmmakers shaping Hollywood itself.",
      "As the son of comedy legend Carl Reiner, he entered the world of entertainment early, but went on to make a name for himself as a director, filmmaker, and actor in his own right.",
      "He's perhaps best known for his breakout role at age 23 as Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law, Michael \"Meathead\" Stivic in the hit 1970s sitcom \"All in the Family,\" though others may know him more recently as Bob Day, the father of the quirky Jess Day in \"New Girl.\" Reiner also directed iconic films such as \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally\u2026,\" \"This is Spinal Tap,\" \"Stand By Me\" and \"A Few Good Men.\"",
      "Friends and colleagues who worked with Reiner through the years sat down with CBS News to share their personal anecdotes and fond memories of him following the news of his tragic death. Reiner and his wife, Michele, were found dead in their Los Angeles home on Dec. 14 and their son, Nick, was charged in their murders.",
      "Here's a look at some tributes from those who knew Reiner best, featured in \"CBS News: Rob Reiner - Scenes from a Life,\" a one-hour special\u00a0broadcast Sunday after \"60 Minutes\" on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Albert Brooks",
      "Albert Brooks said he's still in disbelief over the death of his good friend, who he's known since the pair attended drama class together at Beverly Hills High School more than 60 years ago. He said he was heartbroken, but he loves to talk about his friendship with Reiner because it's \"genuine and it's rare.\"",
      "\"Rob was my oldest friend. It's that simple. He's the person that I've known the longest. I met him when I was 14 years old. So I'm still in that not believing it stage,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Brooks said he still finds himself dialing his pal's number to chat, and then freezes when he realizes what he's done.",
      "\"I know it happened, but, you know, I'm driving around and all of a sudden \u2014 I actually two days ago, I called his number,\" he recalled.",
      "Kathy Bates",
      "Oscar-winning actress Kathy Bates has credited Reiner with changing \"the course of [her] life\" by directing her unforgettable performance as Annie Wilkes in \"Misery\" in 1990.",
      "\"If I hadn't done 'Misery,' it would be like George Bailey going back and seeing what his life would have been like if he had never been there,\" she said. \"I wouldn't have had some of the friends that I have now. I wouldn't have had the richness in my life. I quite frankly probably would have stayed in the theater and I doubt I would have had a movie career. I might have dropped out altogether.\"",
      "She recalled Reiner's enthusiasm when she walked on stage to accept her Oscar for Best Actress in 1991.",
      "\"When they called my name, I looked over and Rob was standing and he was just pounding his fist together going, 'Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!'\" she recalled.",
      "Kiefer Sutherland",
      "Kiefer Sutherland who played Lt. Jonathan Kendrick in the 1992 legal drama \"A Few Good Men\" said Reiner had an unforgettable presence on set as director. He recalled the tense courtroom scene where Jack Nicholson \u2013 Colonel Nathan Jessup \u2013 had to deliver his now famous line, \"You can't handle the truth!\"",
      "After the first moving take, Sutherland recalled Reiner asking Nicholson if he wanted to go again.",
      "\"No one said a word, and Rob went up to Jack Nicholson and whispered in his ear, 'Do you want to do another one?' And Jack Nicholson said, 'Well, we're here,'\" Sutherland recalled. \"So they did another one, and it was just as extraordinary.\"",
      "The actors planned a marathon filming day, but Sutherland said Reiner was so blown away by Nicholson's performance that day that he sent everyone home early.",
      "\"They had planned to shoot the whole day, and Rob looked at everybody and said, 'I couldn't ask for anything more, so you guys all have the rest of the day off,\" Sutherland said.",
      "Annette Bening",
      "Annette Bening played Sydney Ellen Wade, an environmental lobbyist and love interest of widower President Andrew Shepherd, portrayed by Michael Douglas in the 1995 political romantic comedy, \"The American President.\" During filming, Bening said Reiner made it a priority as the movie's director to ensure the cast and crew could spend quality time with their families.",
      "\"On the set, he had that kind of enthusiasm that is infectious. The leader sets the tone, right? So he was wonderful that way. And a real avid family man,\" Bening said.",
      "She added, \"He would insist that the day ended at a sane time, which in show business is kind of unusual. But, he said, 'No, we want everyone to be able to have dinner with their kids.'\"",
      "Michael Douglas",
      "Like Reiner, Michael Douglas was also born to Hollywood royalty, the son of Kirk Douglas.",
      "\"Well, my experience was, watching him, that I could never be the man that my father was. He could do everything, you know, I mean he was Spartacus. Once you go into the same business, it stares you in the face,\" Douglas said. \"And, in Rob's case, are you as funny as your father? But that I think is also what created his tenacity, his strength, and that's something that's not really talked about enough with Rob, about his endurance.\"",
      "Douglas said Reiner was \"spectacular\" to work with in \"The American President.\" \"He was looking out for you,\" he said.",
      "Jerry O'Connell",
      "When Jerry O'Connell was 11, he was cast as the shy but loyal Vern Tessio in the 1986 coming-of-age drama \"Stand by Me.\" He met Reiner for the first time at his audition for the film, and recalled Reiner putting him at ease. He said Reiner was like a father figure to him during that time, and the years after.",
      "Months after the movie came out, when he was 12 years old, O'Connell said Reiner took him out to lunch in Los Angeles.",
      "\"He took me out to lunch, man. He didn't have to do that, You know what I'm saying? It was months after the movie came out. He was a busy man, and he took a 12-year-old me out to lunch. Just to be like, 'Thanks so much. What a great movie,'\" O'Connell recalled, with tears in his eyes. \"That lunch meant so much to me, you know? It's just stuff that kids need to hear.\"",
      "Mandy Patinkin",
      "Mandy Patinkin played Inigo Montoya, a Spanish swordsman, in Reiner's 1987 film adaptation of \"The Princess Bride.\" It was the role of a lifetime.",
      "After wrapping up filming, Patinkin said the cast was invited to come out to Los Angeles to see the first rough cut together. When the film was over, Patinkin turned in the screening room and said he \"never dreamed\" he would get to be in something like this.",
      "\"I didn't even have time to dream it. And he made that dream for me. And I don't go anywhere, where some child or adult or grandfather comes up to me and says, 'Say the line,'\" said Patinkin of his famous line, \"Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father. Prepare to die.\"",
      "The word that came to min when Patinkin heard the news about Reiner and his wife, Michele: \"Inconceivable.\" He said he doesn't know how to process it and he's not looking to understand how to process it.",
      "\"Rob worked hard to try to get me the best human being I could be. One time he said to me, 'I just wish you could get out of your own way.' And I haven't been able to achieve that to this day, but I won't quit trying. He cared about my nature. He showed it to me over and over again,\" Patinkin said. \"I believe that we can connect with Rob and Michele. And every time we're thinking about this or talking about it or anybody tells a story, he's here. He's here with you. He will not be forgotten.\"",

      "Here are some tips to get your financial house in order as you prepare for the new year.",
      "Prepare for new tax changes",
      "The OBBBA, the spending and tax bill signed into law by President Trump on July 4, establishes new tax deduction rules for many Americans, including seniors and workers who earn tips or overtime.",
      "Under a \"no tax on tips\" provision, employees may deduct up to $25,000 earned in tips before Dec. 31. To qualify for the deduction, it's important that workers track their earnings closely because of the IRS's\u00a0reporting requirements, experts say.",
      "\"Document the numbers,\" Vargas said, noting that the same applies to individuals who work overtime.",
      "Some seniors are also eligible for an enhanced senior deduction beginning in 2025. Individuals who are 65 and older may claim an additional deduction of $6,000, or $12,000 per couple, if they qualify.",
      "Because the deduction phases out for single earners with modified adjusted gross income above $75,000 or $150,000 for joint filers, seniors should check that income measure to assess whether or not they are eligible for the deduction, according to Vargas.",
      "Modified adjusted gross income is calculated by finding your AGI, which is on line 11 of your Form 1040, with some deductions and non-taxable items added back in.",
      "Make a budget that will stick",
      "Affordability is a top concern for Americans, whose paychecks aren't keeping pace with inflation. Making a budget that you can realistically follow is a good way to ensure you aren't wasting any money, financial experts say.",
      "It's essential, though, that any kind of budget you design \"matches the way you live,\" Alexa von Tobel, founder and managing director of Inspired Capital, told CBS News.",
      "\"Most budgets fail because they're too aspirational. The ones that stick are automated and grounded in your real patterns,\" she said.",
      "Von Tobel said she prefers the 50/30/20 budgeting rule, which portions half of your take-home pay to essentials; one-third to lifestyle expenses; and 20% to goals such as paying off debt or saving for a vacation.",
      "\"A new year is a perfect time to readdress how your budget aligns with this framework and see where you need to adjust,\" she said.",
      "If the 50/30/20 rule doesn't work for you, there are plenty of other budgeting approaches, including the envelope system and zero-based budgeting. The envelope system sets spending limits for categories like dining out, with that amount placed in cash and used throughout the month.",
      "Zero-based budgeting assigns every dollar of your take-home pay to a specific category \u2014 such as rent, groceries or savings \u2014 until there's nothing left unallocated.",
      "AI tools can remove the self-discipline part of the equation for people and automate savings processes, von Tobel noted.",
      "\"Money management is becoming less about discipline and more about system design. Automate what you can, use tools that give you back time and clarity, and let your financial plan run even when your schedule gets chaotic,\" she said.",
      "Pay down high-interest credit card debt",
      "It's important to prioritize paying down high-interest debt like credit card balances because it's the most expensive to carry and \"can get out of control quickly,\" Vanguard's Vargas said.",
      "When it comes to shedding debt, von Tobel recommends tackling credit card balances with the highest annual percentage rates (APRs) first.",
      "\"Line up your balances by APR, automate all minimum payments and aggressively target the highest-interest line first. Structure beats willpower every time,\" she said.",
      "Another popular strategy for paying down debt is the so-called snowball method. It involves listing your debts by balance and paying off the smallest ones first, regardless of interest rates, to build momentum and stay motivated as balances disappear.",
      "Borrowers have other options for tackling credit card debt as well. One approach is to move balances to a 0% balance transfer card, which can eliminate interest for as long as 21 months. Another is to contact your credit card issuer to ask for a lower annual percentage rate, or APR.",
      "Lock in savings rates before they fall",
      "The Federal Reserve last week cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, its third consecutive cut this year, and hinted at an additional rate cut in 2026.",
      "With at least one additional rate cut expected next year, it may make sense to open a certificate of deposit or a high-yield savings account before rates fall further, said Sam Taube, a lead writer with financial advice site NerdWallet.",
      "Online financial institutions are offering some of the highest rates, with annual percentage yields around 4%.",
      "\"If the Fed lowers rates further from here, they will offer lower fixed yields, so it might make sense to open up a CD of fixed-yield savings instrument like that sooner rather than later,\" he said.",
      "Make sure you're getting the full employer match",
      "If you have a tax-advantaged savings account through your employer, such as a 401(k), financial professionals say it's important to make the most of it. If your company matches employee contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match.",
      "Vargas said a good starting point is to find out what level of contribution your employer will match \u2014 typically it's between 3% to 6% of your salary\u2014 and to contribute at least that much to your account.",
      "\"Work toward maximizing that employer match, so you're not leaving money on the table,\" he said.",
      "Setting up an automatic payroll deduction is an easy way to ensure you're contributing to your 401(k), Von Tobel said, adding that \"small, consistent increases create enormous long-term compounding.\"",
      "Before year-end, you can also make a last-minute extra contribution to your 401(k), according to CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger.",
      "Because retirement contributions lower your taxable income, \"you may also reduce your tax bill in April,\" she noted.",

    "summary": "Here are the top 20 largest Powerball and Mega Millions jackpots, and the odds of winning them.",
    "story": [
      "Lottery jackpots have exploded in size over the last decade.",
      "When Powerball launched in 1992, the first jackpot was $5.9 million, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association. Now, the largest Powerball jackpot on record is the $2.04 billion prize won on Nov. 7, 2022.",
      "Mega Millions followed a similar path. Its first jackpot winner in 2002 took home $28 million. Its record prize \u2014 a $1.602 billion jackpot won on Aug. 8, 2023 \u2014 ranks as the fifth-largest jackpot won in U.S. lottery history.",
      "Thirteen of the 20 largest jackpots have occurred since 2023.",
      "The bigest one this year, Christmas Eve's $1.817 billion Powerball jackpot, is now the\u00a0second-largest U.S. jackpot ever won.",
      "Here are the biggest U.S. jackpot wins before that:",
      "Only five states don't sell lottery tickets: Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada and Utah.",
      "While the prizes are huge, the odds of winning still remain extremely low. Over the last three decades, both games have been redesigned multiple times. Changes have pushed jackpots higher while also adding more ways for players to win smaller prizes.",
      "Powerball players choose five numbers from 1 to 69 and one Powerball number from 1 to 26. In 2015, Powerball increased its number of white balls from 59 to 69 and its number of red balls decreased from 35 to 26.",
      "Before the change, the odds of winning the jackpot were 1 in 175.2 million and the overall odds of winning any prize were 1 in 31.85. After the redesign, the jackpot odds became steeper, 1 in 292.2 million, while the overall odds of winning a prize improved to 1 in 24.9, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.",
      "Mega Millions requires players to pick five different numbers from one to 70 and one Mega Ball number from one to 24. A ticket wins the jackpot by matching all six numbers in a drawing.",
      "In 2025, Mega Millions changed its games to a larger starting jackpot ($50 million vs. $20 million), which \"improved odds to win the jackpot and improved overall odds,\" according to Dan Miller, a spokesperson for Mega Millions.",
      "\"Everyone who wins is winning more because of the embedded multiplier in the new game that takes all non-jackpot prizes and multiplies them by 2X, 3X, 4X, 5X or 10X,\" Miller said in an email. Through Friday, Dec. 5, he said, \"there have been 70 drawings in the new game. In that time, players have won $531 million in non-jackpot prizes. In the old game, those same prizes would have been valued at $119.8 million. That's a 343% increase in player winnings.\"",
      "For example, under the old rules, matching just the Mega Ball was a break-even outcome: a $2 ticket earned a $2 prize. Under the new game, that same match now comes with a built-in multiplier. The minimum prize is $5, which is then multiplied \u2014 meaning a player can now win $10, $15, $20, $25 or even $50 instead of just $2.",
      "The odds to win the jackpot improved from 1 in 302.6 million to\u00a01 in 290.5 million. This is because of Mega Millions removing the one gold Mega Ball from the game, Miller said.",
      "The new game has 24 Mega Balls instead of 25, which improves the odds of picking the right combinations of numbers to win the jackpot. The overall odds to win any prize went from 1 in 24 to 1 in 23.",
      "There's more money in play as well: Powerball increased the price of a ticket from $1 to $2 in 2012. Mega Millions increased its ticket prices from $1 to $2 in 2017 and from $2 to $5 in April of this year.",

    "summary": "The new tourist tax imposes an 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship's passengers to address climate change threats to Hawaii.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge's ruling clears the way for Hawaii to include cruise ship passengers in a new tourist tax to help pay for the impacts of climate change, a levy set to go into effect at the start of 2026.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jill A. Otake on Tuesday denied a request seeking to stop officials from enforcing the new law on cruises.",
      "In the nation's first such levy to help cope with a warming planet, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed legislation in May that raises tax revenue to deal with eroding shorelines, wildfires and other climate problems. Officials estimate the tax will generate nearly $100 million annually.",
      "The levy increases rates on hotel room and vacation rental stays but also imposes a new 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship's passengers, starting next year, prorated for the number of days the vessels are in Hawaii ports.",
      "Cruise Lines International Association challenged the tax in a lawsuit, along with a Honolulu company that provides supplies and provisions to cruise ships and tour businesses out of Kauai and the Big Island that rely on cruise ship passengers. Among their arguments is that the new law violates the Constitution by taxing cruise ships for the privilege of entering Hawaii ports.",
      "Plaintiff lawyers also argued that the tax would hurt tourism by making cruises more expensive. The lawsuit notes the law authorizes counties to collect an additional 3% surcharge, bringing the total to 14% of prorated fares.",
      "\"Cruise tourism generates nearly $1 billion in total economic impact for Hawaii and supports thousands of local jobs, and we remain focused on ensuring that success continues on a lawful, sustainable foundation,\" association spokesperson Jim McCarthy said in a statement.",
      "According to court records, the plaintiffs will appeal. They asked the judge to grant an injunction pending an appeal and requested a ruling by Saturday afternoon, given that the law takes effect Jan. 1.",
      "Hawaii will continue to defend the law, which requires cruise operators to pay their share of transient accommodation tax to address climate change threats to the state, state Attorney General Anne Lopez said in a statement.",
      "The U.S. government intervened in the case, calling the tax a \"scheme to extort American citizens and businesses solely to benefit Hawaii\" in conflict with federal law.",

    "title": "We asked experts to rate the U.S. economy in 2025. Here's what they said.",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/economists-grade-us-economy-2025/",
    "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 14:27:44 -0500",
    "summary": "The economy remained on track this year, defying the gloomiest predictions. That doesn't mean Americans are thrilled with how things are going.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy has been tested by a barrage of challenges in 2025, from sharply higher U.S. tariffs that drove up inflation and rattled consumer confidence, to rising unemployment amid a slowdown in hiring.",
      "Despite those headwinds, the economy has continued to chug along, defying early-year warnings from some economists that the nation could be headed for a recession or that the Trump administration's tariffs would reignite runaway inflation.",
      "The biggest surprise of the year has been the economy's durability, according to experts. Economic growth has surged\u00a0to its fastest pace in two years, inflation has risen less than feared and the stock market has climbed to\u00a0fresh highs.",
      "\"This has been another year of resilience for the economy,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Michael Pearce told CBS News. \"The economy has grown at a pretty steady pace.\"",
      "Yet Pearce hastens to add that the economy, although it has navigated some tricky waters, is \"not spectacular\" as the year comes to a close, assigning it a grade of a B or B-. Other experts who spoke with CBS News also graded the economy in the B range.",
      "That may strike many consumers as generous. Three-quarters of Americans surveyed by CBS News earlier this month said they would give the U.S. economy a C, D or F, while just 25% assigned it an A or a B. Recent consumer confidence surveys also indicate that many Americans are downbeat about the economy, mainly due to stubbornly high prices.",
      "The disconnect partly reflects the differences in how consumers and economists tend to judge the nation's economic performance. While financial pros tend to focus on macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, inflation and unemployment, consumers are more likely to assess the economy based on pocketbook issues like food prices and health care costs \u2014 both of which have risen in 2025.",
      "The White House said the economy has improved from last year under former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"Although much work remains, the American economy is leaps... better now than it was a year ago under Joe Biden: cooled inflation, private-sector job growth, cheaper essentials like gas, lower taxes, and trillions in investments flowing in to make and hire in America,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "He added, \"As President Trump's economic agenda continues taking effect, Americans can rest assured that 2026 will be even better.\"",
      "A turbulent year",
      "The economy has been marked by pronounced volatility and uncertainty in 2025, ranging from the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs to an\u00a0alarming downturn in growth\u00a0in the first three months of the year.",
      "\"It's rare that we've seen a president come in and, with a unified Congress, have such immediate impacts on the economy,\" Pearce said. \"Not all of those are impacting the economy right away, but we've seen a lot of those policies generate a lot of uncertainty.\"",
      "For instance, the Republicans' \"big beautiful bill\" act, signed into law by Mr. Trump on July 4, will likely impact the economy in 2026, with consumers expected to receive juicier tax refunds.",
      "Other effects of the new law could work against some consumers. Perhaps most concerning is the expiration of Affordable Care Act enhanced tax credits, which experts warn will sharply drive up health insurance premiums for millions of Americans.",
      "Meanwhile, it's been a banner year for investors as the boom in artificial intelligence pushed the stock market to a succession of record highs. At the same time, the bullish sentiment on Wall Street has fueled questions about whether a possible\u00a0AI bubble\u00a0could turn to bust if the enormous investment in the technology fails to deliver the promised gains in productivity and corporate profits.",
      "Life on the \"K\"",
      "Economic turmoil often impacts consumer sentiment, making people feel less confident about their finances, economists have long noted. That dynamic has led experts to describe the economy this year as \"K-shaped,\" in which higher-income consumers spend robustly \u2014 thanks in part to the\u00a0strong stock market\u00a0\u2014 even as lower- and middle-income consumers\u00a0pull back.",
      "And it's no wonder. Although inflation has cooled since peaking at a 40-year high in 2022, prices remain elevated, squeezing many Americans and making it hard for them to cover even basic expenses, Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at wealth management firm Janney Montgomery Scott, told CBS News.",
      "It isn't just routine purchases that are straining consumers \u2014 it's also the barriers in the way today of reaching once ordinary financial goals, such as buying a first home, saving for retirement or even just paying off debt, added Chen Zhao, head of economic research at online real estate firm Redfin.",
      "When it comes to homeownership, evidence of that barrier is visible in the median age of first homebuyers today \u2014 that hit 40 this year, a record high, according to the National Association of Realtors. With home values near all-time highs and mortgage rates hovering around 6.3%, many younger Americans are feeling priced out, she said.",
      "\"This situation that we're in right now, where [housing] affordability has gotten to be the worst it's really ever been in recent memory \u2014 and significantly worse than before the pandemic \u2014 it's really unfortunate for the younger generation,\" Zhao said. \"It means delaying the American dream for a lot of folks.\"",
      "In 160 U.S. cities, at least one-fifth of middle-class residents can't afford to live in that area, after factoring in local income levels and price differences, according to Brookings, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Hiring slowdown",
      "Another pressure point is the labor market, where hiring has slowed throughout 2025. The U.S. unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in November, its highest level in four years.",
      "Layoffs also\u00a0jumped to 1.1 million this year through November, up 54% from a year earlier and the highest level since 2020, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "While job seekers are finding it tougher to get a foothold in today's labor market, it's proving particularly challenging for young people, who are facing a decline in job listings and competition from more experienced workers, experts said.",
      "Cooling job growth in the second half of the year is partially a reflection of persistent economic uncertainty, which has led many businesses to throttle hiring. Some businesses are also trimming jobs as they invest in AI, which can perform some tasks previously handled by employees.",
      "\"Any type of uncertainty is going to lead to slower business decisions, whether it's hiring or investment,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS News.",
      "Labor market headwinds in 2025 have prompted the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate three straight times since September. By lowering borrowing costs, the Fed is aiming to encourage businesses to expand and hire.",
      "Slower hiring and rising layoffs could pose a risk to consumer spending, which drives nearly two-thirds of economic activity, economists note.",
      "\"A slower labor market leads to slower income growth, which eventually ends up pulling consumer spending lower,\" Daco said.",
      "Muted tariff impact",
      "One of the biggest economic surprises of 2025 came with President Trump's sweeping tariffs, announced in April on what he termed \"liberation day.\" The plan caused U.S. stocks to plunge\u00a0and stoked fears that the levies would reignite inflation.",
      "Yet despite such concerns, tariffs so far have had a more muted impact on inflation than initially feared. That's partly because U.S. companies, which pay the import duties to the federal government, stockpiled goods before the tariffs kicked in and absorbed some of the costs rather than passing them on to consumers.",
      "\"Generally speaking, the economy outperformed expectations in the face of several large supply shocks,\" Daco said.",
      "Still, inflation remains sticky. The Consumer Price Index, which stood at 3% in January, remains near the same level as of November. Oxford Economics' Pearce estimates that the stepped-up import duties added 0.5 percentage points to the nation's inflation rate this year.",

      "Rising energy costs are adding to the affordability issues facing millions of U.S. consumers, with nonprofit group PowerLines recently estimating that more than 100 million Americans could see heftier bills this year because of rate hikes.",
      "The average household is expected to pay an average of $995 on home heating this winter, a 9.2% increase from last year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association (NEADA). Those who use electricity for heating were projected to see an even steeper jump of 12.2%, with the average bill swelling from $1,090 to $1,233, the group found.",
      "\"Millions of households are being pushed deeper into utility debt and closer to shutoffs simply because they cannot afford to keep their homes warm,\" Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, said in a statement.",

Audits are performed by certified home energy auditors, according to energystar.gov. Look to local government agencies or your utility company for home energy assessment tips.",
      "Tackle obvious leaks. Justin Castronova, a lead inspector at First Choice Inspectors in Illinois, told CBS News consumer correspondent Ash-har Quraishi that the best place to start is with doors and windows. Castronova recommends using caulk to seal gaps, maintaining weather stripping for doors and windows, and using spray foam around electrical outlets (make sure to turn off your power first).",
      "Invest in energy-efficient appliances. That can save you from $10 to $50 a month, depending on the size of the appliance and how many you have, Castronova said.",

    "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 08:03:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Department of Homeland Security says it's replacing its longstanding lottery system for H-1B work visas with an approach that prioritizes skilled, higher-paid foreign workers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday it was replacing its longstanding lottery system for H-1B work visas with a new approach that prioritizes skilled, higher-paid foreign workers.",
      "The change follows a series of actions by the Trump administration aimed at reshaping a visa program that critics say has become a pipeline for overseas workers willing to work for lower pay, but supporters say drives innovation.",
      "\"The existing random selection process of H-1B registrations was exploited and abused by U.S. employers who were primarily seeking to import foreign workers at lower wages than they would pay American workers,\" said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Matthew Tragesser.",
      "Earlier this year, President Trump signed a proclamation imposing a $100,000 annual H-1B visa fee on highly skilled workers, which was challenged in court.",
      "At least one federal judge has upheld it, French news agency AFP reports. In a 56-page opinion Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell wrote that the president has \"broad statutory authority\" to address \"a problem he perceives to be a matter of economic and national security.\"",
      "At least two additional suits against the fee are ongoing.",
      "The president also rolled out a $1 million \"gold card\" visa as a pathway to U.S. citizenship for wealthy individuals.",
      "A press release announcing the new rule says it is \"in line with other key changes the administration has made, such as the Presidential Proclamation that requires employers to pay an additional $100,000 per visa as a condition of eligibility.\"",
      "Historically, H-1B visas have been awarded through a lottery system. This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient, with more than 10,000 visas approved, followed by Tata Consultancy Services, Microsoft, Apple and Google. California has the highest concentration of H-1B workers.",
      "The new system will \"implement a weighted selection process that will increase the probability that H-1B visas are allocated to higher-skilled and higher-paid\" foreign workers, according to Tuesday's press release. It will go into effect Feb. 27, 2026, and will apply to the upcoming H-1B cap registration season.",
      "Supporters of the H-1B program say it is an important pathway to hiring healthcare workers and educators. They say it drives innovation and economic growth in the U.S. and allows employers to fill jobs in specialized fields.",
      "Critics argue that the visas often go to entry-level positions rather than senior roles requiring specialized skills. While the program is intended to prevent wage suppression or the displacement of U.S. workers, critics say companies can pay lower wages by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even when the workers hired have more experience.",
      "The number of new visas issued annually is capped at 65,000, plus an additional 20,000 for people with a master's degree or higher.",

    "summary": "A prominent California farmer was arrested in the shooting death of his estranged wife in a remote mountain community in Arizona, authorities said.",
    "story": [
      "A prominent California farmer was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of murder in the shooting death of his estranged wife in a remote mountain community in Arizona, the Navajo County Sheriff's Office said.",
      "Michael Abatti, 63, was arrested in El Centro, Calif. and booked into jail on a first-degree murder charge. He is awaiting extradition to Arizona.",
      "Authorities say they believe he drove to Arizona on Nov. 20 and fatally shot Kerri Ann Abatti, 59, before returning home to California. She was found dead in her family's tree-shrouded vacation home in Pinetop, Arizona, where she moved after splitting with her husband.",
      "An attorney for Michael Abatti didn't immediately respond to an email and text message seeking comment.",
      "Authorities searched his home in far Southern California on Dec. 2 as part of the investigation into his wife's death.",
      "A Navajo County grand jury indicted Michael Tuesday and deputies got an arrest warrant for him, CBS Phoenix affiliate KPHO-TV reported.",
      "El Centro is a city of 44,000 people just minutes from the Mexican border in the crop-rich Imperial Valley, which is the biggest user of Colorado River water and known for growing leafy greens, melons and forage crops.",
      "Michael Abatti comes from a long line of farmers in the region bordering Arizona, and his grandfather, an Italian immigrant, was among the region's early settlers. His father, Ben, helped start the Imperial Valley Vegetable Growers Association, and the Abatti name is known throughout the region and tied to farming enterprises, scholarship funds and leadership in local boards and groups.",
      "Michael Abatti has grown onions, broccoli, cantaloupes and other crops in the Imperial Valley and served on the board of the powerful Imperial Irrigation District from 2006 to 2010.",
      "Michael and Kerri Abatti were married in 1992 and had three children.",
      "Kerri Abatti is a descendant of one of the first Latter-day Saints families to settle Pinetop in the 1880s. The community, located 190 miles northeast of Phoenix in the White Mountains, was briefly called Penrodville after Kerri's forbearers before adopting the Pinetop name.",
      "The couple split in 2023 and Kerri Abatti filed for divorce in proceedings that were pending in California at the time of her death.",
      "The Abattis were sparring over finances, with Kerri telling the court the couple had lived an upper-class lifestyle during more than three decades of marriage. They owned a large home in California, a vacation home in Pinetop and ranch land in Wyoming and vacationed in Switzerland, Italy and Hawaii while sending their children to private school, she said.",
      "After the split, Kerri was granted $5,000 a month in temporary spousal support but last year asked for an increase to $30,000, saying she couldn't maintain her standard of living as she quit her job as a bookkeeper and office manager for the family farm in 1999 to stay home with the couple's three children. Kerri, who previously held a real estate license in Arizona, also asked for an additional $100,000 in attorney's fees, court filings show.",
      "\"I am barely scraping by each month, am handling all of the manual labor on our large property in Arizona and continuing its upkeep,\" she wrote in court filings earlier this year, adding she was living near her elderly parents. Kerri said she also needed to buy a newer car because her 2011 vehicle had more than 280,000 miles on it and sorely needed repairs.",
      "Michael Abatti said in a legal filing that he couldn't afford the increase after two bad farming years took a toll on his monthly income. He said European shifts in crop-buying to support war-plagued Ukrainian farmers and rising shipping costs were to blame along with an unusually cold and wet winter.",
      "He said in mid-2024 it cost $1,000 to grow an acre of wheat that he could sell for $700 and that he was receiving about $22,000 a month to run the farm as the business struggled to pay its creditors in full.",
      "\"The income available at this time does not warrant any increase in the amount to which the parties stipulated, let alone an increase to $30,000 per month,\" Lee Hejmanowski, Michael Abatti's family law attorney, wrote in court papers.",
      "Days later, Michael Abatti agreed to increase temporary spousal support payments to $6,400 a month, court filings show.",
      "He studied in the agricultural business management program at Colorado State University in Fort Collins before returning to California, according to a 2023 book about water issues written by his college friend, Craig Morgan, titled \"The Morality of Deceit.\"",
      "In 2009, Michael Abatti almost died from an infection caused by a flesh-eating bacteria and was hospitalized and placed in a medically induced coma for treatment, Morgan wrote in the book.",

    "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 19:48:03 -0500",
    "summary": "The Food and Drug Administration has approved a pill version of the weight-loss drug Wegovy.",
    "story": [
      "Regulators at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday gave the green light to a pill version of the blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy, the first daily oral medication to treat obesity.",
      "The FDA's approval handed drugmaker Novo Nordisk an edge over rival Eli Lilly in the race to market an obesity pill. Lilly's oral drug, orforglipron, is still under review.",
      "Both pills are GLP-1 drugs that work like widely used injectables to mimic a natural hormone that controls appetite and feelings of fullness.",
      "In recent years, Novo Nordisk's injectable Wegovy and Lilly's Zepbound have revolutionized obesity treatment globally and in the U.S., where 100 million people have the chronic disease.",
      "The Wegovy pills are expected to be available within weeks, company officials said. Availability of oral pills to treat obesity could expand the booming market for obesity treatments by broadening access and reducing costs, experts said.",
      "\"I do think that having an oral option would be really helpful, one for improving access, but also as another tool that we can offer patients,\" Dr. Reshmi Srinath, director of the Mount Sinai Weight and Metabolism Management Program in New York, told CBS News.",
      "About 1 in 8 Americans have used injectable GLP-1 drugs, according to a survey from KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group. But many more have trouble affording the costly shots.",
      "\"There's an entire demographic that can benefit from the pills,\" said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, a Massachusetts General Hospital obesity expert. \"For me, it's not just about who gets it across the finish line first. It's about having these options available to patients.\"",
      "The Novo Nordisk obesity pill contains 25 milligrams of semaglutide. That's the same ingredient in injectables Wegovy and Ozempic and in Rybelsus, a lower-dose pill approved to treat diabetes in 2019.",
      "How much weight did people lose?",
      "In a clinical trial, participants who took oral Wegovy lost 13.6% of their total body weight on average over about 15 months, compared with a 2.2% loss if they took a placebo, or dummy pill. That's nearly the same as injectable Wegovy, with an average weight loss of about 15%.",
      "Chris Mertens, 35, a pediatric lung doctor in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, joined the Novo Nordisk trial in 2022 and lost about 40 pounds using the Wegovy pill.",
      "\"It was a great option, especially when I know I had tried to do things [in] what people may term 'the right way,' with diet and exercise alone,\" Mertens told CBS News.",
      "The daily medication worked to decrease his appetite and invasive thoughts of food, he said. \"If there were days where I missed a meal, I almost didn't realize it.\"",
      "Before he lost weight, Mertens said, \"I was also seeing effects with things like my blood pressure, with one of my doctors telling me I might need to start medicine for my blood pressure because it was getting high enough, as well as cholesterol being elevated.\"",
      "Participants in the\u00a0clinical trial who took the highest dose of Lilly's orforglipron lost 11.2% of their total body weight on average over nearly 17 months, compared with a 2.1% loss in those who took a placebo.",
      "Both pills resulted in less weight loss than the average achieved with Lilly's Zepbound, or tirzepatide, which targets two gut hormones, GLP-1 and GIP, and led to a 21% average weight loss.",
      "All the GLP-1 drugs, oral or injectable, have similar side effects, including nausea and diarrhea.",
      "Both daily pills promise convenience, but the Wegovy pill must be taken with a sip of water in the morning on an empty stomach, with a 30-minute break before eating or drinking.",
      "That's because Novo Nordisk had to design the pill in a way that prevented the drug from being broken down in the stomach before it could be absorbed by the bloodstream. The drugmaker added an ingredient that protects the medication for about 30 minutes in the gut and makes it easier to take effect.",
      "By contrast, Lilly's orforglipron has no dosing restrictions. That drug is being considered under the FDA's new priority voucher program aimed at cutting drug approval times. A decision is expected by spring.",
      "How much will the Wegovy pills cost?",
      "Producing pills is generally cheaper than making drugs delivered via injections, so the cost for the new oral medications could be lower. The Trump administration earlier this year said officials had worked with drugmakers to negotiate lower prices for the GLP-1 drugs, which can cost upwards of $1,000 a month.",
      "The company said the starting dose would be available for $149 per month from some providers. Additional information on cost will be available in January.",
      "It's not clear whether daily pills or weekly injections will be preferred by patients. Although some patients dislike needles, others don't seem to mind the weekly injections, obesity experts said. Mertens turned to injectable Zepbound when he regained weight after the end of the Wegovy pill clinical trial.",
      "He said he liked the discipline of the daily pill.",
      "\"It was a little bit of an intentional routine and a reminder of today I'm taking this so that I know my choices are going to be affected for the day,\" he said.Dr. Angela Fitch, an obesity expert and chief medical officer of knownwell, a health care company, said whatever the format, the biggest benefit will be in making weight-loss medications more widely accessible and affordable.",
      "\"It's all about the price,\" she said. \"Just give me a drug at $100 a month that is relatively effective.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is set to resume garnishing the wages of some student loan borrowers who are in default beginning in early 2026, and a leading advocacy group for student loan borrowers is raising concerns.",
      "Wage garnishment notices are expected to go out to about 1,000 borrowers in default beginning the week of Jan. 7, according to The Associated Press, with the number of notices expected to increase on a monthly basis after that.",
      "The Education Department said in a statement to The AP that it would begin involuntary collection \"only after student and parent borrowers have been provided sufficient notice and opportunity to repay their loans.\"",
      "It was not immediately clear how much of their wages those in default could see garnished.",
      "\"At a time when families across the country are struggling with stagnant wages and an affordability crisis, this Administration's decision to garnish wages from defaulted student loan borrowers is cruel, unnecessary, and irresponsible,\" said Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel of the student borrower advocacy group Protect Borrowers. \"As millions of borrowers sit on the precipice of default, this Administration is using its self-inflicted limited resources to seize borrowers' wages instead of defending borrowers' right to affordable payments.\"",
      "Federal student loan borrowers are considered in default after missing payments for at least 270 days. Borrowers in default must be given at least 30 days' notice before their wages can be garnished.",
      "Student loan repayments were paused, with no interest accruing, by the first Trump administration in March 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. After several extensions under the Biden administration, payments were required to resume in Oct. 2023 after Congress blocked further extensions.",
      "In May of this year, the Education Department signaled it would move to resume wage garnishment, among other forms of involuntary collection, for those in default.",
      "More than 5 million borrowers were in default when the Education Department said in May it would begin involuntary collections through the Treasury Department's offset program, which uses measures such as withholding tax refunds, federal salaries and Social Security benefits. The department predicted 4 million more could be in default in the months that followed, which would mean nearly 25% of all student loan borrowers would be in default.",
      "Former President Joe Biden attempted to forgive student loan debt for tens of millions of people during his term, but the effort was repeatedly\u00a0rejected by courts, including a\u00a02023 ruling by the Supreme Court. The Biden administration was able to wipe out student loan debt for more than 5 million borrowers through\u00a0other forgiveness programs.",
      "In May's announcement, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said, \"Going forward, the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Treasury, will shepherd the student loan program responsibly and according to the law, which means helping borrowers return to repayment \u2014 both for the sake of their own financial health and our nation's economic outlook,\" she said in a statement Monday.",
      "\"There will not be any mass loan forgiveness,\" the announcement said.",
      "The \"big, beautiful bill\" that President Trump\u00a0signed into law on July 4\u00a0also overhauled the federal student loan system, phasing out several repayment plans, including the SAVE, PAYE, IBR and ICR, capping the amount individuals can borrow for higher education, and eliminating deferment provisions for borrowers facing economic hardship.",

    "summary": "Job listings for store Santas have plunged in recent years as more families shop online and retailers look to contain costs, a new analysis found.",
    "story": [
      "As if donning an itchy red suit and entertaining kids all day weren't a tough enough gig, the nation's professional Santa Clauses face another cheer-sapping challenge this holiday season: getting a job.",
      "Job listings for store Santas are down 35% this year, compared with 2024, according to Revelio Labs. Indeed, the number of postings at malls, stores and other outlets has fallen sharply since 2022, the workforce research firm found.",
      "The reasons: Employers are cutting budgets, more malls are closing their doors, and many parents these days choose to avoid the crowds \u2014 and the experience of plopping an unsuspecting toddler on a store Santa's lap \u2014 in favor of online shopping.",
      "The drop in Santa job postings comes amid generally soft holiday-season hiring this year as retailers look to contain costs. The nation's unemployment rate surged to 4.6% in November, the highest in more than four years.",
      "The news isn't all bad for Santa wannabes. Although fewer places are hiring, pay is improving \u2014 the median hourly wage for Santa jobs is now $25, up from $21.89 in 2022, Revelio found.",
      "Then again, employers want only the most qualified candidates. Roughly 70% of listings for store Santas this year require a real beard, according to the firm, up from only 14% three years ago.",
      "\"Economists call this a composition effect: The average salary is changing, not because the actual pay is rising, but because of who's left in the hiring pool,\" Revelio said. \"As employers require real beards for most positions, they're hiring only from the higher-paid tier. Average wages climb, but it's not a story of rising pay. It's a shrinking labor market dressed up as good news.\"",

      "Instacart said Monday that it would halt the use of an AI-powered tool that allowed retailers to charge customers different prices for identical items on the grocery delivery platform.",
      "\"Effective immediately, Instacart is ending all item price tests on our platform,\" an Instacart spokesperson told CBS News in an email statement. \"Retailers will no longer be able to use Eversight technology to run item price tests on Instacart.\"",
      "The announcement comes after a recent investigation by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, a nonprofit advocacy group, found evidence that retailers such as Albertsons, Costco, Kroger, Safeway and Sprouts Farmers Market were testing the AI pricing system.",
      "The organizations based their findings on data gathered from more than 400 volunteers during online shopping sessions in September. During one test conducted for a Safeway in Seattle, the price for a box of Wheat Thins varied by as much as 23%.",
      "\"Once we pulled back the curtain on Instacart's hidden pricing experiments, the company had no choice but to close the lab,\" Groundwork Collaborative's executive director Lindsay Owens said in a statement on Monday.",
      "The investigation also found\u00a0that Instacart was conducting algorithmic pricing tests using product information from Target. The retail giant told CBS News it has no commercial relationship with Instacart and that it was not involved in the pilot.",
      "Instacart acquired Eversight, an AI-enabled pricing platform, in 2022, and began offering pricing software to retail companies in 2023.",
      "Instacart claims the AI pricing tests did not include customers' personal, demographic, or user-level behavioral characteristics. The decision to end the use of its pricing tool was made in response to feedback from Instacart customers, a company spokesperson said Monday.",
      "Retailers will continue to set their own prices on the delivery website, and they may still offer different prices at different brick-and-mortar locations, Instacart said Monday in a blog\u00a0post.",
      "Reuters reported\u00a0on Dec. 17 that the Federal Trade Commission was probing Instacart over its AI pricing tests. The FTC declined to comment on the report, but said in a statement that it was \"disturbed by what we have read in the press about Instacart's alleged pricing practices.\"",
      "The FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Instacart shelving its AI pricing technology.",

    "summary": "Concerns about inflation, tariffs and politics weighed on consumer sentiment in December, The Conference Board said.",
    "story": [
      "American consumers in December remained downbeat about the state of the economy, a new survey shows.",
      "The Conference Board, a nonprofit group representing businesses, said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell 3.8 points to 89.1 in December, from November's upwardly revised reading of 92.9. The latest figures are close to the group's reading in April, when President Trump announced tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"Despite an upward revision in November related to the end of the shutdown, consumer confidence fell again in December and remained well below this year's January peak. Four of five components of the overall index fell, while one was at a level signaling notable weakness,\" Dana Peterson, chief Economist at The Conference Board, said in a statement.",
      "A measure of Americans' short-term expectations for their income, business conditions and the job market remained stable at 70.7, but still well below 80, the marker that can signal a recession ahead. It was the 11th consecutive month that reading has come in under 80.",
      "Consumers' assessments of their current economic situation tumbled 9.5 points to 116.8. Write-in responses to the survey showed that prices and inflation remained consumers' biggest concern, along with tariffs.",
      "Perceptions of the job market also declined this month. The conference board's survey reported that 26.7% of consumers said jobs were \"plentiful,\" down from 28.2% in November. Also, 20.8% of consumers said jobs were \"hard to get,\" up from 20.1% last month.",
      "\"Consumers' write-in responses on factors affecting the economy continued to be led by references to prices and inflation, tariffs and trade and politics,\" Peterson said. \"However, December saw increases in mentions of immigration, war and topics related to personal finances \u2014 including interest rates, taxes and income, banks, and insurance.",
      "Americans remain generally sour about the economy, with most grading the nation's economic performance this year as either a \"C\" or \"D\" or worse, according to a\u00a0recent CBS News poll.",
      "\"Consumer confidence continued to tumble at the end of the year, as higher prices, a weaker labor market and the waning impact of the government shutdown weighed on household perceptions of the economy,\" Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at investment adviser Oxford Economics, said in a report.",
      "\"Consumers' perceptions of the current state of the economy are at their lowest point in five years,\" he added.",
      "Consumers still spending",
      "Consumer sentiment continued to ebb last month even as the economy accelerated. Federal data released on Tuesday showed the nation's gross domestic product expanded at a blistering 4.3% annual pace in the third quarter, up from 3.8% in the previous quarter and the strongest rate of growth in two years.",
      "\"The latest GDP data confirm that even though consumer confidence is slipping, consumers are still spending,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, said in a report. \"The disconnect must mean that incomes are rising briskly. \u00a0But the payroll report says incomes are slowing. So the data are not sending a clear message right now.\"",
      "Consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of economic activity.",
      "Last week, the Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy gained a healthy 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October. The unemployment rate rose to 4.6% last month, the highest since 2021. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average 35,000 a month, compared to 71,000 in the year ended in March.",

The latest figure, released by the Commerce Department, also reflects a healthy jump from the second quarter's annualized growth of 3.8%.",
      "An acceleration in consumer spending, along with an upswing in exports and government outlays, helped propel economic growth in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said. Despite widespread public concerns about the economy, consumers are continuing to open their wallets, government data shows.",
      "\"While worries surrounding the jobs market, tariffs and inflation continue to swirl, the economy continues to defy its doubters by chugging higher,\" said Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, in an email.",
      "Exports grew at an 8.8% rate, while imports, which subtract from GDP, fell another 4.7%.",
      "Inflation ticks higher",
      "Although GDP growth was surprisingly strong, inflation ticked higher from the previous quarter. Tuesday's data shows that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, a key barometer of inflation and consumer spending, rose at a 2.8% annual pace in the third quarter, compared with 2.1% between April and June.",
      "Core PCE, which excludes the more volatile food and energy categories, grew 2.9%, up from 2.6% in the previous quarter. Both are above the Federal Reserve's annual inflation target of 2%.",
      "The economy has shown resilience this year. While inflation remains higher than the Fed would like, consumer prices have not risen as much as many economists initially feared after President Trump unveiled tariffs earlier this year. Some retailers have cushioned the blow for shoppers by absorbing the added costs, while others have passed them on through higher prices.",
      "The labor market remains a weak spot, with employment numbers showing a slowdown in hiring during the second half of 2025. In November, the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, the highest since 2021.",
      "Will the momentum last?",

    "summary": "Analysts point to rising geopolitical tensions and softer monetary policy as driving the year-end surge.",
    "story": [
      "Gold prices soared above $4,400 on Monday to reach a new all-time high, as analysts pointed to rising geopolitical tensions and softer monetary policy as key drivers of the surge.",
      "The price of the precious metal traded at\u00a0 $4,475 per ounce at 4 p.m. EDT after hitting a high of $4,477 per ounce earlier in the day. The asset has risen more than 70% since the start of this year. Gold is viewed as a safe-haven investment and typically acts as a hedge against inflation.",
      "\"The metals trade has been strong all year, and particularly for gold,\" Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, told CBS News. \"As its fundamentals remain intact, gold digested its recent rally to all-time highs quite well.\"",
      "Silver prices were also rallying on Monday, reaching $69 by 4 p.m. EDT. The metal is up 130% since the start of the year.",
      "Both gold and silver are on pace to reach all-time closing highs today, according to analysts. The rally comes amid expectations for a strong finish in the\u00a0stock market, where tech gains have helped boost performance.",
      "What's driving the surge in gold prices?",
      "Investors are moving money into gold due to a swirl of geopolitical factors, analysts note.",
      "Bond yields around the world floated higher at the same time major global currencies like the yen weakened, Alex Kuptsikevich, the chief market analyst at online brokerage platform FxPro, said in a statement. The combination is reviving interest in the so-called \"debasement trade\" \u2014 a strategy of moving money out of fiat currencies in favor of hard assets like gold, he noted.",
      "Other geopolitical risks, including the U.S. blockade of oil supplies from Venezuela and Ukraine's attack on a Russian shadow fleet tanker in the Mediterranean, were also pushing investors toward gold on Monday, Kuptsikevich added.",
      "Softer monetary policy may also be driving the upswing in gold prices this year, with investors more bullish after three consecutive rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Many on Wall Street expect the central bank to continue to ease monetary policy in 2026, while President Trump is set to nominate a new central bank chief before Fed chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.",
      "\"The latest leg of the rally has been driven by the market pricing in an increasingly gold-friendly 2026 outlook, with lower rates and a potentially softer dollar acting as tailwinds for the bullion,\" said Trevor Yates, senior investment analyst at Global X ETFs, a New York-based investment company.",
      "Central banks in multiple countries are also buying more gold, Yates added, helping drive up the asset's price.",
      "Demand for the precious metal from monetary authorities like the National Bank of Poland has risen in recent months, according to the World Gold Council, a trade association for the gold industry. Central bank gold purchases through October totaled 254 tonnes, a slower pace than the previous three years, the World Gold Council said earlier this month.",
      "Yates said central bank holdings are still far below their historical levels.",
      "What's the forecast for gold in 2026?",
      "Despite investor exuberance this year, the gold rally may not continue its run in 2026, according to Capital Economics. The investment advisory firm predicted in a Monday research note that the price of the precious metal could fall to $3,500 by the end of next year \u2014 and that the drop will act as a drag on silver prices.",
      "\"So goes gold, so goes silver: the end of the speculative boom in the former will also kill off the rally in the latter,\" Capital Economics said in the research note.",
      "Other analysts hold a more optimistic outlook. Yates said he expects lower interest rates and a potentially weak U.S. dollar to help boost the case for hard assets like silver into next year.",
      "\"Overall, we continue to believe we are in the early innings of a broader precious metals rally and remain constructive on both gold and silver,\" he said.",

    "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 07:39:06 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Communications Commission says it's banning new foreign-made drones, a move that will keep new Chinese-made drones out of the U.S. market.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Federal Communications Commission on Monday said it would ban new foreign-made drones, a move that will keep new Chinese-made drones such as those from DJI and Autel out of the U.S. market.",
      "The announcement came a year after Congress passed a defense bill that raised national security concerns about Chinese-made drones, which have become a dominant player in the U.S., widely used in farming, mapping, law enforcement and filmmaking.",
      "The bill called for stopping the two Chinese companies from selling new drones in the U.S. if a review found they posed a risk to American national security. The deadline for the review was Dec. 23.",
      "The FCC said Monday the review found that all drones and critical components produced in foreign countries, not just by the two Chinese companies, posed \"unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States and to the safety and security of U.S. persons.\" But it said specific drones or components would be exempt if the Pentagon or Department of Homeland Security determined they didn't pose such risks.",
      "The FCC cited upcoming major events, such as the 2026 World Cup, America250 celebrations and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, as reasons to address potential drone threats posed by \"criminals, hostile foreign actors, and terrorists.\"",
      "Michael Robbins, president and chief executive officer of AUVSI, the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International, said in a statement that the industry group welcomes the decision. He said it's time for the U.S. not only to reduce its dependence on China but build its own drones.",
      "\"Recent history underscores why the United States must increase domestic drone production and secure its supply chains,\" Robbins said, citing Beijing's willingness to restrict critical supplies such as rare earth magnets to serve its strategic interests.",
      "A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry, Lin Jian, said Tuesday that Beijing opposed the U.S. setting up \"discriminatory\" lists and urged the Trump administration to \"correct its wrong practices\" and provide a fair environment for Chinese companies, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "DJI said it was disappointed by the FCC decision. \"While DJI was not singled out, no information has been released regarding what information was used by the Executive Branch in reaching its determination,\" it said in a statement.",
      "\"Concerns about DJI's data security have not been grounded in evidence and instead reflect protectionism, contrary to the principles of an open market,\" the company said.",
      "In Texas, Gene Robinson has a fleet of nine DJI drones that he uses for law enforcement training and forensic analyses. He said the new restrictions would hurt him and many others who have come to rely on the Chinese drones because of their versatility, high performance and affordable prices.",
      "But he said he understands the decision and lamented that the U.S. had outsourced the manufacturing to China. \"Now, we are paying the price,\" Robinson said. \"To get back to where we had the independence, there will be some growing pains. We need to suck it up, and let's not have it happen again.\"",
      "Also in Texas, Arthur Erickson, chief executive officer and co-founder of the drone-making company Hylio, said the departure of DJI would provide much-needed room for American companies like his to grow. New investments are pouring in to help him ramp up production of spray drones, which farmers use to fertilize their fields, and it will bring down prices, Erickson said.",
      "But he also called it \"crazy\" and \"unexpected\" that the FCC should expand the scope to all foreign-made drones and drone components. \"The way it's written is a blanket statement,\" Erickson said. \"There's a global allied supply chain. I hope they will clarify that.\"",

    "summary": "Mercedes-Benz USA and parent company Daimler AG agreed to settle allegations the automaker secretly installed devices in hundreds of thousands of vehicles to pass emission tests.",
    "story": [
      "Mercedes-Benz USA and parent company Daimer AG have agreed to pay $149.6 million to settle allegations that the automaker secretly installed devices in hundreds of thousands of vehicles to pass emission tests, a coalition of attorneys general announced Monday.",
      "According to the coalition, between 2008 and 2016 the German automaker equipped more than 211,000 diesel passenger cars and vans with software devices that optimized emission controls during tests but reduced the controls during normal operations. The devices enabled vehicles to far exceed legal limits for nitrogen oxides, a pollutant that can cause respiratory illnesses and contributes to smog.",
      "The states alleged that Mercedes installed the devices because it couldn't reach design and performance goals such as fuel efficiency while complying with emissions standards. The automaker allegedly concealed the devices from state and federal regulators and the public while marketing the vehicles as \"environmentally friendly\" and compliant with emissions standards.",
      "The agreement is still subject to court approval.",
      "Daimler AG and Mercedes-Benz USA already agreed in 2020 to pay $1.5 billion to the U.S. government and California state regulators to resolve the emissions cheating allegations.",
      "Mercedes-Benz issued a statement saying the deal announced Monday will resolve all remaining legal proceedings tied to diesel emissions in the United States, but the company still considers the accusations unfounded and denies any liability. The automaker has made \"sufficient provisions\" for the cost of the settlement, the statement said.",
      "Fifty attorneys general, including the attorneys general of the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, made up the coalition announced Monday. California was not part of the group.",
      "The settlement calls for the automaker to pay the attorneys general $120 million with another $29 million payment suspended and potentially waived pending completion of a consumer relief program.",
      "That effort will extend to the roughly 40,000 vehicles with the devices that hadn't been repaired or permanently removed from the road by Aug. 1, 2023. The owners of those vehicles would get $2,000 per vehicle if they install approved emissions modification software and an extended warranty.",
      "The settlement also calls for Mercedes to comply with reporting requirements and refrain from any further unfair or deceptive marketing or sale of diesel vehicles.",
      "Volkswagen also ended up paying $2.8 billion to settle a criminal case due to emissions cheating.",

    "published": "Mon, 22 Dec 2025 15:21:16 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge has approved a preliminary agreement for a class action lawsuit requiring Aetna to cover fertility treatments for same-sex couples as they do with heterosexual couples.",
    "story": [
      "Like many young girls, Mara Berton and June Higginbotham both knew from an early age they wanted families and to become mothers. But as lesbians, they were excluded from accessing the same fertility treatment insurance benefits offered to heterosexual peers.",
      "Instead, like many other same-sex couples, Berton and Higginbotham, who live in California, had to pay $45,000 out of pocket to conceive while heterosexual colleagues with the same insurance plan had many of those costs covered.",
      "\"We knew it wasn't right,\" Berton said in an exclusive interview with CalMatters. She joined a class action lawsuit challenging the policy. \"What we're fighting for is about family building and having kids ... It was really important to both of us, I think, that other couples not have to do this.\"",
      "Last week, in a landmark settlement, U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of California Haywood Gilliam Jr. approved a preliminary agreement for the class action lawsuit requiring Aetna to cover fertility treatments for same-sex couples \u2014 like artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization \u2014 as they do with heterosexual couples. It is the first case requiring a health insurer to apply this policy nationally across all of its enrollees. An estimated 2.8 million LGBTQ members will benefit, including 91,000 Californians.",
      "Under the settlement, Aetna will also pay at least $2 million in damages to California-based members who qualify. Those who may be eligible must submit a claim by June 29, 2026.",
      "\"I truly hope that this is the first of many insurers to change their policy,\" said Alison Tanner, senior litigation counsel for reproductive rights and health at the National Women's Law Center. \"We were looking at that as an issue of inequality \u2014 that folks who were in same-sex relationships were being treated differently.\"",
      "Roughly 9 million additional Californians will soon have access to mandated fertility benefits under a new law taking effect in January. The law applies to state-regulated plans \u2014 which Aetna is not in this case \u2014 and amends the definition of infertility to include same-sex couples and single people.",
      "Previously, Aetna's policy required enrollees to engage in six to 12 months of \"unprotected heterosexual sexual intercourse\" without conceiving before qualifying for fertility benefits, according to the class action complaint. The policy allowed for women \"without a male partner\" to access benefits only after undergoing six to 12 cycles of artificial insemination unsuccessfully depending on age.",
      "Lawyers argued that the policy fundamentally treated LGBTQ members differently and effectively denied them access to the benefit, which can be prohibitively expensive for many people.",
      "In an email, Aetna spokesperson Phillip Blando said the plan provides infertility benefits in accordance with each member's plan, coverage rules and applicable law.",
      "\"Aetna is committed to equal access to infertility coverage and reproductive health coverage for all its members, and we will continue to strive toward improving access to services for our entire membership,\" Blando said.",
      "Berton, who was the lead plaintiff in the case, said she was blindsided by the policy. She had consulted with a fertility clinic and decided to move forward with donor sperm and artificial insemination, when a representative from Aetna called and said she did not meet the definition of infertility.",
      "She appealed the decision multiple times; she was rejected. The experience felt \"dehumanizing,\" her wife Higginbotham said.",
      "Insurance had dictated Berton attempt 12 rounds of artificial insemination before she would be eligible for benefits. Her doctors recommended no more than four rounds.",
      "Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy director for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, said a policy like that could only be designed to dissuade people from accessing their health benefits. Doctors typically recommend three to four cycles of artificial insemination before IVF, but Tipton said there have also been studies showing it is more efficient and cost effective to go straight to IVF.",
      "In 2023, the society updated its medical definition of infertility to include LGBTQ folks and individuals who don't have partners. They did so in part to stop insurers from denying claims like Berton and Higginbotham's.",
      "\"The driving force was a realization that it takes two kinds of gametes to have kids,\" Tipton said. \"Regardless of the cause of that absence, you have to have access in order to be treated for a fertility issue.\"",
      "Since the definition changed, Tipton said more employers and insurers are covering benefits for LGBTQ folks or single people. They have also leveraged the definition to enact statewide benefits expansions, including California's upcoming fertility benefits mandate.",
      "Berton and Higginbotham said they also worried about running out of donor sperm that matched Higginbotham's Jewish and Native American heritage \u2014 and was limited in supply.",
      "\"I don't feel like your insurance should be involved in those types of decisions and kind of determine your journey,\" Berton said.",
      "The couple pulled together money from family members and decided to proceed even without coverage. After four unsuccessful rounds of intrauterine insemination, they moved on to IVF, partially to give themselves the best chance of conceiving with the donor they chose.",
      "The experience was \"all consuming\" and emotionally difficult as Berton endured hormone injections, egg retrievals and a miscarriage. But today, she and Higginbotham have two healthy twin girls whose favorite thing is to play on the swings and \"take every book off of their shelf\" for their mothers to read.",
      "The couple achieved their family dreams before the lawsuit concluded. Even so, Higginbotham said she hopes the settlement will help other LGBTQ couples across the country.",
      "\"I know people that don't have children, that wanted children, because the stuff isn't covered. I know people that their timeline was delayed and maybe they have fewer kids than they wanted,\" Higginbotham said. \"The settlement is such a huge step forward that is really righting a huge wrong.\"",

      "The action comes two weeks after a federal judge struck down President Trump's executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was \"arbitrary and capricious\" and violates U.S. law.",
      "Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump's Jan. 20\u00a0executive order\u00a0blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.",

    "summary": "The main distillery will be closed for site enhancements, the company said. The pause comes after whiskey production has dropped amid a challenging year.",
    "story": [
      "The maker of Jim Beam bourbon whiskey said it plans to pause production at its main distillery in Kentucky starting Jan. 1.",
      "Jim Beam, which is owned by a U.S. subsidiary of Japan's Suntory Holdings, said in an email to CBS News that its distillery in Clermont, Kentucky, will temporarily halt production \"while we take the opportunity to invest in site enhancements.\" The company plans to keep its James B. Beam campus open for visitors during that time, the company added.",
      "Jim Beam will continue to distill at its Fred B. Noe craft distillery in Clermont and Booker Noe distillery in Boston, Kentucky.",
      "The pause comes amid several challenges in the wine and spirits industry. Americans overall are drinking less, with Gallup finding that the share of U.S. adults who consume alcohol has fallen to 54%, near a 90-year low.",
      "Exports of U.S.-produced spirits fell 9% in the second quarter, partly due to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, according to an October report from the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade group. Exports to Canada were particularly hard hit, declining by 85% during the period, after Canadian retailers pulled U.S. spirits from shelves in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs, the group noted.",
      "Through August, whiskey distillers had produced 55 million fewer proof gallons this year than a year ago, a decline of 28%, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader. A proof gallon is one U.S. gallon of liquid that is 50% proof alcohol.",
      "Whiskey connoisseurs may not have to worry about supplies running low. Kentucky warehouses now hold a record 16.1 million barrels of aging bourbon, according to the Kentucky Distillers' Association. The total \u2014 reported in October \u2014 marks the highest level since the repeal of Prohibition and reflects a 27% increase from 2024, the group said.",
      "The surge in bourbon supplies is partly due to an increase in the number of distillers located in Kentucky, the group said. But the industry is also witnessing a dip in demand due to uncertainty over tariffs, declining exports and shifts in drinking habits, it added.",
      "Bourbon, a type of whiskey, must adhere to U.S. distilling laws to be labeled as such. For instance, the liquor must be aged in new, charred oak containers and the grain recipe must be at least 51% corn, according to whiskey tourism site Bourbon Country.",

    "summary": "A planned Christmas Eve jazz concert at the Kennedy Center has been canceled.",
    "story": [
      "A planned Christmas Eve jazz concert at the Kennedy Center, a holiday tradition at the Washington, D.C., performing arts center dating back more than 20 years, has been canceled.",
      "The show's host, musician Chuck Redd, told The Associated Press he called off the performance after the White House announced last week that President Trump's name would be added to the facility \u2014 drawing pushback from Democratic lawmakers and some scholars, who say the change violates the law. According to the White House, the president's handpicked board approved the decision to rename the institution the Trump-Kennedy Center. The revised name later appeared on the building's facade.",
      "\"When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,\" Redd told The Associated Press in an email Wednesday. Redd, a drummer and vibraphone player who has toured with everyone from Dizzy Gillespie to Ray Brown, has been presiding over holiday \"Jazz Jams\" at the Kennedy Center since 2006, succeeding bassist William \"Keter\" Betts.",
      "The center's website lists the show as canceled.",
      "The Kennedy Center's vice president of public relations, Roma Daravi, told CBS News in a statement: \"Any artist cancelling their show at the Trump Kennedy Center over political differences isn't courageous or principled \u2014 they are selfish, intolerant, and have failed to meet the basic duty of a public artist: to perform for all people.\"",
      "In a letter to Redd, Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell called the cancellation a \"political stunt\" and alleged that Jazz Jams have faced \"dismal ticket sales.\" Grenell also said the center plans to seek $1 million in damages.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Redd for comment.",
      "President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and Congress passed a law naming the center as a living memorial to him.\u00a0The law explicitly prohibits the board of trustees adding any additional memorials to the site.",
      "The decision to rename the center has drawn steep criticism from congressional Democrats and some members of Kennedy's family. Democratic Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio sued over the renaming Monday, calling it a \"flagrant violation of the rule of law\" and noting that the name can't be changed without an act of Congress.",
      "Grenell, who was appointed by Mr. Trump,\u00a0has argued that the center's status as a memorial to Kennedy wasn't changed.",
      "Mr. Trump, a Republican, has been deeply involved with the center named for an iconic Democrat after mostly ignoring it during his first term. He has forced out its leadership, overhauled the board while arranging for himself to head it and personally hosted this year's Kennedy Center honors, breaking a long tradition of presidents mostly serving as spectators.",
      "Numerous artists have called off Kennedy Center performances since Mr. Trump returned to office, including Issa Rae and Peter Wolf. Lin-Manuel Miranda canceled a planned production of \"Hamilton.\"",

    "summary": "As prosecutors contend with a massive trove of Epstein files, President Trump suggested Friday the Justice Department is spending too much time on the issue \u2014 but said Democrats should be named.",
    "story": [
      "As prosecutors contend with a massive trove of documents related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, President Trump suggested Friday the Justice Department is spending too much time on the issue \u2014 but said prominent Democrats linked to Epstein should be named.",
      "The Justice Department has released scores of records on Epstein over the last week, responding to a law requiring it to publish its files on Epstein by Dec. 19. The files cover more than 20 years worth of investigations into the disgraced financier, and highlighted the relationships he cultivated over the years with well-known people like Mr. Trump and former President Bill Clinton \u2014 neither of whom have been accused of any wrongdoing.",
      "And on Wednesday, the department announced that the federal prosecutor's office in Manhattan had discovered upwards of 1 million more records \"potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case.\" It said that combing through the newly discovered documents and making necessary redactions could take \"a few more weeks.\"",
      "Mr. Trump addressed the discovery on Truth Social late Friday, writing: \"Now 1,000,000 more pages on Epstein are found. DOJ is being forced to spend all of its time on this Democrat inspired Hoax. When do they say NO MORE, and work on Election Fraud etc.\"",
      "The president went on to allege that Democrats, not Republicans, are \"the ones who worked with Epstein.\"",
      "\"Release all of their names, embarrass them, and get back to helping our Country,\" he wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump has long been wary of the Epstein issue, periodically calling it a \"hoax\" and arguing that Republican lawmakers who supported the release of more records on Epstein had fallen for a diversion tactic spearheaded by Democrats.",
      "He eventually said last month that Republicans should vote for the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which mandated the files' release, writing, \"it's time to move on from this Democrat Hoax.\"",
      "Simultaneously, the president has zeroed in on Democrats with links to Epstein. In mid-November, he asked the Justice Department to investigate Epstein's ties to Clinton and two other Democrats. The department had previously said in July that there is no evidence to justify prosecuting any uncharged third-parties in the Epstein case.",
      "Last week's initial release of Justice Department files on Epstein featured multiple photos of Clinton, including an image of the former president sitting in a hot tub and several images of him at events with celebrities like Michael Jackson.",
      "Another release of files earlier this week included references to Mr. Trump. One 2020 email from a federal prosecutor said flight logs revealed that the president flew on Epstein's private jet \"many more times\" than was previously known.",
      "The files do not indicate wrongdoing on the part of Clinton or Mr. Trump. A Clinton spokesperson has long acknowledged that the former president traveled with Epstein on several occasions, but said he had no knowledge of Epstein's crimes.",
      "A Clinton spokesperson\u00a0on Monday\u00a0pushed the Justice Department to release \"any remaining records\" in the Epstein files that mention Clinton or include a photo of him, arguing the former president has nothing to hide.",
      "Mr. Trump ran in the same social circles as Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s, but says he cut off ties with Epstein many years ago. The president called the release of photos of Clinton and others a \"terrible thing\" on Monday, saying that many people who appear in images with Epstein \"really had nothing to do with\" him.",
      "\"I don't like the pictures of Bill Clinton being shown. I don't like the pictures of other people being shown. I think it's a terrible thing,\" the president told reporters. \"I think Bill Clinton's a big boy, he can handle it. But you probably have pictures being exposed of other people that innocently met Jeffrey Epstein years ago ... and they're highly respected bankers and lawyers and others.\"",

    "summary": "Strikes against ISIS targets in Nigeria come after President Trump spent weeks accusing the West African country's government of failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Thursday that the U.S. launched \"powerful and deadly\" strikes against Islamic State forces in Nigeria, after spending weeks accusing the West African country's government of failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.",
      "\"Tonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even Centuries!\" Mr. Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \"I have previously warned these Terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not provide further details on the strikes, such as how many people were killed, who or what was specifically targeted, or how many strikes were carried out, other than to say they were \"numerous perfect strikes.\"",
      "U.S. Africa Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in Africa, said in a statement that its \"initial assessment is that multiple ISIS terrorists were killed in the ISIS camps.\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted on X: \"The President was clear last month: the killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria (and elsewhere) must end. \"The @DeptofWar is always ready, so ISIS found out tonight \u2014 on Christmas. More to come\u2026 Grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation.\"",
      "The Defense Department posted to its X account\u00a0an unclassified 9-second video that appeared to show a missile being launched from a military vessel.",
      ".@POTUS \u201cTonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ct7rUW128t",
      "In its own statement, Nigeria's foreign ministry acknowledged the strikes\u00a0and indicated that it was given advanced notice, saying that \"Nigerian authorities remain engaged in structured security cooperation with international partners, including the United States of America, in addressing the persistent threat of terrorist and violent extremism. This has led to precision hits on terrorist targets in Nigeria by air strikes in the North West.\"",
      "\"Terrorist violence in any form, whether directed at Christians, Muslims or other communities, remains an affront to Nigeria's values and to international peace and security,\" the ministry added.",
      "Nigerian\u00a0 Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar went further, telling a local television network his nation provided the U.S. with intelligence on jihadists before the raids, French news agency AFP reported. It quoted him as saying he spoke by phone with Secretary of State Marco Rubio \"for 19 minutes before the strike and then we spoke again for another five minutes before it went on.\"",
      "Asked if there would be more strikes, Tuggar said: \"It is an ongoing thing, and we are working with the U.S. We are working with other countries as well.\"",
      "In early November, Mr. Trump said that he had instructed the Pentagon to \"prepare for possible action\" in Nigeria after he alleged that Nigeria's government was not doing enough to combat the persecution of Christians there.",
      "\"If we attack, it will be fast, vicious and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians! WARNING: THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT BETTER MOVE FAST!\" Mr. Trump wrote on Nov. 1.",
      "In response at the time, Hegseth wrote on social media that the Department of War, the Trump administration's preferred term for the Defense Department, was \"preparing for action.\"",
      "This comes about a week after the U.S. conducted a series of strikes on ISIS targets in Syria in response to the killing of two U.S. soldiers and an interpreter.",
      "Mr. Trump in November also said he would be designating Nigeria as a \"country of particular concern.\"",
      "Designating a \"country of particular concern\" under the\u00a01998 International Religious Freedom Act\u00a0is an executive prerogative that normally follows recommendations from both the congressionally mandated U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and the State Department.",
      "The State Department usually releases\u00a0its annual\u00a0Report on International Religious Freedom in the spring, but has not yet done so this year. The report may or may not include \"particular concern\" designations, which can be done at any time. And, such designations, which authorize U.S. penalties, do not necessarily impose sanctions.",
      "The Nigerian government has rejected Mr. Trump's claims that it is not doing enough to protect Christians from violence. Analysts have said that while Christians are among those targeted, the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria's Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur. Earlier Thursday, at least five people were killed and dozens more injured in an explosion at a mosque in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri.",
      "Nigeria's President Bola Ahmed Tinubu previously said on social media that the characterization of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country does not reflect the national reality.",
      "\"Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so,\" Tinubu said. \"Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it. Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.\"",
      "Nigeria was first placed on the \"country of particular concern\"\u00a0list\u00a0by the U.S. in 2020 in what the State Department called \"systematic violations of religious freedom.\" But the designation did not single out attacks on Christians. The designation was lifted in 2023 in what many saw as a way to improve ties between the countries ahead of a visit by then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken.",

    "story": [
      "The Veterans Affairs Department is reimposing a near total ban on abortions for veterans and their families after a Justice Department memo from the Office of Legal Counsel last week\u00a0asserted that it's against federal law for the VA to provide them in most instances.",
      "VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz told CBS News, \"The Department of Justice's opinion states that VA is not legally authorized to provide abortions, and VA is complying with it immediately. DOJ's opinion is consistent with VA's proposed rule, which continues to work its way through the regulatory process.\"",
      "In 2022, the department modified its 1999 abortion rules\u00a0to allow \"access to abortions when the life or health of the pregnant Veteran would be endangered if the pregnancy were carried to term, or when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest,\"\u00a0the VA website states.",
      "Now, under the guidance given by the Office of Legal Counsel, the VA's proposed rule reinstates \"the full exclusion on abortions and abortion counseling from the medical benefits package.\"",
      "The proposed rule does have one exception, stating that the \"VA has never understood this policy to prohibit providing care to pregnant women in life-threatening circumstances, including treatment for ectopic pregnancies or miscarriages, which were covered under the VA's medical benefits package prior to the 2022. ... For the avoidance of doubt, the proposed rule would make clear that the exclusion for abortion does not apply 'when a physician certifies that the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.'\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington condemned the VA's move in a post on X, saying it \"is yet another attack on reproductive freedom and a profound betrayal of veterans who put their lives on the line for our country.\" And Democratic Rep. Judy Chu of California, said on X that denying veterans \"the freedom to make their own health care decisions\u2014especially survivors of military sexual trauma\u2014is cruel, dangerous, and an insult to all who have served.\"",
      "The VA argued in its proposed rule that it is \"without question that VA has the authority to bar provision of abortion services through the VA medical benefits package to veterans\" and says the Biden administration implemented the changes to the abortion ban in response to the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturning women's abortion rights. \"In doing so, the administration predicted a high demand for VA abortions that never materialized,\" the proposed rule states.",
      "The Center for Reproductive Rights said in a press release that the policy \"is effectively a national abortion ban for veterans, preventing them and their families from receiving abortions at VA health care facilities in all 50 states, including the 14 states that protect abortion rights.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday it was replacing its longstanding lottery system for H-1B work visas with a new approach that prioritizes skilled, higher-paid foreign workers.",
      "The change follows a series of actions by the Trump administration aimed at reshaping a visa program that critics say has become a pipeline for overseas workers willing to work for lower pay, but supporters say drives innovation.",
      "\"The existing random selection process of H-1B registrations was exploited and abused by U.S. employers who were primarily seeking to import foreign workers at lower wages than they would pay American workers,\" said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Matthew Tragesser.",
      "Earlier this year, President Trump signed a proclamation imposing a $100,000 annual H-1B visa fee on highly skilled workers, which was challenged in court.",
      "At least one federal judge has upheld it, French news agency AFP reports. In a 56-page opinion Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell wrote that the president has \"broad statutory authority\" to address \"a problem he perceives to be a matter of economic and national security.\"",
      "At least two additional suits against the fee are ongoing.",
      "The president also rolled out a $1 million \"gold card\" visa as a pathway to U.S. citizenship for wealthy individuals.",
      "A press release announcing the new rule says it is \"in line with other key changes the administration has made, such as the Presidential Proclamation that requires employers to pay an additional $100,000 per visa as a condition of eligibility.\"",
      "Historically, H-1B visas have been awarded through a lottery system. This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient, with more than 10,000 visas approved, followed by Tata Consultancy Services, Microsoft, Apple and Google. California has the highest concentration of H-1B workers.",
      "The new system will \"implement a weighted selection process that will increase the probability that H-1B visas are allocated to higher-skilled and higher-paid\" foreign workers, according to Tuesday's press release. It will go into effect Feb. 27, 2026, and will apply to the upcoming H-1B cap registration season.",
      "Supporters of the H-1B program say it is an important pathway to hiring healthcare workers and educators. They say it drives innovation and economic growth in the U.S. and allows employers to fill jobs in specialized fields.",
      "Critics argue that the visas often go to entry-level positions rather than senior roles requiring specialized skills. While the program is intended to prevent wage suppression or the displacement of U.S. workers, critics say companies can pay lower wages by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even when the workers hired have more experience.",

    "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:07:06 -0500",
    "summary": "Instacart had drawn criticism for testing an AI-based system that enabled retailers to charge different prices for the same grocery items.",
    "story": [
      "Instacart said Monday that it would halt the use of an AI-powered tool that allowed retailers to charge customers different prices for identical items on the grocery delivery platform.",
      "\"Effective immediately, Instacart is ending all item price tests on our platform,\" an Instacart spokesperson told CBS News in an email statement. \"Retailers will no longer be able to use Eversight technology to run item price tests on Instacart.\"",
      "The announcement comes after a recent investigation by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, a nonprofit advocacy group, found evidence that retailers such as Albertsons, Costco, Kroger, Safeway and Sprouts Farmers Market were testing the AI pricing system.",
      "The organizations based their findings on data gathered from more than 400 volunteers during online shopping sessions in September. During one test conducted for a Safeway in Seattle, the price for a box of Wheat Thins varied by as much as 23%.",
      "\"Once we pulled back the curtain on Instacart's hidden pricing experiments, the company had no choice but to close the lab,\" Groundwork Collaborative's executive director Lindsay Owens said in a statement on Monday.",
      "The investigation also found\u00a0that Instacart was conducting algorithmic pricing tests using product information from Target. The retail giant told CBS News it has no commercial relationship with Instacart and that it was not involved in the pilot.",
      "Instacart acquired Eversight, an AI-enabled pricing platform, in 2022, and began offering pricing software to retail companies in 2023.",
      "Instacart claims the AI pricing tests did not include customers' personal, demographic, or user-level behavioral characteristics. The decision to end the use of its pricing tool was made in response to feedback from Instacart customers, a company spokesperson said Monday.",
      "Retailers will continue to set their own prices on the delivery website, and they may still offer different prices at different brick-and-mortar locations, Instacart said Monday in a blog\u00a0post.",
      "Reuters reported\u00a0on Dec. 17 that the Federal Trade Commission was probing Instacart over its AI pricing tests. The FTC declined to comment on the report, but said in a statement that it was \"disturbed by what we have read in the press about Instacart's alleged pricing practices.\"",
      "The FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Instacart shelving its AI pricing technology.",
      "In a separate case last week, Instacart agreed to pay $60 million in customer refunds to settle federal allegations of deceptive practices after the FTC accused Instacart of falsely advertising free deliveries and not clearly disclosing service fees.",

      "Kathleen Stilling: Their relationship was really special. \u2026 that was one of the things that really drew me to this case. \u2026 The idea that out of the blue he would snap and kill his wife and then stage the accident, it just seems so implausible to me.",
      "They insist this isn't a murder mystery. It's an old-fashioned love story that ended in a tragic accident. During his trial, Todd told the court that he fell for Barbara, at first sight.",

And then, surprisingly, instead of heading to Barbara's school, Todd headed north \u2014 away from it.\u00a0 Why he did would become a critical question.",

      "Todd Kendhammer says the pipe flew off a truck, smashed into the windshield of the car he was driving and caused his wife Barbara's death \u2014 a story that Prosecutor Tim Gruenke says is simply preposterous.",
      "Tim Gruenke: Our theory is that he used that himself to put the hole in the windshield. It didn't fly off of a truck going by.",
      "Tim Gruenke: Todd said he was traveling north on Highway M.",
      "Gruenke says that police became suspicious of Todd when pieces of his story just didn't seem to add up, starting with that mysterious truck.",
      "Tim Gruenke: He turned right onto Bergum Coulee Road.",
      "This is the description Todd Kendhammer gave police on the way to the hospital:",
      "TODD KENDHAMMER: It was a older, like a bigger flatbed-looking truck \u2026 Like a pickup truck with a flatbed on it.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: What color was the cab?",
      "TODD KENDHAMMER:\u00a0 I don't even remember. It was darker, I don't \u2014 that's all I know. Dark green or dark blue.",
      "Erin Moriarty (at the scene, pointing at road): So, he's going this way and he claims that the \u2014 that a truck carrying a pipe was going this way?",
      "Tim Gruenke: Correct.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Were you ever able to find a truck?",
      "Tim Gruenke: No. Police spent some time looking for the truck and putting out word to the community to ask if anybody saw a truck that day.",
      "Surveillance video from a horse ranch down the road does show what appears to be the Kendhammer car pass by at approximately 7:57 a.m. on the day of the incident. But at around the same time, no truck that matched the description Todd gave police was ever seen heading in the opposite direction.",
      "And then four days after the incident, Medical Examiner Dr. Kathleen McCubbin conducted an autopsy on Barbara.",
      "Tim Gruenke: She didn't understand when she first heard a pipe had done it. She had called law enforcement to look at the pipe 'cause she didn't understand how that could be.",
      "Barbara had three lacerations on the back of her head.",
      "Tim Gruenke: She said that the injuries to Barb were very inconsistent with a pipe of that size and that weight coming through the windshield.",
      "She concluded that Barbara died of \"blunt trauma injuries of the head and neck, with skull fractures \u2026 cricoid cartilage fractures \u2026 and ultimate brain death.\" The cricoid is the ring-shaped bony cartilage structure located in the lower neck.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What do you believe caused the broken cricoid cartilage?",
      "Tim Gruenke: It's consistent with strangulation.",
      "The medical examiner also noted that there were countless other injuries on Barbara that suggested there could have been an earlier struggle. She had scratches on her neck, a broken nose, a laceration on her forehead and bruising all over her body.",
      "Tim Gruenke: She had some injuries to her fingers.",
      "Todd also had injuries to his hands.",
      "Tim Gruenke: He said that came from striking the windshield when he saw something flying at him.",
      "And he had what appeared to be scratches on his neck and chest as well.",
      "Tim Gruenke: He said he got that 'cause he worked with glass. It turns out he doesn't work with glass. He puts in windshields. But he doesn't normally work with glass or broken glass. So those injuries seemed odd. \u2026 It seems consistent like someone who was in a fight. A really bad fight.",
      "Police had also interviewed a construction worker who said he drove by the Kendhammer car around 8 a.m. but didn't see any damage to the windshield or any people around.",
      "Tim Gruenke: He saw the car in the ditch. \u2026 And thought maybe somebody had just driven off the road or tried to make a turn and got stuck.",
      "Erin Moriarty: So, he didn't see anybody. He didn't see either Todd or Barbara?",
      "Tim Gruenke: Correct.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Could they have been hidden in the high grass?",
      "Tim Gruenke: Well, that's the only thought is that \u2026 he was maybe trying to hold her down and keep her from calling for help.",
      "There were other red flags. On the day of the incident Barbara was scheduled to work at 8 a.m., but she never called to say that she'd be late. She also did not make her daily call her to her mom.",
      "Tim Gruenke: As a woman who has never been later for work, who always calls her mom \u2026 when you look at, that's an obvious change of the pattern.",
      "And where were Todd and Barbara driving to that morning, going in the opposite direction from Barbara's work?",
      "This is what Todd Kendhammer told investigators on the drive to the hospital:",
      "TODD KENDHAMMER: I'm gonna put a windshield in a truck for a guy.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: So, is the windshield you were going to replace in somebody's driveway or?",
      "TODD KENDHAMMER: In his truck. I was gonna take it to my house.",
      "Todd told police that, on the way to drive Barbara to work, he decided to drive over to pick up a truck that needed a windshield replaced. He said the truck, with keys inside, was in the driveway of a person he knew from work named Justin Heim.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: Did you call the guy?",
      "TODD KENDHAMMER: No, I didn't call him. \u2026 I was just gonna swing over and if it was there grab it.",
      "But when the investigators spoke with Justin Heim, he told a very different story.",
      "Tim Gruenke: When the police looked into that, they found Justin Heim never had ordered a windshield from Todd, didn't need a windshield. Todd didn't even know where he lived.",
      "So just one week after Barbara's death and just two days before her funeral, investigators asked Todd to come down to the police station under the ruse that they had some leads on trucks that may have dropped the pipe that day.",
      "TODD KENDHAMMER [in interrogation room, opening pill container]: Is it OK if I take that? I didn't take my medicine this morning.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: Yeah, that's fine.",
      "As investigators began to question him, Todd told them he had not taken his anti-anxiety medication, and he appeared confused and forgetful of details.",
      "TODD KENDHAMMER [distraught, holding his head in his hands]: And \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 just don't \u2014 remember, I remember \u2014 and I don't know how \u2026 I remember \u2014 I remember the worst part was when I looked \u2014 the pipe was \u2014 the pipe was there \u2026\"",
      "Jessica Servais: He was trying to help. Like he thought they were trying to help him find the cause of the accident.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: How did the pipe get through the windshield, let's start there.",
      "TODD KENDHAMMER: The pipe \u2014 I don't \u2014 It came off a truck.",
      "But they were closing in on what they believed were Todd's lies.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: There's no explanations for it. You can't \u2014 the injuries that were on Barb did not occur from that accident, from a pipe going through your windshield.",
      "And then, when police pressed him about where he was actually going that day, Todd Kendhammer changed his story.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: I talked to Justin.",
      "Tim Gruenke: He \u2026 told a story that he wasn't going to Justin Heim's house. It was actually a friend of Justin's.",
      "Police would later find that friend who told them he also didn't need a windshield and was not expecting Todd the day of the incident.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Isn't it possible he was in shock? Isn't it possible that he just can't remember anything from that time?",
      "Tim Gruenke: Part of it. \u2026 I could see somebody not remembering a detail or two. Not remembering something traumatic. But the things that surround it you usually do remember. \u2026 So, things like remembering where you were going.",
      "After 3-and-a-half hours of questioning Todd, investigators let him go home, but they kept building their case.",
      "Tim Gruenke: Do I know exactly blow-by-blow how it happened? No, I don't. But I know it didn't happen from a pipe coming off a truck.",
      "Three months after Barbara's death, Todd Kendhammer was arrested.",
      "Jessica Servais: We were basically just like, \"Well how we get him back out?\" Because he is not supposed to be in there \u2026",
      "Jessica hoped a jury would believe her father when Todd took the stand to tell his side of the story at his trial.",

      "TIM GRUENKE (trial opening): What started out looking like a tragic car accident would soon become more complicated.",
      "In December 2017 when Todd Kendhammer went to trial for his wife Barbara's murder, almost everyone who attended was there to support him. Yet, his daughter Jessica feared the worst.",

      "DR. KATHLEEN MCCUBBIN | Medical examiner: The cause of Barbara Kendhammer's death was blunt impact injuries of her head and neck.",
      "The state's star witness was Medical Examiner Dr. Kathleen McCubbin.",
      "DR. KATHLEEN MCCUBBIN: I did not believe that these injuries are consistent with the end of a pipe striking the back of the head.",
      "Todd's trial lawyer Stephen Hurley didn't call a forensic pathologist of his own to dispute the state's case but tried to create reasonable doubt during cross-examination.",
      "STEPHEN HURLEY: If her head were moving at the time of the pipe coming through, the pipe had the potential, because it is some 5 feet long, to strike her head in more than one place, is that correct?",
      "DR. KATHLEEN MCCUBBIN: That may be possible, yes.",
      "Attorney Hurley asked McCubbin if Barbara's large water mug could have slammed into her face if she ducked to avoid the pipe and caused some of the injuries.",
      "DR. KATHLEEN MCCUBBIN: Yes, it could be. It's a possibility.",
      "But when Hurley questioned Dr. McCubbin, he didn't focus on one of the critical injuries that Barbara suffered \u2013 the cricoid fracture \u2013 which the prosecution insisted could only have been caused by Todd.",
      "Tim Gruenke: And it could have happened in a multitude of ways, but I believe during the fight, her cricoid fracture happens.",

      "The windshield of the car was as hotly disputed as the medical evidence. The defense's expert, Mark Meshulam, with over 30 years of experience working with glass, believes the evidence supports Todd's story.",
      "MARK MESHULAM: By observing the crack branching ...",
      "The fracture patterns on the windshield, he said, show three different events.",
      "MARK MESHULAM: The first one was a hand impact, when Mr. Kendhammer's fist went into the glass.",
      "The second event was the puncture when the pipe broke through the windshield. \u00a0And the third, harder to detect, was caused, he said, when Todd removed the pipe from the windshield.",
      "NICK STAHLKE: The lines that are highlighted here would indicate those impact points.",
      "But the state's forensic expert Nick Stahlke said the impacts didn't occur in the order that Meshalum said they did. District Attorney Gruenke argues this is more evidence showing that Todd Kendhammer intentionally damaged the windshield, and it was not from a pipe falling off a truck.",
      "Tim Gruenke: It couldn't have done what he said it did. \u2026 The crime lab found that the windshield had two strikes on the outside which is impossible. However the pipe comes, it's not going to hit, back up again and hit again.",

      "Jessica Servais: They never really said how he killed her or what he did to stage everything. If what they're saying is he staged it and killed her at the same time, the time frame doesn't fit up either. You don't have enough time to do all that stuff.",
      "Because that construction worker drove by at 8 a.m. that morning, Todd had just 5 minutes to stage the crime before he called 911 at 8:05 a.m.",
      "Erin Moriarty: So, in that short period of time he had the presence of mind to go get the pipe out of the trunk, go around, break it twice \u2026 and call 911 and administer CPR.",
      "Tim Gruenke: Yes. \u2026 He can do a lot of damage in 2 or 3 minutes. So, it's more time than people think.",
      "JUDGE TODD BJERKE: Mr. Hurley, you'll be calling your next witness?",
      "STEPHEN HURLEY: Yes, I call Todd Kendhammer.",
      "With so much at stake, the defense decided to gamble by putting Todd Kendhammer himself on the stand.",
      "STEPHEN HURLEY: Did you ever strike Barbara Kendhammer?",
      "TODD KENDHAMMER: No.",
      "Todd tried to explain to the jurors why, during the police interrogation, he told investigators conflicting stories about where he was going that morning.",
      "TODD KENDHAMMER: When I watch that video it's me in the picture, but it's not me talking. I'm not in the right state of mind talking in that. I wasn't thinking of where I was going or what I was doing. I was thinking of Barb.",
      "Todd seemed to be doing well \u2026",
      "JUDGE TODD BJERKE: Mr. Gruenke, you may begin your cross-examination.",
      "\u2026 until he had trouble remembering details about that day:",
      "TODD KENDHAMMER: I don't recall if I said that or not.",
      "TODD KENDHAMMER: I don't remember that.",
      "TODD KENDHAMMER: I can't recall for sure.",
      "But his most damaging testimony may have been when he changed his story yet again. He told the jury about a third person he was supposedly going to see on the day of the incident: Jared Loging.",
      "TIM GRUENKE: And today you say you were trying to find the house of Mr. Loging?",
      "TODD KENDHAMMER: Correct.",
      "Tim Gruenke: So that's another kinda odd statement to make \u2014 that that's why you were going that way. And why you couldn't have told police that the first time or the second time or in the year before trial.",
      "And just like the others Todd said he was going to visit that morning, Loging said he had never arranged for Todd to replace a windshield.",
      "TIM GRUENKE: Did you change your story for trial because you knew police had figured out your lies?",
      "TODD KENDHAMMER: No.",
      "JUDGE TODD BJERKE: We the jury find the defendant Todd A. Kendhammer guilty \u2026",
      "The jury was out just 9 hours before they reached their verdict. Three months later, everyone was back in the courtroom. The conviction had an automatic life sentence, but it was up to the judge to decide if Todd Kendhammer would be eligible for parole.",
      "GERIANNE BUCHNER WETTSTEIN [on the stand]: I am here today. I do not stand alone.",
      "Jessica and Jordan were stunned when Gerianne Buchner Wettstein, their mom's cousin, spoke out against Todd and read a letter signed by several other cousins.",
      "Jessica Servais: I just remember thinking, like, \"wow!\"",
      "GERIANNE BUCHNER WETTSTEIN: Barbara found the courage that day to fight back. Therefore, we stand here today, united with that same courage asking you to sentence her killer to the maximum penalty possible.",
      "But Jessica says Gerianne had been estranged from their mother.",
      "Jessica Servais: She basically painted this scene that \u2026 she just feels so bad about my mom and her big blue eyes, even though her eyes are green. \u2026 My mom hates her.",
      "\"48 Hours\" reached out to Gerianne and she denies Jessica's claims that she was estranged from Barbara. But her testimony wasn't the only surprise that day. Gruenke had some harsh words for the Kendhammer family, who had to sell Todd and Barbara's home and Jessica's house to pay Todd's legal bills.",
      "TIM GRUENKE [at sentencing]: Pardon my language, but to be perfectly frank they need to get their head out of their ass. They need to start looking at this in reality \u2026",
      "Jessica Servais: I don't think you should be able to talk that way in a courtroom.\u00a0 If you can think that to yourself, that's fine because I also think you're an ass, but I'm not going to say it out loud.",
      "Jordan Kendhammer: At least word it different.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Don't you think you may have added to their pain at that sentencing by saying that?",
      "Tim Gruenke: I think I have to open their eyes in some way. \u2026\u00a0 I think they are giving him false hope. And I think he's dragging them down with him by using all their money to continue in his lies.",
      "The judge ruled Todd Kendhammer would be eligible for parole after 30 years. But Todd's case is far from over.",
      "NEW EVIDENCE PRESENTED",
      "Todd Kendhammer's verdict was guilty. But Jessica and Jordan are determined to clear his name.",
      "Jessica Servais: Because he didn't do it. \u2026\u00a0 And he doesn't lie. So, when he says he didn't do it, we believe him.",
      "That belief is why Barbara and Todd's children brought on Jerry Buting and Kathleen Stilling, who understand that undoing a murder conviction is an immense challenge.",
      "Jerry Buting: It's very difficult to reverse a judgement that's become final.",
      "Kathleen Stilling: it's kind of like trying to turn an aircraft carrier. It's slow \u2026 and difficult to do.",
      "Still, they overcame a big first hurdle: getting back in court.",
      "Todd Kendhammer was granted an evidentiary hearing. It was a chance to argue that his original defense team had been ineffective, and that there was critical, new evidence.",
      "Jessica Servais: We were grateful that the judge was taking the time to see what we had come up with.",
      "And four years after his conviction for the intentional homicide of his wife Barbara, inmate Kendhammer was back in front of Judge Todd Bjerke.",
      "It opened the courthouse doors a crack, to the possibility of a new trial.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Is this the most hopeful you have felt \u2026 that your dad may have a chance to walk out of prison?",
      "Jessica Servais: Yeah.",
      "The burden is now on the defense. Jerry Buting starts by calling a forensic pathologist, something Todd's first defense team had elected not to do.",
      "Jerry Butting: They chose to go a different route. And I think that was serious mistake that really damaged Todd's ability to defend himself.",
      "But now Dr. Shaku Teas, who has performed some 6,000 autopsies, would examine Barbara Kendhammer's medical records and autopsy photos.",
      "JERRY BUTING: Did you observe anything on her body that was consistent with Barbara Kendhammer having been beaten with fists?",
      "DR. SHAKU TEAS: No.",
      "JERRY BUTING: Or that she was a woman who had been in a fight?",
      "DR. SHAKU TEAS: No.",
      "Doctor Teas contradicted the findings of the medical examiner who had performed the autopsy and testified at trial, Dr. McCubbin.",
      "DR. KATHLEEN MCCUBBIN: Yes, some of her injuries certainly could be consistent with an assault or beating as well, yes.",
      "PROSECUTOR SUSAN DONSKEY: Consistent with strangulation?",
      "DR. KATHLEEN MCCUBBIN: It could be, yes.",
      "But for Dr. Teas, the stark photos and silent sketches tell a different story.",
      "DR. SHAKU TEAS: I don't see any injuries on Barbara that I would say are suggestive or consistent with strangulation.",
      "And Dr. Teas suggests that the injury to Barbara's cricoid could be due to that large travel mug.",
      "JERRY BUTING: So, if she had that in her lap when she's moving forward, could that have caused the cricoid fracture",
      "DR. SHAKU TEAS:\u00a0 It could be the mug.",
      "As for the injuries to the back of her head \u2026",
      "Erin Moriarty: If the pipe is coming in \u2026 how would she get severe injuries in the back of her head?",
      "Jerry Buting: Because she ducked, and the pipe came through like that (ducks his head and upper body) and grazed the back of her head.",
      "DR. SHAKU TEAS: Barbara Kendhammer died as a result of \u2026 an automobile accident.",
      "And Teas believes some injuries seen in the autopsy came from the final act of Barbara Kendhammer's generosity: the harvesting of her donated organs.",
      "But DA Gruenke doesn't buy the theories of Dr. Teas.",
      "Tim Gruenke: I don't put a lot of faith in her testimony.",
      "But when it comes to Todd Kendhammer's guilt or innocence, Buting and Stilling say there is more than just physical evidence to consider.",
      "DR. GEOFFREY LOFTUS [testifying via Zoom]: Something very traumatic and attention-grabbing had occurred, which would likely obliterate any short-term memory that Mr. Kendhammer would have had.",
      "The defense hired another expert, this time in human memory. Dr. Geoffrey Loftus testified that Todd Kendhammer's various stories could be a result of stress from a terrible accident.",
      "KATHLEEN STILLING: Would you say that this was a situation that was ripe for an inaccurate memory?",
      "DR. GEOFFREY LOFTUS: Yes.",
      "Still the most controversial aspect of this story is about that pipe that Todd claims crashed through his windshield and killed Barbara.",
      "As part of their initial investigation, local authorities had attempted to reconstruct Todd's story of the deadly incident on County Road M.",
      "They tested, and taped, dropping a similar pipe off the back of a truck to see if it could, in fact, bounce. The idea: to determine if a pipe might have bounced high enough to hit the windshield of Todd's oncoming car.",
      "But Kendhammer's lawyers thought the pipe test was inconclusive. They never shared the investigators' video with judge or jury. And neither did the state.",
      "Tim Gruenke: I didn't think we needed it. The defense didn't want it. We just agreed not to use it.",
      "It was only at the new evidentiary hearing that the pipe test was finally presented in court.",
      "Jerry Buting: The first time the judge ever even heard about those experiments was in our motion.",
      "Butting and Stilling shared the pipe test video with \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Erin Moriarty: What you're showing me is that the state's own experts did an experiment that if in fact the pipe bounced like this it could've done exactly what Todd said it did.",
      "Jerry Buting: That's right.",
      "Jerry Buting: Now that one hits on its end and look how it bounces.",
      "Erin Moriarty: And come up really high.",
      "Jerry Buting: It comes up high.",
      "Erin Moriarty: In your mind these videos show that it could have happened.",
      "Jerry Buting: That's the point. Yes.",
      "Which contradicts state investigators who, from the beginning, had suggested that a pipe slamming through Todd's windshield was next to impossible.",
      "INVESTIGATOR [during interrogation]: What are the odds that that would happen to a guy that changes out windshields?\u00a0 I mean, what do you suppose those odds are?\u00a0 One in a trillion if at all?",
      "Buting and Stilling introduced evidence from across America to prove it's more common than you think.",
      "Jerry Buting (referencing video evidence): This one is in \u2014 near Bakersfield, California, a pipe that looks remarkably similar that went right through this person's vehicle. Here's another one. \u2026 This one's Houston, OK.",
      "Erin Moriarty: And it goes right through and hits \u2014",
      "Jerry Buting: Would've killed \u2014",
      "Erin Moriarty: A passenger.",
      "And it turns out you don't have to be an expert to find a piece of pipe along a country road.",
      "Jessica Servais: There was another pipe on the road up the ways \u2026 that someone found.",
      "Erin Moriarty: There was a pipe, and when was that pipe found?",
      "Jordan Kendhammer: Shortly after.",
      "Erin Moriarty: And it was very similar to the one that went through the windshield?",
      "Jordan Kendhammer: Same diameter, same material.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What do you think happened?",
      "Jordan Kendhammer: I believe the pipe came through and hit mom.",
      "That belief in their father would not waver. Still how could the experts at trial see a case so differently? We decided to ask another forensic pathologist to take a fresh look at the evidence.",
      "Lindsay Thomas: The more I looked at it, the more I understood why it's so complicated.",
      "A COMPLICATED CASE",
      "Dr. Lindsey Thomas is a forensic pathologist who has performed about 5,000 autopsies.",
      "Dr. Lindsey Thomas:\u00a0 If it didn't happen the way Todd says it happened, then how did it happen?",
      "Dr. Lindsey Thomas: This is the kind of case where it isn't that clear cut.",
      "\"48 Hours\" asked her to review the medical evidence in this case \u2013 including Dr. McCubbin's autopsy report.",
      "Dr. Lindsey Thomas: The original autopsy was very well done and the conclusions that they reached were very reasonable.",
      "Still, Dr. Thomas says she wouldn't have reached some of the same conclusions.",
      "Dr. Lindsey Thomas: And that's what makes this case so challenging.",
      "The most troubling injury for her is that cricoid fracture on Barbara's neck. She agrees with Dr. Teas, the forensic pathologist who testified for the defense in the evidentiary hearing and does not believe that Barbara was strangled.",
      "Dr. Lindsey Thomas: I've never seen a fractured cricoid in strangulation. \u2026 I wouldn't say it absolutely can't happen, but certainly I haven't seen it, I haven't read about it, I haven't heard about it \u2026 it seems more consistent with the kind of thing that would happen \u2014 in a weird car crash.",
      "And she believes the injuries to the back of Barbara's head were too severe to have been caused by Todd's fists. But she says Barbara could have been hit with a heavy object like her mug.",
      "Dr. Lindsey Thomas: Yeah, it would have to be a substantial coffee cup. But I understand there was a pretty substantial coffee cup in the car.",
      "Ultimately, Dr. Thomas can't say for sure how Barbara sustained her injuries.",
      "Dr. Lindsey Thomas: Based on just the medical evidence alone, it wouldn't be one where \u2026 you could definitely say, \"Oh, this is clearly a homicide or clearly an accident.\"",
      "Erin Moriarty: The idea that a man is sitting in prison, does that concern you?",
      "Dr. Lindsey Thomas: Well, it always does when you have a case like this that isn't clear cut. \u2026 You just worry a little that the evidence was given too much weight one way or the other, or the jury wasn't given all of the relevant materials.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Had you ever served on a murder trial before as a jury member?",
      "Tim Brennan: No. Not ever.",
      "Tim Brennan, the jury foreman, says he found Dr. McCubbin's testimony very convincing. We shared with him some of the new information from the evidentiary hearing, including Dr. Teas' conclusions.",
      "Erin Moriarty: If you had heard a medical examiner disagree with Dr. McCubbin \u2026 would that have made a difference?",
      "Tim Brennan: Without hearing the full extent \u2026 of that \u2014 it's hard to say.",
      "Still, he stands by the jury verdict.",
      "Tim Brennan: When Todd Kendhammer \u2026 gave his testimony \u2026 He just came across as a person with a lot of falsehoods.",
      "Erin Moriarty: When you say falsehoods, did you feel he was lying?",
      "Tim Brennan: Definitely.",
      "Tim Brennan: I'm very confident that we got it right.",
      "As the Kendhammer family awaits the judge's ruling, Todd is serving his life sentence more than two hours away from his kids.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What do you miss the most about your mom and having your dad around?",
      "Jessica Servais: I used to be annoyed \u2026 that he would call me all the time, and like always come over, but I kind of miss it now (crying). \u2026 I just miss having them around all the time.",
      "And Jessica's daughter Carlin is growing up without her grandparents.",
      "Jessica Servais: Their dream was always to do stuff with their grandkids \u2026 so it's just hard not to have him with her.",
      "Now, Jessica and Jordan and all those who believe in Todd Kendhammer continue to wait, hoping he gets another shot at what they believe is justice.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Do you think your dad will be coming home?",
      "Jessica Servais: Yes. \u2026 We aren't going to stop until he can be home.",
      "Prosecutor Gruenke believes justice has already been served for Barbara Kendhammer.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Do you have any concerns at all that you might have convicted an innocent man?",
      "Tim Gruenke: Not in this case, no.",
      "Todd Kendhammer's requests for a new trial have been denied.",

      "Jeffrey R. Holland, a high-ranking official in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who was next in line to become the faith's president, has died. He was 85.",
      "Holland died early Saturday morning from complications associated with kidney disease, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced on its website.",
      "Holland led a governing body called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, which helps set church policy while overseeing the many business interests of what is known widely as the Mormon church.",

      "Henry B. Eyring, one of Oaks' two top counselors, is now next in line for the presidency.",
      "Holland had been hospitalized during the Christmas holiday for treatment related to ongoing health complications, the church said. Experts on the faith pointed to his declining health in October when Oaks did not select Holland as a counselor. He attended several church events that month in a wheelchair.",
      "His death leaves a vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve that Oaks will fill in the coming months, likely by calling a new apostle from a lower-tier leadership council. Apostles are all men in accordance with the church's all-male priesthood.",
      "Holland grew up in St. George, Utah, and worked for many years in education administration before his call to join the ranks of church leadership. He served as the ninth president of Brigham Young University, the Utah-based faith's flagship school, from 1980 to 1989 and was a commissioner of the church's global education system.",
      "Under his leadership, the Provo university worked to improve interfaith relations and established a satellite campus in Jerusalem. The Anti-Defamation League later honored Holland with its Torch of Liberty Award for helping foster greater understanding between Christian and Jewish communities.",
      "Holland is widely remembered for a 2021 speech in which he called on church members to take up metaphorical muskets in defense of the faith's teachings against same-sex marriage. The talk, known colloquially as \"the musket fire speech,\" became required reading for BYU freshmen in 2024, raising concern among LGBTQ+ students and advocates.",

Rodriguez is seeking at least $77 million in damages and also has sued Lionsgate, which distributed the 2016 film, accusing the studio of turning a blind eye to Perry's alleged misconduct.",
      "\"Having recently failed in another matter against Mr. Perry, the very same lawyer has now made yet another demand from more than a decade ago which will also be a failed money grab,\" Alex Spiro, an attorney for Perry, said in a statement Friday provided to CBS News.",
      "Lionsgate did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "According to the complaint, Rodriguez was approached in 2014 by a trainer at an Equinox gym in Los Angeles who said Perry wanted his phone number to discuss an acting role. Perry later encouraged Rodriguez to audition for \"Boo! A Madea Halloween,\" telling him, \"I'm not a bad person to know and have in your corner,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "After Rodriguez was cast, he was invited to Perry's home, where Perry allegedly touched him inappropriately while they watched a movie. The lawsuit describes additional alleged incidents in 2016, 2018 and 2019, including one encounter in which Perry allegedly attempted to unbuckle Rodriguez's pants and another in which Perry placed Rodriguez's hand on his genitals. The complaint says Perry gave Rodriguez $5,000 on multiple occasions following the encounters.",
      "Rodriguez says he resisted the advances and ultimately decided to file suit after learning of similar allegations made by another actor, Derek Dixon.",
      "Dixon sued Perry in June, alleging the filmmaker groped him while Dixon worked on Perry's television series \"The Oval\" and \"Ruthless.\" That lawsuit, which was originally filed in L.A. Superior Court, has reportedly since been moved to federal court in Georgia, where Perry's studio is based.",
      "Rodriguez's lawsuit includes claims of sexual assault, sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.",

    "summary": "The Veterans Affairs Department is reimposing a near total ban on abortions for veterans and their families that was modified in 2022.",
    "story": [
      "The Veterans Affairs Department is reimposing a near total ban on abortions for veterans and their families after a Justice Department memo from the Office of Legal Counsel last week\u00a0asserted that it's against federal law for the VA to provide them in most instances.",
      "VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz told CBS News, \"The Department of Justice's opinion states that VA is not legally authorized to provide abortions, and VA is complying with it immediately. DOJ's opinion is consistent with VA's proposed rule, which continues to work its way through the regulatory process.\"",
      "In 2022, the department modified its 1999 abortion rules\u00a0to allow \"access to abortions when the life or health of the pregnant Veteran would be endangered if the pregnancy were carried to term, or when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest,\"\u00a0the VA website states.",
      "Now, under the guidance given by the Office of Legal Counsel, the VA's proposed rule reinstates \"the full exclusion on abortions and abortion counseling from the medical benefits package.\"",
      "The proposed rule does have one exception, stating that the \"VA has never understood this policy to prohibit providing care to pregnant women in life-threatening circumstances, including treatment for ectopic pregnancies or miscarriages, which were covered under the VA's medical benefits package prior to the 2022. ... For the avoidance of doubt, the proposed rule would make clear that the exclusion for abortion does not apply 'when a physician certifies that the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.'\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington condemned the VA's move in a post on X, saying it \"is yet another attack on reproductive freedom and a profound betrayal of veterans who put their lives on the line for our country.\" And Democratic Rep. Judy Chu of California, said on X that denying veterans \"the freedom to make their own health care decisions\u2014especially survivors of military sexual trauma\u2014is cruel, dangerous, and an insult to all who have served.\"",
      "The VA argued in its proposed rule that it is \"without question that VA has the authority to bar provision of abortion services through the VA medical benefits package to veterans\" and says the Biden administration implemented the changes to the abortion ban in response to the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturning women's abortion rights. \"In doing so, the administration predicted a high demand for VA abortions that never materialized,\" the proposed rule states.",
      "The Center for Reproductive Rights said in a press release that the policy \"is effectively a national abortion ban for veterans, preventing them and their families from receiving abortions at VA health care facilities in all 50 states, including the 14 states that protect abortion rights.\"",
      "The VA's policy change was first reported by MS Now.",

    "summary": "As many Americans head into 2026 with mounting money worries, reviewing your finances now could help put you on firmer footing next year.",
    "story": [
      "Many Americans are heading into 2026 with serious money worries as an affordability crisis collides with\u00a0stagnant wages, making it more important to take steps to shore up their finances.",
      "On top of that, a major tax overhaul is taking effect under Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" law, or OBBBA, creating opportunities to benefit from the new rules. Other financial changes, such as potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, could also impact your bank account next year, experts say.",
      "About 84% of Americans have new financial resolutions for 2026, including building an emergency fund or opening a high-yield savings account, according to a recent Vanguard survey. That resolve may be spurred by growing unease about the year ahead. About one in three Americans thinks their finances are likely to worsen in 2026, according to Bankrate, the highest share since the personal finance firm began tracking sentiment in 2018.",
      "\"The last few weeks of the year are a great time to review your finances, especially around saving, and it's important to know how you might be impacted by the new tax law,\" Sabino Vargas, a certified financial planner and senior financial advisor for Vanguard, told CBS News.",
      "Here are some tips to get your financial house in order as you prepare for the new year.",
      "Prepare for new tax changes",
      "The OBBBA, the spending and tax bill signed into law by President Trump on July 4, establishes new tax deduction rules for many Americans, including seniors and workers who earn tips or overtime.",
      "Under a \"no tax on tips\" provision, employees may deduct up to $25,000 earned in tips before Dec. 31. To qualify for the deduction, it's important that workers track their earnings closely because of the IRS's\u00a0reporting requirements, experts say.",
      "\"Document the numbers,\" Vargas said, noting that the same applies to individuals who work overtime.",
      "Some seniors are also eligible for an enhanced senior deduction beginning in 2025. Individuals who are 65 and older may claim an additional deduction of $6,000, or $12,000 per couple, if they qualify.",
      "Because the deduction phases out for single earners with modified adjusted gross income above $75,000 or $150,000 for joint filers, seniors should check that income measure to assess whether or not they are eligible for the deduction, according to Vargas.",
      "Modified adjusted gross income is calculated by finding your AGI, which is on line 11 of your Form 1040, with some deductions and non-taxable items added back in.",
      "Make a budget that will stick",
      "Affordability is a top concern for Americans, whose paychecks aren't keeping pace with inflation. Making a budget that you can realistically follow is a good way to ensure you aren't wasting any money, financial experts say.",
      "It's essential, though, that any kind of budget you design \"matches the way you live,\" Alexa von Tobel, founder and managing director of Inspired Capital, told CBS News.",
      "\"Most budgets fail because they're too aspirational. The ones that stick are automated and grounded in your real patterns,\" she said.",
      "Von Tobel said she prefers the 50/30/20 budgeting rule, which portions half of your take-home pay to essentials; one-third to lifestyle expenses; and 20% to goals such as paying off debt or saving for a vacation.",
      "\"A new year is a perfect time to readdress how your budget aligns with this framework and see where you need to adjust,\" she said.",
      "If the 50/30/20 rule doesn't work for you, there are plenty of other budgeting approaches, including the envelope system and zero-based budgeting. The envelope system sets spending limits for categories like dining out, with that amount placed in cash and used throughout the month.",
      "Zero-based budgeting assigns every dollar of your take-home pay to a specific category \u2014 such as rent, groceries or savings \u2014 until there's nothing left unallocated.",
      "AI tools can remove the self-discipline part of the equation for people and automate savings processes, von Tobel noted.",
      "\"Money management is becoming less about discipline and more about system design. Automate what you can, use tools that give you back time and clarity, and let your financial plan run even when your schedule gets chaotic,\" she said.",
      "Pay down high-interest credit card debt",
      "It's important to prioritize paying down high-interest debt like credit card balances because it's the most expensive to carry and \"can get out of control quickly,\" Vanguard's Vargas said.",
      "When it comes to shedding debt, von Tobel recommends tackling credit card balances with the highest annual percentage rates (APRs) first.",
      "\"Line up your balances by APR, automate all minimum payments and aggressively target the highest-interest line first. Structure beats willpower every time,\" she said.",
      "Another popular strategy for paying down debt is the so-called snowball method. It involves listing your debts by balance and paying off the smallest ones first, regardless of interest rates, to build momentum and stay motivated as balances disappear.",
      "Borrowers have other options for tackling credit card debt as well. One approach is to move balances to a 0% balance transfer card, which can eliminate interest for as long as 21 months. Another is to contact your credit card issuer to ask for a lower annual percentage rate, or APR.",
      "Lock in savings rates before they fall",
      "The Federal Reserve last week cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, its third consecutive cut this year, and hinted at an additional rate cut in 2026.",
      "With at least one additional rate cut expected next year, it may make sense to open a certificate of deposit or a high-yield savings account before rates fall further, said Sam Taube, a lead writer with financial advice site NerdWallet.",
      "Online financial institutions are offering some of the highest rates, with annual percentage yields around 4%.",
      "\"If the Fed lowers rates further from here, they will offer lower fixed yields, so it might make sense to open up a CD of fixed-yield savings instrument like that sooner rather than later,\" he said.",
      "Make sure you're getting the full employer match",
      "If you have a tax-advantaged savings account through your employer, such as a 401(k), financial professionals say it's important to make the most of it. If your company matches employee contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match.",
      "Vargas said a good starting point is to find out what level of contribution your employer will match \u2014 typically it's between 3% to 6% of your salary\u2014 and to contribute at least that much to your account.",
      "\"Work toward maximizing that employer match, so you're not leaving money on the table,\" he said.",
      "Setting up an automatic payroll deduction is an easy way to ensure you're contributing to your 401(k), Von Tobel said, adding that \"small, consistent increases create enormous long-term compounding.\"",
      "Before year-end, you can also make a last-minute extra contribution to your 401(k), according to CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger.",
      "Because retirement contributions lower your taxable income, \"you may also reduce your tax bill in April,\" she noted.",

      "An acceleration in consumer spending, along with an upswing in exports and government outlays, helped propel economic growth in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said. Despite widespread public concerns about the economy, consumers are continuing to open their wallets, government data shows.",

      "Inflation ticks higher",
      "Although GDP growth was surprisingly strong, inflation ticked higher from the previous quarter. Tuesday's data shows that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, a key barometer of inflation and consumer spending, rose at a 2.8% annual pace in the third quarter, compared with 2.1% between April and June.",
      "Core PCE, which excludes the more volatile food and energy categories, grew 2.9%, up from 2.6% in the previous quarter. Both are above the Federal Reserve's annual inflation target of 2%.",
      "The economy has shown resilience this year.

    "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 19:07:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Explosions boomed across Kyiv for hours as ballistic missiles and drones hit the city in an attack that began early in the morning.",
    "story": [
      "Russia attacked Ukraine's capital with missiles and drones early Saturday morning, killing one person and wounding 27 others, a day before talks between Ukraine and the U.S., local authorities said. Explosions boomed across Kyiv as the attack began in early morning and continued for hours.",
      "The attack came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy  \u00a0prepares to meet with President Trump\u00a0in Florida on Sunday for further talks in an effort to end the nearly four-year-old war.",
      "\"This attack is Russia's answer on our peace efforts. It really shows that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin doesn't want peace,\" Zelenskyy   said after stopping in Canada to meet with Prime Minister Mark Carney in Halifax, Nova Scotia.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said Saturday that it carried out a \"massive strike\" overnight, using \"long-range precision-guided weapons from land, air, and sea, including Kinzhal hypersonic aeroballistic missiles\" and drones, on energy infrastructure facilities \"used by the Ukrainian Armed Forces,\" as well as \"Ukrainian military-industrial complex enterprises.\"",
      "The ministry said the strike came in response to Ukraine's attacks on \"civilian objects\" in Russia.",
      "Earlier on Saturday, the ministry said its air defenses shot down seven Ukrainian drones over the Russian regions of Krasnodar and Adygeya overnight.",
      "Poland scrambled fighter jets and closed airports in Lublin and Rzeszow near the border with Ukraine for several hours during the Russian attacks, the country's armed forces command said on X. There was no violation of Polish airspace, it said. Civil aviation authority Pansa said the two airports had since resumed operations. It was unclear what caused the alert in Poland when the Russian attacks were focused on Kyiv, which is far from the border.",
      "Russia targeted Ukraine with almost 500 drones and 40 missiles of various types, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram. The main target was energy and civilian infrastructure in Kyiv, he said. In some districts of the region there is no electricity or heating because of the attacks, he added.",
      "\"There have been many questions these days. Where is the Russian response to the proposals to end the war, which were made by the United States and the world?\" Zelenskyy said Saturday. \"Russian representatives hold long talks, in reality the 'Kinzal' and 'Shaheds' speak for them,\" he added, a reference to certain types of missiles and drones.",
      "\"His scream is still in my ears\"",
      "There were over 10 damaged residential buildings in the attack, said Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko, in a post on Telegram. People were being evacuated from under the rubble of collapsed buildings.",
      "Olena Karpenko, 52, heard a man as he burned to death in the attack. \"His scream is still in my ears. I can't believe it,\" she said, weeping.",
      "Karpenko said they heard a sudden explosion at the nearby thermal power plant, followed by a stronger blast that shook the windows of her home. Then came the hit on her building.",
      "\"I saw how the apartment was burning, there was a fire and we heard a man's screams, begging for help,\" she said.",
      "Two children were among those wounded in the attack, which hit seven locations across the capital, the head of the Kyiv Military Administration, Tymur Tkachenko, in a statement on Telegram. A body was found under the rubble of one damaged building, he said.",
      "\"In fact, the entire center of Kyiv was under attack by drones,\" he said, adding that Russia was sending a message that \"it is raising the stakes in this war.\"",
      "A fire broke out in an 18-story residential building in the Dnipro district of the city, and emergency crews rushed to the scene to contain the flames. A 24-story residential building in the Darnytsia district was also hit, Tkachenko said, and more fires broke out in the Obolonskyi and Holosiivsky districts.",
      "In the wider Kyiv region, the strikes hit industrial and residential buildings, according to Ukraine's Emergency Service. In the Vyshhorod area, emergency crews rescued one person found under the rubble of a destroyed house.",
      "Russia claims territorial gains",
      "In what could be viewed as an effort to further ramp up pressure on Ukraine before the Zelenskyy-Trump talks, the Kremlin on Saturday night released a video of Putin in military fatigues receiving reports from top military officials in an unidentified military command post.",
      "Russia's General Staff chief, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, reported to Putin that the Russian troops have taken full control of Myrnohrad in the Donetsk region \u2014 Russia uses the old Soviet name of the city, Dimitrov \u2014 the city of Huliaipole in the Zaporizhzhia region, and a few other settlements.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian officials. Ukraine's General Staff reported attempts by Russian forces \"to push Ukrainian defenders from their positions\" in a number of areas, including Myrnohrad, and Kyiv's forces repelling \"enemy attempts to advance\" in the areas of Huliaipole and Bilohiria.",
      "Putin said that \"if Kyiv authorities are not willing to end the matter peacefully, we will achieve all the goals we have in the special military operation by military means.\"",
      "Zelenskyy travels to meet Trump",
      "According to the Agence France-Presse, while in Canada, Zelensky also held a conference call in which he briefed European Union, NATO and European leaders, who gave him their \"full support\" per German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.",
      "EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said in a social media post they welcomed \"a just and lasting peace that preserves Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\"",
      "Carney announced $1.8 billion worth of economic assistance to Ukraine that helps unlock financing from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for reconstruction and development.",
      "In a series of social media posts Saturday evening, Zelenskyy said Ukraine is working with the U.S. on a recovery roadmap to 2040. He estimated that Ukraine will need \"somewhere around\" $700 billion to $800 billion \"for reconstruction.",
      "In one post, Zelenskyy made several requests to the U.S. and Europe, including air defenses and weaponry \u2014 which he said are \"currently insufficient\" \u2014 along with money and drones.",
      "Zelenskyy has said he would prioritize discussing security guarantees for Ukraine when he meets with Mr. Trump. The U.S. has committed to providing guarantees that mirror the NATO alliance's Article 5, which means an attack on Ukraine would trigger a collective military response from the U.S. and its allies. But key details need to be worked out.",
      "Territorial concessions are the most sensitive of issues\u00a0the two leaders will discuss, including the Donetsk region and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Zelenskyy reiterated that Ukraine would never recognize any territory as Russian \"under any circumstances.\"",
      "\"But the most important issue I want to stress today is security guarantees. Beyond territorial issues and the ZNPP (nuclear plant), security guarantees are critically important for us,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Thailand and Cambodia signed a ceasefire agreement on Saturday after weeks of deadly fighting along their border.",
    "story": [
      "Thailand and Cambodia signed a ceasefire agreement on Saturday after\u00a0weeks of deadly fighting\u00a0along their border over competing territorial claims.",
      "The neighbors' long-standing border conflict reignited this month, shattering an earlier truce and killing at least 47 people, according to official counts. Around one million people have also been displaced.",
      "The agreement took effect at noon local time and calls for a halt in military movements and airspace violation for military purposes.",
      "Only Thailand has carried out airstrikes, hitting sites in Cambodia as recently as Saturday morning, according to the Cambodian Defense Ministry.",
      "The deal also calls for Thailand, after the ceasefire has held for 72 hours, to repatriate 18 Cambodian soldiers it has held as prisoners since earlier fighting in July. Their release has been a major demand of the Cambodian side.",
      "Within hours of the signing, Thailand's Foreign Ministry protested to Cambodia that a Thai soldier sustained a permanent disability when he stepped on an anti-personnel land mine it charged had been laid by Cambodian forces.",
      "Defense ministers met at the border to sign the agreement",
      "The agreement was signed by the countries' defense ministers, Cambodia's Tea Seiha and Thailand's Nattaphon Narkphanit, at a border checkpoint. It followed three-day lower-level talks by military officials.",
      "It declares that the sides are committed to an earlier ceasefire that ended five days of fighting in July and follow-up agreements.",
      "The original July ceasefire was brokered by Malaysia and pushed through by pressure from\u00a0U.S. President Donald Trump, who threatened to withhold trade privileges unless Thailand and Cambodia agreed. It was formalized in more detail in October at a regional meeting in Malaysia that Trump attended. Despite those deals, the countries carried on a bitter propaganda war and minor cross-border violence continued, escalating in early December to widespread heavy fighting.",
      "Many clauses similar to those in Saturday's agreement were included in October's ceasefire document, and were open to various interpretations and generally honored only in part. These included provisions concerning land mines and the Cambodian prisoners.",
      "The fragility of the new agreement was underlined by Thailand's Defense Ministry spokesperson Surasant Kongsiri in a news briefing after Saturday's signing. He said that the safe return of civilians to their homes would indicate the situation had stabilized enough to allow the repatriation of the captured Cambodian soldiers.",
      "\"However if the ceasefire does not materialize, this would indicate a lack of sincerity on the Cambodian side to create sure peace,\" he said. \"Therefore, the 72-hour ceasefire beginning today is not an act of trust nor unconditional acceptance but a time frame to tangibly prove whether Cambodia can truly cease the use of weapons, provocations and threats in the area.\"",
      "Civilians bore the brunt of the fighting",
      "Thailand has lost 26 soldiers and one civilian as a direct result of the combat since Dec. 7, according to officials. Thailand has also reported 44 civilian deaths.",
      "Cambodia hasn't issued an official figure on military casualties, but says that 30 civilians have been killed and 90 injured. Hundreds of thousands of people have been evacuated on both sides of the border.",
      "\"Today's ceasefire also paves the way for the displaced people who are living in the border areas to be able to return to their homes, work in the fields, and even allow their children to be able to return to schools and resume their studies,\" Cambodia's Defense Minister Tea Seiha told reporters after the signing.",
      "Each side blamed the other for initiating the fighting and claimed to be acting in self-defense.",
      "The agreement also calls on both sides to adhere to international agreements against deploying land mines, a major concern of Thailand.",
      "Thai soldiers along the border have been wounded in at least 10 incidents this year by what Thailand says were newly planted Cambodian mines. Cambodia says the mines were left over from decades of civil war that ended in the late 1990s.",
      "Following the latest injury on Saturday, Thailand's Foreign Ministry noted that the new agreement \"includes key provisions on joint humanitarian demining operations to ensure the safety of military personnel and civilians in the border areas as soon as possible.\"",
      "Another clause says the two sides \"agree to refrain from disseminating false information or fake news.\"",
      "The agreement calls for a resumption of previous measures to demarcate the border. The sides also agreed to cooperate in suppressing transnational crimes. That's primarily a reference to\u00a0online scams perpetrated by organized crime that have bilked victims around the world of billions of dollars each year. Cambodia is a center for such criminal enterprises.",
      "World leaders hail the agreement",
      "Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who was instrumental in putting together the original ceasefire, said the new agreement \"reflects a shared recognition that restraint is required, above all in the interest of civilians.\"",
      "The European Union also welcomed the agreement, and called on \"both sides to implement it in good faith.\" EU foreign affairs spokesperson Anouar El Anouni thanked the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which both Cambodia and Thailand are members, for \"playing a positive part in the result,\" in a social media post.",
      "\"The EU stands ready to provide any support needed,\" El Anouni said.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement Saturday that the United States welcomed the agreement and urged the two countries to \"immediately honor this commitment and fully implement the terms of the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords.\"",
      "The office of United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk said he \"welcomes news that Thailand and Cambodia have resumed a ceasefire and hopes this will pave the way for confidence building and peace.\"",

    "summary": "Strikes against ISIS targets in Nigeria come after President Trump spent weeks accusing the West African country's government of failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Thursday that the U.S. launched \"powerful and deadly\" strikes against Islamic State forces in Nigeria, after spending weeks accusing the West African country's government of failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.",
      "\"Tonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even Centuries!\" Mr. Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \"I have previously warned these Terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not provide further details on the strikes, such as how many people were killed, who or what was specifically targeted, or how many strikes were carried out, other than to say they were \"numerous perfect strikes.\"",
      "U.S. Africa Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in Africa, said in a statement that its \"initial assessment is that multiple ISIS terrorists were killed in the ISIS camps.\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted on X: \"The President was clear last month: the killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria (and elsewhere) must end. \"The @DeptofWar is always ready, so ISIS found out tonight \u2014 on Christmas. More to come\u2026 Grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation.\"",
      "The Defense Department posted to its X account\u00a0an unclassified 9-second video that appeared to show a missile being launched from a military vessel.",
      ".@POTUS \u201cTonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ct7rUW128t",
      "In its own statement, Nigeria's foreign ministry acknowledged the strikes\u00a0and indicated that it was given advanced notice, saying that \"Nigerian authorities remain engaged in structured security cooperation with international partners, including the United States of America, in addressing the persistent threat of terrorist and violent extremism. This has led to precision hits on terrorist targets in Nigeria by air strikes in the North West.\"",
      "\"Terrorist violence in any form, whether directed at Christians, Muslims or other communities, remains an affront to Nigeria's values and to international peace and security,\" the ministry added.",
      "Nigerian\u00a0 Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar went further, telling a local television network his nation provided the U.S. with intelligence on jihadists before the raids, French news agency AFP reported. It quoted him as saying he spoke by phone with Secretary of State Marco Rubio \"for 19 minutes before the strike and then we spoke again for another five minutes before it went on.\"",
      "Asked if there would be more strikes, Tuggar said: \"It is an ongoing thing, and we are working with the U.S. We are working with other countries as well.\"",
      "In early November, Mr. Trump said that he had instructed the Pentagon to \"prepare for possible action\" in Nigeria after he alleged that Nigeria's government was not doing enough to combat the persecution of Christians there.",
      "\"If we attack, it will be fast, vicious and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians! WARNING: THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT BETTER MOVE FAST!\" Mr. Trump wrote on Nov. 1.",
      "In response at the time, Hegseth wrote on social media that the Department of War, the Trump administration's preferred term for the Defense Department, was \"preparing for action.\"",
      "This comes about a week after the U.S. conducted a series of strikes on ISIS targets in Syria in response to the killing of two U.S. soldiers and an interpreter.",
      "Mr. Trump in November also said he would be designating Nigeria as a \"country of particular concern.\"",
      "Designating a \"country of particular concern\" under the\u00a01998 International Religious Freedom Act\u00a0is an executive prerogative that normally follows recommendations from both the congressionally mandated U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and the State Department.",
      "The State Department usually releases\u00a0its annual\u00a0Report on International Religious Freedom in the spring, but has not yet done so this year. The report may or may not include \"particular concern\" designations, which can be done at any time. And, such designations, which authorize U.S. penalties, do not necessarily impose sanctions.",
      "The Nigerian government has rejected Mr. Trump's claims that it is not doing enough to protect Christians from violence. Analysts have said that while Christians are among those targeted, the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria's Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur. Earlier Thursday, at least five people were killed and dozens more injured in an explosion at a mosque in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri.",
      "Nigeria's President Bola Ahmed Tinubu previously said on social media that the characterization of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country does not reflect the national reality.",
      "\"Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so,\" Tinubu said. \"Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it. Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.\"",
      "Nigeria was first placed on the \"country of particular concern\"\u00a0list\u00a0by the U.S. in 2020 in what the State Department called \"systematic violations of religious freedom.\" But the designation did not single out attacks on Christians. The designation was lifted in 2023 in what many saw as a way to improve ties between the countries ahead of a visit by then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken.",

    "summary": "Flat-headed cats are among the world's most threatened wild felines.",
    "story": [
      "An elusive wild cat long feared extinct in Thailand has been rediscovered three decades after the last recorded sighting, conservation authorities and an NGO said Friday.",
      "Flat-headed cats are among the world's most threatened wild felines, with the International Union for Conservation of Nature estimating that just 2,500 adults exist in the wild. The rare animals are about the size of a domestic cat and have distinctive, round, close-set eyes.",
      "Flat-headed cats are found only in Southeast Asia and typically live in dense wetland ecosystems like peat swamps and freshwater mangroves. Such areas are under threat: Thailand's peat swamp forests have been heavily fragmented, largely due to land conversion and agricultural expansion, said veterinarian and researcher Kaset Sutasha of Kasetsart University. The last confirmed sighting of a flat-headed cat in Thailand was in 1995.",
      "Last year, wild cat conservation organization Panthera and Thailand's Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation began an ecological survey that used camera traps in the country's Princess Sirindhorn Wildlife Sanctuary.",
      "Flat-headed cats were detected 29 times during the survey, Panthera and Thai officials said. It was not immediately clear how many individuals the detections represent, as the species lacks distinctive markings, so counting is tricky. Pattanarangsan said the survey's findings suggest a relatively high concentration of the species.",
      "The footage included a female flat-headed cat with her cub \u2014 a rare and encouraging sign for a species that typically produces only one offspring at a time. The species has also struggled to reproduce across isolated areas, contributing to its endangerment.",
      "Kaset, who was not involved in the survey but has researched wild cats for years, said the \"rediscovery is exciting\" but is only a \"starting point\" for future conservation efforts.",
      "\"What comes after this is more important \u2014 how to enable them to live alongside us sustainably, without being threatened,\" Kaset said.",
      "In addition to Thailand, flat-headed cats can be found in Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo, according to the Felidae Conservation Fund. They have a diet dominated by fish, frogs and shrimp, and are nocturnal, elusive animals.",
      "Much about the species remains a mystery because of their rarity and the difficulty of accessing their habitats, Panthera conservation program manager Rattapan Pattanarangsan said.",

    "story": [
      "Tehran, Iran \u2014 Iran seized a foreign oil tanker as it traveled the strategic Strait of Hormuz, state media said Friday.",
      "Mojtaba Ghahramani, a provincial chief of the justice department, said the oil tanker was carrying some 4 million liters (25,000 barrels) of smuggled fuel when the Revolutionary Guard naval forces seized the vessel, the official IRNA news agency reported.",
      "Ghahramani said the forces also detained 16 foreign crew members of the tanker, adding that the seizure was a remarkable \"blow \" to smugglers. He didn't disclose the nationality of the crew or the flag of the tanker.",
      "Iran occasionally seizes oil-carrying vessels over similar charges in the region. In November, Iran seized a ship as it traveled through the narrow Strait of Hormuz over what it said were violations, including carrying an illegal consignment.",
      "The West has blamed Iran for a series of limpet mine attacks on vessels that damaged tankers in 2019, as well as for a drone attack on an Israeli-linked oil tanker that killed two European crew members in 2021. Those attacks began after President Trump, in his first term in office, unilaterally withdrew from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.",
      "Iran also seized the Portuguese-flagged cargo ship MSC Aries in April 2024.",
      "Following years of tensions between Iran and the West, coupled with the situation in the Gaza Strip, Iran saw a full-scale 12-day war in June with Israel, whose strikes led to the deaths of senior military commanders and nuclear scientists. Iran's retaliatory missile barrage killed 28 in Israel.",
      "Tehran has long threatened to close off the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all traded oil passes. The U.S. Navy has long patrolled the Mideast through its Bahrain-based 5th Fleet to keep the waterways open.",

    "summary": "King Charles III led his family to church on foot ahead of his annual Christmas Day speech that is expected to focus on pilgrimage.",
    "story": [
      "King Charles III and members of the royal family \u2014 minus his disgraced brother, the former Prince Andrew \u2014 gathered for Christmas at the king's private Sandringham Estate, where they traditionally spend the holiday. In the king's annual Christmas speech, broadcast across Britain and the Commonwealth, he stressed the importance of both unity and diversity.",
      "In the morning, Charles and Queen Camilla, along with the Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Kate, their children and extended family members, walked to services at St. Mary Magdalene Church at Sandringham, in Norfolk, about 100 miles north of London.",
      "Members of the royal family also stopped to greet people in the crowd outside.",
      "Andrew was not present for the holiday gathering, BBC News reported, in the wake of the\u00a0scandal over his ties to the late sex offender\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein. He\u00a0did not attend last year either. In October, he was\u00a0stripped of his remaining titles and honors, including prince, and is now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.",
      "Later in the day, the king's annual Christmas Day speech was watched by millions of people in the U.K. and across the Commonwealth, an association of 56 nations with historic ties to Britain.",
      "\"As I meet people of different faiths, I find it enormously encouraging to hear how much we have in common, a shared longing for peace and a deep respect for all life,\" Charles said in his address, which was recorded earlier this month at Westminster Abbey.",
      "Amid \"division both at home and abroad,\" he said, there are \"values of which we must never lose sight.\"",
      "\"With the great diversity of our communities, we can find the strength to ensure that right triumphs over wrong.\"",
      "Westminster Abbey, in the heart of London, is where monarchs have been crowned since William the Conqueror in 1066, and it has also been the site of numerous royal weddings.",
      "The speech was accompanied by a video of members of the royal family, including scenes from the king's historic trip to the Vatican, where he prayed with\u00a0Pope Leo XIV in an effort to forge closer relations between the Church of England and the Catholic Church.",
      "The speech is one of the rare occasions when Charles, 77, can voice his own views and doesn't seek guidance from the government. The remarks typically have a strong religious framework, reflect current issues and sometimes draw on the monarch's personal experiences.",
      "The king's speech was followed by a performance by a Ukrainian choir and London's Royal Opera Chorus, in a sign of support for Ukraine in its war against Russia's invasion.",
      "This was Charles' fourth Christmas speech since ascending to the throne after his mother,\u00a0Queen Elizabeth II, died in September 2022.",
      "The address comes just two weeks after Charles made a deeply personal television appearance in which he said \"good news\" from his doctors meant that he would be able to reduce his treatment for cancer in the new year.",
      "The king was diagnosed with a still undisclosed form of cancer in early 2024. Buckingham Palace says his treatment is now moving to a \"precautionary phase\" and his condition will be monitored to ensure his continued recovery.",
      "During last year's Christmas address, Charles honored care workers around the country and gave a special thanks to the doctors and nurses who supported him after his cancer diagnosis.",
      "Catherine, Princess of Wales, also underwent treatment for cancer last year. She said in January that she was in remission\u00a0after going through some \"hard times\" during her recovery. Kate, as she is widely called, has not shared details about what type of cancer it was.",
      "She and her husband Prince William, the\u00a0heir to the throne, have three children: 12-year-old Prince George of Wales, 10-year-old Princess Charlotte of Wales and 7-year-old Prince Louis of Wales.",

    "summary": "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced a national bravery award to honor those who confronted an antisemitic terror attack.",
    "story": [
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced plans Thursday for a national bravery award to recognize civilians and first responders who confronted \"the worst of evil\" during an antisemitic\u00a0terror attack that left 15 dead and has cast a heavy shadow over the nation's holiday season.",
      "Albanese said he plans to establish a special honors system for those who placed themselves in harm's way to help during the attack on a beachside Hanukkah celebration, like Ahmed al Ahmed, a Syrian-Australian Muslim who disarmed one of the assailants before being wounded himself.",
      "The attackers, identified as Sajid Akram, who was killed by police during the Dec. 14 attack, and his 24-year-old son Naveed Akram, are accused of perpetrating Australia's worst massacre since 1996.",
      "Speaking at a press conference after a Christmas Day lunch at a charitable foundation in Sydney, Albanese described a holiday season defined by a sharp contrast between extremist violence and the \"best of humanity.\"",
      "\"This Christmas is a different one because of the anti-terror and the terrorist attack motivated by ISIS and antisemitism,\" Albanese said. \"But at the same time as we have seen the worst of humanity, we have seen the bravery and kindness and compassion ... from those who rushed to danger.\"",
      "Acts of heroism amid the tragedy",
      "The proposed honors would recognize those who are nominated and recommended for bravery or meritorious awards under the existing Australian Honors and Awards system for their actions during and after the attack. Officials have not yet said who would be honored.",
      "In the days after Ahmed's story came to light, members of the public donated more than $1.5 million\u00a0to aid the 44-year-old father and shop owner who was seen on video tackling one of the gunmen from behind and wrestling the rifle from his hands. He was shot multiple times in the left arm, apparently by the second gunman, and was expected to face months of recovery.",
      "\"Ahmed did really a heroic job,\" his cousin, Mohammad al Ahmed, told The Associated Press. \"Without any hesitation, he tackled the terrorist and disarmed him just to save innocent people.\"",
      "Other accounts of heroism also emerged, including acts of extraordinary bravery by victims who did not survive.",
      "They included a married couple in their 60s,\u00a0Boris and Sofia Gurman, who were seen on video trying to stop the attack just before it unfolded. In the footage, Boris Gurman can be seen grabbing a rifle from one of the two gunmen as they unloaded multiple weapons from their car, which had an ISIS flag draped across the windshield. Moments later, the Gurmans were shot and killed.",
      "\"This encapsulates who Boris and Sofia were \u2014 people who instinctively and selflessly tried to help others,\" their family said in a statement.",
      "Another man, 62-year-old Reuven Morrison, was shot dead as he pelted one of the attackers with bricks.",
      "\"From my sources and understanding, he had jumped up the second the shooting started. He managed to throw bricks at the terrorist,\" his daughter, Sheina Gutnick, told CBS News the day after the attack. His actions were also captured on video.",
      "Gutnick berated the government and police for being \"untrained for this massacre, untrained for what's to come, untrained for what the Jewish community has been telling the Australian government is inevitable,\" adding to a chorus of\u00a0criticism after a documented rise in hate attacks\u00a0targeting Australia's Jewish residents.",
      "An American who was at the Bondi Beach event, Rabbi Leibel Lazaroff, ran over to help a police officer who was shot, taking off his own shirt to use as a tourniquet, his father told CBS News. Moments later, Lazaroff was also shot and wounded, and his mentor was killed. \"As I was talking to Leibel, he said, 'I wish I could have done more,'\" his father said.",
      "Australia strengthening gun laws",
      "Just a day after pushing through the country's toughest firearm laws, New South Wales state leader Chris Minns issued a plea for national solidarity, urging Australians to support their Jewish neighbors during what he described as a fortnight of \"heartbreak and pain.\"",
      "\"Everybody in Australia needs to wrap their arms around them and lift them up,\" Minns said at a news conference Thursday. \"I want them to know that Australians have got their back. We're in their corner and we're going to help them get through this.\"",
      "The gun reforms, which passed through the New South Wales state legislature on Christmas Eve, include capping individual gun ownership at four and reclassifying high-risk weapons like pump-action firearms.",
      "The legislation also tightens licensing by reducing permit terms to two years, restricting ownership to Australian citizens and removing the review pathway for license denials.",
      "\"Gun reform alone will not solve hatred or extremism, but we can't fail to act on restricting access to weapons which could lead to further violence against our citizens, Minns said earlier in the week when introducing the proposed laws.",
      "Other new laws will ban the public display of terrorist symbols and grant police expanded powers to restrict public gatherings in specific areas following terrorist incidents.",
      "Albanese has also announced plans to tighten Australia's already strict gun laws.",

      "Talk show host\u00a0Jimmy Kimmel\u00a0took aim at President Trump as he warned Thursday about the rise of fascism in an address to U.K. viewers dubbed \"The Alternative Christmas Message.\"",
      "The message, aired on Channel 4 on Christmas Day, reflected on the impact of the second term in office for Mr. Trump, who Kimmel said acts like he's a king.",
      "\"From a fascism perspective, this has been a really great year,\" he said. \"Tyranny is booming over here.\"",
      "The channel began a tradition of airing an alternative Christmas message in 1993, as a counterpart to the\u00a0British monarch's annual televised address\u00a0to the nation. Channel 4 said the message is often a thought-provoking and personal reflection pertinent to the events of the year.",
      "The comedian has skewered Mr. Trump since returning to the air after ABC suspended\u00a0\"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"\u00a0in September following criticism of comments the host made over the killing of conservative activist\u00a0Charlie Kirk.",

      "\"We won, the president lost, and now I'm back on the air every night giving the most powerful politician on earth a right and richly deserved bollocking,\" he said.",
      "Channel 4 previously invited whistle-blower Edward Snowden and former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to deliver the alternative Christmas message.",
      "Kimmel, who said he didn't expect Brits to know who he was, warned that silencing critics is not just something that happens in Russia or North Korea.",
      "Despite the split that led to the American Revolution 250 years ago, he said the two nations still shared a special relationship and urged the U.K. not to give up on the U.S. as it was \"going through a bit of a wobble right now.\"",
      "\"Here in the United States right now, we are both figuratively and literally tearing down the structures of our democracy from the free press to science to medicine to judicial independence to the actual White House itself,\" Kimmel said, in reference to the demolition of the building's East Wing. \"We are a right mess, and we know this is also affecting you, and I just wanted to say sorry.\"",

      "In an Instagram post, Bolsonaro's wife, Michelle Bolsonaro, said the surgery was a success. The procedure in Brasilia, the nation's capital, lasted about 3\u00bd hours and was completed without complications, according to the family.",
      "Bolsonaro, who has been hospitalized since Wednesday, has been serving a\u00a027-year prison sentence\u00a0since November for an attempted coup.",

      "\"It is a complex surgery,\" Dr. Claudio Birolini said on Wednesday, according to Agence France-Presse. \"But it is a standardized... scheduled surgery, so we expect the procedure to be carried out without major complications.\"",
      "Doctors say Bolsonaro's double hernia causes him pain. The former leader, who was in power between 2019 and 2022, has gone through several other surgeries since he was stabbed in the abdomen during a campaign rally in 2018.",
      "Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversaw Bolsonaro's coup trial and sentenced him to prison, authorized the procedure but denied the former president's request for house arrest after he leaves the hospital.",
      "Bolsonaro doesn't have any contact with the few other inmates at the federal police headquarters in Brasilia, where he is held and where his around 130-square-foot room has a bed, a private bathroom, air conditioning, a television and a desk, according to authorities.",
      "He has free access to his doctors and lawyers, but other visitors must receive approval from the Supreme Court. On Wednesday, de Moraes authorized Bolsonaro's sons to visit him while he's hospitalized.",

      "Early Thursday, his eldest son, Sen. Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro, told reporters before the surgery that his father had written a letter confirming he had appointed him as his political party's presidential candidate in next year's election. Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro announced on Dec. 5 that he will challenge\u00a0President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who is seeking a fourth nonconsecutive term, as the candidate of Bolsonaro's Liberal Party.",
      "The senator read the letter to journalists, and his office released a reproduction of it to the media.",
      "\"He represents the continuation of the path of prosperity that I began well before becoming president, as I believe we must restore the responsibility of leading Brazil with justice, resolve and loyalty to the aspirations of the Brazilian people,\" Bolsonaro said in the handwritten letter, dated Dec. 25.",
      "The former president and several of his allies were convicted by a panel of Supreme Court justices for attempting to overthrow Brazil's democratic system following his 2022 election defeat.",
      "The plot included plans to kill Lula, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin and de Moraes. There was also a plan to encourage an insurrection in early 2023.",

      "Emma Heming Willis recently wrote a deeply personal essay on her website about navigating the holidays as her husband battles dementia. (Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images)",
      "\"He loved this time of year \u2014 the energy, the family time, the traditions. He was the pancake maker, the get-out-in-the-snow-with-the-kids guy, the steady presence moving through the house as the day unfolded. There was comfort in the routine of knowing exactly how the day would go, especially since I\u2019m a creature of habit.\"",
      "\"Dementia doesn\u2019t erase those memories,\" the mother of two shared. \"But it does create space between then and now. And that space can ache.\"",

      "In 2022, Willis\u2019 family announced he had been diagnosed with aphasia, a condition that causes loss of the ability to understand or express speech. Nearly a year later, the family said the actor had received a more specific diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD).",
      "The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration describes FTD as a group of brain disorders caused by degeneration of the frontal and/or temporal lobes of the brain, which affects behavior, language and movement, according to\u00a0The Associated Press. Aphasia can be a symptom of it.",
      "The association describes frontotemporal degeneration as \"an inevitable decline in functioning,\" with an average life expectancy of seven to 13 years after the onset of symptoms. The progressive disease is terminal, and there is no cure.",

      "\"Grief during the holidays can show up in unexpected ways,\" wrote Emma. \"It can arrive while pulling decorations out of storage, wrapping gifts or hearing a familiar song. It can catch you off guard in the middle of a room full of people, or in the quiet moment when everyone else has gone to bed.\"",

      "\"I find myself, harmlessly, cursing Bruce\u2019s name while wrestling with the holiday lights or taking on tasks that used to be his,\" she wrote. \"Not because I\u2019m mad at him \u2014 never that \u2014 but because I miss the way he once led the holiday charge. Yes, he taught me well, but I\u2019m still allowed to feel annoyed that this is one more reminder of how things have changed.\"",
      "The holidays, which once brought \"uncomplicated joy,\" can now arrive \"tangled in a web of grief,\" she said.",

When dementia is part of your family, \u2018normal\u2019 becomes a moving target.\"",

It\u2019s adapting. It\u2019s choosing compassion and reality over perfection. It\u2019s understanding that meaning doesn\u2019t live in the size of the gathering or the polish of the day. It lives in presence.\"",
      "\"Grief is not a sign of ingratitude. It\u2019s a sign of love,\" she stressed.",

      "\"There\u2019s no denying that the holidays are different now. But different doesn\u2019t mean empty. It doesn\u2019t mean broken. It doesn\u2019t mean devoid of meaning. There is still connection. There is still love. There is still joy to be had. And if this season feels heavy for you, please know that you\u2019re not alone. You\u2019re not doing it wrong. And there is no single \u2018right\u2019 way to move through this time of year when dementia is part of your life. There is only your way. And that is enough.\"",

But I think what has also helped me is the advocacy part of all this, being able to use my voice to help somebody else. That has been really comforting to me, to be able to share what I\u2019ve learned along the way.

      "The findings could help explain why some heart treatments work better on one side than the other. (iStock)",

      "From TikTok routines to old-school military tactics and high-tech machines, this year's fitness trends promised big results with surprisingly simple moves \u2014 but experts say not all gains are created equal.",

      "NAVY VET REVEALS THE DAILY MOVEMENT AND NUTRITION HABITS THAT KEEP HIM FIT AFTER 35",
      "No. 1: 12-3-30 treadmill trend",
      "The 12-3-30 workout \u2014 which entails walking at a 12% incline at 3 mph for 30 minutes \u2014 exploded on TikTok and is now supported by research. A new study compared it to \"self-paced\" treadmill running, matching total calories burned between the two.",
      "The 12-3-30 workout entails walking at a 12% incline at 3 mph for 30 minutes. (iStock)",
      "Running burned energy faster \u2014 roughly 13 calories per minute versus 10 calories per minute for 12-3-30, the study found. The walking method used more fat as fuel, however, with about 41% of energy coming from fat, compared to 33% with running.",
      "Maelee Wells Sutton, a certified personal trainer at Crunch Fitness in New York, previously told Fox News Digital it's \"no surprise\" that higher-intensity running burns calories faster. \"Walking at 12-3-30 is certainly more intense than walking on a flat surface, but is less intense than a run,\" she noted.",
      "No. 2: Weighted vests",
      "Weighted vests, long used in military training, resurfaced as a social media craze this year, with TikTok searches for #weightedvest drawing more than 30 million views.",

      "THE BEST WEIGHTED VESTS TO POWER UP ANY WORKOUT",
      "\"You turn everyday walking into a slightly more demanding workout without changing the movement,\" the Atlanta-based doctor added.",
      "Weighted vests, long used in military training, resurfaced as a social media craze this year. (iStock)",
      "Research shows weighted vests can increase calorie burn and cardiovascular demand, but long-term outcomes are mixed.",
      "\"Focus on posture, and slowly add weight over time,\" Kovacs advised. \"Always listen to your body. Discomfort is a sign to back off.\"",
      "No. 3: Jiu-jitsu for family fitness, self-defense",
      "Sparked by high-profile users like Ivanka Trump and Gisele B\u00fcndchen, jiu-jitsu is getting new attention as both a workout and a life skill.",

      "Beyond self-defense, the trainers frame jiu-jitsu as a way to build presence and emotional control.",

      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "On the fitness side, Gui Valente highlighted the full-body demand of jiu jitsu: \"You work every single muscle in your body, in different ways. You have to be able to develop great stamina \u2026 as well as flexibility and mobility.\"",
      "No. 4: TikTok\u2019s 50-jump wake-up ritual",
      "Another popular fitness trend in 2025 was simply to get out of bed in the morning and jump 50 times.",
      "Kathryn Smith, creator of the trend, admitted that she\u2019s not naturally disciplined. \"I am a lazy person by nature. I always have been. I'm never gonna do something that I don't want to do,\" she says in her TikTok clip.",
      "One viral morning jumping routine involves hopping 50 times after getting out of bed to boost energy, circulation and mood. (iStock)",
      "\"How I've gotten to the point I am right now has been very, very, very baby steps. So, the first thing is morning jumping \u2026 What I do when I get out of bed, my feet touch the ground, I jump 50 times.\"",

      "Sports nutrition expert Maura MacDonald said the trend caught on due to its ease of access. \"It\u2019s a lot easier to get out of bed and jump 50 times than to lace up your sneakers and head out for a run, or go to the gym and do deadlifts,\" she previously told Fox News Digital.",
      "No. 5: Vibration plates for \u2018effortless\u2019 training",
      "Vibration plates \u00a0\u2014 platforms that use whole-body vibration \u2014 are trending as a potential shortcut for fat loss and strength.",

    "story": [
      "Dr. Daryl Gioffre, a gut health specialist in Naples, Florida, speaks with Fox News Digital about when acid reflux can lead to more dangerous medical conditions, and how to prevent damage.",
      "For most people, heartburn is an occasional annoyance and source of temporary discomfort. But for some, chronic heartburn can lead to more dangerous conditions \u2014 potentially even pre-cancerous ones.",
      "About 10% of people with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) will develop Barrett\u2019s esophagus, a condition where the lining of the lower esophagus is replaced with abnormal cells that are more prone to cancer, according to medical experts.",
      "Some studies have shown that among those with Barrett\u2019s esophagus, between 3% and 13% will go on to develop cancer, but most will not.",
      "POPULAR SLEEP POSITIONS COULD BE DAMAGING YOUR NERVES, ACCORDING TO EXPERTS",
      "When acid reflux becomes dangerous",
      "\"Your stomach is designed to handle acid. Your esophagus is not,\" Dr. Daryl Gioffre, a Florida-based gut health specialist and certified nutritionist, told Fox News Digital.",
      "About 10% of people with chronic acid reflux will develop Barrett\u2019s esophagus, a condition where the lining of the lower esophagus is replaced with abnormal cells that are more prone to cancer. (iStock)",
      "\"With reflux, the danger is not the burn in the chest or throat \u2014 the real danger is the constant backflow of acid traveling the wrong way.\"",
      "In most people, the lower esophageal sphincter \u2014 which Gioffre refers to as the \"acid gate\" \u2014 keeps acid in the stomach, which is lined with thick mucus and specialized cells designed to protect it.",
      "\"With reflux, the danger is not the burn in the chest or throat \u2014 the real danger is the constant backflow of acid traveling the wrong way.\"",
      "\"But when the gate gets weak, it relaxes or stays slightly open, and acid slips back up the wrong way,\" he said. This \"gate\" can weaken with magnesium deficiency, high stress, alcohol, poor sleep, dehydration and late-night snacking, all of which can disrupt healthy digestion.",
      "When acid hits the esophagus, it irritates tissue that was never designed to withstand it, according to the doctor.",
      "\"Every time acid comes back up the wrong way, it injures the lining like a slow chemical burn,\" said Gioffre, who is also the author of \"Get Off Your Acid\" and \"Get Off Your Sugar.\" Over time, that irritation erodes the lining, drives inflammation and can change the cells.",
      "NOT ALL FIBER IS CREATED EQUAL \u2014 DOCTORS SHARE WHICH KINDS TRULY SUPPORT LONGEVITY",
      "\"These new cells are no longer normal esophageal cells \u2014 they begin to shift into cells that look more like stomach lining, because those cells can tolerate the acid,\" the doctor said. \"That change is called metaplasia, or Barrett\u2019s esophagus.\"",
      "Once the cells start changing, the risk of further mutation goes up. If that process continues, Gioffre warned, it can progress to dysplasia, which is the stage right before esophageal cancer.",
      "Some studies have shown that among those with Barrett\u2019s esophagus, between 3% and 13% will go on to develop cancer. (iStock)",
      "\"So the real danger is not the heartburn you feel,\" he summarized. \"It is the repeated acid exposure forcing the esophagus to adapt in ways it was never designed to. Fixing reflux at the root stops this entire cascade before those cellular changes begin.\"",
      "Men at higher risk",
      "Men generally have a higher risk because they burn through magnesium faster, tend to carry more visceral fat pushing upward on the stomach, eat heavier meals and snack late at night, Gioffre cautioned. These activities all weaken the acid gate and shut down healthy digestion.",
      "THE BREAD THAT KEEPS THINGS MOVING IN THE BATHROOM \u2014 AND DOCTORS SAY IT REALLY WORKS",
      "\"Eating within three hours of lying down almost guarantees the stomach does not empty, and that is one of the biggest drivers of nighttime reflux,\" he said. \"On top of that, men often ignore symptoms, or mask them with PPIs and antacids instead of fixing the root cause.\"",
      "All of these factors contribute to a \"perfect storm\" for chronic inflammation and long-term damage, according to Gioffre.",
      "Warning signs",
      "There are certain red flags that indicate when acid reflux has gone beyond an occasional annoyance and has progressed to constant and chronic.",
      "\"If that burn becomes more frequent or more intense, or starts showing up even when you have not eaten, your body is waving a giant warning flag,\" Gioffre said.",
      "Difficulty swallowing, a feeling that food is \"stuck,\" chronic hoarseness, a constant cough, throat clearing or the feeling of a lump in the throat are all indicators that the acid is moving upward into areas it should never reach. (iStock)",
      "Difficulty swallowing, a feeling that food is \"stuck,\" chronic hoarseness, a constant cough, throat clearing or the feeling of a lump in the throat are all indicators that the acid is moving upward into areas it should never reach, according to the doctor.",
      "EXPERT WARNS OF 'SILENT EPIDEMIC' THAT PUTS MEN\u2019S HEALTH AT SERIOUS RISK",
      "\"Ulcers in your throat, or even in your mouth, are another sign that the acid is doing real damage,\" he warned.",
      "\"Another major warning sign is when reflux goes from something you notice occasionally to something you feel every day or every night, or when PPIs and antacids stop helping,\" Gioffre said. \"That usually means the lining is irritated and eroded, and may already be changing on a cellular level.\"",
      "Nighttime reflux is the most dangerous because the acid sits on the esophagus for hours, causing deep inflammation and long-term cellular changes, the doctor said. (iStock)",
      "Unexplained weight loss, vomiting blood and black stools are all serious symptoms that demand immediate attention, the doctor added.",
      "\"The bottom line: When reflux becomes consistent, chronic and starts impacting swallowing, your voice, or the tissues in your mouth or throat, it is no longer just a nuisance,\" Gioffre told Fox News Digital. \"That is the point where the esophagus may be moving toward a precancerous state, and men especially cannot afford to wait on it.\"",

      "Gioffre shared the following essential steps to preventing acid reflux and improving digestive health.",

      "Nighttime reflux is the most dangerous because the acid sits on the esophagus for hours, causing deep inflammation and long-term cellular changes, he warned. \"This one rule alone can dramatically lower acid reflux and cancer risk.\"",

      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"The fastest way to tighten that gate is to build your mineral reserves, especially magnesium,\" he said.",
      "The best way to do this is to load up on magnesium-rich foods like avocado, spinach, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds, quinoa and almonds, and consider adding a clean magnesium supplement.",
      "The fastest way to protect your esophagus, according to Gioffre, is to eliminate or neutralize the foods and habits that weaken the acid gate and push acid the wrong way.",
      "For people who can\u2019t fully eliminate these triggers, certain habits can help neutralize their impact by reducing acid strength and pressure before it reaches the esophagus.",
      "The doctor recommends cutting back on alcohol and caffeine, both of which relax the acid gate and increase the risk of acid reflux. (iStock)",
      "\"Drinking most of your water earlier in the day helps, because pounding water at night stretches the stomach and relaxes the acid gate, making it much easier for acid to flow the wrong way once you lie down,\" he said.",
      "He also recommends cutting back on alcohol and caffeine, both of which relax the acid gate instantly.",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "Some other major triggers that fuel the reflux cycle include chocolate, spicy foods, garlic, onions, sugar, ultraprocessed foods and heavy nighttime meals, according to the doctor.",
      "\"These foods and habits weaken the lower esophageal sphincter, drive up inflammation and push pressure upward,\" he said. \"That\u2019s exactly how a little heartburn turns into chronic reflux, and slowly causes the kind of damage that puts the esophagus at risk for cancer.\"",

      "It has also been used against departments in New Jersey, Mississippi and Tennessee, as well as a division of the NYPD, for allegations ranging from excessive use of force, to gender bias and allegedly unlawful traffic stops.",

      "On Wednesday, the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund (LELDF) told Fox News Digital it would ask the Trump Justice Department to use the same law in a different respect to investigate progressive Fairfax County Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Steve Descano in Virginia.",
      "Descano, who received at least $600,000 from a George Soros-funded political action committee during his first election bid in Virginia\u2019s largest jurisdiction in 2019, came under fire recently for the nonprosecution of an illegal immigrant who allegedly murdered someone the day after he was released.",
      "LELDF\u2019s request \"seeks to use established federal civil-rights tools to test whether a prosecutor\u2019s office is operating a discriminatory system that endangers the public and erodes equal justice under law,\" the group\u2019s president, Jason C. Johnson told Fox News Digital. LELDF officials will formally ask Deputy Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon to investigate Descano\u2019s office under the same \"pattern-or-practice\" concerns as Biden\u2019s DOJ had in Louisville.",
      "The group alleged the Fairfax Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office \"violat[ed] the civil rights of US citizens by favoring illegal aliens and non-citizens in charging, plea bargaining, and sentencing decisions.\"",
      "They cited Descano\u2019s \"official policy\" to consider \"immigration consequences\" when prosecuting cases.",
      "\"As a federal prosecutor, Steve protected immigrants from criminals who targeted them due to their immigration status\u2026 Steve knows that regardless of immigration status, all our neighbors deserve equal protection of, and equal access to, the law,\" a passage on Descano\u2019s campaign page reads.",
      "\"The fear of law enforcement that Donald Trump has fostered in immigrant communities does nothing but lead to increased crime,\" Descano claimed in backing up his policy.",
      "\"In addition to providing a safe place, Steve\u2019s office will take immigration consequences into account when making charging and plea decisions. Although prosecutors typically refer to immigration consequences as \u2018collateral consequences,\u2019 avoiding the unnecessary destruction of families and communities will be a top priority for Steve as Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney. Wherever possible, Steve will make charging and plea decisions that limit or avoid immigration consequences.\"",
      "That type of prosecutorial discretion runs afoul of the law, LELDF claimed in their letter to Dhillon.",

      "Marvin Morales-Ortez was arrested by Fairfax County Police. (DHS)",
      "They pointed to the case of Marvin Morales-Ortez, who reportedly had first-degree murder charges stemming from a 2019 incident dropped by Descano\u2019s office \u2014 which in turn told Washington\u2019s ABC affiliate their evidence showed it was \"clear that he was ultimately not the perpetrator who had killed Mr. [Jose] Guillen Mejia.\"",
      "Nick Minock, a reporter for the outlet, later obtained a transcript of Morales-Ortez\u2019 preliminary hearing where Descano\u2019s office posited that Morales-Ortez was present when Guillen Mejia was murdered and had ambushed the man on a walking path.",
      "A short time after he was released, Morales-Ortez allegedly went to a home on Fan Shell Court in Reston, Va. \u2014 near John F. Dulles International Airport \u2014 and allegedly shot a man inside.",
      "That chain of events enraged the Trump administration, with Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin saying that \"Fairfax County politicians [who] push[ed] pushing policies that released this illegal alien from jail\" have \"blood on their hands.\"",
      "In the letter, LELDF argued that \"dozens of illegal aliens like Morales-Ortez have repeatedly received excessive leniency from [Fairfax] under Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Steve Descano.\"",
      "They pointed directly to a passage in a 2020 memo from Descano laying out similar to his campaign page that \"[Assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorneys] shall consider immigration consequences where possible and where doing so accords with justice.\"",
      "LELDF claimed the memo and the policy it forwards directly violates the Constitution and denies U.S. citizens equal protection under the law versus illegal immigrants.",
      "Steve Descano speaks at an event at the Center for American Progress on Dec. 17, 2019. (Getty Images)",
      "\"It is both immoral and unlawful for a government agency to engage in systemic discrimination against U.S. citizens to the benefit of those illegally present,\" the group told Dhillon.",
      "The memo represents the necessary predicate for a federal investigation, they argued, while also taking issue with Fairfax\u2019s \"explicit policy directing prosecutors to weigh immigration consequences, including deportation's \u2018detrimental impact\u2019 on families and communities, while ensuring no better outcomes than for non-immigrants.\"",
      "In a fuller excerpt from the memo, Descano says that when the seriousness of an offense and its harm is significant, the weight of \"potential adverse immigration consequences\" should be \"minimal,\" while the opposite is true for \"less serious\" offenses and those with \"no identifiable victim.\"",
      "In those cases, subordinate prosecutors should \"have greater latitude in negotiating a resolution that takes adverse immigration consequences into account.\"",

      "Kurt the CyberGuy joins 'Fox & Friends' to share his tips to stay safe from online scammers and recent warnings on how AI toys can harm children.",
      "Apple has released emergency security updates to fix two zero-day vulnerabilities that attackers actively exploited in highly targeted attacks.",
      "The company described the activity as an \"extremely sophisticated attack\" aimed at specific individuals. Although Apple did not identify the attackers or victims, the limited scope strongly suggests spyware-style operations rather than widespread cybercrime.",
      "Both flaws affect WebKit, the browser engine behind Safari and all browsers on iOS. As a result, the risk is significant. In some cases, simply visiting a malicious webpage may be enough to trigger an attack.",
      "Below, we break down what these vulnerabilities mean and explain how you can better protect yourself.",

      "The two vulnerabilities are tracked as CVE-2025-43529 and CVE-2025-14174, and Apple confirmed that both were exploited in the same real-world attacks. According to Apple's security bulletin, the flaws were abused on versions of iOS released before iOS 26, and the attacks were limited to \"specific targeted individuals.\"",
      "CVE-2025-43529 is a WebKit use-after-free vulnerability that can lead to arbitrary code execution when a device processes maliciously crafted web content. To put it simply, it allows attackers to run their own code on a device by tricking the browser into mishandling memory. Apple credited Google's Threat Analysis Group with discovering this flaw, which is often a strong indicator of nation-state or commercial spyware activity.",
      "The second flaw, CVE-2025-14174, is also a WebKit issue, this time involving memory corruption. While Apple describes the impact as memory corruption rather than direct code execution, these types of bugs are often chained together with other vulnerabilities to fully compromise a device. Apple says this issue was discovered jointly by Apple and Google's Threat Analysis Group.",
      "In both cases, Apple acknowledged that it was aware of reports confirming active exploitation in the wild. That language is important because Apple typically reserves it for situations where attacks have already occurred, not just theoretical risks. The company says it addressed the bugs through improved memory management and better validation checks, without sharing deeper technical details that could help attackers replicate the exploits.",
      "Devices affected and signs of coordinated disclosure",
      "Apple has released patches across its supported operating systems, including the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, Safari, watchOS, tvOS and visionOS.",
      "According to Apple's advisory, affected devices include iPhone 11 and newer models, multiple generations of iPad Pro, iPad Air from the third generation onward, the eighth-generation iPad and newer and the iPad mini starting with the fifth generation. This covers the vast majority of iPhones and iPads still in active use today.",
      "Apple has patched the flaws across its entire ecosystem. Fixes are available in iOS 26.2 and iPadOS 26.2, iOS 18.7.3 and iPadOS 18.7.3, macOS Tahoe 26.2, tvOS 26.2, watchOS 26.2, visionOS 26.2 and Safari 26.2. Because Apple requires all iOS browsers to use WebKit under the hood, the same underlying issue also affected Chrome on iOS.",

Delaying updates is often the only window attackers need. If you tend to forget about updates, let your devices handle them for you. Enable automatic updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS and Safari. That way, you are protected even if you miss the news or are traveling.",
      "Most WebKit exploits start with malicious web content. Avoid tapping on random links sent over SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram or email unless you are expecting them. If something feels off, open the site later by typing the address yourself.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If you are a journalist, an activist or someone who deals with sensitive information, consider reducing your attack surface. Use Safari only, avoid unnecessary browser extensions, and limit how often you open links inside messaging apps.",
      "Apple's Lockdown Mode is designed specifically for targeted attacks. It restricts certain web technologies, blocks most message attachments, and limits attack vectors commonly used by spyware. It is not for everyone, but it exists for situations like this.",
      "Targeted attacks often start with profiling. The more personal data about you that is floating around online, the easier it is to pick you as a target. Removing data from broker sites and tightening social media privacy settings can lower your visibility.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Unexpected crashes, overheating, sudden battery drain or Safari closing on its own can sometimes be warning signs. These do not automatically mean your device is compromised. However, if something feels consistently wrong, updating immediately and resetting the device is a smart move.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Apple has not shared details about who was targeted or how the attacks were delivered. However, the pattern fits closely with past spyware campaigns that focused on journalists, activists, political figures and others of interest to surveillance operators. With these patches, Apple has now fixed seven zero-day vulnerabilities that were exploited in the wild in 2025 alone. That includes flaws disclosed earlier this year and a backported fix in September for older devices.",

      "Uber Eats uses four-wheeled robots to handle the final stretch of food delivery.",
      "DoorDash wants to help you decide where to eat, not just how your food arrives. The company has launched Zesty, a new artificial intelligence-powered social app built to make finding local restaurants faster and easier.",
      "Zesty is now in public testing in the San Francisco Bay Area and New York. Instead of scrolling through endless reviews, menus and social videos, the app lets you ask an AI chatbot for recommendations in plain language.",
      "Think of it as a digital concierge for food discovery.",

      "How Zesty works",
      "Once you open Zesty and sign in with your DoorDash account, the experience feels familiar and simple. You see nearby restaurants and a chat box where you can type exactly what you want. DoorDash says users can ask prompts like:",
      "The app blends AI search with social discovery, showing photos, comments and saved spots shared by other diners. \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "A low-key dinner in Williamsburg that's good for introverts",
      "Brunch spots good for groups",
      "Romantic dinner with a vintage feel",
      "The AI then curates recommendations by pulling information from DoorDash data, Google Maps, TikTok, Reddit and other sources. According to DoorDash co-founder Andy Fang, the goal is to surface the best suggestions from across the web in one place. Each recommendation includes context such as ratings, social buzz and where the suggestion came from. DoorDash says the results do not imply sponsorships or paid placements.",
      "A social network built around food",
      "Zesty also adds a social layer. Users can post photos, leave comments, follow other diners and share saved spots with friends. If you find a restaurant that looks promising, you can bookmark it for later or send it to someone planning dinner with you. This makes Zesty feel less like a search engine and more like a food-focused social network. It is designed for people who enjoy discovering places through other people's experiences, not just star ratings. For DoorDash, this is a clear shift toward community-driven discovery.",
      "Why DoorDash built Zesty",
      "DoorDash wants to remove friction from the decision process. Instead of bouncing among Google, TikTok, Yelp and delivery apps, Zesty aims to bring everything together in a single guided experience. That approach also aligns with a broader trend. More people already use AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini to plan meals and trips. Zesty aims to offer that same convenience with a strong local and social focus.",
      "Zesty lets users ask for restaurant recommendations in natural language instead of scrolling through endless reviews and menus. (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)",
      "\"At DoorDash, we're always looking for new ways to help people connect with the best of their communities,\" a company spokesperson told CyberGuy. \"We're piloting an app called Zesty to make it easier to discover great nearby restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and more through personalized search and social sharing. Zesty is now in public beta in San Francisco and New York, and we're excited to learn from early testers as we keep shaping what local discovery can look like.\"",
      "Of course, Zesty faces an uphill climb. Many users already rely on Google Maps or existing social apps to find restaurants. Some may not want to download another standalone app, even if it promises better recommendations. Still, Zesty could appeal to users who enjoy food discovery as a social activity. For them, a dedicated network built around local dining may feel more useful than generic search results. DoorDash appears willing to test that idea and see how users respond.\u00a0For now, the company is focused on getting people to use the app, learning what works, and fine-tuning its matching engine. Once that experience feels right, Zesty will expand to more cities.",
      "WOULD YOU EAT AT A RESTAURANT RUN BY AI?",
      "Part of DoorDash's bigger expansion plan",
      "Zesty is not an isolated experiment. It fits into DoorDash's broader push beyond food delivery. Earlier this year, DoorDash rolled out features for in-person dining reservations and in-store rewards. The company also continues to invest heavily in automation and AI-driven logistics.",
      "We reported a few months ago on another major innovation from DoorDash: Dot, its fast new autonomous delivery robot. Dot is designed for short local trips and runs on an AI-powered delivery platform that decides whether an order should be handled by a Dasher, a robot or another method. Together, Zesty and Dot show how DoorDash is trying to own more of the local commerce experience, from discovery to delivery.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you enjoy trying new restaurants, Zesty could save you time and decision fatigue. Instead of reading dozens of reviews, you can ask for exactly what you want and get curated suggestions instantly. For casual diners, the app may feel unnecessary if Google already works fine. For food lovers who like sharing finds and following others with similar tastes, Zesty could become a useful daily tool. It also signals where local discovery may be heading. AI-driven recommendations paired with social proof could soon replace traditional review hunting.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here: Cyberguy.com.",
      "Zesty is now in beta in San Francisco and New York as DoorDash tests and refines its personalized matching experience. (iStock)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Zesty shows DoorDash experimenting with how people choose where to eat, not just how food gets delivered. By combining AI search with social sharing, the company is testing a more conversational and community-driven approach to local discovery. Whether Zesty becomes essential or stays niche will depend on how well it delivers meaningful recommendations. Still, it highlights DoorDash's growing ambition to shape more parts of our everyday local life.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Typing a web address directly into your browser feels harmless. In fact, it feels normal. But new research shows that a simple habit is now one of the riskiest things you can do online. A recent study from cybersecurity firm Infoblox reveals a troubling shift.",
      "Most parked domains now redirect visitors to scams, malware or fake security warnings. In many cases, this happens instantly. You do not have to click anything. That means a single typo can expose your device.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "What are parked domains?",
      "Parked domains are unused or expired web addresses. Many exist because someone forgot to renew a domain. Others are deliberate misspellings of popular sites like Google, Netflix or YouTube. For years, these domains displayed harmless placeholder pages. They showed ads and links to monetize accidental traffic. While annoying, they rarely posed serious danger. That is no longer true. Infoblox found that more than 90 percent of visits to parked domains now lead to malicious content. This includes scareware, fake antivirus offers, phishing pages and malware downloads.",
      "A single mistyped web address can redirect you from a trusted site to a dangerous parked domain in seconds, Kurt Knutsson writes. (PeopleImages/Getty Images)",
      "Why direct navigation has become so risky",
      "Direct navigation means typing a website address by hand instead of using a bookmark or search result. One missing letter can change everything. For example, mistyping gmail.com as gmai.com does not trigger an error. Instead, it can deliver your email straight to criminals. Infoblox found that some of these typo domains actively run mail servers to capture messages. Even worse, many of these domains form part of massive portfolios. One group tracked by Infoblox controlled nearly 3,000 lookalike domains associated with banks, tech companies and government services.",
      "Malicious parked domains often trigger fake security warnings or hidden redirects without requiring any clicks. (CyberGuy.com)",
      "How these domains decide whom to attack",
      "Not everyone sees the same thing when visiting a parked domain. That is intentional. Researchers discovered that parked pages often profile visitors in real time. They analyze IP address, device type, location, cookies and browsing behavior. Based on that data, the domain decides what you see next. Visitors using a VPN or non-residential connection often see harmless placeholder pages. Residential users on phones or home computers get redirected to scams or malware instead. This filtering helps attackers stay hidden while maximizing successful attacks.",
      "Why parked domain scams are increasing",
      "Several trends are fueling the problem. First, traffic from parked domains is often resold multiple times through affiliate networks. By the time it reaches a malicious advertiser, there is no direct relationship with the original parking company. Second, recent ad policy changes may have increased exposure. Google now requires advertisers to opt in before running ads on parked domains. While intended to improve safety, this shift may have pushed bad actors deeper into affiliate networks with weaker oversight. The result is a murky ecosystem where responsibility is difficult to trace.",
      "Even government domains are being targeted",
      "Infoblox also found typosquatting aimed at government services. In one case, a researcher accidentally visited ic3.org instead of ic3.gov while trying to report a crime. The result was a fake warning page claiming a cloud subscription had expired. That page could just as easily have delivered malware. This highlights how easy it is to fall into these traps, even when doing something important.",
      "A screenshot shows how mistyping the FBI\u2019s IC3 web address redirects users to an unrelated parked domain. (Infoblox)",
      "Ways to stay safe from parked domain traps",
      "You can reduce your risk with a few smart habits:",
      "Save banks, email providers and government portals. Avoid typing these addresses manually.",
      "Slow down when entering web addresses. One extra second can prevent a costly mistake.",
      "Strong antivirus software protects your device if a malicious page loads, blocking malware downloads, scripts and fake security pop-ups.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "At first glance, the rapid rollout might seem surprising. But there's context behind it. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has reportedly called a \"code red\" inside the company, urging teams to move faster on improving ChatGPT. That push comes as competition heats up. Google recently released Gemini 3, which reportedly outperformed ChatGPT on several artificial intelligence benchmarks and delivered stronger image generation. At the same time, Anthropic's Claude continues to advance quickly.",
      "Against that backdrop, GPT-5.2 feels less like a routine upgrade and more like a strategic response. So what actually changed in GPT-5.2, and why does OpenAI say it matters?",

      "What exactly is GPT-5.2",
      "GPT-5.2 is the newest version in OpenAI's flagship 5-series of large language models. Like its predecessor, it includes two default variants. GPT-5.2 Instant is designed for everyday chatting and web searches. GPT-5.2 Thinking is meant for more complex tasks like long reasoning chains and multi-step problem solving. These two models are now the default for all ChatGPT users, including free users. They replace GPT-5.1 Instant and Thinking entirely. If you are using ChatGPT today, you are already using GPT-5.2, whether you realize it or not.",
      "What OpenAI says GPT-5 brings to ChatGPT",
      "At the same time, OpenAI continues to position GPT-5 as \"expert intelligence for everyone.\" The company says GPT-5 delivers stronger performance across math, science, finance, law and other complex subjects. In OpenAI's view, ChatGPT now acts more like a team of on-demand experts than a basic chatbot. To support that claim, OpenAI points to practical examples. These include better coding help, more expressive writing support, clearer health-related explanations and improved safety and accuracy. The company showcases use cases such as generating app code, writing speeches, explaining medications and correcting mistakes in user-submitted images. In theory, GPT-5.2 builds on that same foundation. However, while OpenAI emphasizes deeper thinking and more reliable answers, those gains remain subtle for many everyday users.",
      "What new features does GPT-5.2 add?",
      "Here's the short answer. None. GPT-5.2 does not introduce new tools, interfaces, or headline features. Instead, OpenAI describes a series of behind-the-scenes improvements that supposedly make ChatGPT faster, smarter and more capable. According to OpenAI, GPT-5.2 performs better at:",

      "Why testing chatbot improvements is tricky",
      "Evaluating chatbot upgrades is harder than it sounds. Responses can vary widely even when prompts stay the same. A model might excel at one task and struggle with a nearly identical one just moments later. On top of that, OpenAI's 5-series models already perform at or near the top of the field. When performance starts that high, meaningful gains become harder to detect. With that in mind, we tested GPT-5.2, and in most tests, it behaved almost identically to GPT-5.1.",
      "Why benchmarks don't tell the full story",
      "OpenAI's benchmarks show modest gains for GPT-5.2. That matters for researchers and developers working at scale. Still, even advanced users may struggle to see practical benefits. Other companies have delivered clearer upgrades. Google's Gemini Nano Banana Pro model shows obvious gains in AI image generation and editing. Those improvements are easy for anyone to test and verify. By contrast, GPT-5.2's changes feel abstract. They exist mostly on paper rather than in daily use.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you pay for ChatGPT, there's little downside to using GPT-5.2. It replaces GPT-5.1 in the model lineup and generally performs at least as well in everyday use. Free users don't have much choice either, as model access is handled automatically. For most people, the experience feels familiar and stable.",
      "The picture shifts slightly for programmers and those who use it for business. Early pricing details suggest GPT-5.2 may cost roughly 40 percent more per million tokens than GPT-5.1, depending on usage tier and access method. That makes testing important before committing at scale.",
      "ChatGPT-5.2 works fine but may not feel exciting, Kurt Knutsson writes. (Michael Nguyen/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "GPT-5.2 feels like a model released under pressure rather than inspiration. It performs well, stays reliable, and moves forward in measurable ways. Still, it doesn't deliver the kind of clear progress many people expect from a new version number. OpenAI remains a leader in AI, but competition is closing in fast. As rivals roll out more noticeable improvements, small updates may no longer be enough to stand out. For now, GPT-5.2 feels less like a breakthrough and more like OpenAI holding its ground.",

      "Over the past few weeks, we've heard from a number of people who received unexpected phone calls shortly after activating a new iPhone. The callers claimed to be from a major carrier. They said a shipping mistake was made. They insisted the phone needed to be returned right away. One message stood out because it shows exactly how convincing and aggressive this scam can be.",
      "\"Somebody called me (the call said it was from Spectrum) and told me they sent the wrong iPhone and needed to replace it. I was to rip off the label on the box, tape it up and set it on my porch steps. FedEx was going to pick it up and they'd put a label on it. And just for my trouble, he'd send me a $100 gift card! However, the guy was just too anxious. He called me again at 7 am to make sure I would follow his instructions. Right after that, I picked up my box on the steps and called Spectrum, who confirmed it was a scam. There are no such things as refurbished i17 phones because they're brand new. I called the guy back, said a few choice words and hung up on him. Since then, they have called at least twice for the same thing. Spectrum should be warning its customers!\"",

      "How the new iPhone replacement scam works",
      "This scam relies on timing and pressure. First, criminals focus on people who recently bought a new iPhone. That information often comes from data-broker sites, leaked purchase data or marketing lists sold online. Next, scammers spoof a carrier phone number. As a result, the call appears legitimate. They sound confident and informed because they already know the device model you ordered.",
      "Once the call begins, the story moves quickly. The scammer claims a shipping mistake occurred. Then they insist the phone must be returned right away. To reinforce urgency, they say a courier is already scheduled. If you follow the instructions, you hand over a brand-new iPhone. At that point, the device is gone. The scammer either resells it or strips it for parts. By the time you realize something is wrong, recovery is unlikely.",
      "Why this scam feels so believable",
      "This scam copies real customer service processes. Carriers do ship replacement phones. FedEx does handle returns. Gift cards are often used as apologies.

    "story": [
      "Fox News anchor Bret Baier explores how the technology is changing how the world operates on Special Report.",
      "Amazon's Ring video doorbells are getting a major artificial intelligence (AI) upgrade, and it is already stirring controversy.",
      "The company has started rolling out a new feature called Familiar Faces to Ring owners across the United States. Once enabled, the feature uses AI-powered facial recognition to identify people who regularly appear at your door. Instead of a generic alert saying a person is at your door, you might see something far more personal, like \"Mom at Front Door.\" On the surface, that sounds convenient.",
      "Privacy advocates, however, say this shift comes with real risks.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "GOOGLE NEST STILL SENDS DATA AFTER REMOTE CONTROL CUTOFF, RESEARCHER FINDS",
      "Ring\u2019s new Familiar Faces feature uses AI facial recognition to identify people who regularly appear at your door and personalize alerts. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)",
      "How Ring's Familiar Faces feature works",
      "Ring says Familiar Faces helps you manage alerts by recognizing people you know. Here is how it works in practice. You can create a catalog of up to 50 faces. These may include family members, friends, neighbors, delivery drivers, household staff or other frequent visitors. After labeling a face in the Ring app, the camera will recognize that person as they approach. Anyone who regularly passes in front of your Ring camera can be labeled by the device owner if they choose to do so, even if that person is unaware they are being identified.",
      "From there, Ring sends personalized notifications tied to that face. You can also fine-tune alerts on a per-face basis, which means fewer pings for your own comings and goings. Importantly, the feature is not enabled by default. You must turn it on manually in the Ring app settings. Faces can be named directly from Event History or from the Familiar Faces library. You can edit names, merge duplicates or delete faces at any time.",
      "Amazon says unnamed faces are automatically removed after 30 days. Once a face is labeled, however, that data remains stored until the user deletes it.",
      "Why privacy groups are pushing back",
      "Despite Amazon's assurances, consumer protection groups and lawmakers are raising alarms. Ring has a long history of working with law enforcement. In the past, police and fire departments were able to request footage through the Ring Neighbors app. More recently, Amazon partnered with Flock, a company that makes AI-powered surveillance cameras widely used by police and federal agencies. Ring has also struggled with internal security. In 2023, the FTC fined Ring $5.8 million after finding that employees and contractors had unrestricted access to customer videos for years. The Neighbors app previously exposed precise home locations, and Ring account credentials have repeatedly surfaced online. Because of these issues, critics argue that adding facial recognition expands the risk rather than reducing it.",
      "Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) staff attorney Mario Trujillo tells CyberGuy, \"When you step in front of one of these cameras, your faceprint is taken and stored on Amazon\u2019s servers, whether you consent or not. Today\u2019s feature to recognize your friend at your front door can easily be repurposed tomorrow for mass surveillance. It is important for state regulators to investigate.\" The Electronic Frontier Foundation is a well-known nonprofit organization that focuses on digital privacy, civil liberties and consumer rights in the tech space.",
      "WASHINGTON COURT SAYS FLOCK CAMERA IMAGES ARE PUBLIC RECORDS",
      "Once a face is labeled by the device owner, Ring can replace generic notifications with named alerts tied to that individual. (CyberGuy.com)",
      "Where the feature is blocked and why that matters",
      "Legal pressure is already limiting where Familiar Faces can launch. According to the EFF, privacy laws are preventing Amazon from offering the feature in Illinois, Texas and Portland, Oregon. These jurisdictions have stricter biometric privacy protections, which suggests regulators see facial recognition in the home as a higher-risk technology. U.S. Senator Ed Markey has also called on Amazon to abandon the feature altogether, citing concerns about surveillance creep and biometric data misuse.",
      "Amazon says biometric data is processed in the cloud and not used to train AI models. The company also claims it cannot identify all locations where a face appears, even if law enforcement asks. Still, critics point out the similarity to Ring's Search Party feature, which already scans neighborhoods to locate lost pets.",
      "We reached out to Amazon for comment but did not receive a response before our deadline.",
      "Ring's other AI feature feels very different",
      "Not all of Ring's AI updates raise the same level of concern. Ring recently introduced Video Descriptions, a generative AI feature that summarizes motion activity in plain text. Instead of guessing what triggered an alert, you might see messages like \"A person is walking up the steps with a black dog\" or \"Two people are peering into a white car in the driveway.\"",
      "HOW RESTAURANT RESERVATION PLATFORM OPENTABLE TRACKS CUSTOMER DINING HABITS",
      "Ring\u2019s Video Descriptions feature takes a different approach by summarizing activity without identifying people by name. (Amazon)",
      "How Video Descriptions decides what matters",
      "This AI focuses on actions rather than identities. It helps you quickly decide whether an alert is urgent or routine. Over time, Ring says the system can recognize activity patterns around a home and only notify you when something unusual happens. However, as with any AI system, accuracy can vary depending on lighting, camera angle, distance and environmental conditions. Video Descriptions is currently rolling out in beta to Ring Home Premium subscribers in the U.S. and Canada. Unlike facial recognition, this feature improves clarity without naming or tracking specific people. That contrast matters.",
      "Video Descriptions turns motion alerts into short summaries, helping you understand what is happening without identifying who is involved. (Amazon)",
      "Should you turn Familiar Faces on?",
      "If you own a Ring doorbell, caution is wise. While Familiar Faces may reduce notification fatigue, labeling people by name creates a detailed record of who comes to your home and when. Given Ring's past security lapses and close ties with law enforcement, many privacy experts recommend keeping the feature disabled. If you do use it, avoid full names and remove faces you no longer need. In many cases, simply checking the live video feed is safer than relying on AI labels. Not every smart home feature needs to know who someone is.",
      "How to turn Familiar Faces on or off in the Ring app",
      "If you want to review or change this setting, you can do so at any time in the Ring mobile app.",

      "Alexa is now answering your door for you",
      "Amazon is also rolling out a very different kind of AI feature for Ring doorbells, and it lives inside Alexa+. Called Greetings, this update gives Ring doorbells a conversational AI voice that can interact with people at your door when you are busy or not home. Instead of identifying who someone is, Greetings focuses on what they appear to be doing. Using Ring's video descriptions, the system looks at apparel, actions, and objects to decide how to respond.",
      "For example, if someone in a delivery uniform drops off a package, Alexa can tell them exactly where to leave it based on your instructions. You can even set preferences to guide delivery drivers toward a specific spot, or let them know water or snacks are available. If a delivery requires a signature, Alexa can ask the driver when they plan to return and pass that message along to you. The feature can also handle sales representatives or service vendors. You might set a rule such as politely declining sales pitches without ever coming to the door yourself.",
      "Greetings can also work for friends and family. If someone stops by while you are away, Alexa can greet them and ask them to leave a message for you. That interaction is saved so you can review it later. That said, the system is not perfect. Because it relies on visual context rather than identity, mistakes can happen. A friend who works in logistics could show up wearing a delivery uniform and be treated like a courier instead of being invited to leave a message. Amazon acknowledges that accuracy can vary. Importantly, Amazon says Greetings does not identify who a person is. It uses Ring's video descriptions to determine the main subject in front of the camera and generate responses, without naming or recognizing individuals. That makes it fundamentally different from the Familiar Faces feature, even though both rely on AI.",
      "Greetings is compatible with Ring Wired Doorbell Pro (3rd Gen) and Ring Wired Doorbell Plus (2nd Gen). It is available to Ring Premium Plan subscribers who have video descriptions enabled and is currently rolling out to Alexa+ Early Access users in the United States and Canada.",
      "Thinking about a Ring doorbell?",
      "If you are already in the Ring ecosystem or considering a video doorbell, Ring's lineup includes models with motion alerts, HD video, night vision, and optional AI-powered features such as Video Descriptions. While Familiar Faces remains controversial and can be turned off, many homeowners still use Ring doorbells for basic security awareness and package monitoring.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Amazon Ring's AI facial recognition feature shows how quickly convenience can collide with privacy. Familiar Faces may offer smarter alerts, but it also expands surveillance into deeply personal spaces. Meanwhile, features like Video Descriptions prove that AI can be useful without identifying people. As smart home tech evolves, the real question is not what AI can do but what it should do.",

      "Safeguarding your phone and personal data has never been more crucial.",
      "A new Android banking trojan called Sturnus is shaping up to be one of the most capable threats we have seen in a while. It is still in early development, but it already behaves like a fully mature operation.",
      "Once it infects a device, it can take over your screen, steal your banking credentials and even read encrypted chats from apps you trust. The worrying part is how quietly it works in the background. You think your messages are safe because they are end-to-end encrypted, but this malware simply waits for the phone to decrypt them before grabbing everything.",
      "It's important to note, however, that Sturnus does not break encryption; it only captures messages after your apps decrypt them on your device.",

      "Sturnus malware uses deceptive screens that mimic real banking apps to steal your credentials in seconds. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson\u00a0)",
      "A closer look at the malware's capabilities",
      "Sturnus combines several attack layers that give the operator nearly full visibility into the device, as reported by cybersecurity research firm ThreatFabric. It uses HTML overlays that mimic real banking apps to trick you into typing your credentials. Everything you enter goes straight to the attacker through a WebView that forwards the data instantly. It also runs an aggressive keylogging system through the Android Accessibility Service. This lets it capture text as you type, follow which app is open, and map every UI element on the screen. Even when apps block screenshots, the malware keeps tracking the UI tree in real time, which is enough to reconstruct what you are doing.",
      "NEW ANDROID MALWARE CAN EMPTY YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IN SECONDS",
      "On top of overlays and keylogging, the malware monitors WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal and other messaging apps. It waits for these apps to decrypt messages locally, then captures the text right from the screen. This means your chats may remain encrypted over the network, but once the message appears on your display, Sturnus sees the entire conversation. It also includes a full remote control feature with live screen streaming and a more efficient mode that sends only interface data. This allows precise taps, text injection, scrolling and permission approvals without showing any activity to the victim.",
      "How Sturnus stays hidden and steals money",
      "The malware protects itself by grabbing Device Administrator privileges and blocking any attempt to remove it. If you open the settings page that could disable those permissions, Sturnus detects it immediately and moves you away from the screen before you can act. It also monitors battery state, SIM changes, developer mode, network conditions and even signs of forensic investigation to decide how to behave. All this data goes back to the command-and-control server through a mix of WebSocket and HTTP channels protected with RSA and AES encryption.",
      "When it comes to financial theft, the malware has several ways to take over your accounts. It can collect credentials through overlays, keylogging, UI-tree monitoring and direct text injection. If needed, it can black out your screen with a full-screen overlay while the attacker performs fraudulent transactions in the background. Since the screen is hidden, you have no idea anything is happening until it is too late.",
      "7 ways you can stay safe from Android malware like Sturnus",
      "If you want to protect yourself from threats like this, here are a few practical things you can start doing right away.",
      "Avoid downloading APKs from forwarded links, shady websites, Telegram groups or third-party app stores. Banking malware spreads most effectively through sideloaded installers disguised as updates, coupons or new features. If you need an app that isn't in the Play Store, verify the developer's official site, check hashes if provided and read recent reviews to make sure the app hasn't been hijacked.",
      "Most dangerous malware relies on accessibility permissions because they allow full visibility into your screen and interactions. Device administrator rights are even more powerful since they can block removal. If a simple utility app suddenly asks for these, stop immediately. These permissions should only be granted to apps that genuinely need them, such as password managers or accessibility tools you trust.",
      "Install system updates as soon as they arrive, since many Android banking trojans target older devices that lack the latest security patches. If your phone is no longer receiving updates, you are at a higher risk, especially when using financial apps. Avoid sideloading custom ROMs unless you know how they handle security patches and Google Play Protect.",
      "HOW ANDROID MALWARE LETS THIEVES ACCESS YOUR ATM CASH",
      "The malware quietly captures decrypted messages from apps like WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal right as they appear on your screen. (Kurt Knutsson)",
      "Android phones come with Google Play Protect built in, which catches a large chunk of known malware families and warns you when apps behave suspiciously. But if you want greater security and control, choose a third-party antivirus app. These tools can alert you when an app starts logging your screen or trying to take over your phone.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "A lot of these campaigns rely on data brokers, leaked databases and scraped profiles to build lists of people to target. If your phone number, email, address or social handles are floating around on dozens of broker sites, it becomes much easier for attackers to reach you with malware links or tailored scams. A personal data removal service helps clean up that footprint by deleting your info from data broker listings.",

It sidesteps encrypted messaging, steals banking credentials with multiple backup methods, and maintains a strong grip on the device through administrator privileges and constant environmental checks. Even if the current campaigns are limited, the level of sophistication here suggests a threat that is being refined for larger operations. If it reaches wide distribution, it could become one of the most damaging Android banking trojans in circulation.",

    "story": [
      "A few hundred robots moved a building that covers about 43,400 square feet.",
      "A quiet town in western Denmark is quickly becoming a testing ground for the future of housing.",
      "Skovsporet, described as Europe's largest 3D-printed housing project, is now taking shape in Holstebro. When finished, the development will deliver 36 student apartments built faster than many single-family homes.",
      "The project sits near VIA University College and serves students in the area. NordVestBo, an affordable housing organization focused on student living, commissioned the development. SAGA Space Architects designed the project in collaboration with 3DCP Group and COBOD. From the beginning, the goal stayed simple and ambitious. Build high-quality homes faster, more efficiently and at a scale traditional construction often struggles to reach. So far, the progress speaks for itself.",

      "AUSTRALIA DEBUTS FIRST MULTI-STORY 3D PRINTED HOME \u2013 BUILT IN JUST 5 MONTHS",
      "The six buildings are arranged around shared outdoor areas, creating a village-style layout designed for student life. (SAGA Space Architects)",
      "How 36 student apartments were printed at record speed",
      "Skovsporet includes six buildings, and each one holds six ground-level student apartments. Crews printed the structures on site using the COBOD BOD3 3D construction printer. The machine extrudes a cement-like material layer by layer, following a digital blueprint with millimeter accuracy.",
      "At first, printing a single building took several weeks. However, productivity improved quickly as the team gained experience. By the final building, printing wrapped up in just five days. That pace equals more than one student apartment printed per day.",
      "Even more notable is the small crew required to run the system. Only three people operated the printer on site. As a result, automation handled the heavy work while the team focused on oversight, quality and precision.",
      "Inside the 3D-printed student apartments",
      "Each apartment measures roughly 431 to 538 square feet. Despite their compact footprint, the layouts feel open and intentional. Every unit includes a full kitchen, a study area, a lounge, a bathroom with a shower and a bedroom with a double bed. Large roof windows and slanted ceilings pull daylight deep into the space, helping soften the concrete structure. Inside, coated plywood panels and glass elements add warmth and contrast. The result feels modern and livable rather than industrial. These homes are designed for daily student life, not just architectural headlines.",
      "AFFORDABLE 3D-PRINTED BIONIC ARM USES MUSCLE SIGNALS TO MOVE",
      "Why 3D printed construction is changing how housing gets built",
      "The real story at Skovsporet is not just speed. It is repeatability. As the team moved from one building to the next, efficiency improved without sacrificing quality. The BOD3 printer runs on a ground-based track system that allows uninterrupted printing of long wall sections. That consistency makes it easier to scale multi-unit housing projects.",
      "According to COBOD, this kind of automation reduces labor needs, shortens timelines and improves accuracy. For cities facing housing shortages, those benefits matter.",
      "How sustainability is built into this 3D printed housing project",
      "Skovsporet also shows how 3D printing supports more sustainable construction. The walls were printed using D.fab concrete with FUTURECEM, a low-carbon cement developed by Aalborg Portland. Because the printer deposits material only where it is structurally needed, waste drops significantly compared to traditional methods. The site layout also preserved 95% of the existing trees by carefully positioning print beds between them. In other words, faster construction did not come at the cost of environmental care.",
      "A COBOD BOD3 printer extrudes concrete layer-by-layer on site, forming the structural walls of Skovsporet\u2019s student apartments with millimeter precision. (SAGA Space Architects)",
      "What happens next for Denmark's 3D-printed student housing",
      "The 3D printing phase is now complete. Human crews have taken over to install roofs, windows, interiors, furniture and utilities. Landscaped gardens, walking paths and bicycle parking are also underway to create a shared village atmosphere. The project remains on schedule, with residents expected to move in by August 2026.",
      "WORLD\u2019S BIGGEST 3D-PRINTED SCHOOLS ARE UNDERWAY IN QATAR",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you care about housing affordability, this project is worth watching. Skovsporet proves that automation can deliver student housing faster while keeping quality high. It also hints at what could come next. Multiunit housing built with fewer workers, less waste and shorter timelines could ease pressure in crowded cities. While 3D-printed homes will not replace traditional construction overnight, they are clearly moving into the mainstream. For students, renters and communities, that shift could open the door to more accessible housing options.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Skovsporet is more than a construction milestone. It is a real-world example of how digital design, automation and sustainability can come together at scale. As Europe, the United States and Australia explore similar projects, this student village in Denmark may become a blueprint for future neighborhoods.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to share his tips for safe holiday shopping and finding the best deals on Cyber Monday.",
      "Christmas is around the corner, and so is the SantaStealer malware. While the name sounds jolly, this malware is more than capable of ruining your happiness this festive season. The worst part is that this new strain is available to almost anyone willing to pay a small fee. It essentially works as malware-as-a-service, letting buyers target people at scale, obviously not for any legitimate use.",
      "SantaStealer is starting to make noise across Telegram channels and underground hacker forums. It is being marketed as a stealthy, memory-only information stealer that can quietly siphon data without leaving obvious traces on disk.",
      "Memory-only does not mean undetectable. It simply reduces disk artifacts, which can delay detection rather than prevent it altogether. That promise alone is enough to attract cybercriminals, especially at a time when browser-stored passwords, session cookies and crypto wallets remain high-value targets.",
      "MALICIOUS BROWSER EXTENSIONS HIT 4.3M USERS",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\u00a0Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "SantaStealer malware is spreading ahead of Christmas, with cybercriminals marketing the data-stealing tool for hire across Telegram and underground forums. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "SantaStealer and how it actually works",
      "SantaStealer operates as a malware-as-a-service, charging $175 per month for its basic tier and $300 per month for the premium plan. Researchers at Rapid7 say the operation rebrands an earlier project called BluelineStealer, with a Russian-speaking developer pushing toward a wider launch before the end of the year.",
      "Despite bold claims about evading detection, Rapid7's analysis paints a more grounded picture. The samples they examined were not particularly difficult to analyze and lacked the advanced anti-analysis techniques being advertised, which is good news for us. If it can be detected, security tools have a better chance of removing it before it can do serious damage.",
      "Functionally, SantaStealer is still dangerous. It uses 14 separate data-collection modules that run in parallel, pulling information from browsers, messaging apps like Telegram and Discord, gaming platforms such as Steam, crypto wallet apps and extensions, and even local documents. The malware can also take screenshots of your desktop. Stolen data is written to memory, compressed into ZIP files and sent out in 10MB chunks to a hardcoded command-and-control server.",
      "One notable capability is its use of an embedded executable to get around Chrome's App-Bound Encryption, a security feature introduced in mid-2024. This workaround typically requires the malware to be executed at the user level and is not a remote bypass of Chrome's security model. Similar tricks have already been used by other info-stealers, showing how quickly attackers test and adapt to new browser protections.",
      "What this says about the current threat landscape",
      "SantaStealer is not fully operational yet and has not been distributed at scale, but it reflects a broader trend in cybercrime. Modern info-stealers are modular, configurable and sold much like regular software. The affiliate panel that Rapid7 observed allows buyers to fine-tune exactly what data the malware steals, from full system sweeps to narrowly targeted attacks focused on specific apps or crypto wallets.",
      "The malware also includes options to avoid infecting systems in certain regions and to delay execution, which can throw off both victims and security analysts. As for how SantaStealer might spread, researchers say recent campaigns increasingly rely on ClickFix-style attacks. These tricks push victims into pasting malicious commands directly into the Windows terminal, often disguised as steps to fix an issue or enable a feature.",
      "More traditional methods are still very much in play. Phishing emails, pirated software, torrent downloads, malicious ads and even deceptive YouTube comments remain effective delivery channels. Once malware like this runs on a system, it needs very little time to grab saved passwords, session cookies and wallet data that can later be abused or sold.",
      "7 steps you can take to stay safe from SantaStealer malware",
      "A few sensible habits and the right tools can significantly reduce your risk, even if malware like this continues to evolve. Here are seven practical steps you can take to stay safe:",
      "Modern antivirus tools don't just look for known malware signatures. They also monitor suspicious behavior, such as programs trying to grab browser data or run hidden processes. Keep real-time protection enabled and take alerts seriously instead of dismissing them.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "A new malware-as-a-service threat known as SantaStealer targets passwords, session cookies and crypto wallets while promoting itself as a stealthy, memory-only attack. (Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "Updates are not just about new features. They often patch security flaws that malware actively targets. This includes your OS, browser, browser extensions, crypto wallet apps and messaging tools. Delaying updates gives attackers a wider window to exploit known weaknesses.",
      "Info-stealers love browser-saved passwords because they are easy to grab. A password manager stores your credentials in an encrypted vault and reduces what your browser keeps locally. It also helps you use strong, unique passwords for every service without having to remember them.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Even if your password is stolen, 2FA can stop attackers from getting in. App-based authenticators are more secure than SMS codes and should be your first choice for email, crypto exchanges, cloud services and social media accounts.",
      "ClickFix-style attacks rely on trust and urgency. If a website, pop-up or video tells you to paste a command into the Windows terminal to fix something, stop. Unless you fully understand what that command does, assume it is dangerous.",
      "When your email, phone number or other personal details are widely available online, attackers can target you more convincingly. Personal data removal services help take your information down from data broker sites, reducing the chances of targeted phishing or malware lures.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

Stick to official app stores, trusted developers and verified extensions, even if it means skipping a \"free\" download.",
      "SantaStealer can quietly siphon sensitive data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "SantaStealer may not yet live up to its own hype, but that should not make you complacent. Early-stage malware often improves quickly once developers patch obvious mistakes. Be cautious with links and attachments from unfamiliar emails, and think twice before running unverified code or browser extensions pulled from public repositories.",

These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says the Ability Hand brings real touch, natural movement and unmatched durability.",
      "At 18, Jamie Grohsong was living a dream many young athletes chase for years. He was a three-time all-conference shortstop, a Division I college prospect and a player who lived for the game. Then one Fourth of July night in 2023, everything changed. A firework exploded in his hand. In seconds, Jamie lost his pitching hand, his season and what felt like his entire baseball future. The path he had worked toward since childhood disappeared. For a while, Jamie accepted that reality. Baseball, the sport that shaped his identity, was over.",

      "AI-POWERED BAT TRACKING COULD GIVE BASEBALL PLAYERS THE EDGE",
      "Jamie Grohsong throws a baseball using a bionic prosthetic hand after losing his pitching hand in a fireworks accident. His return shows how technology can help athletes reclaim what they love. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "When technology reopens a closed door",
      "Two years later, Jamie stepped back onto a baseball field wearing something he never imagined using. A bionic prosthetic known as the Ability Hand.",
      "\"The fact that I can feel and sense everything to the finest details opened my mind to the possibility of everything that could actually be done,\" he told CyberGuy.",
      "The goal was not to recreate the past. It was to find out what might still be possible.",
      "Engineers who build advanced prosthetic hands saw Jamie's story and reached out with a simple question. What if he did not have to give up the game entirely? That question started an extraordinary journey that blended grit, patience and cutting-edge engineering.",
      "\"When building the Ability Hand, we prioritized real-life usage,\" Dr. Aadeel Akhtar, founder and CEO of PSYONIC, told CyberGuy. \"While we already put the hand through its fair share of stress tests, baseball is a whole different ball game.\"",
      "Baseball is definitely a brutal test for any piece of equipment. Throwing requires precise release timing. Hitting demands force, stability and follow-through. At first, nothing came easily.",
      "Learning how to throw again",
      "Throwing a baseball with a bionic hand is not about raw strength. It is about timing and grip. The Ability Hand uses muscle sensors that detect subtle movements in the arm. During a throw, many muscles activate at once, which can cause the hand to open too early. Early throws slipped away. Some felt right. Others did not.",
      "Instead of forcing the hand to grip harder, the PSYONIC team adjusted the technique. Jamie learned to hold the ball lightly and let momentum release it naturally. Small grip changes made a real difference. Slowly, throws began to land. Then they became repeatable. For Jamie, each clean throw rebuilt confidence that had been missing for two years.",

      "A former Division I baseball prospect, Jamie Grohsong steps back onto the field with a bionic hand, redefining what is possible after life-altering injury. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The surprise moment at Oracle Park",
      "Just as Jamie started throwing again, another door opened. He received an invitation to throw the ceremonial first pitch at the San Francisco Giants' Oracle Park. It was the team he grew up watching. The timeline was tight. He had barely over a week to prepare.",
      "The pitch was not perfect. That never mattered. Standing on a Major League Baseball field with a bionic hand, Jamie proved something bigger than accuracy. He showed that the game was still part of him. Later, he said the experience taught him that life does not require perfection to be meaningful.",
      "FULLY IMPLANTABLE BRAIN CHIP AIMS TO RESTORE REAL SPEECH",
      "Wearing a multi-articulating bionic hand, Jamie Grohsong proves baseball is still part of his identity two years after a devastating accident. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can you actually hit with a bionic hand?",
      "Throwing was only part of the challenge.\u00a0Hitting posed an even bigger question.",
      "\"Swinging a bat was a feeling I didn't think I'd feel again,\" Jamie said.",
      "Engineers discovered that bat placement matters more with prosthetics than with natural hands. When the bionic hand serves as the bottom hand on the bat, impact spreads across the fingers. When it sits on top, stress concentrates on the thumb. Jamie bats left-handed, which placed the prosthetic in a safer position. He told CyberGuy,\u00a0\"I can hit with this thing for sure.\"",
      "Then came the first swings. The sensation was unfamiliar. The contact felt strange. Still, the bat met the ball. One swing turned into another. Soon, balls started flying deep into the field. Then it happened. Jamie sent one over the fence.",
      "A world-first moment",
      "Those swings marked what many believe to be the first documented home runs hit using a multi-articulating bionic hand. For Jamie, it was more than a technical milestone. It was emotional closure and a new beginning at the same time. He was not trying to prove that prosthetics make athletes better. He was proving that they can help people reconnect with what they love. The bionic hand did not replace his identity. It gave him a new way to express it.",
      "SMART FABRIC MUSCLES COULD CHANGE HOW WE MOVE",
      "Jamie Grohsong learns to throw and hit again with a bionic prosthetic, blending determination with cutting-edge engineering. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this story says about resilience and design",
      "Jamie's comeback highlights a larger truth about modern assistive technology. At its best, design focuses on real-life use rather than lab conditions. Even so, advanced prosthetics remain expensive and imperfect, and they can break under stress. Because of that, users need time, training and patience to adapt. Yet stories like this show how powerful thoughtful engineering can be when it works alongside human determination. Ultimately, this is not about superhero moments but about access, persistence and refusing to let one moment define a lifetime.",

It helped him build a new one that still includes the game he loves.",

      "This combined image shows JonBenet Ramsey before her 1996 murder as well as her father, John Ramsey, in a 2022 interview with Fox News Digital. The case remains unsolved, and he has advocated for years for authorities to conduct new DNA testing on evidence from the Dec. 26, 1996 homicide. (Left and inset: Courtesy of the Ramsey family, Right: Michael Ruiz/Fox News Digital)",
      "JonBenet's father, John Ramsey, met with Boulder police last January and said it was \"an important meeting.\" He told Fox News Digital earlier this year that he urged the department to accept help from a private genetics lab with a track record of cracking other cold cases.",
      "In a September interview with Fox News Digital, he implored President Donald Trump to get involved in the case.",

      "\"I am absolutely convinced that's the gold standard today,\" Ramsey said. \"So I've been pushing that pretty hard in terms of what I think ought to happen, and I don't know that they're doing it. I know they listen, but I don't know where they are mentally, in terms of making that happen.\"",
      "Ramsey echoed his sentiments in an interview this month with the Daily Mail, when he added that leaders at advanced DNA laboratories had informed him about how investigative genetic genealogy only requires a minuscule sample to yield results \u2013 while also insisting he believes there is a 70% chance his daughter's killer could be named within months.",
      "\"IGG is a very powerful tool \u2013 just use it,\" Ramsey told the outlet. \"If they do it and they come up empty-handed, at least that way I can say thank you, you've tried everything you can so far.\"",

      "Ramsey also pointed to a list of potential suspects compiled by legendary homicide detective Lou Smit in the 1990s, with Smit theorizing his daughter's killer was someone who held a grudge against Ramsey, the outlet reported.",
      "\"Lou Smit's list [of potential persons of interest] is 700 people long,\" Ramsey told the Mail. \"There's so many leads \u2013 but using DNA makes this case solvable.\"",
      "Ramsey, who was previously a vocal critic of the Boulder Police Department over its handling of the case, is now praising investigators in light of the new developments.",
      "\"It\u2019s encouraging,\" Ramsey told NewsNation. \"The key really in progress has been the addition of new leadership there. It was not very good for 25 to 26 years. And now, knowing Chief Redfearn from the outside, I\u2019ve met with him three or four times. I\u2019m impressed with him. I think he\u2019s sincere and honest.",
      "\"The problem with the old leadership was the old guard.\u00a0These people that were in that police department had never investigated a murder.\"",

      "Although Boulder police in the past have been resistant to sacrificing what few samples they have left to new testing, Redfearn is a new leader in the department and may change course.",
      "There are items in the case that have never been tested.",
      "\"The most important one was the garrote that was used to strangle my daughter,\" Ramsey told the Mail.",
      "\"That had to have DNA evidence on it because it was a very complex knot, I'm told, and the assumption is that this creature couldn't have tied that wearing gloves \u2013 so that was a real piece we want to be either tested or re-tested.\"",

      "JonBenet Ramsey, found murdered in her Boulder home in 1996, may see her case revived as new DNA technology offers hope for answers. (Courtesy of the Ramsey family)",

      "PHOENIX \u2014 A student at Loyola University New Orleans who has twice been denied the opportunity to start a Turning Point USA chapter on campus vowed at the conservative organization's annual AmericaFest conference that she would keep fighting.",
      "Anistin Murray is a freshman at the Catholic school located in the heart of the Big Easy. She and two other would-be co-founders of the campus club have endured a monthslong battle with the school's student government association (SGA), which insists that Turning Point shouldn't have a presence on campus.",
      "On Oct. 15, the TPUSA students were first denied an official charter. Murray and her fellow founders then enlisted the help of Loyola New Orleans law students to draft an appeal, saying that the decision was \"subjective.\"",
      "\"Most of it was subjective reasoning,\" law student Ethan Estis told Fox News Digital at the time. \"They didn't really root it in any of the laws or rules and regulations that they're supposed to follow, and it was purely subjective. And that was our basis in attack in the written appeal that we did.\"",

      "\"They said that, you know, it does make a lot of the students feel uncomfortable and that it will bring a lot of hate and negativity and all this disruption to the university, which I find quite sad because that's not what an organization is meant to push,\" Murray told Fox News Digital at AmericaFest in Phoenix.",
      "\"You know, they say that they stand for the majority of the students and the student body at Loyola, but I think to undermine that, there were people who voted yes to have a Turning Point at Loyola,\" she said, adding that she feels like students who agree with TPUSA's values have been silenced.",
      "Murray said that Turning Point stands for dialogue, not hatred.",
      "\"Just because people disagree with us does not mean that there needs to be uncivil discourse,\" she said. \"Like, we can talk civilly and understand that we disagree, but we're hearing each other and understanding that we both come from different places, and I think that was the biggest part for [the SGA], and that was a very important question that got reiterated a lot.\"",

      "Hotly contested primaries for Congress and governor next year will not only choose new candidates for important midterm races, but also serve as early battlegrounds in the fight for the future of both parties, as Democrats and Republicans navigate with how to move forward after the 2024 election.",
      "Although Democrats have celebrated victories up and down the ballot this year, they are still searching for definition and direction after their 2024 loss to President Donald Trump. The party is divided over which strategies and ideologies to embrace, as well as the question of elevating and embracing a new generation of leaders at the expense of older, entrenched incumbents.",
      "Republicans are also weighing what the future of their party should look like, following Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Loyalty to the president continues to define Republican contests, and some 2026 primaries will test whether Trump can exact revenge against Republicans who have crossed him. Others will test just how much Trump\u2019s \"Make America Great Again\" movement is redefining the GOP.",
      "All of those ideas and outcomes could play into the next presidential race, too. And there are plenty of ways in which next year\u2019s primaries will also be early tests for leaders in both parties considering 2028 campaigns for the White House, with some already taking sides in key contests.",
      "Here are the key themes to watch in the primaries as next year's midterm elections get going.",
      "Debating Democrats\u2019 future",
      "Democratic voters and candidates are divided over a lot right now, including strategy, ideology and style. Ultimately, the conflict is about what is most appealing to voters, from some who have left the party to the idea of bringing in new voters who may be disillusioned with politics altogether.",
      "That fight is playing out in the first major primary March 3 in Texas. Rep. Jasmine Crockett launched her race for Senate by taking direct aim at Trump and suggesting she can turn out new voters and build a \u201cmultiracial, multigenerational coalition.\u201d State Rep. James Talarico, meanwhile, is pitching himself as a candidate who is willing to stand up to his party and appeal to voters in both parties who are \u201chungry for sincerity and honesty and compassion.\u201d",
      "The party\u2019s ideological divides are also playing out in two Democratic Senate primaries in Michigan and Minnesota, testing different theories for how to win traditional \u201cblue wall\u201d states where Republicans have made gains in recent years.",
      "In Michigan, former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed is running as an unapologetic progressive, supporting \"Medicare for All\" and backed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. State Sen. Mallory McMorrow launched her race calling for a \u201cnew generation of leadership\u201d and is a self-described \u201cpragmatist.\u201d And Rep. Haley Stevens, who flipped a Republican-held district in 2018 and is a leader of the \u201ccenter-left\u201d New Democrat Coalition, launched her race by slamming Trump\u2019s tariff policies.",
      "In Minnesota, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan is running as a staunch progressive in the race to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Tina Smith, and she has endorsements from Sanders and other liberal leaders. Rep. Angie Craig, who has represented a swing district, has said the Democratic Party must be a \u201cbig tent,\u201d pushing back on far-left calls to decrease police funding.",
      "A battle for the soul of the party is also brewing in the primary for governor in California, where the top two candidates, regardless of party, move on to a general election.",
      "The top Democratic candidates are all staking out lanes with varied theories of how to win over party voters on their home turf. Former  Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra is running a health care-centric campaign; former Rep. Katie Porter is leaning into the progressive populism that helped her win competitive House races; billionaire Tom Steyer is pivoting away from his focus on climate and embracing a campaign centered on affordability and confronting big business; Rep. Eric Swalwell is leaning on his clashes with Trump; and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is highlighting his executive experience.",
      "Trump\u2019s revenge",
      "Questions about loyalty to Trump loom over just about every Republican primary contest up and down the ballot. But in a handful, it\u2019s the dominant debate.",
      "Trump has endorsed Navy veteran Ed Gallrein against Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie in the GOP primary, after Massie repeatedly drew Trump\u2019s ire for criticizing the president's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files and opposing key pieces of his domestic and foreign policy agenda.",
      "The president also threw his weight behind Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones\u2019 bid for governor, elevating him in a crowded primary that includes a handful of other prominent Georgia elected officials. That blessing came years after Jones controversially signed on to a slate of pro-Trump electors who falsely attested that Trump won the 2020 election.",
      "Another key race dominated by loyalty to Trump is Louisiana\u2019s Senate race, where Sen. Bill Cassidy, one of the few remaining GOP members of Congress who voted to convict Trump after his second impeachment, is running for re-election.",
      "Cassidy\u2019s well-funded Republican opponents, including state Treasurer John Fleming and state Sen. Blake Miguez, have bear-hugged Trump and framed Cassidy\u2019s conviction vote after the Jan. 6 riot as a betrayal.",
      "Cassidy, a physician, has made a series of overtures to Trump as chairman of the Senate health committee, including green-lighting Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s nomination despite Cassidy\u2019s concerns about Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine activism.",
      "The left\u2019s anti-establishment angst",
      "For many Democrats, the path forward involves bucking party leaders and elevating younger ones after former President Joe Biden's tenure as party leader \u2014 and its abrupt and damaging end for the party in 2024.",
      "Democrats\u2019 anti-establishment angst is fueling primaries across the Senate map, especially in Maine, where Gov. Janet Mills, 77, is facing off against military veteran Graham Platner, 41, in the primary to take on GOP Sen. Susan Collins.",
      "Mills, whom Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., urged to run, has pitched herself as the Democrat best positioned to defeat Collins, but has pledged to only serve one term if elected, acknowledging \u201cage is a consideration.\u201d",
      "Platner, a progressive also backed by Sanders, has decried Schumer, who was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1998, and Democratic leaders, arguing that \u201cpeople don\u2019t want establishment politicians.\u201d",
      "Platner also blamed \u201cthe establishment\u201d for spreading unflattering information about his past, amid revelations that he had a tattoo that resembled a Nazi symbol, which he has since covered up, and past Reddit posts that included a slew of controversial and offensive comments. Platner apologized for many of the posts, saying he was \u201cdisillusioned\u201d after his military service.",
      "That angst on the left is also leading to challenges against sitting Democratic lawmakers, as progressive groups have banded together to oust incumbents who they say aren\u2019t doing enough to fight Trump.",
      "Some of those primaries include Durham County Commissioner Nida Allam\u2019s race against North Carolina Rep. Valerie Foushee, in a 2022 primary rematch; state Sen. Donavan McKinney\u2019s challenge against Michigan Rep. Shri Thanedar; state Rep. Justin Pearson\u2019s race against Tennessee Rep. Steve Cohen; and lawyer and barista Melat Kiros\u2019 challenge to Colorado Rep. Diana DeGette.",
      "New York\u2019s House Democratic primaries next year have also become a hot bed for anti-establishment angst, as challengers against Reps. Ritchie Torres and Dan Goldman have taken aim at the support they\u2019ve received from pro-Israel groups in past elections.",
      "In a launch video for his primary bid to unseat Goldman earlier this month, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander pointed specifically to donations to Goldman from the pro-Israel lobbying group, American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC.",
      "Former Missouri Rep. Cori Bush is also making a run for her old seat by challenging Rep. Wesley Bell in a primary. Bell defeated Bush in a primary last year as he got a boost from an AIPAC-affiliated group.",
      "Some Democrats challenging older lawmakers with an argument for generational change, meanwhile, are already raising significant funds.",
      "California Rep. Mike Thompson, 74, and Connecticut Rep. John Larson, 77, are each facing Democratic primary challengers who raised more than $1 million in the third quarter of this year. In Georgia, Rep. David Scott, 80, who has served his district since 2003, has faced concerns about his age and health for years, and multiple primary challengers have raised the issue.",
      "In Massachusetts, Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton earlier this year launched a primary challenge against 79-year-old Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., framing his candidacy around the push for a younger generation of Democratic leaders.",
      "Markey, who served in the House before he was first elected to the Senate in 2013 and has long been considered a progressive champion, fended off a younger primary challenger in 2020, when he defeated then-Rep. Joe Kennedy III.",
      "MAGA purity tests",
      "Apart from the races mentioned above that specifically center on Trump, a slew of other GOP primaries will test how he has reshaped the Republican Party.",
      "The most consequential may be in Texas, where the GOP civil war that\u2019s dominated state politics for the last decade has culminated in multiple primary opponents challenging Sen. John Cornyn.",
      "Trump, who hasn\u2019t endorsed, is a central theme in this race. While Attorney General Ken Paxton has hammered Cornyn\u2019s past criticisms of the president, Cornyn has raced to frame himself as one of Trump\u2019s top lieutenants in the Senate, and Rep. Wesley Hunt has touted his early support for Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign. But the dividing lines extend beyond Trump, into issues such as guns and immigration.",

      "Winning the hearts and minds of young men has been at the center of politics over the past year. Republicans sought to cement President Donald Trump\u2019s gains, while Democrats, fearing they could lose an increasingly disaffected segment of the electorate for a generation, launched a series of initiatives to prevent that.",
      "Ahead of next year\u2019s midterms, some Democrats say the momentum is shifting. High-profile Democrats running in last month\u2019s elections \u2014 Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Zohran Mamdani in New York City \u2014 improved on the party\u2019s poor performance among young men one year before. Some 2028 Democratic presidential contenders launched policy initiatives aimed at men and boys. And in Trump\u2019s first year in office, many young men say they feel a continued economic and social malaise, cutting into his support with that key group.",
      "\u201cI never want to hear again that the Democratic Party has a problem with young men,\u201d Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin told reporters after the November elections.",
      "While some Democrats are taking an early victory lap, members of both parties say the fight is far from over.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some bed-wetting going on amongst some folks who are like, \u2018Well, Trump\u2019s numbers have slipped with all these groups that he won big with last year,\u2019\u201d said a senior Republican strategist, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about the matter. \u201cThat\u2019s just shortsighted. ... The Republican ecosystem is just a little bit stronger in this space.\u201d",
      "In addition, multiple Democrats said that while they\u2019ve been encouraged by the progress the party has made, there remains a level of discomfort among some party leaders in speaking to those issues.",
      "At last month\u2019s Symposium on Young American Men, a conference put on by The Lafayette Company, a conservative communications firm, to discuss crises facing the demographic, Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., said some in the party still have a fear of being \u201ccanceled\u201d for homing in on the subject.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s OK to reach out to men,\u201d Gallego said. \u201cTalk to men. Talk about men being men.\u201d",
      "Republicans, meanwhile, plan to hammer Democrats ahead of the midterms as out of touch with the concerns of young men while projecting improved economic standing for them in the new year, pointing to tax provisions in Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Beautiful Bill,\u201d including some about tipped wages.",
      "The senior Republican strategist said the midterms will be decided by voters\u2019 attitudes on Trump and the economy, predicting sentiment will improve as Trump\u2019s agenda fully sets in.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of folks who feel that they are not where they should be, they\u2019re falling behind,\u201d this person said. \u201cThere\u2019s a general unsettlement. Young men are especially there when you look at job prospects, AI, there\u2019s uncertainty in general. And you add in the fact that you can\u2019t buy a house, you can\u2019t find a girlfriend. ... A lot of folks look to Trump for solutions.\u201d",
      "The fight could define several critical midterm races, with Democrats hoping to build on their 2025 gains while Republicans still work to figure out how to get inconsistent voters to turn out without the president at the top of the ticket.",
      "A senior GOP Senate aide said that \u201cto the extent\u201d Republicans are pondering how to get disaffected young men back to the polls next fall, \u201cthey\u2019re just hoping Trump does it\u201d for them.",
      "While it\u2019s difficult to measure how Trump\u2019s standing among young men has ebbed, this month\u2019s Yale Youth Poll found his gains with young voters last year have largely been wiped out this year. The survey found that just 34% of voters ages 18 to 22 approved of Trump, in addition to 32% of voters ages 23 to 29. Last year, Trump won 42% of those under 30, a traditionally left-wing electorate that shifted substantially rightward from 2020.",
      "Economic sentiment appeared to be the biggest factor in the shift. Mamdani, Spanberger and Sherrill all focused on affordability in their campaigns and not only improved among young men over 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris but were also able to win over 7% to 9% of Trump voters in their elections, per NBC News exit polls.",
      "Youth unemployment \u2014 for those ages 16 to 24 \u2014 was at 10.8% in July, rising year over year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate in November for U.S. residents ages 20 to 24 hit 8.3% in November, BLS data showed, down from 9.2% in September but still the highest since 2021. And this spring\u2019s Harvard Youth Poll found that roughly 4 in 10 of those under 30 were \u201cbarely getting by\u201d financially.",

      "Christian G., 25, an independent from Clifton, New Jersey, said it was continued disappointment with the economy that had him voting for Sherrill after having backed Trump.",
      "\u201cI feel like I expected certain things to be improved or certain things to become more affordable, and it did the exact opposite,\u201d he said in a recent focus group observed by NBC News and produced by Syracuse University and the research firms Engagious and Sago, adding: \u201cI would say for me it is kind of a testament to how, I guess, trust was lost over the year. Whereas I voted for him back in \u201924, now, a year later, I\u2019m feeling let down. I wanted to be a little more logical in my approach and vote for someone who I thought would benefit me more.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not what many Democratic leaders figured when they entered the year trying to tackle Republicans\u2019 advantage among young men \u2014 an edge they believed was due to the \u201cmanosphere,\u201d a universe of apolitical to explicitly right-wing podcasters and streamers who embraced Trump in last year\u2019s election. Some Democrats urged party leaders to break into that space, while others were willing to spend millions to fund their own male-friendly content platform.",
      "Thinking about the project to essentially create a left-wing Joe Rogan, Virginia state Del. Josh Thomas, a Democrat who spoke at last month\u2019s Symposium on Young American Men, laughed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m laughing because it ain\u2019t that hard if you\u2019re being yourself,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cAnd so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good use of donor funds to try and re-create a new ecosystem or shoehorn people into an existing ecosystem. But we have ... very earnest and sincere Democratic leaders who are men who can speak authentically about what it means to be a man at an earlier time and also what it means to be a man today.\u201d",
      "One Democratic man who found success in such spaces was Mamdani, who won young men by roughly 40 points over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo last month. He has made a series of high-profile podcast appearances this year, including on \u201cFlagrant,\u201d a prominent comedy program Trump appeared on last year, and \u201cThe Adam Friedland Show.\u201d",
      "In an interview, Mamdani said he was struck by how many New Yorkers he engaged with came across him only through his appearances on shows like \u201cFlagrant.\u201d He said a critical lesson for Democrats \u201cis to stop treating young people and young men with the condescension that we often see and hear in our politics.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat I found time and time again is that affordability was not something that needed any translation in young people\u2019s lives, that this was something that was the difference between whether or not they could move out of their parents\u2019 apartment and live on their own or not,\u201d said Mamdani, the 34-year-old avowed democratic socialist. \u201cThere\u2019s oftentimes even this attempt at trying to speak to young people, especially young men, slowly, through the prism of friends or memes, when you can, in fact, speak directly to them and to their problems.\u201d",
      "Mamdani also connected issues around the cost of living with male loneliness and alienation.",
      "\u201cPart of this story that we are telling is that the crisis of cost has also denied so many people the engagement with their own city and the sense of themselves as being someone who does more than just exist between work and home,\u201d he said.",
      "Mamdani, whose campaign held high-profile free events, including a soccer tournament and a scavenger hunt, said he\u2019s thinking of how to spur more free or low-cost events in the city that young people can take part in. Elsewhere, Democrats across the spectrum are coming forth with ideas to address an array of male-centric issues. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore recently announced an initiative to hire more male teachers, while California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who said Democrats had \u201cwalked away\u201d from men\u2019s and boys\u2019 issues, signed executive orders this year to address male suicide and launch a \u201cCalifornia Men\u2019s Service Challenge.\u201d",
      "In an interview, Thomas noted that he authored legislation to create Virginia\u2019s first governor\u2019s advisory board on boys\u2019 and men\u2019s issues.",
      "\u201cI think men have seen ... there\u2019s been a different focus in the Democratic Party that maybe didn\u2019t exist in October of last year,\u201d he said.",
      "Yet voters often feel differently about state and local elections than they do about national ones. Alex Lieberman of Brooklyn, New York, said that even though he backed Mamdani in November, he would vote for Trump for a third time if he could. (Without Trump on the ballot, Lieberman said, he would back whoever the more populist option is.)",
      "\u201cI think he has fulfilled his campaign promises,\u201d Lieberman, who is in his 20s and said he was inspired to vote for Mamdani in part because of his focus on affordability and small-business issues, said of Trump. \u201cAnd I think that everything that people are not happy with, I just don\u2019t, frankly, understand, because it was exactly what it was like in the first term.\u201d",
      "In office, Trump hasn\u2019t made such explicit appeals to young men, though allies have said his agenda \u2014 particularly on the economy, diversity and immigration \u2014 has them in mind. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., told NBC News at the Symposium on Young American Men that Trump has sought to bolster the standing of young men, \u201cbut I haven\u2019t heard him speak specifically ... about young men much, other than celebrating excellence and achievement, celebrating hard work.\u201d",
      "Lankford said he has heard the conversation around issues affecting young men shift over the past year, saying he no longer hears much, if any, discussion of \u201ctoxic masculinity,\u201d a concept that conservatives have criticized for years as part of broader left-wing excess. Similarly, the right has taken sharper aim this year at diversity initiatives, claiming they hamper the prospects of younger white men.",
      "To maintain their strength with young men, a longtime pro-Trump operative said, Republicans will capitalize on diversity policies they feel a future Democratic presidential nominee will embrace.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve lost them,\u201d this person said of young men. \u201cI still think our party will be the one that has a more appealing vision. Will they turn out in the midterms for random Republicans? Maybe not. Were they turning out for the midterms before? No. Really, what we\u2019re talking about is will they be there in \u201928.\u201d"

Across the country, former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s daughter, Christine Pelosi, is running for a state Senate seat in California. And in Georgia, the son of former GOP Rep. Jack Kingston, Jim Kingston, is running for his dad\u2019s old House seat.",
      "Chellie Pingree said it has been both \u201cheart-warming and terrifying\u201d to watch her daughter, a former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, enter the political arena. But she also said it\u2019s only \u201cnatural\u201d to see the next generation of public servants following in some of their parents\u2019 footsteps.",

You get to a certain age, and your kids are grown up in their own careers,\u201d she told NBC News. \u201cAngus is probably in his last term in the Senate, and Jeanne is retiring. So it\u2019s sort of natural that our children would be at the age to run for Congress.\u201d",

      "\u201cSometimes people use the shorthand of, \u2018Well, he\u2019s the senator\u2019s son,\u2019\u201d King III said, going on to analogize his situation to that of Hall of Fame hockey player Wayne Gretzky\u2019s son when he decided to play high school hockey. \u201cYou still have to skate. You still have to shoot the puck. You still have to grind it out in the corner. There\u2019s no real advantage from the name on the back of your jersey.\u201d",

      "Pros and cons",

Kennedy and a member of America\u2019s most iconic political dynasty, got splashy media coverage when he entered a crowded and competitive race in New York for a Manhattan-area House seat earlier this year.",
      "But family ties can also bring a unique set of challenges for candidates. In a political environment where there\u2019s a thirst to replace the establishment, being associated with a politician could backfire \u2014 and fuel accusations of nepotism.",

Name ID starts at a really high place \u2014 you don\u2019t have to spend money building it, and you come into it with some advantageous fundraising relationships as well,\u201d said Doug Heye, a longtime Republican strategist and former Republican National Committee communications director.",

But he also said, \u201cIt\u2019s harder now, because the parties have less power. We don\u2019t have machines like we used to. If daddy was a senator, you still have to earn it to some extent. It isn\u2019t handed to you. There\u2019s more scrutiny.\u201d",

It\u2019s a very open process,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, it was a five-way primary.\u201d",

      "The flight, known as Artemis II, could lift off as early as February and would be a long-awaited jump start to America\u2019s lagging return-to-the-moon program. The mission will serve as a crucial test of NASA\u2019s next-generation Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft, which have been in development for more than a decade and faced years of setbacks and severe budget overruns. The system has never carried a crew before.",
      "Returning to the moon has been a priority for President Donald Trump since his first term, and the current administration has placed renewed emphasis on dominating the intensifying space race between the U.S. and China. Chinese officials have pledged to land their own astronauts on the lunar surface by 2030.",

      "For some scientists, the excitement around returning to the moon stems from the prospect of investigating enduring mysteries about the moon\u2019s formation and evolution \u2014 such as violent collisions in the nascent solar system that created it and where its water originated \u2014 which came into focus during the Apollo program in the 1960s and 1970s.",

But on the moon, you have this terrain that formed about 4.5 billion years ago, and it\u2019s just sitting there on the surface for us to explore.\u201d",
      "Although the Artemis II mission won\u2019t land on the lunar surface, it will test various technologies, docking maneuvers and life-support systems \u2014 first in Earth orbit and then in orbit around the moon \u2014 that will be essential for future missions.",

    "summary": "\"Heated Rivalry\" fans explain why the episode went viral and why its impact has been so widespread. What happened in the episode?",
    "story": [
      "Francis Dominic, a content creator based in Los Angeles, watches episodes of \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d the moment they drop on HBO Max. When he saw the fifth episode, he knew he wanted to watch it again \u2014 this time, with a crowd.",
      "\u201cI was like, 'Listen, I have to experience this with people,'\u201d Dominic tells TODAY.com.",
      "Dominic headed to a local gay sports bar that has been airing episodes of the romance novel adaptation since Episode 3, demonstrating the snowball effect the show has had since its Nov. 28 premiere.",
      "In his videos from the evening, the crowd cheers during the last scene as if they were experiencing a live sporting event. Other reactions flooding social media are similarly euphoric, with people saying they're watching it \"like it's the Super Bowl.\"",
      "But why has Episode 5 in particular led to such an outpouring of love? Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "What Is \u2018Heated Rivalry\u2019?",
      "Based on Rachel Reid\u2019s \"Game Changers\" romance novel series, two hockey all-stars fall for each other in \u201cHeated Rivalry.\u201d",
      "Situated within a league that has no openly queer players, Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie) and Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams) feel trapped, especially as their feelings for each other grow.",
      "Full of longing and NSFW scenes, the series has been hailed as a perfect romance novel adaptation by fans and has brought new ones into the fold, hence the crowd at Francis\u2019 local bar.",
      "What Happens in Episode 5 of 'Heated Rivalry'?",
      "Episode 5 continues the dramatic highs and lows of Shane and Ilya. Notable moments include Shane ending his relationship with Rose Landry, Shane getting hurt and taken off the ice on a stretcher with a distraught Ilya looking on, and Ilya confessing he loves Shane (that is, in Russian, a monologue that \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d fans who are native Russian speakers are especially loving.)",
      "But in its final few moments, after four episodes of angst, there's a reprieve, one that fans experienced with joy \u2014\u00a0and documented for social media.",
      "To explain it, we have to go back to Episode 3, which took a detour from Shane and Ilya\u2019s story to focus on another hockey player, New York star Scott Hunter (Francois Arnaud).",
      "While he\u2019s older than Shane and Ilya, who are both in their mid-20s, he's struggling with the same issue. His meet-cute with an aspiring art historian named Kip (Robbie G.K.) led to a real love, but he feels unable to come out. With Kip tired of living under the shadow of a secret romance, they're at a standstill.",
      "Then comes the ending of Episode 5, when Scott\u2019s New York Admirals win the Stanley Cup. As his teammates embrace friends and family on the ice, Scott moves to the edge of the rink and scans the crowd, looking for someone.",
      "Shane and Ilya watch the moment unfold on the TV. That means the fictional characters and the \"Heated Rivalry\" audience experience the shock of what Scott does next: He gestures for Kip to come down to the ice. Then, he kisses him on live TV.",
      "Meanwhile, Shane and Ilya seemingly have their own revelations of what this might mean for their relationship.",
      "At the end of the episode, Ilya calls Shane and takes him up on his offer to spend two weeks alone at his home. For the first time in years, they'll have quality together.",
      "The episode ends with Ilya telling Shane, \u201cI\u2019m coming to the cottage.\u201d",
      "Why Is Episode 5 Such a Big Deal?",
      "While \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d has been building momentum since its premiere, Episode 5 has inspired a particular outpouring of emotion.",
      "Ronald Charles Chavis filmed his husband, Refeal Shtivi, weeping after watching the episode in a video shared to TikTok. Speaking to TODAY.com, the couple say the episode\u2019s \u201cgrand gesture\u201d reminded them of their own story. Shtivi was encouraged to come out to the wider world after meeting Chavis in 2023.",
      "\u201cThis coming out part in front of so many people, I did myself. I felt like the big release they were having. I felt super connected with that,\u201d Shtivi says.",
      "\u201cGay, straight \u2014 people want to know that they\u2019re loved,\u201d Chavis adds. \u201cThat was the beauty in that episode.\"",
      "Chavis calls the episode \u201ccathartic\u201d for viewers, especially after the four episodes of build-up.",
      "\u201cIt was such a such a release for them that everybody watching that episode felt it. Because at one point it felt like we were all holding our breath, waiting, and when he did that, it was like it was a sign that everything was going to be OK,\u201d Chavis says.",
      "Dominic points to the widespread pop culture phenomenon of  LGTBQ love stories ending in tragedy. Instead, at the end of \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d Episode 5, a gay love story is \u201cloudly celebrated\" as the crowd in the stadium cheers, too.",
      "\u201cWhat was so great about it is that we finally got a huge happily ever after,\u201d Dominic says. \u201cWhen I watched it by myself, I was sobbing, because it\u2019s like we are constantly fighting for our happily ever after.\u201d",
      "For Dominic, Episode 5\u2019s ending is meta, with consequences reverberating both in the show and in the real world.",
      "\u201cI think seeing Scott choose Kip and bringing him on the ice was so triumphant, because sometimes that just never happens either in real life or in media portraits of gays in their relationship,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cHopefully people will be inspired to live the truth that they\u2019ve always wanted to,\" he said. \"If this is what\u2019s happening right now mainstream media, I\u2019m like, why can\u2019t it happen in real life?\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Singer-songwriter Sophia James is responsible for one of the major internet moments of 2025: Group 7, a social media experiment that went extremely viral.",
      "Back in October, James posted seven TikTok videos assigning people to groups one through seven, with her her single \u201cSo Unfair\" playing in the background.",
      "Thanks to the mystery of the algorithm, one of the videos went off. \u201cIf you\u2019re watching this video, you are in group 7,\u201d James said in the 7th video, which amassed 85.6 million views.",
      "What followed was not just a viral moment, but a turning point for James' career, leading to a New York Times profile an in-person group 7 event in Los Angeles.",
      "What comes after group 7? A lot, James says.",
      "Life before and after \u2018group 7\u2019",
      "Before her viral moment, James describes her career as an independent artist as \u201cpretty stagnant.\u201d",
      "She graduated from UCLA with a degree in jazz. \u201cI just knew that I wanted to do music my whole life,\u201d she tells TODAY.com. \u201cI figured if I had a good understanding of jazz theory and practice, I could translate it easily to whatever genre I chose.\u201d",
      "Since college, she has worked all over the music industry, from session pianist to backup vocalist to touring opener and keyboardist.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had my hands in about 10 different pies at any given point, with the intention of making the solo artist career full-time,\u201d James says.",
      "As an independent artist, social media was the \"only tool in her arsenal\" for getting her own music out into the world \u2014 but she did not expect her impulsive batch of videos to blow up. She says she was \u201cjust trying things and feeling silly,\u201d so she was shocked when the seventh video took off.",
      "This journey and group 7 have not only changed her goals, but the scale of her audience and the reach of her music. James gained over 100,000 TikTok followers after going viral, according to The New York Times.",
      "The viral moment also helped James catch the attention of SiriusXM\u2019s Mikey Piff, who discovered her song \u201cSo Unfair\u201d through the group 7 video. James explains that Piff emailed her asking to play her on the station.",
      "\u201cI was like, that\u2019s crazy \u2014 I never, ever thought I would ever have a song on the radio,\u201d James says. \u201cI consider that the pinnacle of a music career.\u201d",
      "James says \u201cSo Unfair\u201d then transferred over to the Hits 1 station because of the positive response to the song.",
      "\u201cAnd so that\u2019s been really unbelievable and very massive,\u201d James says.",
      "Still, life after group 7 can come with pressure. James says she has felt some expectations to recreate the viral success, but she knows it was a \u201clightning in a bottle\u201d moment.",
      "\u201cI will never top the group 7 video, at least on social media,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is my magnum opus on social media.\u201d",
      "New year, new music",
      "James says if people want more excitement, they should turn to her music. Instead of chasing another viral hit, James is focused on building her future. She says her upcoming album, to be released in 2026, represents a creative shift.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely the most explorative I\u2019ve ever been in music,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s very absurd and playful in a lot of ways, and it\u2019s been really fun to explore that side of artistry.\u201d",
      "James says earlier songs were more \u201cdeeply existential and grim,\u201d where the new album is a lot more \u201cexplosive.\u201d She feels all the feelings, ranging from anger to humor.",
      "\u201cTo be an artist you don\u2019t have to be tortured,\u201d James says. \u201cYou can also be a trickster, you can be playful and excited and angry.\u201d",
      "These feelings in her music are inspired by lived experience, relationships and music she\u2019s listened to across eras. In her mind, these are songs that could be enjoyed and on the radio 15 years ago or 15 years from now.",
      "Much of her upcoming album was shaped by the two years she spent writing it, a period filled with \u201ca lot of living.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like I have the freedom to dream bigger than I have felt like I was allowed to in a long while,\u201d James says.",
      "Going forward, James hopes to spend as much time on the road as possible. \u201cI want to tour forever,\u201d she says. \u201cSo come hang.\u201d",
      "In other words \u2014 we're all in group 7 now."

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is en route to the U.S. via Canada ahead of a weekend of high-stakes diplomacy and a renewed push for peace amid deadly Russian bombing on Ukraine\u2019s capital.",
      "Zelenskyy is set to meet with President Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday, after a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and phone calls with European leaders Saturday.",
      "As Trump ups pressure to bring the war to an end, Zelenskyy said that the critical issue of U.S.-backed security guarantees for Ukraine, to prevent a further Russian incursion, would hinge on the U.S. president.",
      "\u201cFor us, it is very important that there is a signal that we want legally binding security guarantees,\u201d Zelenskyy told Ukrainian journalists in a Q&A session via WhatsApp on Saturday. \u201cThis primarily depends on President Trump. The question is what security guarantees President Trump is ready to provide to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "If Russia \u201cturns even the Christmas and New Year period into a time of destroyed homes and burned apartments, of ruined power plants, then this sick activity can only be responded to with truly strong steps,\u201d he posted on X earlier as he embarked on the trip. \u201cThe United States has this capability. Europe has this capability.\u201d",
      "In addition to meeting with Trump and Carney, Zelenskyy said he would talk remotely with European leaders to \u201cexchange the details of the documents I will be discussing with the President of the United States.\u201d",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will attend the online meeting, a European Commission spokesperson told NBC News.",
      "European leaders have largely been sidelined in the main negotiations between the U.S., Ukraine and Russia.",
      "They have focused on how to support Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, with talks ongoing over security guarantees and funding. But longtime American allies in Europe have struggled to balance mounting pressure from Washington with their reluctance to give in to Russia\u2019s hard-line demands.",
      "A Ukrainian official familiar with the planning for Sunday\u2019s meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump told NBC News that in addition to security guarantees for Ukraine, the Ukrainians are preparing to discuss economic prosperity and reconstruction of the war-torn country.",
      "There are also talks of holding a joint news conference with Trump and Zelenskyy, not necessarily to announce anything new, but to discuss the results of the meeting, the Ukrainian official said.",
      "In a WhatsApp chat with Ukrainian journalists on Friday, Zelenskyy said, \u201cThe 20-point plan we have been working on is 90% ready,\u201d and negotiating teams in Ukraine and the U.S. had made \u201csignificant progress.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur task is to make sure everything is 100% ready,\u201d he added. \u201cWith each such meeting and each such conversation, we must bring the desired result closer.\u201d",
      "Trump has made a high-level diplomatic push to end the war, but his efforts have run into Moscow\u2019s and Kyiv\u2019s widely differing positions and demands, while Russia remains unrelenting in its offensive.",
      "Heavy Russian shelling and explosions struck Kyiv and the surrounding region early Saturday morning, killing at least two people and injuring 20 more, according to Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko, who added that more than 10 residential buildings in the city had been damaged.",
      "The strikes caused the temporary closure of two airports in southeastern Poland after the Polish air force scrambled fighter jets, the Polish Air Navigation Services Agency said on X.",
      "Zelenskyy said Saturday that 500 Russian drones and 40 missiles had struck the nation.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched a full-scale invasion of Russia\u2019s much smaller neighbor in February 2022, has not backed off maximalist demands that would see Ukraine blocked from integrating with the West and limit its ability to defend itself. Until Tuesday, Zelenskyy had maintained that he would be unwilling to withdraw troops from the country\u2019s eastern industrial heartland, much of which has been occupied by Russian forces, as part of a plan to end the war.",
      "The Ukrainian leader has since given details of an updated peace plan offering Russia the potential withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the east and the creation of a demilitarized zone in their place.",
      "Trump told Politico Friday that he anticipated a \u201cgood\u201d meeting with the Ukrainian leader, though he offered no endorsement of Zelenskyy\u2019s plan.",
      "Zelenskyy \u201cdoesn\u2019t have anything until I approve it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll see what he\u2019s got.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "She\u2019d waited years for the news.",
      "But when the message arrived Aug. 26, 2022, Josephine Wentzel suddenly had to confront an agonizing possibility. She\u2019d spent six years tracking the man authorities believed was responsible for killing her daughter, a search that spanned thousands of miles, international borders and dozens of possible sightings that, in the end, had produced little.",
      "Wentzel declined to identify the message\u2019s sender, but she said it supposedly contained a recent picture of Raymond McLeod, who at the time was one of the U.S. Marshals Service\u2019s most wanted fugitives. Had he actually been found \u2014 or would this be another jolt of false hope?",
      "She focused in on the image, she said, and \u201cjust freaked out like, oh, my gosh, it\u2019s him. I didn\u2019t even want to think it because someone might hear my thoughts and warn him to flee.\u201d",
      "McLeod, a 42-year-old former U.S. Marine, was apprehended in El Salvador days later and is awaiting trial in San Diego on a charge of first-degree murder in the June 2016 strangulation of Krystal Mitchell. He pleaded not guilty and is scheduled for a preliminary hearing in March. His attorneys either declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment. In court filings, they said McLeod accidentally killed Mitchell during \u201crough, consensual sex gone wrong.\u201d",
      "Wentzel, a 67-year-old grandmother and former police detective had been preparing for life as an RV'ing snowbird when her daughter was killed. She has used the improbable platform she developed pursuing McLeod to write two books \u2014 \u201cThe Chase\u201d and \u201cThe Capture\u201d \u2014 and to help other grieving parents navigate the mix of frustration, despair and confusion left by an unsolved homicide.",
      "Wentzel has assisted a nonprofit that helps law enforcement agencies with a series of cases in recent years, including the disappearance and alleged murder of Maya Millete, according to the Cold Case Foundation\u2019s co-executive director. Through a nonprofit Wentzel established, Angels of Justice, she launched a campaign urging the White House to treat the country\u2019s massive backlog of unsolved murders as a national emergency.",
      "In a statement, a White House spokeswoman blamed former President Joe Biden for failing to enable law enforcement agencies to \u201ctruly fight crime\u201d and said that President Donald Trump is \u201crestoring integrity to our justice system.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Marshals Service, which apprehended McLeod, declined to comment on questions about Wentzel\u2019s role in finding him, but in a statement after McLeod\u2019s capture the agency\u2019s director said Wentzel had worked \u201cdiligently with law enforcement these past years to see this day of justice arrive.\u201d",
      "The San Diego County District Attorney\u2019s Office has said she was \u201cinstrumental\u201d in the search for McLeod.",
      "\u201cShe goes for it,\u201d said Pat Kuiper, who credits Wentzel with helping push investigators in Washington state to take another look at the nearly two-decade-old unsolved murder of her son. \u201cShe goes for it in such a way that people can\u2019t really refuse her, because she\u2019s so genuine and kind, but persistent, assertive.\u201d",
      "For Rachel Glass, whose daughter was found strangled along with her pregnant roommate in Arizona 15 years ago, Wentzel provided an empathetic ear and insight into an investigative process that Glass \u2014 a longtime nurse \u2014 knew nothing about.",
      "\u201cIf there are things that go on and you think, what the hell is this, I\u2019d call her and say, you won\u2019t believe what\u2019s happened now,\u201d Glass recalled. \u201cAnd she might tell me x, y and z about why it has to play out like that.\u201d",
      "Wentzel\u2019s husband of nearly three decades, a retired post office maintenance engineer, attributes her latest chapter to the tenacity she\u2019s always shown.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s something I lack,\u201d he said. \u201cI can get easily discouraged and say, forget it. But my wife, she\u2019s not gonna forget it.\u201d",
      "A deadly date in San Diego",
      "For Wentzel, that chapter began soon after the death of her daughter. According to a statement of facts filed by the San Diego County District Attorney\u2019s Office, McLeod had gotten into a fight at a San Diego bar June 9, 2016, after he grabbed Mitchell by the throat and a man intervened, telling him to stop.",
      "Mitchell was found dead the next day at the apartment where they were staying. According to the statement, a deputy medical examiner determined she had been strangled and later compared the severity of the injury to someone who\u2019d been struck with a baseball bat or had their neck stomped on.",
      "Mitchell, 30, had been visiting the city with McLeod from Phoenix, where the divorced mother of two worked as a property manager, Wentzel said. To her mother, Mitchell was the life of the party \u2014 and someone who turned heads whenever she walked into a room.",
      "Mitchell met McLeod through work a few weeks before \u2014 he\u2019d gone to her office to rent an apartment, her mother said \u2014 and they\u2019d traveled to San Diego. Mitchell was impressed by how much McLeod seemed to care for his young son, Wentzel said, and she didn\u2019t appear to know about his previous allegations of domestic violence.",
      "One of those alleged incidents occurred not long before their trip, court records in California show. In Riverside County, he was charged that April with inflicting corporal injury on a spouse \u2014 an alleged crime that involved accusations that he strangled his wife, according to the statement of facts.",
      "McLeod pleaded not guilty, the Riverside County records show, and in a filing his lawyers in Mitchell\u2019s case have said that he has a \u201chistory of consensual sexual practices that included elements of the BDSM community such as bondage, whipping, slapping, choking and erotic asphyxiation, sometimes to unconsciousness.\u201d",
      "That earlier case was not adjudicated, however, and McLeod disappeared after Mitchell\u2019s death. According to prosecutors, on June 10, he allegedly drove Mitchell\u2019s car to San Diego International Airport, where he rented another car and headed to Mexico.",
      "An international search",
      "The San Diego Police Department identified McLeod as a person of interest in Mitchell\u2019s death almost immediately. A warrant seeking his arrest in her murder was filed June 13.",
      "But McLeod was nowhere to be found. Eventually, Wentzel recalled, the Marshals Service got involved and offered a reward. But she became frustrated with the government\u2019s inability to quickly investigate leads in foreign countries, she said. U.S. embassies seemed less than enthusiastic about helping, she said, and she recalled a deputy marshal telling her that they couldn\u2019t just \u201crun in and get the guy.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s another country,\u201d she recalled him saying. \u201cWe got to get approval.\u201d",
      "The Marshals Service declined to comment. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "So Wentzel began searching herself. Although she\u2019d worked for several years as a police officer and detective in her native Guam decades ago, she said that experience didn\u2019t begin to prepare her for the years of social media sleuthing that she was about to embark on.",
      "One of her first steps was to pull together a \u201cwanted\u201d poster with pictures of McLeod, along with a brief description of the slaying and the reward amount \u2014 at the time $5,000, she said. She focused on Belize, a place she\u2019d heard he might be, and circulated information among dozens of Facebook accounts \u2014 gyms and resorts, restaurants and a university, screenshots of the messages show.",
      "After posting the information to a buy/sell group, Wentzel recalled, the responses started rolling in. Some were by phone. Others came via WhatsApp or Facebook.",
      "\u201cMadam I saw this man I am sure of it from his tattoos and his face,\u201d one message read, according to a screenshot.",
      "\u201cIf he is here he will b caught,\u201d read another.",
      "But then, he wasn\u2019t. And the messages continued. There were tips that he was in Honduras, that he was in Guatemala. Some tipsters seemed to legitimately want to help, she said. Others seemed like scammers.",
      "\u201cOne guy contacted me and said, OK, he\u2019s here,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI know where he\u2019s working at. I\u2019ve got pictures. I\u2019ve got all this. So, you know, I need you to send me $1,000.\u201d",
      "There were so many tips, said Mike Wentzel, that fielding them became a 24/7 job for his wife. At times, he considered asking her to dial things back, but never could.",
      "\u201cThis is her child,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can I tell her to stop?\u201d",
      "But there were times when the thought crossed her mind. Keeping hope alive during the pandemic, when that steady flow of tips dried up, was especially difficult, she said.",
      "The final tip",
      "As this slump in information dragged on, Wentzel said, local and federal officials announced that McLeod had been added to the Marshals\u2019 list of its 15 most wanted fugitives. In the spring 2021 announcement, they also announced that the reward for information leading to McLeod\u2019s arrest had grown to $50,000.",
      "His last known location was in Guatemala in 2017, the officials said.",
      "Wentzel said she believes it was a tip linked to that Central American country that ultimately led to McLeod\u2019s capture. Five years after he was spotted in Guatemala, she said, a couple of tipsters told her they\u2019d seen McLeod at a hotel just north of the country\u2019s border with El Salvador.",
      "Wentzel surveyed YouTube videos from the hotel to see if she could spot his face, she recalled, and she posted a \u201cwanted\u201d ad on Facebook that targeted accounts in the area. Wentzel said she set a 100-mile radius for the ad, meaning that everyone in that zone would see McLeod\u2019s face.",
      "Eventually, Wentzel said, she learned from the Marshals Service that someone saw one of her ads and shared a brochure with authorities that appeared to show McLeod. The brochure was from a Salvadoran English school not far from the Guatemalan hotel, she said.",
      "It was this image that prompted Wentzel to conclude: \u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201d",
      "Four days later, on Aug. 30, 2022, authorities announced that McLeod had been taken into custody in Sonsonate, El Salvador, where he\u2019d been teaching English. He landed in San Diego the next day.",
      "Wentzel wrestled with a tangle of emotion as McLeod\u2019s arraignment approached. She thought about her daughter\u2019s final moments and ticked through a litany of revenge fantasies, she recalled. But she didn\u2019t want to stew in hatred and bitterness. So she tried to focus on her daughter\u2019s children, whom she and her husband have raised, and on the other victims she\u2019s sought to help.",
      "\u201cMurder does this to you \u2014 it makes you somebody you\u2019re not, if you allow it,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t picture living my life out like this. I wanted to be a grandma and I just wanted to travel and have fun and live the rest of my life out with my family. But it made me something else.\u201d"

      "On the side of a dusty road in Gaza, dozens of mostly young men gather against the counter of a makeshift storefront. Under a canvas roof, the acrylic display cases are filled with boxes of high-end cellphones.",
      "It is a surreal spectacle: Palestinians, many displaced from their bombed-out homes, malnourished, sick and jobless in this collapsed economy, being sold the recently released iPhone 17 Pro. Even budget phones have been selling for as much as 5,000 shekels \u2014 around $1,500 \u2014 according to customers in Gaza, where prices have spiked to 10 times those in other countries.",
      "That such luxury items are in supply, but often food or medicine is still scarce, is exasperating aid workers and Palestinians. Experts interviewed for this story said Israel\u2019s border controls often make commercial goods easier to transport than humanitarian aid. Though the flow has increased during the shaky ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the United Nations and other groups say they are still facing serious restrictions on urgent items.",
      "\u201cWe cannot even afford food \u2014 how are we supposed to afford phones?\u201d asked Samir Kamal Awad Abou Dakaa, 52, who was a construction worker before the war and has a wife and five children to feed.",
      "His family lives in a tent encampment in the southern city of Khan Younis, where his kids are given Arabic lessons using a scrap of blackboard and fed rice at a local soup kitchen. His faded blue track jacket, thinning hair and quiet voice betray what he calls a \u201cbeyond difficult\u201d life.",
      "This contrast is not new for Gaza, said Mona Jebril, a research fellow at England\u2019s University of Cambridge who lived in the territory for 22 years. \u201cBefore the war and during the siege, there were mobile phones and expensive cars. But because of the extra restrictions on the borders, the massive devastation and humanitarian catastrophe, then this paradox comes to light even more.\u201d",
      "This is the latest twist in efforts to get aid into Gaza during a patchy ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. While President Donald Trump\u2019s peace plan appears to be holding, albeit with regular Israeli airstrikes, the crisis endures.",
      "Nearly all of the population of some 2 million has been displaced, 80% of the buildings have been destroyed or damaged, and 9,000 children were hospitalized for malnutrition in October alone, according to the U.N.",
      "The ceasefire has changed things. Some 65,000 pallets of aid came into Gaza during the first month of the ceasefire, the U.N. said, double the previous four weeks. But essential equipment, such as forklift trucks and mobile storage units, is still being \u201csystematically rejected by Israeli authorities,\u201d the U.N.\u2019s humanitarian affairs office (OCHA) said. Medical equipment, food parcels and solar lighting, meanwhile, are still being \u201cblocked from entry at scale\u201d by Israeli restrictions, administrative controls and logistics backlogs, OCHA said.",
      "An analysis of Israeli figures by The Associated Press earlier this month showed there has been a shortfall in aid deliveries, with Israel agreeing to let in 600 trucks per day but the true daily average totaling 459."

      "LONDON \u2014 European allies reacted with outrage Wednesday after the Trump administration sanctioned online safety campaigners accused of censoring \u201cAmerican viewpoints.\u201d",
      "The five people Secretary of State Marco Rubio banned from entering the United States include a former top European Union official and four high-profile activists against hate speech and disinformation on social media.",
      "Rubio accused the five sanctioned figures of leading \u201corganized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose.\u201d",
      "These \u201cradical activists and weaponized NGOs have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states,\u201d he added, using the acronym to refer to nongovernmental organizations. \u201cThe Trump administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship.\u201d",
      "It marks a dramatic escalation of Washington\u2019s war on what it sees as censorship from across the Atlantic. Europe has previously seen Vice President JD Vance berate its leaders over perceived failures on free speech.",
      "For many on the continent and elsewhere, however, the move comes as an amplification of the Trump administration\u2019s own crackdown on viewpoints that don\u2019t align with its own.",
      "The pushback from Washington also comes after European attempts to regulate American tech giants such as the Elon Musk-owned platform X, which was fined 120 million euros (around $140 million) by the European Union earlier this month for \"breaching transparency obligations.\"",
      "The European Commission, which is the E.U.'s executive arm, as well as the German Justice Ministry and French President Emmanuel Macron all condemned the move.",

      "Musk said back in 2022 that he supported the law, but began to change with the fine against X \u2014 the first under the new legal powers \u2014 which he called \"bulls---.\" He has also referred to Breton as a \"tyrant of Europe,\" while Rubio and JD Vance both condemned the fine.",
      "\u201cIs McCarthy\u2019s witch hunt back?\u201d Breton wrote on X, referring to the 1950s anti-communist campaign led by Republican Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy. \u201cTo our American friends: \u2018Censorship isn\u2019t where you think it is.\u2019\u201d",

Rogers, the under secretary of state, called Ahmed a \u201ckey collaborator with the Biden administration\u2019s effort to weaponize the government against U.S. citizens\u201d and noted that CCDH had previously put out a report that named now-Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as part of the \"disinformation dozen.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Ahmed, a U.S. permanent resident, filed a lawsuit against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other Trump officials over the sanctions. On Thursday, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order that forbade law enforcement from arresting or detaining Ahmed before his case is heard.",
      "Next on the list was Clare Melford, head of the Global Disinformation Index, a nonprofit organization based in the United Kingdom that tries to tackle disinformation. Rogers accused the group of using American \u201ctaxpayer money to exhort censorship and blacklisting of American speech and press.\u201d",
      "The State Department also sanctioned Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon, both co-leaders of the German nonprofit HateAid, whose mission statement is to \u201cstrengthen democracy in digital space\u201d by providing legal support to victims of \u201cdigital violence.\u201d",
      "Hodenberg and Ballon told NBC News in a statement that this was \"an act of repression by a government that is increasingly disregarding the rule of law and trying to silence its critics by any means necessary.\"",
      "They added: \u201cWe will not be intimidated by a government that uses accusations of censorship to silence those who stand up for human rights and freedom of expression.\u201d",
      "The Global Disinformation Index condemned the measures as an \u201cauthoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship.\u201d",

The White House has portrayed its actions as necessary to break the decadeslong liberal bias held by media and government elites, while for critics, it is an attempt to silence dissent and promote illiberal, often hate, speech online.",

      "SYDNEY \u2014 The sense of anger is palpable among members of the Jewish community in and around Bondi Beach as it reels from the attack on a Hanukkah celebration that killed 15 people.",
      "Much of their fury is directed at the government, which has been accused of failing to heed warnings about antisemitic threats ahead of the Dec. 14 attack. But there has also been sadness and soul-searching about the place the community has in a neighborhood well known for its Jewish roots, and in Australia\u2019s wider society.",
      "Linda Royal said her parents fled Poland after the invasion by Nazi Germany in 1939, arriving first in Lithuania. They landed in Sydney two years later, aided by illegal transit visas issued by a Japanese diplomat.",
      "\u201cLike many migrants, they came to Bondi because it was working-class and inexpensive,\u201d she told NBC News last week close to the site of the shooting, on a hill where thousands of flowers had been laid in tribute to the victims.",
      "In the years since her parents\u2019 arrival, Royal said, the Jewish community has swelled in the neighborhood and its surrounding suburbs, first with Holocaust survivors and later with refugees known as refuseniks from countries in the former Soviet Union, some of whom had been denied permission to emigrate to Israel.",
      "\u201cThere was a huge sense of community,\u201d Royal said. \u201cThe Jewish community sticks together. We\u2019re constantly unfortunately on the run from persecution.\u201d",
      "Australia\u2019s worst mass shooting in decades has \u201ccompletely ripped us apart,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll never be the same again.\u201d",
      "Authorities have identified the two suspects as 24-year-old Naveed Akram and his 50-year-old father, Sajid Akram. The elder Akram was shot dead at the scene, while his son was charged last week with 59 offenses, including terrorism and 15 counts of murder, after waking up from a coma.",
      "Investigators have said the pair were inspired by the ideology of the Islamic State terrorist group. Two homemade ISIS flags were found in the younger suspect\u2019s car, police have said. ISIS has praised but not officially claimed the attack, referring to it in an official publication as \u201cSydney\u2019s pride.\u201d",
      "As well as sadness about the attack, \u201cthere\u2019s a great deal of anger, a great deal of rage,\u201d Alex Ryvchin, the co-chief executive officer of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, said via phone on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that not only was the writing on the wall, but the community explicitly and repetitively told the government what was going to happen,\u201d said Ryvchin, who was born in Ukraine before he moved to Australia as a child.",
      "The shooting was \u201ca clear escalation from violent slogans and aggressive street protests and abuse of Jews on the streets, to harassment and vandalism of Jewish property and then finally the firebombings,\u201d he said, referring to several arson attacks on synagogues in recent years. This \u201cwas always going to end in murder, and that\u2019s exactly where we are,\u201d he added.",
      "Ryvchin, whose former home was daubed with antisemitic language and cars were set alight earlier this year, said both Australia\u2019s federal government and provincial leaders in the state of New South Wales had failed to act on proposals to curb antisemitic violence.",
      "These included more visible policing and a clampdown on pro-Palestinian protests that had become increasingly aggressive and turned people against the Jewish community, he added.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, whose poll numbers were found by The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper to have plunged by 15 points in the wake of the attack, said Tuesday that his government would address hate speech and gun control and work with states on new laws.",

      "New South Wales, where Bondi is situated, debated tougher gun laws on Tuesday. The state\u2019s leader is also trying to ban the display of terrorist symbols and curb protests. Other states have indicated they\u2019ll try to follow suit.",
      "But while they were welcomed by some, others were critical of the hasty way the government tried to bring them in. Antony Loewenstein, a journalist and author who serves on the advisory committee of the Jewish Council of Australia, a progressive group that advocates for \u201cPalestinian freedom,\u201d said: \u201cI think they\u2019re an absolute abomination.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are rushed, not thought through, and they\u2019re arguably unconstitutional,\u201d he said, adding that he thought they would be challenged in court.",
      "Three activist groups representing those in support of Palestine and Indigenous Australians have said they\u2019ll challenge the proposed laws in Australia\u2019s high court.",
      "Loewenstein also disputed Ryvchin\u2019s claim that pro-Palestinian marches in Australia, some of the largest of which have taken place in Sydney, had incited violence against the Jewish community.",
      "Australia is home to many \u201cprogressive Jews who are deeply against Israel\u2019s mass slaughtering in Gaza\u201d and oppose Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government, Lowenstein said.",
      "\u201cThe truth of the matter is that there is literally no connection that we are aware of between the murderers, these two men, father and son, and the pro-Palestine movement. Zero,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are worried and scared, of course, by the direct targeting of Jews but also deeply concerned that our fears are being weaponized in the service of deeply antidemocratic and draconian policies,\u201d he added.",
      "Others like Ryvchin are calling for a Royal Commission, or a major public inquiry into the attack. It is necessary so \u201cJewish people can walk down the street without fear and maybe next year we can get together again, as we have every year, and kindle the Hanukkah flames and hopefully not do it with police snipers on roofs,\u201d he said.",
      "Albanese has so far resisted calls to do this, saying he wants to avoid a drawn-out process and that Royal Commissions haven\u2019t been held after similar incidents.",
      "Whether it takes place or not, back in Bondi, Linda Royal said things would not be the same again.",
      "\u201cWe now associate this place with yet another place of a Jewish massacre, and that can never be taken away,\u201d she said."

      "On Monday morning, \u201can explosive device planted under the bottom of a car was detonated\u201d on Yasenevaya Street in the south of the city, Russian Investigative Committee spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko said in a statement.",
      "\u201cInvestigators are pursuing various theories regarding the murder,\u201d Petrenko said. \u201cOne of them is that the crime was orchestrated by Ukrainian intelligence agencies.\u201d",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin had been \"immediately\" told about the incident, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.",

      "In April, it claimed responsibility for killing Lt. Gen. Yaroslav Moskalik in a car bomb near the Russian capital. And in December 2024, it said it was behind the death of Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the head of Russia's chemical, radiological and biological weapons unit.",

      "Meanwhile, Witkoff met separately with Ukrainian and European representatives, calling those discussions \"productive and constructive.\"",
      "Despite the positive words, the White House's monthslong push for peace has so far failed to bridge the gap between Moscow's maximalist demands and the grave concerns held by Kyiv and Europe.",
