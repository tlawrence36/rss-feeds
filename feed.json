      "JAIPUR, India -- The film that was submitted as India\u2019s official Oscar entry but failed to make the final list of nominees has swept the International Indian Film Academy Awards, which recognize outstanding work in the country's film industry.",
      "Director Kiran Rao\u2019s critically acclaimed \u201cLaapataa Ladies\u201d \u2014 renamed \u201cLost Ladies\u201d for its Oscar campaign \u2014 emerged as the biggest winner at the 2025 IIFA Awards, bagging 10 wins, including best picture and best direction.",
      "The 2023 comedy is about two veiled brides who are accidentally swapped during a train ride, and tackles issues of patriarchy and gender roles, a shift from decades of male-centered mainstream Indian movies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a rare privilege to win an award for a film like \u2018Laapataa Ladies.' It\u2019s been a wonderful night. It\u2019s a rare privilege to make a film like this,\u201d Rao said in her acceptance speech.",
      "Rao's film \u2014 a rare departure from most Bollywood films, which typically feature song-and-dance routines, violence and melodrama \u2014 also won in categories for best story, best screenplay and best actress in a leading role.",
      "The annual ceremony of IIFA began in the western city of Jaipur on Saturday and concluded Sunday.",
      "Indian cinema\u2019s most recognizable names took part in the glitzy event and Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan and actor Shahid Kapoor were among those who performed at the ceremony. The event was hosted by veteran director and producer Karan Johar and actor Kartik Aaryan.",

      "\u201cParasite\u201d filmmaker Bong Joon Ho\u2019s original science fiction film \u201cMickey 17\u201d opened in first place on the North American box office charts. According to studio estimates Sunday, the Robert Pattinson-led film earned $19.1 million in its first weekend in theaters, which was enough to dethrone \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d after a three-week reign.",
      "Overseas, \u201cMickey 17\u201d has already made $34.2 million, bringing its worldwide total to $53.3 million. But profitability for the film is a long way off: It cost a reported $118 million to produce, which does not account for millions spent on marketing and promotion.",

It\u2019s an original film from an Oscar-winning director led by a big star that was afforded a blockbuster budget and given a robust theatrical release by Warner Bros., one of the few major studios remaining. But despite all of that, and reviews that were mostly positive (79% on RottenTomatoes), audiences did not treat it as an event movie, and it may ultimately struggle to break even.",
      "Originally set for release in March 2024, Bong Joon Ho\u2019s follow-up to the Oscar-winning \u201cParasite\u201d faced several delays, which he has attributed to extenuating circumstances around the Hollywood strikes. Based on the novel \u201cMickey7\u201d by Edward Ashton, Pattinson plays an expendable employee who dies on missions and is re-printed time and time again. Steven Yeun, Naomi Ackie, Toni Collette and Mark Ruffalo also star.",
      "It opened in 3,807 locations domestically where it performed best in New York and Los Angeles. Premium large format showings, including IMAX screens, also accounted for nearly half of its opening weekend. Internationally, it did especially well in Korea, where it made an estimated $14.6 million.",
      "Second place went to \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World,\u201d which added $8.5 million from 3,480 locations in North America and $9.2 million internationally. Its global total currently rests at $370.8 million. The Walt Disney Studios is on track to become the first studio to cross $1 billion in 2025 sometime this week.",
      "Holdovers \u201cLast Breath,\u201d \u201cThe Monkey\u201d and \u201cPaddington in Peru\u201d rounded out the top five.

      "Kebede, a first-generation Ethiopian American from Los Angeles, spent five years touring with \u201cHamilton,\u201d most recently in the role of Angelica Schuyler. Stepping into \u201cWicked\u201d on Tuesday marked her Broadway debut.",

      "\u201cI just had this creative craving in terms of storytelling in the theatrical way that I was missing,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I sat my mother down and I was like, \u2018Look, I think I need just a couple years to explore this creative endeavor.\u2019\u201d",

      "Authorities are preparing to reveal more information about the investigation into the deaths of actor Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- Authorities are set to reveal more information about an investigation into the deaths of actor Gene Hackman and wife Betsy Arakawa, whose partially mummified bodies were discovered last month at their home in New Mexico.",
      "The Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office has said it does not suspect foul play, and tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative.",
      "Sheriff Adan Mendoza and state fire, health and forensics officials scheduled an afternoon news conference Friday to provide updates on the case.",
      "Mendoza has said the couple may have died up to two weeks before they were discovered on Feb. 26. Hackman\u2019s pacemaker last showed activity Feb. 17, nine days before maintenance and security workers showed up at the home and alerted police.",
      "Arakawa was found with an open prescription bottle and pills scattered on the bathroom counter, while Hackman was found in the home\u2019s entryway.",
      "One of the couple's three dogs also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs survived. Authorities initially misidentified the breed of the dead animal.",
      "Authorities retrieved personal items from the home including a monthly planner and two cellphones that will be analyzed. Medical investigators have been working to establish the cause of their deaths, but toxicology reports often take weeks to complete.",
      "When they were found, the bodies were decomposing with some mummification, a consequence of body type and climate in Santa Fe\u2019s especially dry air at an elevation of nearly 7,200 feet (2,200 meters).",
      "Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d \"Hoosiers\" and \u201cSuperman\u201d from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s.",
      "Arakawa, born in Hawaii, studied as a concert pianist, attended the University of Southern California and met Hackman in the mid-1980s while working at a California gym.",
      "The couple\u2019s stucco, Pueblo-revival style home sits on a hill in a gated community at the southern tip of the Rocky Mountains. Santa Fe is known as a refuge for celebrities, artists and authors.",
      "Hackman dedicated much of his time in retirement to painting and writing novels far from Hollywood\u2019s social circuit. He served for several years on the board of trustees at the Georgia O\u2019Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, and he and his wife were investors in local businesses."

      "Iran\u2019s semiofficial Fars news agency, quoting an anonymous official, said the sentence was for him drinking and having alcoholic drinks, not his music.",
      "The lashes were \u201cfully carried out in Branch 4 of the Enforcement of Sentences Office at the Tehran Morality Security Prosecutor\u2019s Office, and Mr. Mehdi Yarahi\u2019s case has been closed,\u201d Minuei said.",
      "Yarahi wrote and performed the song \u201cRoosarito,\" Farsi for \u201cYour Headscarf.\" The music video urged women to remove their hijabs and featured uncovered women dancing. Yarahi's initial arrest in August was believed to be linked to the video, which is still available online.",
      "Yarahi wrote on X apparently after the flogging: \u201cHe who is not willing to pay a price for freedom is not worthy of it.\u201d",
      "On the streets of Iranian cities, it\u2019s becoming more common to see a woman passing by without a mandatory headscarf, or hijab, after the second anniversary of the death of Mahsa Amini and the mass protests it sparked in 2022.",
      "Amini, 22, died on Sept. 16, 2022, in a hospital after her arrest by the country\u2019s morality police over allegedly not wearing her hijab to the liking of the authorities.",
      "The protests that followed Amini\u2019s death started first with the chant \u201cWomen, Life, Freedom.\u201d However, the protesters\u2019 cries soon grew into open calls of revolt against 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
      "The monthslong security crackdown that followed killed more than 500 people and saw over 22,000 detained. Only Afghanistan and Iran mandate women wearing the hijab.",
      "Meanwhile, online videos showed uncovered women attending the 12th Iran Interior Design Award ceremony, as well as men and women shaking hands. The judiciary's Mizan news agency reported Thursday that prosecutors had announced legal action against all organizers, hosts and individuals seen violating Iran's laws.",

      "Seven years ago, global pop phenomenon Jennie became the first member of the K-pop group Blackpink to release solo music",
      "NEW YORK -- She was the first to go \u201cSOLO.\u201d",
      "Seven years ago, global pop phenomenon Jennie became the first member of the K-pop group Blackpink to release solo music. On Friday, she becomes the latest to drop a debut solo studio album, the English-language \u201cRuby.\u201d It's a kaleidoscope of different sounds for Jennie, full of incongruous, polished pleasures.",
      "\u201cSOLO,\u201d her debut single, was a product of its time \u2013 nostalgic EDM-pop with pitched up whistle effects and simple, declarative lyrics. \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 solo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo,\" she repeated on the chorus. You had to believe her: She wasn\u2019t leaving her band, but a lackluster relationship, an ex so innocuous they're barely a player in the song. \u201cThis time I\u2019m only lookin\u2019 at me, myself and I,\u201d she sang, \u201cI\u2019ma do it on my own now.\u201d A lot has changed in the time since, but the core of her and her band's sonic messaging \u2014 self-empowerment above all else \u2014 hasn't wavered.",
      "On \u201cRuby,\u201d it's strongest on the singles \u201cMantra,\" where Jennie cheerleads in a chant-along chorus: \u201cPretty girls don\u2019t do drama \u2019less we wanna / it\u2019ll be depending on the day\" atop brassy production perfect for primetime commercial placement. Or \u201cExtraL\u201d with the innovative Doechii, whose acicular raps give additional weight to \u201cYeah, we lappin\u2019 the men,\u201d a line delivered with laughter.",
      "But it isn't all assertions of autonomy. On the languid \u201cLove Hangover\u201d with Dominic Fike, she's falling into destructive patterns with an undeserving partner; in a falsetto, her chameleonic vocal performance is so convincing, the recording almost doesn't even sound like Jennie. Or maybe it just doesn't sound like the Jennie fans have grown to known?",
      "Across \u201cRuby,\u201d don\u2019t expect cuts that would make a Blackpink record. Prior to \u201cRuby,\u201d Jennie had only worked with one producer \u2014 Teddy Park, a man synonymous with her girl group hits. This time around, she worked with an eclectic team ranging from Diplo to El Guincho \u2014 new voices to explore different facets of her personality. It's ambitious and glossy, moving from an acoustic ballad here (\u201cTwin\u201d), virtuosic rapping there (\u201cZen\u201d), to familiar beats on (\"With the IE (Way Up)\" and \u201cStart A War\u201d). And it pays off.",
      "Jennie tries her best Rihanna phrasing on the SZA-channeling \u201cStart A War,\" and maybe spends too much time with robust collaborations \u2014 Childish Gambino and Kali Uchis on the nostalgic R&B of \u201cDamn Right,\u201d Dua Lipa on \u201cHandlebars\" that launches straight into the chorus \u2014 perfect for TikTok.",
      "In whole, Jennie's \u201cRuby\u201d is a solid re-introduction to the Blackpink superstar. The songs are strong and diverse and nostalgic \u2014 but maybe not wholly distinctive. It is still a reason to be excited for her future solo work."

      "Research by the charity English Heritage suggests it may have found a portrait of England's shortest-reigning queen Lady Jane Grey",
      "LONDON -- A painting that has gone on public display Friday could be the only portrait of England's shortest-reigning queen, Lady Jane Grey, painted during her lifetime, according to the conservation group English Heritage.",
      "It said there is \u201ccompelling\u201d evidence to suggest that the portrait, on loan from a private collection, shows Jane, who was no older than 17 when she became queen for just nine days in the summer of 1553.",
      "One of England's most tragic regal figures, she was executed at the Tower of London in 1554. Jane was a devout Protestant at a time of religious upheaval, the ultimate innocent victim of the chicanery of the Tudor court in the chaotic aftermath of Henry VIII\u2019s reign.",
      "She is perhaps best-known from Paul Delaroche\u2019s painting, \u201cThe Execution of Lady Jane Grey,\u201d which hangs in the National Gallery in central London. Jane, who may have been as young as 16, is shown blindfolded as an executioner with an axe waits to behead her.",
      "But that painting, like the few others that purport to show Jane, all date from after her death.",
      "Now, English Heritage says a Tudor-era work could be a \u201clive\u201d painting of Jane. The portrait, along with six others, will hang at Wrest Park, a country estate west of London managed by English Heritage, and which incidentally is the location of many scenes of Netflix's steamy period drama \"Bridgerton.\"",
      "The charity worked with the Courtauld Institute of Art and scientist Ian Tyers, who specializes in dendrochronology, or the dating of tree rings. It said there is enough evidence to raise the question: \"Could this mysterious portrait be Lady Jane Grey?\"",
      "Among the evidence presented, English Heritage said the tree-dating points to the wooden panel having been constructed between 1539 and around 1571 \u2014 Jane is believed to have been born in 1536 or 1537 and was executed in early 1554. It also said the back of the panel displays a merchant or cargo mark, identical to one used on a royal portrait of King Edward VI, who, in an ultimately tragic turn, anointed his first cousin once removed as his successor.",
      "It also noted a \u201cstriking change\" in the eyes of the sitter to the left rather than the right and that at some point, the eyes, mouth and ears were deliberately scratched out. In addition, it said the sitter was likely wearing a more elaborate costume.",
      "Rachel Turnbull, English Heritage\u2019s Senior Collections Conservator, said the evidence points to the possibility that \u201cwe are looking at the shadows of a once more royal portrait of Lady Jane Grey, toned down into subdued, Protestant martyrdom after her death.\u201d",
      "Jane was bright, reportedly spoke multiple languages and a big fan of Plato. But it was her commitment to Protestantism that interested Edward VI.",
      "Edward VI, the only surviving son of Henry VIII, was the first monarch to be raised a Protestant after his father split from Rome in order to divorce his first wife Catherine of Aragon. His mother was Henry's third wife, Jane Seymour, who Lady Jane was named after.",
      "On being informed in 1553 that he was terminally ill, the 15-year-old Edward wanted to bypass his older sisters Mary and Elizabeth, and named Lady Jane his heir to prevent the realm reverting to Catholicism.",
      "On July 10, Jane became queen but was deposed nine days later after her support melted away in the wake of an uprising by Mary's supporters. Jane was subsequently convicted of treason and sentenced to death."

      "He died Sunday in Lakeland, Florida, two of his business representatives said. Lowe had been struggling to recover from elective heart surgery in November, his family said in a statement. \u201cOver the past few months, his family and friends have been by his side in support and care for him,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Lowe's booming voice and off-the-wall humor turned \u201cSpace Ghost Coast to Coast\u201d into a cult classic among young adults and teens.",
      "The show debuted in 1994 and aired for more than a decade on Cartoon Network as part of its Adult Swim nighttime programming block.

While the interviews with the likes of William Shatner, Conan O'Brien and Donny Osmond were pre-recorded, Lowe would later add wacky and rambling digressions, such as asking guests if they were getting enough oxygen.",
      "\u201cInsanity became en vogue, thanks to us,\u201d Lowe told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2004.",

      "\u201cYou all knew him as Space Ghost (and all his other characters), but we knew him as himself, a true character in his own right, one that left an indelible mark on all of us at Adult Swim,\u201d he said.",
      "The show's producers would begin recording Lowe as soon as he stepped into the booth, Ouweleen said, creating some of the best material \u201cwhen he didn\u2019t realize he was being recorded.\u201d",
      "Lowe voiced several other characters on Adult Swim shows, including \u201cRobot Chicken,\u201d \u201cAqua Teen Hunger Force\u201d and \u201cThe Brak Show.\u201d",
      "Until this past year, he continued to make regular appearances at comic book and sci-fi conventions.",
      "Lowe, who was born in Dunedin, Florida, began his career as a disc jockey and television personality in Florida and Georgia. He continued to do voice work for radio stations after Adult Swim.",
      "He was an avid folk and pop art collector and a self-taught artist whose intricate pen and ink drawings were displayed in several museums, including The High Museum of Art in Atlanta where his work is part of its permanent collection.",
      "There were no details available on his survivors. His family said there will be a private service.",

      "The annual Pritzker Architecture Prize has been awarded to Liu Jiakun of China, who earned the field\u2019s highest honor for \u201caffirming architecture that celebrates the lives of ordinary citizens,\u201d organizers announced Tuesday.",
      "Liu, based in Chengdu in China\u2019s southwestern Sichuan region, has said that the purpose of his architecture \u201cis to create a beautiful, just and dignified living environment,\u201d and that he tries to balance commercial needs with the human needs of the public.",
      "The architect \u201cupholds the transcendent power of the built environment through the harmonizing of cultural, historical, emotional and social dimensions, using architecture to forge community, inspire compassion and elevate the human spirit,\u201d Pritzker organizers said in a statement.",
      "Liu is known for creating public areas in highly populated cities where there is little public space, \u201cforging a positive relationship between density and open space,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Organizers cited his West Village in Chengdu, a 2015 five-story project that spans a block. It includes a perimeter of pathways for cyclists and pedestrians around \u201cits own vibrant city of cultural, athletic, recreational, office and business activities within, while allowing the public to view through to the surrounding natural and built environments.\u201d",
      "They also noted the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute Department of Sculpture in Chongqing, which they said displays an alternate solution to maximizing space, \u201cwith upper levels protruding outward to extend the square footage of a narrow footprint.\u201d",
      "In an interview Sunday in his office in Chengdu, Liu said he was not one of those architects who likes to have a strongly recognizable visual style. Rather, he said, he pays more attention to method and strategy.",
      "\u201cMany architects use a strong personal style and form to gain a foothold in the world,\u201d Liu told The Associated Press, speaking in Mandarin. \u201cNo matter where it is, people can tell immediately that it is his or her work with a very strong symbolism. But I am not such a kind of architect.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to have a very clear or obvious style that can be recognized as mine just at a glance,\u201d he said. \u201cI take a more methodological and strategic approach. I hope that when I go to a specific place, I can use my methodology and strategy to adapt to local conditions. I like to fully understand the place, and then look for resources, problems \u2026 and then distill and refine, and finally turn (this) into my work.\u201d",
      "Liu also said he tries to balance his country\u2019s artistic and architectural heritage with the realities of modern technology.",
      "\u201cI think China\u2019s traditional architecture is of course brilliant and very classic,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is a product of its time.\u201d",
      "He said he hopes to deeply understand \u201cthe thematic part of tradition that can survive,\u201d and then express it with contemporary technology and language. In that way, he said, \u201ctradition can be used as a core \u2026 but the presentation of your work is contemporary.\u201d",
      "Liu said he also seeks to balance commercial imperatives with civic concerns.",
      "\u201cThe rapid development of cities nowadays is basically driven by capital. It is natural for capital to pursue profits,\u201d he said. But he added: \u201cYou have to leave the public the space they deserve. Only in this way can the development of a city be positive and healthy, rather than being completely high-density, where people live in drawers and boxes \u2026 without even a place to go and no space for communication.\u201d",
      "Liu is the 54th laureate of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, established in 1979 by the late entrepreneur Jay A. Pritzker and his wife, Cindy. Winners receive a $100,000 grant and a bronze medallion.",
      "The prize has often been equated to the Nobel. Asked if he thought the honor would impact his life, Liu replied: \u201cI have thought about it. But I want to maintain normalcy \u2026 I don\u2019t want to become nervous about everything. Of course, it has its advantages. I will definitely not need to promote myself too much. But will it also make me better at work? Not necessarily. Excessive expectations may become a pressure.\u201d",
      "He had another concern, too.",
      "\u201cAnd will it make me too busy and prevent me from working more attentively?\u201d he pondered. \u201cI hope to keep the normalcy and the freedom, as well as calmness.\u201d",

      "But take a look at Kiefer's 2019 \u201cThe Crows,\u201d alongside Van Gogh's 1890 \u201cWheatfield with Crows,\u201d and the inspiration for the German's work jumps from the wall.",
      "The brooding black birds aren't the only shared subjects that the two artists depict.",
      "One of Van Gogh's most famous inspirations \u2014 sunflowers \u2014 also appear in Kiefer's works.",
      "A huge dried sunflower hangs upside down in a glass cabinet, shedding its seeds on a book made from lead sheets, while \u201cSol Invictus\u201d shows a sunflower towering over the artist, who is lying in a yoga position known as the corpse pose.",
      "The show also includes some of his sketches from his trip retracing Van Gogh's footsteps.",
      "The 79-year-old German artist has a long relationship not just with Van Gogh, but also with the Stedelijk and Dutch collectors who bought some of his early works. The Stedelijk is showing early pieces such as a sculpture of an aeroplane resembling a B-1 bomber that is made of lead and called \u201cJourney to the end of the Night.\u201d",
      "The centerpiece of the Stedelijk is the installation for which the show is named. Built up around the museum's central staircase, it features paint-splattered clothes on hangers and flower petals spilling down paintings and into piles on the floor, among many things.",
      "Kiefer said that he wrote one of the lines in the Seeger song, which was later also sung in German by Marlene Dietrich, on the wall as part of the installation: \u201cWho will ever learn?\u201d",
      "\"This sentence makes the song philosophical,\" he told reporters. \"You know, because we cannot understand. We cannot understand, for example, that today things happened in (19)33 in the world.\u201d",
      "Asked about the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party that surged in last month's German election, he said: \u201cIt's horrible.\u201d",
      "The huge central work is made up of a long list of components including emulsion, oil, acrylic, shellac, golf leaf, sediment of electrolysis, dried flowers, straw, fabric and steel.",
      "The straw features in many of Kiefer\u2019s paintings, giving them a complex surface that sometimes echoes Van Gogh\u2019s bold brush strokes.",
      "\"He\u2019s working like a sort of ... alchemist transforming material into an art,\u201d curator Edwin Bakker of the Van Gogh Museum told The Associated Press.",
      "The exhibition opens March 7 and runs until June 9 at the Van Gogh Museum and Stedelijk Museum."

    "story": [
      "George Clooney, the proud son of a journalist, likes journalism and telling truth to power",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 George Clooney made waves in July when he called on Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential race, citing diminished capacity. For Clooney, there wasn't a choice to stay silent.",
      "\u201cI was raised to tell the truth and telling the truth means telling it when it's not comfortable,\" the actor-director and big Democratic booster tells The Associated Press. \u201cI did what I was raised and taught to do. That\u2019s it.\u201d",
      "There was inevitable backlash \u2014 just as there was back when he was branded a traitor for speaking out against the invasion of Iraq \u2014 but Clooney took the hits.",
      "\u201cTelling the truth to power or taking chances like that \u2014we\u2019ve seen it over our history,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here and survived these things and we will survive it.\u201d",
      "Clooney's truth-to-power stance takes another step this spring as he makes his Broadway debut, telling the story of legendary reporter Edward R. Murrow in an adaptation of his 2005 film \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck.\u201d Performances starts March 12.",
      "Murrow, who died in 1965, is considered one of the architects of U.S. broadcast news and perhaps his greatest moment was opposing Sen. Joe McCarthy, who cynically created paranoia of a communist threat in the 1950s.",
      "\u201cThis is a story about who we are at our best, when we hold our own feet to the fire, when we check and balance ourselves,\u201d says Clooney. \u201cWhat\u2019s scary about now and the difference between Murrow\u2019s time is that we\u2019ve now decided that truth is negotiable.\u201d",
      "In the movie version \u2014 which Clooney co-wrote with Grant Heslov \u2014 the role of Murrow went to David Strathairn and Clooney played CBS executive Fred Friendly; this time, Clooney takes up the mantle of Murrow. When he and Heslov did a reading for theater investors he just played Murrow and the financiers agreed to sink their money in the play \u2014 on the condition Clooney stay in the role.",
      "As in the movie, the play version will have footage of the real McCarthy on screens and the stage will resemble a newsroom with several dozen old-fashioned monitors mixing old and new footage.",
      "The transition to Broadway makes a lot of sense since many of the movie's reviewers said it felt to them a lot like a play. It actually was originally conceived as a live TV movie, an idea scuttled after Justin Timberlake exposed Janet Jackson's nipple in the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show and scared away any notion of live network events.",
      "\u201cIt is an incredibly literary play,\u201d says Tony-winning director David Cromer. \u201cIt is filled with debate. It is filled with well-reasoned and very complex arguments about is this the right thing to do? Is this the right thing to do now? What happens when we do this? How do we say this?\u201d",
      "Two-time Oscar winner Clooney returns to Murrow at a time when journalists are under fire from the new U.S. administration and being denied access for not following White House talking points.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t decide to remount or do the play for any real political reasons,\u201d says Heslov, a frequent Clooney collaborator who is also making his Broadway writing debut. \u201cIt turns out that the environment might be ripe for it.\u201d",
      "Murrow had a large presence in Clooney\u2019s home growing up. His father, Nick Clooney, a veteran journalist, worked as a TV news anchor and host in a variety of cities including Cincinnati, Salt Lake City and Los Angeles. He also wrote a newspaper column in Cincinnati and taught journalism at American University.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m the son of a journalist, a proper journalist, a guy who tells the truth. My father\u2019s still out there fighting the good fight,\u201d says Clooney. \u201cI believe in it. I believe in the whole idea of how this works.\u201d",
      "Clooney is part of a starry group of Hollywood veterans arriving on Broadway this season, a list that includes Denzel Washington, Jake Gyllenhaal, Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey Jr., Jim Parsons, Sarah Snook and John Mulaney.",
      "Clooney insisted before he came that he didn't want to be the highest paid actor on Broadway. It mirrored the time he mortgaged his house and paid himself a salary of just $1 to finance the movie version of \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo me, it\u2019s like, pay Patti LuPone the most of anybody on Broadway. Pay somebody who\u2019s paid their dues. It shouldn\u2019t be somebody who\u2019s doing his first Broadway play,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t want to be part of that. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d",
      "The box office for a ticket to see him at the Winter Garden is white hot even before previews begin but Clooney deflects that to Murrow \u2014 it's not me, he suggests, it's the character he's playing.",
      "\u201cThe words of Edward Murrow are words that kind of soothe us,\" he says. \"It\u2019s a salve for insanity. And I think people are excited to be in a room and share some of those conversations.\u201d",
      "Clooney hasn't done a full-length play since he got his Equity Card in 1986 in Chicago as the comic relief in \u201cVicious,\u201d about punk icon Sid Vicious. \u201cMost of the cast members that I\u2019m working with weren\u2019t born when I did my last play. So it\u2019s scary,\u201d he says.",
      "He thought he'd missed his chance at Broadway, a notch on many actor's bucket list. He's 63 now and it would mean uprooting his family for months.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve succeeded in my career. I\u2019m not saying that I haven\u2019t succeeded, but I hadn\u2019t done anything on Broadway and I thought maybe it\u2019s too late,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d been offered a couple of plays that I didn\u2019t think I was right for, and I thought if I was going to do it, I should do something that I was right for. And this was an opportunity where I thought, \u2018Well, I know how to tell this story. I may not do a great job with it. You know, I may really screw it up, but I know what\u2019s required of the thing.\u2019\u201d"

      "PARIS -- Doja Cat took her front-row seat at Balmain\u2019s fall show at Paris Fashion Week, fresh off her appearance at the Oscars in a custom beaded Balmain gown. But on the runway, designer Olivier Rousteing shifted from red carpet opulence to a new kind of luxury, built on sculptural knitwear, fluid draping and dazzling blown-up zebra motifs.",
      "The Wednesday night collection opened with a now-familiar silhouette from Rousteing \u2014 a swooping hooded sweater, this time paired with a leather peplum and relaxed leather trousers. Knitwear remained the focus \u2014 draped mohair, wool jersey dresses and cocooning sweaters gave the collection a sense of ease.",
      "The monochrome \u201cgroutfit\u201d made a strong showing, broken up by the rich textural play of pleats, ruched tops and embossed leathers that kept the palette from falling flat.",
      "That softness found its counterbalance in statement hardware and a flash of animalistic energy. Chunky bracelets, talon earrings and that bold, graphic zebra motif, paired with oversized coats and slouchy boots reminded us this was still Balmain.",
      "The footwear was a standout. Sculpturally twisted pumps and fuzzy or buttery-soft leather boots injected a playful contrast into the collection\u2019s rhythm of black, white and bursts of citrus orange.",
      "Though the emphasis on draping and ease was a shift, the Balmain DNA shone through in the accessories. Rousteing\u2019s experiment with volume felt like a recalibration rather than a reinvention, proving once again that luxury isn\u2019t just about excess, but knowing when to let the clothes breathe."

      "Thomas Jolly filed a complaint for death threats after receiving homophobic and antisemitic abuse on social networks.

      "The abuse last summer quickly escalated, including attacks based on Jolly's sexual orientation and wrongly assumed Israeli roots, and reportedly aimed to silence the artistic intent of the show. Jolly responded by filing a formal complaint with the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office on July 31, prompting an investigation that led to arrests in the south of France in October 2024.",

      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 Actor Gene Hackman died of heart disease a full week after his wife died from hantavirus in their New Mexico hillside home, likely unaware that she was dead because he was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, authorities revealed Friday.",
      "Both deaths were ruled to be from natural causes, chief medical examiner Dr. Heather Jarrell said alongside state fire and health officials at a news conference.",
      "\u201cMr. Hackman showed evidence of advanced Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d Jarrell said. \u201cHe was in a very poor state of health. He had significant heart disease, and I think ultimately that\u2019s what resulted in his death.\u201d",
      "Authorities didn't suspect foul play after the bodies of Hackman, 95, and Betsy Arakawa, 65, were discovered Feb 26. Immediate tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative.",
      "Investigators found that the last known communication and activity from Arakawa was Feb. 11 when she visited a pharmacy, pet store and grocery before returning to their gated neighborhood that afternoon, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said Friday.",
      "Hackman's pacemaker last showed signs of activity a week later and that he had an abnormal heart rhythm Feb. 18, the day he likely died, Jarrell said.",
      "Although there was no reliable way to determine the date and time when both died, all signs point to their deaths coming a week apart, Jarrell said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite possible he was not aware she was deceased,\u201d Jarrell said.",
      "Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner, said he believes Hackman was severely impaired due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and unable to deal with his wife\u2019s death in the last week of his life.",
      "Most older Americans with dementia live at home, and many receive care from family or friends.",
      "Their bodies were found a little over a week later. Hackman was found in the home\u2019s entryway. His death was tied to heart disease with Alzheimer\u2019s disease contributing.",
      "Arakawa was found in a bathroom. Authorities linked her death to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings. Thyroid medication pills prescribed to Arakawa were found nearby and weren\u2019t listed as contributing to her death, Jarrell said.",
      "Hantavirus typically is reported in spring and summer, often due to exposures that occur when people are near mouse droppings in homes, sheds or poorly ventilated areas. This is the first confirmed case of hantavirus in New Mexico this year.",
      "While hantavirus is found throughout the world, most cases in the U.S. have been found in western states. The virus can cause a severe and sometimes deadly lung infection.",
      "Jarrell said it was not known how quickly Arakawa died.",
      "One of the couple\u2019s three dogs also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs survived. Authorities initially misidentified the breed.",
      "Dogs do not get sick from hantavirus, said Erin Phipps, a veterinarian with the New Mexico Health Department. The sheriff considers this an open investigation until they receive results of the dog's necropsy and finish checking into data from personal cellphones retrieved from the home.",
      "When Hackman and Arakawa were found, the bodies were decomposing with some mummification, a consequence of body type and climate in Santa Fe\u2019s especially dry air at an elevation of nearly 7,200 feet (2,200 meters).",
      "\u201cAll of us that knew him should have been checking on him,\u201d said Stuart Ashman, co-owner of Artes de Cuba gallery who cherished his encounters with Hackman at a local Pilates exercise studio, where they used to swap stories. \u201cI had no idea. ... It's just really sad. And that she died a week before him. My God.\u201d",
      "Dr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist in Virginia, said when two bodies are found at the same time, the usual assumption would be that they died at the same time. But Hackman\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease added a complicating factor: He apparently was unable to seek help after his wife died.",
      "\u201cThey died several days apart: One dying of a viral infection, the hantavirus, which can kill quite quickly. And the other death occurring from heart disease. And that too can be a relatively sudden death,\" Weedn said. \"Their (the authorities\u2019) explanation, I thought, was quite clear and plausible. I believe they really discovered what truly happened in this case.\u201d",
      "Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d \u201cHoosiers\u201d and \u201cSuperman\u201d from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s.",
      "Arakawa, born in Hawaii, studied as a concert pianist, attended the University of Southern California and met Hackman in the mid-1980s while working at a California gym.",
      "Hackman dedicated much of his time in retirement to painting and writing novels far from Hollywood\u2019s social circuit. He served for several years on the board of trustees at the Georgia O\u2019Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, and he and his wife were investors in local businesses.",

      "If you\u2019re about to go to the gym, should you eat something beforehand",
      "If you listen to some self-proclaimed exercise experts on social media, they swear that working out on an empty stomach burns more fat.",
      "But it\u2019s a common misconception that exercising in a fasted state improves performance or burns more calories, said Abby Langer, a dietitian in Toronto.",
      "\u201cThe research shows that in terms of gains, it doesn\u2019t really make much of a difference,\u201d she said.",
      "Does that mean you should load up on protein and carbs right before a workout? No, that\u2019s not true either.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at when \u2014 and how \u2014 you should eat, before, after or even during a workout. (And remember, experts say what you eat is more important than when you eat.)",
      "The calories in food literally are energy, so you need them to fuel your body for a proper workout. Eating too much too soon beforehand, though, can be problematic.",
      "Exercising diverts blood from organs including the stomach to the muscles, said Langer, author of \u201cGood Food, Bad Diet.\u201d So exercising on a full stomach affects the digestive process, which could cause cramping or even make you feel sick.",
      "That\u2019s particularly the case with meals high in fat, protein or fiber, which take longer to digest than carbohydrates. Langer recommends eating a high ratio of carbs beforehand and waiting two to three hours before intense exercise.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to eat a big steak an hour before you play hockey,\u201d she said.",
      "If you exercise first thing in the morning or before dinner, it\u2019s OK to have a carb-rich snack like a banana with peanut butter or yogurt with fruit beforehand. It will give you the energy to perform well, and you can fuel up afterward with a full meal.",
      "That steak may serve you better afterward because that\u2019s when a higher ratio of protein is easier to digest, said Krista Austin, a physiologist in Colorado Springs.",
      "Austin said if it will be an hour or longer before you can have a full meal, it\u2019s better to have a high-protein snack in the meantime to help curb your appetite. The reason has little to do with muscle recovery or nutrient absorption: Rather, people who are too hungry make poor dietary choices.",
      "\u201cA lot of people get very hungry about an hour after exercise, and you don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d said Austin, author of \u201cPerformance Nutrition: Applying the Science of Nutrient Timing.\u201d \u201cYou want to catch it early, or you go and overeat.\u201d",
      "But it\u2019s another myth that you need to grab a protein shake within minutes of finishing to build the biggest muscles, Langer said.",
      "Many exercise enthusiasts point to what\u2019s known as an \u201canabolic window\u201d of about an hour within exercising that the body is primed to repair muscle. For the average person, you have a much longer window, and nutrient timing is less important than making sure you consume some protein at every meal, Langer said. The body needs a continuous supply of amino acids like protein for muscle repair and maintenance, she said, which means about 25 to 30 grams at every meal, depending on various factors.",
      "\u201cPrioritizing that will help with goals, either muscle building, satiety, weight loss, all of that,\u201d Langer said.",
      "Most people who are eating enough throughout the day don\u2019t need anything during a workout. Langer and Austin said the threshold is about an hour of intense exercise. Longer than that \u2014 say you're training for a marathon \u2014 and you can benefit from a carb-rich snack in the middle.",
      "Instead of focusing on when to eat, Austin said to focus on what and how much. She cautioned against overcomplicating the topic and recommended following the USDA\u2019s My Plate recommendations for a balanced diet.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing we need to teach people is that nutrition is simple,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe you need to stop focusing on the concept of nutrient timing and just make sure that you\u2019re consistently eating throughout the day and focus on health.\u201d",

      "WARSAW, Poland -- Polish abortion rights activists opened a center across from the parliament building in Warsaw on Saturday where women can go to have abortions with pills, either alone or with other women.",
      "Opening the center on International Women's Day across from the legislature was a symbolic challenge to authorities in the traditionally Roman Catholic nation, which has one of Europe's most restrictive laws.",
      "A small but loud group of protesters stood outside the center as activists gathered inside for its inauguration. The activists had private security guards, while police also separated the protesters from those inside.",
      "Activists with the group Abortion Dream Team say it is the first stationary abortion center in Poland. It is meant to offer support to women who prefer not to have abortions alone in their bathrooms at home.",
      "They also say they want to put pressure on politicians and to destigmatize abortion in a society where they say one in four women have had the procedure but it remains a taboo topic.",

But the coalition he leads spans a broad ideological divide, with lawmakers on the left who want to legalize abortion and conservatives strongly opposed.",

      "Food and Drug Administration nominee Dr. Marty Makary is known for his contrarian views and fiery criticism of traditional medical institutions",
      "WASHINGTON -- Dr. Marty Makary rose to national attention by skewering the medical establishment in books and papers and bashing the federal response to COVID-19 on TV.",
      "Now the Johns Hopkins University surgeon and researcher has been nominated to lead the Food and Drug Administration. The agency \u2014 responsible for regulating products ranging from toothpaste to vaccines \u2014 is famously understated, issuing carefully worded statements devoid of opinion or scientific speculation.",
      "That's the opposite approach of Makary, whose sweeping rhetoric and biting criticism often veer into hyperbole, according to a review of recent speeches, interviews and podcast appearances by The Associated Press.",
      "Makary has called the U.S. food supply \u201cpoison,\u201d says the federal government is the \u201cgreatest perpetrator of misinformation\u201d about COVID-19 and regularly suggests that pesticides, fluoride and overuse of antibiotics may be to blame for rising rates of infertility, attention deficit disorder and other health conditions. He\u2019ll appear Thursday before a Senate panel considering his nomination.",
      "Makary\u2019s views align with those of the man who would be his boss: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary who built a following by sowing doubts about vaccines, ultraprocessed foods and fluoride. Notably, Makary has never embraced Kennedy\u2019s discredited idea that vaccines might cause autism.",
      "Experts who have worked with Makary say his contrarian approach could be useful at FDA \u2014 but only if he\u2019s able to resist political pressure from Kennedy and others on hot-button issues like vaccines.",
      "\u201cHe has this reputation of being someone who cares about evidence and transparency,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran of Yale University, who was part of an informal research group with Makary. \u201cThe question is whether he\u2019s going to preserve and defend the integrity of the agency or is he going to fall in line with the administration.\u201d",
      "Makary did not respond to an AP interview request.",
      "Trained as a pancreatic surgeon, Makary\u2019s initial work focused on uncontroversial topics like hospital costs and surgical checklists.",
      "In 2016, he made headlines with a paper stating that medical errors were \u201cthe third leading cause of death in the U.S.\u201d That conclusion was quickly disputed by other experts, who said the paper\u2019s death estimate was ten times higher than more rigorous reviews.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Makary reached a much broader audience as a regular on Fox News, where he opposed vaccine mandates and called the FDA \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cmired in politics and red tape.\u201d",
      "Makary often directs his harshest criticism toward the \u201cmedical hubris\u201d of fellow doctors, as in his latest book \u201cBlind Spots,\u201d which catalogues a number of cases where experts \u201cgot the science perfectly backwards.\u201d",
      "For example, he examines early recommendations that parents delay giving babies peanut-based foods due to allergy risks. Today, pediatricians generally recommend earlier introduction to prevent food allergies.",
      "Many researchers view such examples differently.",
      "\u201cThese are cases of people doing the best they can with evolving information and needing to make decisions along the way,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim of Harvard Medical School. \u201cAs commissioner, he\u2019s going to have to be OK with making decisions based on evolving evidence \u2014 and some of those decisions might be wrong.\u201d",
      "Like others in Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, Makary says many of the chronic health problems afflicting Americans may be related to food additives, pesticides and other chemicals.",
      "\u201cHow about research on the pesticides that have hormone effects in children that may explain the declining fertility and lowering age of puberty?\u201d Makary asked, in a September podcast with Dr. Drew Pinsky.",
      "New York University food researcher Marion Nestle says Makary\u2019s questions \u201care extremely difficult to settle,\u201d because there\u2019s no way to ethically do the type of research needed to reach a firm conclusion: give one group of children food with pesticides and compare them with a control group getting food not grown with pesticides.",
      "\u201cI sympathize with his frustration and think we would be much better off with a lot fewer pesticides in our food supply, but I tend to view these issues more cautiously,\u201d Nestle said.",
      "Nutrition experts also say it\u2019s overly simplistic to declare all ultraprocessed foods harmful, since the category includes an estimated 60% of U.S. foods, including granola, peanut butter and ice cream.",
      "\u201cThey are not all created equal,\u201d said Gabby Headrick of George Washington University. \u201cIt is much more complicated than just pointing the finger at ultraprocessed foods as the driver of chronic disease in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe greatest perpetrator of misinformation during the pandemic has been the United States government,\u201d Makary told House lawmakers during a 2023 roundtable hosted by Republicans.",
      "Among the many COVID-19 policies Makary attacked was the recommendation for booster shots in teens and young adults, particularly boys and young men. That group received particular attention because early vaccinations showed a higher rate of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation that is usually mild. Complicating the issue was the fact that COVID-19 itself also caused cases of myocarditis that were usually more severe.",
      "A 2022 paper coauthored by Makary concluded that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more injury than benefit. None of the authors specialized in studying infectious diseases or vaccine reactions.",
      "\u201cThey made mistake after mistake and every time it either minimized the vaccine\u2019s benefits or exaggerated the risks,\u201d said Dr. Robert Morris of the University of Washington, who published a critique of the work. \u201cThis paper really fed the whole notion that the vaccine is worse than the disease.\u201d",
      "Makary's conclusion contradicted that of U.K. experts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which estimated the booster prevented 114 hospitalizations for every seven it caused in young people.",
      "Despite such pushback, Makary told Congress that CDC and FDA \u201clied to the American people\u201d about the need for boosters and other COVID measures.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, an FDA vaccine adviser, says the Biden administration made missteps in rolling out boosters, including announcing plans to make them available for all age groups before outside experts had weighed in. But, Offit said, Makary\u2019s language has damaged public trust in health institutions, including the one he\u2019s been picked to lead.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s rhetoric that\u2019s purposefully inflammatory to win over a certain crowd, which is part of today\u2019s zeitgeist of disdaining public health agencies,\u201d Offit said. \u201cSo he\u2019s offered the position at FDA because he has disdain for the agency.\u201d",

      "A new study finds the number of butterflies has dropped 22% since 2000, a new study finds",
      "WASHINGTON -- America's butterflies are disappearing because of insecticides, climate change and habitat loss, with the number of the winged beauties down 22% since 2000, a new study finds.",
      "The first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday's journal Science.",
      "\u201cButterflies have been declining the last 20 years,\u201d said study co-author Nick Haddad, an entomologist at Michigan State University. \u201cAnd we don't see any sign that that's going to end.\"",
      "A team of scientists combined 76,957 surveys from 35 monitoring programs and blended them for an apples-to-apples comparison and ended up counting 12.6 million butterflies over the decades. Last month an annual survey that looked just at monarch butterflies, which federal officials plan to put on the threatened species list, counted a nearly all-time low of fewer than 10,000, down from 1.2 million in 1997.",
      "Many of the species in decline fell by 40% or more.",
      "David Wagner, a University of Connecticut entomologist who wasn't part of the study, praised its scope. And he said while the annual rate of decline may not sound significant, it is \u201ccatastrophic and saddening\u201d when compounded over time.",
      "\u201cIn just 30 or 40 years we are talking about losing half the butterflies (and other insect life) over a continent!\u201d Wagner said in an email. \"The tree of life is being denuded at unprecedented rates.\u201d",
      "The United States has 650 butterfly species, but 96 species were so sparse they didn't show up in the data and another 212 species weren't found in sufficient number to calculate trends, said study lead author Collin Edwards, an ecologist and data scientist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "\u201cI'm probably most worried about the species that couldn't even be included in the analyses\u201d because they were so rare, said University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Karen Oberhauser, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Haddad, who specializes in rare butterflies, said in recent years he has seen just two endangered St. Francis Satyr butterflies \u2014 which only live on a bomb range at Fort Bragg in North Carolina \u2014 \u201cso it could be extinct.\u201d",
      "Some well-known species had large drops. The red admiral, which is so calm it lands on people, is down 44% and the American lady butterfly, with two large eyespots on its back wings, decreased by 58%, Edwards said.",
      "Even the invasive white cabbage butterfly, \u201ca species that is well adapted to invade the world,\" according to Haddad, fell by 50%.",
      "\"How can that be?\u201d Haddad wondered.",
      "Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal said he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.",
      "\u201cThe loss of butterflies, parrots and porpoises is undoubtedly a bad sign for us, the ecosystems we need and the nature we enjoy,\u201d Agrawal, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email. \u201cThey are telling us that our continent's health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature's beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species. They have something to teach us.\u201d",
      "Oberhauser said butterflies connect people with nature and that \u201ccalms us down, makes us healthier and happier and promotes learning.\u201d",
      "What's happening to butterflies in the United States is probably happening to other, less-studied insects across the continent and world, Wagner said. He said not only is this the most comprehensive butterfly study, but the most data-rich for any insect.",
      "Butterflies are also pollinators, though not as prominent as bees, and are a major source of pollination of the Texas cotton crop, Haddad said.",
      "The biggest decrease in butterflies was in the Southwest \u2014 Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma \u2014 where the number of butterflies dropped by more than half in the 20 years.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the butterflies that are in dry and warm areas are doing particularly poorly,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAnd that kind of captures a lot of the Southwest.\u201d",
      "Edwards said when they looked at butterfly species that lived both in the hotter South and cooler North, the ones that did better were in the cooler areas.",
      "Climate change, habitat loss and insecticides tend to work together to weaken butterfly populations, Edwards and Haddad said. Of the three, it seems that insecticides are the biggest cause, based on previous research from the U.S. Midwest, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cIt makes sense because insecticide use has changed in dramatic ways in the time since our study started,\u201d Haddad said.",
      "Habitats can be restored and so can butterflies, so there's hope, Haddad said.",

      "ATLANTA -- Georgia's Senate passed two bills Monday that would ban most gender-affirming care for minors and people incarcerated in state prisons, mirroring moves by Republicans across states and a handful of executive orders by President Donald Trump targeting transgender people.",
      "The chamber voted 34-19 for a bill that would ban puberty blockers and most gender-affirming care for people under 18, including those already undergoing treatment. Georgia lawmakers in 2023 banned most gender-affirming surgeries and hormone replacement therapies for transgender minors unless they were already receiving treatment. The law lets doctors prescribe puberty blockers.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re asking (minors) to make changes that will have changes to the rest of their lives,\u201d bill sponsor Republican Sen. Ben Watson, of Savannah, said Monday. \u201cIt is not a fair decision to them. It is not a fair decision to the parents.\u201d",
      "A second bill sponsored by Senate Majority Whip Randy Robertson passed 37-15 and would ban most gender-affirming care for people incarcerated in state prisons.",
      "Last month, the chamber passed bills to ban transgender people from playing in school sports and cut off public funding for gender-affirming care for adults. The four bills will now head to the House for debate.",
      "Opponents said Republicans are playing politics by targeting transgender people and that lawmakers should focus on helping Georgians with more pressing issues such as housing and healthcare. They say both bills infringe on the rights of transgender people and their families to make decisions about gender-affirming care.",
      "\u201cThis body has promulgated bill after bill attacking trans people with the ultimate goal of making trans fols disappear. We\u2019ve been here before,\" said Senate Minority Whip Kim Jackson, a Stone Mountain Democrat who is openly lesbian.",
      "At least 26 states have adopted laws restricting gender-affirming care for minors, and most are facing lawsuits. A study released in January found that fewer than 1 in 1,000 adolescents with commercial insurance during a five-year period received gender-affirming medications such as puberty blockers or hormones.",
      "Jackson and other Democrats proposed a failed amendment to Watson\u2019s bill that would let minors receiving treatment keep going to avoid the medical and emotional ramifications of stopping midway.",
      "Sens. Elena Parent and Sonya Halpern, both Atlanta Democrats, reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the rights of transgender people but broke with their party to vote for Robertson\u2019s bill because they said they do not think taxpayers should pay for gender-affirming care for people in prison. Parent proposed an amendment to make an exception for incarcerated people already undergoing hormone replacement therapy that failed.",
      "\u201cI will not let my party be dragged into an argument that makes us look out of touch with the very people we claim to represent,\u201d Halpern said.",
      "Sen. Sally Harrell, an Atlanta Democrat who has two transgender children, took the stand toward the end of the evening.",
      "\u201cIt felt like we were debating a political football instead of people,\" Harrell said of a debate on the school sports bill. \"And so I came to this well to remind people that we are talking about very real people \u2014 parents, children, families.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is dropping an emergency abortion case in Idaho in one of the administration\u2019s first moves on the issue since President Donald Trump's second term began",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration on Wednesday moved to drop an emergency abortion case in Idaho in one of its first moves on the issue since President Donald Trump began his second term.",
      "The Justice Department filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which was originally filed by the Biden administration, in a reversal that could have national implications for urgent care.",
      "The lawsuit had argued that emergency-room doctors treating pregnant women had to provide terminations if needed to save their lives or to avoid serious health consequences in Idaho, which has one of the country's strictest abortion bans.",
      "The Democratic administration had given similar guidance to hospitals nationwide in the wake of the Supreme Court 2022 decision overturning the right to abortion. It's being challenged in other conservative states.",
      "In Idaho, the state argued that its law does allow life-saving abortions and the Biden administration wrongly sought to expand the exceptions. The state agrees with the dismissal, so it does not need judicial approval, Justice Department attorneys wrote in court documents.",
      "Idaho doctors, meanwhile, say it remains unclear which abortion are legal, forcing them to airlift pregnant women of state if a termination might be part of the standard of care. It's often unclear in fast-moving emergencies whether pregnancy complications could ultimately prove fatal, doctors said in court documents.",
      "A judge has blocked Idaho from any abortion ban enforcement that would change emergency treatment at the state's largest hospital system for now.",
      "In his first term, Trump, a Republican, appointed many of the Supreme Court justices who voted to overturned the constitutional right to abortion. He has since said the issue should be left to the states.",
      "Complaints that pregnant women were turned away from U.S. emergency rooms spiked after the overturning of Roe v. Wade amid questions about what care hospitals could legally provide, federal records showed.",
      "The Supreme Court stepped into the Idaho case last year. It ultimately handed down a narrow ruling that allowed hospitals to keep making determinations about emergency pregnancy terminations but left key legal questions unresolved.",
      "The case went before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in December. Those judges have not yet ruled.",
      "About 50,000 people in the U.S. develop life-threatening pregnancy complications each year, including major blood loss, sepsis or the loss of reproductive organs. In rare cases, doctors might need to terminate a pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant person, especially in cases where there is no chance for a fetus to survive.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions since 2022. Currently, 12 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant."

      "Dr. Marty Makary will answer questions from a Senate panel about his plans to lead the Food and Drug Administration",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Food and Drug Administration is set to answer Senate questions Thursday about his plans for the agency, which may soon be at the center of an administration plan to scrutinize vaccines, antidepressants and ultraprocessed foods.",
      "Dr. Marty Makary \u2014 a surgeon, author and researcher \u2014 is known for his contrarian views and outspoken criticism of the medical establishment. Like health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Makary traces many of the health issues afflicting Americans to food additives, overprescribing of drugs and the influence of drugmakers, insurers and food companies.",
      "To become commissioner, he\u2019ll need a majority vote from members of the Senate\u2019s health committee, who will question him Thursday morning. A confirmation vote by the full Senate is expected later this month.",
      "The FDA has long been a target for Kennedy, who last year vowed to \u201cclear out\u201d entire departments at the agency, including those overseeing nutrition. Kennedy recently called for a \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d commission to review the safety of vaccines, antidepressants, stimulants and weight-loss drugs \u2014 all products regulated by the FDA \u2014 particularly in children.",
      "The approach has been lauded by most Republicans. But Senate Democrats are expected to push Makary on his willingness to break with Kennedy on key issues, including the safety and benefits of childhood vaccinations.",
      "FDA commissioners aren\u2019t typically involved in the agency\u2019s day-to-day scientific reviews, but they often serve as a buffer between FDA staff and political appointees elsewhere in government.",
      "For his part, Makary has been critical of the agency he would lead. While working as a Fox News contributor during COVID-19, he called the FDA \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cmired in politics and red tape.\u201d",
      "Despite such views, Makary is considered one of Trump\u2019s more conventional health nominees and is widely expected to be confirmed. Before the pandemic, Makary was mainly known for influential studies of medical errors, hospital costs and overprescribing of opioids.",
      "Headquartered in the suburbs outside Washington, the FDA oversees medical products plus billions of dollars in consumer goods, including most foods, cosmetics and vaping products.",
      "Makary would take over at a particularly turbulent period for the agency. Last month, the FDA abruptly fired hundreds of medical reviewers, researchers and inspectors, only to rehire some of them a week later. Several senior FDA officials have resigned or retired in recent months. The agency is also expected to lose more staffers to buyouts, further layoffs and return-to-office requirements.",
      "Among other issues facing the agency:",
      "\u2014 Pressure from anti-abortion groups to restrict the abortion pill mifepristone",
      "\u2014 Efforts to keep up with a wave of artificial intelligence-based medical systems",
      "\u2014 Legal battles with compounding pharmacies and telehealth companies over off-brand versions of weight-loss drugs",
      "In government ethics forms, Makary recently said he has cut financial ties with several companies that could be impacted by his work at FDA, including telehealth and drug companies that sell compounded versions of FDA-approved drugs.",

      "Harrison\u2019s plasma contained a rare antibody, known as anti-D, which is used to make injections that protect unborn babies from hemolytic disease of the newborn, in which a pregnant woman\u2019s immune system attacks her fetus\u2019 red blood cells. The disease is most common when a woman has an Rh negative blood type and her baby\u2019s is Rh positive.",
      "Australia has only 200 anti-D donors who help 45,000 mothers and their babies annually.",
      "Despite an aversion to needles, Harrison made 1,173 donations after he turned 18 in 1954 until he was forced to retire in 2018, aged 81.",
      "\u201cHe did it for the right reasons. As humble as he was, he did like the attention. But he would never do it for the attention,\u201d Mellowship said, adding his grandfather had been surprised to be recognized by Guinness World Records in 2005 as the person who had donated the most blood plasma in the world.",
      "The record was beaten in 2022 by American Brett Cooper from Walker, Michigan.",
      "The Australian Red Cross Blood Service said Harrison was renowned as the \u201cMan with the Golden Arm.\u201d",

      "SEMINOLE, Texas -- Measles had struck this West Texas town, sickening dozens of children, but at the Community Church of Seminole, more than 350 worshippers gathered for a Sunday service. Sitting elbow-to-elbow, they filled the pews, siblings in matching button-down shirts and dresses, little girls\u2019 hair tied neatly into pink bows.",

He heard that at least two Mennonite schools shut down for a bit to disinfect.",
      "What he hasn\u2019t heard: Any direct outreach from public health officials on what to do as the number of those sickened with measles has grown to 146 and a school-age child has died. And though Klassen is a trusted church and community leader, his congregants haven\u2019t asked about whether they should vaccinate their kids \u2014 and he wouldn\u2019t want to weigh in.",
      "\u201cWith this measles situation, I can honestly just tell you we haven\u2019t taken any steps as a church,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did leave it up to the mothers.\u201d",
      "As measles \u2014 a preventable disease the U.S. considered eliminated in 2000 \u2014 spreads through West Texas\u2019 rural expanse, Klassen is sticking to an approach on vaccines that is a key tenet for Mennonites. Family leaders are the top decision-making authority \u2014 not outside recommendations, certainly not government mandates.",
      "Alongside measles in this region, where voters overwhelmingly supported President Donald Trump, there\u2019s another outbreak: one of misinformation about vaccines, distrust of local public health officials and fear of governmental authority overruling family autonomy. And on the national stage, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the country\u2019s top health official and an anti-vaccine activist, dismissed the Texas outbreak as \u201cnot unusual.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo I trust all the vaccines? No,\u201d Klassen said. \u201cAnd I get from (Kennedy) that he doesn\u2019t trust all the vaccines, either. And he is very well educated in that; I\u2019m not.\u201d",
      "In an opinion piece for Fox News Digital, Kennedy wrote about the value of the vaccine but stopped short of calling on families to get it, saying the decision is \u201ca personal one.\u201d He urged parents to speak to their health care providers about options.",
      "Vaccine skepticism has also been spurred by state lawmakers who this year filed more than a dozen bills that would strengthen or expand vaccine exemptions, which Texas already allows for \u201creasons of conscience, including a religious belief.\u201d",
      "At hospitals in Lubbock, 80 miles to the north and on the front lines of the outbreak, babies with measles are struggling to breathe.",
      "Dr. Summer Davies, a Texas Tech Physicians pediatrician, said she has treated about 10 of the outbreak\u2019s patients, most very young or teens. She said children have had to be intubated, including one younger than 6 months old. Others come in with such high fevers or severe sore throats that they refuse to eat or drink to the point of dehydration.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard as a pediatrician, knowing that we have a way to prevent this and prevent kids from suffering and even death,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do agree that the herd immunity that we have established in the past isn\u2019t the same now. And I think kids are suffering because of that.\u201d",
      "In Lubbock County, 92% of kindergarteners are up to date on their measles, mumps and rubella shots, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. That\u2019s lower than the 95% threshold experts say is needed to prevent measles from spreading. Gaines County, which includes Seminole, has an 82% MMR vaccination rate, though rates for homeschooled or private school students may be much lower. The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide. Many Mennonite families don\u2019t send children to public schools.",
      "All of the children admitted with measles to Covenant Children\u2019s Hospital in Lubbock were unvaccinated, officials said last week. Dr. Lara Johnson, the hospital\u2019s chief medical officer, told The Associated Press that Covenant has seen more than 20 patients, including children, teens and pregnant mothers, since the outbreak began in late January.",
      "News of a measles case in Seminole, population 7,200, put doctors on a \u201cshared high alert,\u201d said Dr. Martin Ortega, a family physician for Texas Tech Physicians in Odessa, about an hour away. The small towns of West Texas may look completely isolated on a map, with little between them beyond oil and gas facilities and sprawling desert. But the region is connected by its people, who regularly travel long distances to grocery stores, hospitals and houses of worship.",
      "Many doctors are seeing measles cases for the first time in their careers. In Lea County, New Mexico, 30 minutes west of Seminole, nine measles cases with no clear connection to the Texas outbreak, rattled doctors and parents. An unvaccinated infant in Austin also tested positive for measles after an overseas vacation.",
      "It\u2019s \u201ca little bit surreal,\u201d said Dr. Rumbidzai Mutikani, a pediatrician at Nor-Lea Hospital District\u2019s Hobbs Medical Clinic. Parents were so concerned \u201cour phones were just ringing,\u201d Mutikani said.",
      "Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock\u2019s public health department, said West Texas' rural landscape is a major challenge, not just in getting to patients and transporting test samples, but also in getting the word out.",
      "A lot of the messaging is word of mouth, she said, but they are working on public-service announcements featuring trusted Gaines County residents, putting up billboards about measles, handing out flyers and posting in WhatsApp groups.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic caused \u201ca lot of distrust in public health\u201d and government requirements, Wells said. On Facebook, people have accused her of making up the measles outbreak. They hope her department loses its funding.",
      "It\u2019s \u201creally hurtful stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re really working to help encourage vaccines for our community and help those kids that are infected to make sure they get medical treatment so that we don\u2019t end up with another death.\u201d",
      "The reality on the ground can be nuanced, however.",
      "Brownfield Mayor Eric Horton is pro-Trump, he said, but also pro-MMR vaccine.",
      "His county was hard-hit by COVID-19, Horton said, with nearly 90 deaths. So when measles cases came to his town of 8,600, Horton feared for his community. He said the local hospital has been busy administering vaccines since the outbreak started.",
      "\u201cOut here on the south plains of Texas, we are conservative people, but we also are not anti-vaxxers,\u201d he said.",
      "Across the region, people echoed this sentiment about routine childhood vaccinations in interviews with the AP and The Texas Tribune. Often, though, they are less supportive of COVID-19 and flu shots.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that (Mennonites) don\u2019t vaccinate, and they put other people\u2019s families and children at exposure for it,\u201d said Stephen Spruill, a 36-year-old trucker from Seminole.",
      "But \"this is America. People have the right to choose.\u201d",

      "All of Lane\u2019s kids are vaccinated. Praising Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s vote against Kennedy\u2019s nomination, she said the fact that \u201cthe only Republican that went against RFK was a polio survivor says a lot.\u201d But she said she voted off other issues: her religious beliefs, stance on abortion and who would be best for the region\u2019s oil and gas industry.",
      "\u201cAs far as RFK being an anti-vaxxer, this is the most important thing: People have to make a decision for themselves and be as informed as they possibly can,\u201d Horton said.",
      "But in doctors' offices throughout the region, pediatricians see the consequences of that stance.",
      "Mutikani, the Hobbs pediatrician, said she\u2019s seen vaccine hesitancy increase in recent years as parents come to her with worries that line up with what\u2019s trending on social media. \u201cVirulent\u201d misinformation is especially worrisome in rural areas with few news sources or where many people who don\u2019t regularly see doctors live, she said.",
      "And having \u201cthese really big, respected public figures openly going against the grain, going against research and what we know, it makes it really, really difficult,\u201d she said.",

      "Menopause affects about half the world\u2019s population at some point in life",
      "NEW YORK -- It took five years for Crystal Burke to put a name to the symptoms that haunted her.",
      "Heart palpitations. Insomnia so severe she slept only two to four hours a night. A newfound struggle to make decisions in her job as a nurse. Confusion when dealing with statistics, which she used to handle with ease.",
      "\u201cIt affected my work, it affected my relationships, it affected everything,\" Burke said. \"I felt lost. I didn\u2019t talk to anybody about it.\u201d",
      "Then Burke saw an advertisement about a face cream which contained estrogen, one of the two hormones ovaries produce less and less of with aging. She began talking with friends about her symptoms. And she connected the dots: menopause.",
      "At just 38, Burke had thought she was too young to be going through the life stage when menstrual periods stop and women no longer can become pregnant. But menopause is more than the pop culture stereotype featuring women in their 50s having hot flashes. Symptoms can start much earlier \u2014 during perimenopause, the time leading up to menopause \u2014 and go well beyond hot flashes.",
      "The many manifestations include insomnia, migraines, brain fog, loss of concentration, memory problems, mood swings, depression, anxiety, heart palpitations, hair loss and weight gain. If that wasn\u2019t enough, some people experience heavy, painful periods or recurring urinary tract infections.",
      "Chronic insomnia can make it difficult to concentrate. Brain fog leaves the afflicted struggling to find words during meetings. But social stigma and a lack of information have left menopausal people dealing alone with severe symptoms that may impact their work. Many stay silent, fearing they\u2019ll be viewed as underperformers or weak.",
      "Some women in senior leadership positions leave their jobs or reduce their hours as a result of debilitating side effects from menopause, said Lauren Redfern, executive director of Hormonally, a nonprofit that provides workplace training and education about women\u2019s health. But those who feel supported by employers during the transition are more likely to remain at work, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you open up a space to talk about these things, people are desperate to have a conversation,\u201d Redfern said. \u201cThe symptoms are so diverse and so far-reaching and so prolific they impact every area of someone\u2019s life.\u201d",
      "Menopause affects about half the world\u2019s population at some point in life. Yet due to the epidemic of silence around it, women, nonbinary people and transgender individuals often don't recognize the onset of unpleasant physical and emotional changes as side effects of declining hormone levels.",
      "Finding health care providers who are trained to identify and treat their symptoms can be challenging. Some startups have sought to change that by providing access to referrals or telehealth appointments with doctors or therapists who specialize in treating menopausal patients.",
      "\u201cWhen you don\u2019t know that something can get fixed, it\u2019s very scary,\u201d said Midi Health founder Joanna Strober, whose company connects women with professionals who understand menopause. \u201dIf you think, \u2018For the rest of my life I\u2019m going to have brain fog and not remember anyone\u2019s name, and I\u2019m going to keep losing my car in the parking lot and I\u2019m going to keep gaining weight,\u2019 then it\u2019s very demoralizing.\u201d",
      "Burke found relief when she began hormone replacement therapy. Inspired to help others, she co-founded The Menopause Clinic in Louisiana to offer telehealth services focused on menopause.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing is for women to know what perimenopause is, what menopause is, and that there are options,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThe suffering isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d",
      "Hormone replacement therapy is not an option for those with certain medical histories, and some doctors are unwilling to prescribe it. Some experts recommend acupuncture, dietary changes and exercise to help manage symptoms.",
      "The Mayo Clinic estimates that menopause symptoms lead to $1.8 billion in lost work time per year in the U.S. About 5% of employers offer menopause benefits or accommodations such as the ability to work from home or a cool room, according to benefit consulting company NFP.",
      "Here are some steps you or your employer can take to make the workplace more hospitable for people experiencing menopause.",
      "Finding supportive colleagues can help bridge knowledge gaps. If your organization doesn't have a menopause support group, you can start one. Once established, the group or human resources department can bring in facilitators to teach the entire workforce \u2014 not just women \u2014 about menopause.",
      "Sarah Daniels, a communications manager, started a support group called \u201cMenopause Matters\u201d at Arriva Group, a U.K.-based public transportation company. The male-dominated company already had a gender inclusion group, so Daniels joined and organized the menopause group as an offshoot.",
      "The group's monthly meetings are held online during business hours. Participants swap notes on supplements, teas, treatments and beauty products. Daniels believes the group improves productivity because it gives members a sense of belonging within the organization.",
      "\u201cI know how lonely it is when you are going through these things, because you think, \u2018Is this just happening to me?'\" she said. \u201cI had a UTI (urinary tract infection) that was so severe that I fainted on a train. My periods were so heavy that I couldn\u2019t leave the house.\u201d",
      "Arriva has a policy that says bosses must listen to and make reasonable adjustments for employees struggling with menopause. That could mean more restroom breaks, uniform adaptations to help with hot flashes or flexible working hours, Daniels said.",
      "People working for employers who do not subsidize menopause-related care and programs can model requests for similar benefits after the small percentage of companies that do.",
      "When Shevonya Noble joined biotechnology firm Genentech as a principal quality and compliance leader, she was connected with a care advocate who helped her find a nutritionist, wellness coach, career coach, mental health provider and physical support coach to address her menopause symptoms.",
      "Appointment costs were covered through a benefit provided by Maven, which partners with employers and health plans to deliver care targeted to women. Genentech\u2019s benefits also include menopause-specific classes and support groups.",
      "At a former employer, Noble felt she had to hide the hot flashes that interrupted her sleep and disrupted her concentration while giving presentations because she didn't see anyone else furiously fanning themselves at their desks.",
      "\u201cThe conversation about menopause needs to be broadened to include men, not just men in our lives but in the workplace as well,\u201d Noble said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we not shy away from the topic but include it in our conversations and to just take the mystique away from what goes on with women at this stage in life.\u201d",
      "Speaking up about symptoms also may help. When women experience hot flashes and brain fog at work, they\u2019re often seen as less competent, but if they say, \u201cIt\u2019s menopausal, I\u2019m getting treated for it,\u2019\u201d the discrimination goes away and they\u2019re seen as powerful leaders again, according to Midi founder Strober.",
      "\u201cYou have to call it out. You have to say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a hot flash,\u2019 not just look sweaty in a meeting, because then they just discount you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you call it out, you can take your power back.\u201d",

      "Women planning pill abortions in Wyoming will need to get an ultrasound after lawmakers overrode the governor's veto of the new measure",
      "CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- Women planning pill abortions in Wyoming will need to get an ultrasound after lawmakers overrode the governor's veto of the law.",
      "Wednesday's 22-9 vote by the state Senate followed a 45-16 vote by the House on Tuesday to override. In vetoing the bill Monday, Republican Gov. Mark Gordon questioned whether it was reasonable and necessary, especially for victims of rape and incest.",
      "Lawmakers cited concerns about women's well-being Wednesday in voting to override, and they cleared the two-thirds majority requirement.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very concerned about the psychological effects of this procedure,\u201d Republican Sen. Darin Smith of Cheyenne said of the governor, \u201cbut what about the psychological effects of having an abortion, for the rest of your life?\u201d",
      "The new requirement, which takes effect right away, was criticized by abortion rights advocates.",
      "\u201cWe are saddened so many legislators lack empathy and respect for women\u2019s decision-making authority, but we stand ready to fight this unconstitutional, unnecessary and unreasonable bill in court,\u201d Christine Lichtenfels, executive director of the Wyoming abortion access advocacy group Chelsea\u2019s Fund, said in a statement.",
      "Wyoming is the first state to explicitly outlaw pill abortions, though that and other abortion bans over the past three years are on hold pending a case before the Wyoming Supreme Court.",
      "Ten other states require abortion providers to perform ultrasounds on women seeking abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",
      "Under Wyoming's new law, pregnant women planning pill abortions will have to drive potentially long distances to get an ultrasound and have it documented. They would have the opportunity but not be required to view the image of the fetus at least 48 hours before a pill abortion.",
      "Existing state law already requires abortion providers to offer an ultrasound to women getting abortions.",
      "Pregnant woman who do not get an ultrasound will not be penalized under the new law, however. Instead it is medical providers who face up to $9,000 in fines and six months in jail for not arranging it.",
      "But there are few if any active abortion providers left. Last week the state's only full-service abortion clinic stopped providing any abortion care, surgical or medicinal, after Gordon signed a bill requiring such facilities to be licensed as surgical centers.",
      "Wellspring Health Access in Casper is wary of running afoul of the law while it challenges it and others in court, President Julie Burkhart said.",
      "It was not clear whether Wyoming's only other clinic providing medication abortions, a family medicine practice in Jackson, continues to do so. There was no response to phone messages left with the clinic seeking comment Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Pill abortions remain possible in the state through remote services: Women have access through the Just the Pill telehealth service and online providers such as Abuzz, The Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, and Aid Access, according to Chelsea\u2019s Fund.",
      "The Guttmacher Institute found that more than 3 in 5 abortions carried out in the U.S. through the formal health care system in 2023 were medicinal. Wyoming had the biggest portion of abortions via pill that year: 19 in 20.",

      "A bucktoothed llama that spends his days comforting chronically ill children at a North Carolina camp founded by NASCAR royalty has been crowned the world\u2019s oldest llama in captivity.",
      "At 27 years and more than 250 days, the selfie- and snuggle-loving llama called Whitetop dethroned Dalai Llama, the Guinness World Records announced last week. Dalai lived on a ranch in Albuquerque and was announced as the oldest in 2023 shortly after his 27th birthday.",
      "Whitetop was donated to the Victory Junction camp in 2006, just two years after race car driver Kyle Petty \u2014 the son of NASCAR great Richard Petty \u2014 and his family founded the camp in honor of Petty's own son, Adam, who was 19 when he was killed in a 2000 crash while practicing for a race.",
      "The year-round free camp sits on 84 acres (34 hectares) in the Petty hometown of Randleman, North Carolina, about 75 miles (121 kilometers) west of Raleigh. It\u2019s designed for children with conditions that include cancer, kidney and heart disease, cerebral palsy, Spina Bifida and an array of neurological and physical disabilities.",
      "Whitetop has become known for his relaxed, sweet and empathetic personality. His go-to move is to lie still while campers pet him, which can comfort children and give them important sensory input, said Billie Davis, the camp's barn director.",
      "\u201cHe really gets to help campers come out of their shell when they interact with him,\" she said. \"He can be kind of intimidating at first, but once they come over to him and love on him and pet on him, they just realize how sweet he is.\u201d",
      "One of his best friends is a miniature highland cow named Gus-Gus, who tends to forget Whitetop is a llama and enjoys jumping on him. Whitetop also likes to roll in fresh wood chippings, chomp on soaked alfalfa and pose for selfies.",
      "\u201cIf you try to take a picture of him from the side, he\u2019s not into it,\" Davis said. \"He will, like scoot in there and try to get his face from a side profile so that it\u2019s like he\u2019s cheesing.\u201d",
      "Davis attributes Whitetop's long life to great veterinary care and exercise, as well as it simply loving his job.",
      "The average life span for a llama is 15 years, according to the Denver Zoo Conservation Alliance.",
      "Whitetop has developed arthritis in his twilight years but otherwise is very healthy, said Davis. And the only times the llama becomes upset is when Gus-Gus, along with two miniature donkeys named Jed and Jethro, leave him alone.",
      "Stephanie Wilkerson, 33, first went to the camp\u2019s family weekend in 2006 after she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. She said she was initially a little nervous around Whitetop but soon realized petting him and giving him hugs made her feel better.",
      "\u201cWhen I started stroking him more and more and more, I got more relaxed,\" said Wilkerson, who lives in Thomasville, North Carolina.",
      "With Whitetop\u2019s newfound fame in longevity, the camp has started selling limited edition T-shirts displaying Whitetop with sunglasses and the words, \u201cStill Spit\u2019n.\u201d The proceeds go to the camp.",
      "Although Davis said Whitetop would like people to know not all llamas spit on you.",
      "\u201cTypically llamas only spit when they are scared, uncomfortable or territorial over something,\" she said. \"And he just loves his job so much that he doesn\u2019t do it.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the National Institutes of Health is facing questions from a Senate panel",
      "WASHINGTON -- A health economist who famously clashed with officials at the National Institutes of Health faces Senate questioning Wednesday on his nomination to head that agency.",
      "Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford University professor, was an outspoken critic of the government\u2019s COVID-19 shutdowns and vaccine policies. Now he\u2019s poised to become director of the NIH, long called the government\u2019s crown jewel, as it faces mass firings and drastic funding cutbacks.",
      "He \u201chas a vision to restore faith in medical research for the American people,\u201d Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who chairs the Senate health committee considering the nomination, wrote on X after meeting with Bhattacharya last month.",
      "But he faces scrutiny from Democrats furious that turmoil at the nation\u2019s largest funder of medical research threatens the development of cures and new treatments.",
      "\u201cIt is incredibly important that we have a leader at NIH who will stand up for the agency\u2019s role as a world leader in lifesaving research,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state.",
      "Until recently, the $48 billion NIH had strong bipartisan support. NIH scientists conduct cutting-edge research at its 27 institutes specializing in diseases including cancer, chronic illnesses such as heart, lung and kidney disease, aging and Alzheimer\u2019s. Most of the agency\u2019s budget is dispersed to universities, hospitals and other research groups through highly competitive grants to conduct everything from basic research to clinical trials.",
      "NIH-funded research has played a part in the development of most treatments approved in the U.S. in recent years.",
      "Bhattacharya gained public attention as one of three authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 open letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm and argued that people at low risk of COVID-19 should live normally while building up immunity through infection.",
      "At the time -- before vaccinations had begun \u2013 that view was embraced by some in the first Trump administration but was widely denounced by infectious disease experts. Then- NIH director Dr. Francis Collins called it dangerous and \u201cnot mainstream science.\u201d",
      "Bhattacharya became a plaintiff in a Supreme Court case, Murthy v. Missouri, arguing he was \u201cunfairly censored\u201d on social media as part of government efforts to combat misinformation. While the case gained national attention, it was ultimately unsuccessful in a 6-3 ruling.",

      "A yearslong legal battle over the right to an emergency abortion in Idaho has been abruptly upended now that President Donald Trump has moved to drop the high-profile case.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Justice Department had argued that emergency-room doctors treating pregnant women had to provide terminations if it was needed to save their lives or to avoid serious health consequences.",
      "Yet a little more than a month after taking over the White House, Trump's decision to abandon the legal fight signals how the Republican administration plans on interpreting federal law designed to protect urgent care when up against states' abortion bans.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. The ruling came down while President Joe Biden, a Democrat, was in office, but many of the justices who helped reverse Roe v. Wade were appointed under Trump.",
      "So in response, Biden warned that his administration considered abortion part of the stabilizing care that federal law requires facilities to provide to patients who show up at an emergency room. A month later, Biden sued Idaho, which had enacted an abortion ban that makes it a crime with a prison term of up to five years for anyone who performs or assists in an abortion.",
      "The Biden administration argued that Idaho\u2019s abortion ban prevented ER doctors from offering an abortion if a woman needs one in a medical emergency. But Idaho\u2019s attorney general has pointed out that federal law also requires hospitals to consider the health of the \u201cunborn child\u201d in its treatment, too.",
      "The lawsuit has twisted and turned in the legal system ever since. Last year, the Supreme Court agreed to step into the Idaho case, but it handed down a narrow ruling: Hospitals were allowed to make determinations about emergency pregnancy terminations, but the key legal question about what care hospitals should legally provide remains unresolved.",
      "Known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, the 1986 law requires emergency rooms to offer a medical exam if you turn up at their facility. The law applies to any ERs that accept Medicare funding \u2014 so nearly all of them.",
      "Those ERs are also required to stabilize patients experiencing a medical emergency before discharging or transferring them. Notably, if the ER doesn't have the resources or staff to treat a patient, medical staffers must arrange a medical transfer to another hospital \u2014 they can't simply direct a patient to go elsewhere.",
      "EMTALA is more scrutinized than ever since Roe was overturned. Multiple doctors and families have told The Associated Press about pregnant women with dangerous medical conditions showing up in hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices only to be denied the abortions that could help treat them. Some women described facing harmful delays.",
      "Not yet. And the DOJ's three-page motion didn't explain why they wanted to abandon the lawsuit either. However, since having a hand in revoking the constitutional right to abortion, Trump has repeatedly touted his support of leaving abortion regulations up to the states.",
      "Meanwhile, ending the effort to use federal law to protect emergency abortions was a goal of Project 2025, the blueprint created by the Heritage Foundation for a second Trump term, which calls for reversing what it describes as \u201cdistorted pro-abortion\u201d interpretations of federal law. Trump insisted during his 2024 presidential campaign that Project 2025 was not part of his agenda.",
      "\u201cTheir move to drop this case against Idaho I think really shows what their true priorities are \u2014 and it is to push an anti-abortion political agenda rather than support the lives, health and well being of pregnant women and people, not just in Idaho but across the country because this case does have far-reaching impact,\u201d said Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation, an association of abortion providers.",
      "Trump's decision to drop the Idaho case comes several months after the Supreme Court said the federal government couldn't require hospitals to provide pregnancy terminations when it would violate Texas' abortion ban.",
      "Texas had sued over the Biden administration's enforcement of EMTALA, and a lower federal court eventually sided with the state. But similar to the case in Idaho, the Supreme Court stopped short of deciding whether the federal law can supersede a state's abortion ban.",
      "Meanwhile, concern has grown over whether Trump's decision in the Idaho case is a sign that his administration may also reverse course in a longstanding legal battle over telehealth access to mifepristone, the medication used in the nation's most common abortion method.",
      "The Department of Justice under Biden had sought to dismiss a complaint brought by a handful states seeking to roll back access to mifepristone. It's currently unclear how Trump plans on proceeding."

      "Patients who live in rural counties are 10% more likely to die of their cancer than those living in metropolitan areas, said Neli Ulrich of the University of Utah\u2019s Huntsman Cancer Institute.",
      "A third of patients travel more than 150 miles for care at the Salt Lake City cancer center. But for patients even further away \u2014 in Idaho, Montana, Nevada and Wyoming \u2014 because it\u2019s also the regional hub for NIH-funded studies of new treatments.",
      "So Ulrich\u2019s center helps train local doctors to do at least some of the blood tests and other steps of clinical trials that let faraway patients participate without traveling \u2014 a program threatened if her university loses tens of millions in NIH cuts.",
      "The issue: Most of the NIH\u2019s budget \u2014 more than $35 billion a year \u2014 goes to universities, hospitals and other research groups. The grants are divided into \u201cdirect costs\u201d \u2014 covering researchers\u2019 salaries and a project\u2019s supplies \u2014 and \u201cindirect costs,\u201d to reimburse other expenses supporting the work such as electricity, maintenance and janitorial staff, and safety and ethics oversight.",
      "NIH directly negotiates with research groups, a process that grants managers say requires receipts and audits, to set rates for those indirect expenses that can reach 50% or more. But the Trump administration now plans to cap those rates at 15%. The administration estimates it would save the government $4 billion a year but scientists say it really means they'll have to stop some lifesaving work.",
      "They are \u201creal expenses, that\u2019s the critical point \u2013 they are not fluff,\u201d said Ulrich. Using separate cancer center funds to cover those costs would threaten other \u201cactivities that are really important to us in serving our communities across the mountain West.\u201d",
      "A federal judge has blocked the move but until the court fight is done researchers aren\u2019t sure what they can continue to afford.",
      "NIH grants divided between researchers in every state in 2023 supported more than 412,000 jobs and $92 billion in new economic activity, according to a yearly report from United for Medical Research that often is cited as Congress sets the agency's budget.",
      "The AP tallied how much money would have been lost in each state under a 15% cap on those grants\u2019 indirect costs. Those lost dollars alone would have cost at least 58,000 jobs, concluded an analysis assisted by Inforum, a nonpartisan economic consulting firm that conducts UMR's economic impact reports.",
      "Consider Hopkins, which runs about 600 NIH-funded clinical trials plus other laboratory research and is Baltimore\u2019s largest private employer. \u201cIf we can\u2019t do science and we can\u2019t support the science, we can\u2019t support the surrounding community either,\u201d Huganir said.",
      "Huganir studies how the brain stores memory as people learn when he discovered a gene that, when mutated, causes certain intellectual disabilities.",
      "After years studying the SynGap1 gene, \u201cwe have what we think is a really great therapeutic\u201d almost ready to be tested in severely affected children. Huganir has applied for two new NIH grants key for moving toward those trials.",
      "\u201cThe problem is for the kids, there\u2019s a window of time to treat them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re running out of time.\u201d",
      "NIH reviews of new grant applications have been delayed despite court rulings to end a government spending freeze, and it\u2019s unclear how quickly they can get back on track.",
      "\u201cEveryone I know is basically freaking out because we suddenly don\u2019t know how much longer we\u2019ll be able to keep our labs open,\u201d said neuroscientist Rebecca Shansky at Boston\u2019s Northeastern University, who\u2019s awaiting word on grants for her study of how the brain processes pain and trauma.",
      "Even scientists with existing funding are left wondering if their projects \u2014 from transgender health to learning why white breast cancer patients in Oklahoma fare worse than Black patients in Massachusetts \u2014 will be caught in Trump\u2019s anti-diversity crackdown. Some already have, even though studying different populations is fundamental to medicine.",
      "\u201cThose studies are very much threatened right now. People don\u2019t know what the rules are,\u201d said well-known Hopkins specialist Dr. Otis Brawley. \u201cWe\u2019re actually going to kill people is what it amounts to, because we\u2019re not studying how to get appropriate care to all people.\u201d",

      "",
      "Taken together, experts have raised concerns about a possible misinterpretation of Kennedy's message: that because vitamin A is available, they don't need to be vaccinated.",
      "",
      "\"Vitamin A is absolutely not a substitute nor an equivalent for MMR vaccination, which is the best way to prevent a child from getting measles,\" Ericka Hayes, MD, of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told MedPage Today.",
      "",
      "Indeed, the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is \"one of the most effective and durable vaccines that we have,\" she said, with the full two-dose series being 97% effective against measles.",
      "",
      "\"I think some people are thinking, 'Oh, well, then, if I, for example, take vitamin A, I won't get measles, or I'm less likely to get measles,'\" Hayes said. \"And that is absolutely not the case.\"",
      "",
      "Much of the literature about vitamin A and measles comes from lower- and middle-income countries, where deficiency may pose more of a problem. However, given that vitamin A deficiency can put kids at risk of worse outcomes with measles  --  and most kids aren't assessed for vitamin A levels  --  U.S. expert consensus has settled on administering the vitamin in all cases.",
      "",
      "Tina Tan, MD, of Northwestern University, who is president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said vitamin A \"really plays an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system and supports the function of immune cells so the body can fight off infections like measles.\"",
      "",
      "However, taking vitamin A won't prevent a child from getting measles in the first place, Hayes said, and it can have \"significant toxicities,\" especially when taken in high doses. \"And just because you're taking vitamin A or have a good vitamin A level doesn't guarantee that you will not have a ... severe case of measles,\" she added.",
      "",
      "The AAP Red Book  --  an encyclopedia of pediatric infectious diseases  --  noted that U.S. experts concur with WHO recommendations on giving vitamin A to all children with measles, and recommends giving it once a day for 2 days at the following doses:",
      "50,000 IU for infants younger than 6 months",
      "50,000 IU for infants younger than 6 months",
      "",
      "\"Again, if a child has measles, that vitamin A should be prescribed under the supervision of the physician to make sure that it is dosed appropriately,\" Hayes said.",
      "",
      "Still, both Hayes and Tan emphasized that vaccination is the only way to stop more measles outbreaks like the current one in west Texas, where 159 cases have been identified since late January, with 22 hospitalizations and one death  --  the first measles death in the U.S. since 2015.",
      "",
      "Tan said that the \"number of unvaccinated individuals is growing, and that basically increases the risk for spread of measles, because measles is one of the most contagious viruses.\"",
      "",
      "\"If we cannot get our vaccination rates up to where they were, we're going to continue to see these outbreaks,\" she added, and that could mean more deaths, as it's estimated that one to three children in 1,000 with measles will die.",

      "Measles can also cause complications after the initial illness has passed, including subacute sclerosing panencephalitis  --  a rare, though fatal, neurologic disease  --  and immunodeficiency, Hayes said.",
      "",
      "\"I always find measles extremely concerning because it is so contagious,\" Hayes said. There are \"so many individuals in this country who are not immune,\" such as infants under 1 year of age, who cannot be vaccinated yet, and individuals who are immunocompromised, she added. And there is a \"risk for very severe disease as well as complications  --  both acute complications as well as long-term complications  --  with this virus.\""

Thousands of young men and women from Asia, Europe and Africa released from modern day slavery are now waiting in an indefinite limbo at repurposed scam centers and army camps controlled by armed militia groups as the first major global effort to crack down on the fast-growing industry of scamming is turning into a growing humanitarian crisis.",

      "Israel last week cut off supplies of goods to the territory of over 2 million Palestinians, an echo of the siege it imposed in the earliest days of its war with Hamas. It's pressing the militant group to accept an extension of the first phase of their ceasefire. That phase ended last weekend. Israel wants Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce.",
      "Hamas instead wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire\u2019s more difficult second phase, which would see the release of remaining hostages from Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a lasting peace. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others.",
      "The militant group \u2014 which has warned that cutting off supplies would affect the hostages \u2014 said Sunday it wrapped up the latest round of ceasefire talks with Egyptian mediators without changes to its position, calling for an immediate start of the ceasefire's second phase.",
      "Israel has said it would send a delegation to Qatar on Monday \u201cin an effort to advance the negotiations.\u201d",

      "The International Criminal Court said there was reason to believe Israel had used \u201cstarvation as a method of warfare\u201d when it issued an arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year. The allegation is central to South Africa\u2019s case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide.",

      "Boehler told CNN that \u201cI think you could see something like a long-term truce, where we forgive prisoners, where Hamas lays down their arms, where they agree they\u2019re not part of the political party going forward. I think that\u2019s a reality. It\u2019s real close.\u201d",

      "A Greek charity has been treating dozens of orphaned, sick and injured Mediterranean monk seals, rare marine mammals whose population had dwindled so dramatically that the species at one point faced extinction",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- Panagis hauls himself out of the pool at a rehabilitation center in Greece and scurries over for a delectable lunch: whole mackerel. It\u2019s been about three months since the orphaned seal pup was found struggling in the coastal waters of Cyprus. Soon, he\u2019ll be well enough to go home.",
      "Panagis is one of dozens of Mediterranean monk seals, or Monachus monachus, that have been nursed back to health by Greece\u2019s MOm, a charity dedicated to the care and protection of the rare marine mammal whose population had dwindled so dramatically that at one point it faced extinction.",
      "Thanks to conservation efforts, the seals with the big, round eyes and prominent whiskers are now making a remarkable comeback. Nearly half of their estimated global population of 800 live in Greek waters, where the extensive coastline offers an abundance of sea caves that provide shelter for females to rear their young.",
      "Sleek and remarkably fast in the water, the monk seal is a skillful hunter and can consume up to 3 kilograms (6 pounds) of fish, octopus and squid a day. But it's not averse to a ready meal, and can rip through fishing nets to steal fish \u2014 which led fishermen to view them as pests.",
      "For decades, they were hunted, contributing to a major population decline between the 1960s and 1980s that led the International Union for Conservation of Nature, or IUCN, to list them as critically endangered.",
      "When conservation efforts began in the 1980s, combined with outreach programs to educate the public \u2014 and fishermen \u2014 \u201csociety gradually began to change \u2026 and the population began to recover,\u201d said Panagiotis Dendrinos.",
      "Dendrinos, a marine biologist and coordinator of the Hellenic Society for the Study and Protection of the Monk Seal \u2014 or MOm \u2014 that has pioneered the Monachus monachus conservation program, says the monk seal is the only seal species in the Mediterranean Sea and also \"one of the rarest species of seal and marine mammal in the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo protect an animal like the Mediterranean monk seal in its natural environment, you essentially have to protect the entire marine ecosystem,\u201d he said.",
      "Conservation efforts have paid off, and in recent years, the species climbed down a notch on the IUCN\u2019s Red List of threatened species to \u201cendangered.\u201d About a year ago improved one step further, to \u201cvulnerable.\u201d",
      "Usually contacted by members of the public who find an animal in distress, MOm specialists tend to adult seals on location where possible, and transport young seals to the organization's rehabilitation center housed in the grounds of Athens zoo, on the outskirts of the Greek capital.",
      "There, the young mammals are looked after by veterinarians, fed a special diet to provide them with the best nutrition and hone their swimming skills in a pool.",
      "Their carers give them names \u2014 often after the people who found them \u2014 but make sure contact with humans is kept to a minimum to prepare the animals for their return into the wild.",
      "The young seals typically stay in the rehab center for several months, until they've put on enough weight and their natural hunting instinct kicks in, allowing them to fend for themselves. They are then tagged so they can be tracked, and re-introduced into the wild.",
      "MOm, the only center of its kind in the region, has cared for about 40 seals from far and wide, both on location and in its facilities, Dendrinos said.",
      "\u201cThis year, we had a really pleasant surprise,\u201d he said. A female seal that had been treated and released four years ago was spotted nursing a pup.",
      "Panagis was found in Cyprus, near where the body of his mother had been found a few days earlier. Alerted by locals, the organization arranged for the seal to be flown to Athens.",
      "\u201cTransportation is carried out with whatever is available,\u201d said veterinary assistant Nikitas Vogiatzis, shortly after feeding Panagis. \u201cEither by plane, or by boat, or even by taxi. \"Konstantina came in a taxi, Panagis by plane, Renos came on a boat,\u201d he said, listing MOm\u2019s most recent wards.",
      "Weighing just under 15 kilograms (33 pounds) when he arrived, the now 3-month-old seal has reached over 40 kilograms (88 pounds). Panagis is nearly ready for his return trip home, which MOm experts hope will happen in May.",

      "Malaria season begins this month in a large part of Africa",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Malaria season begins this month in a large part of Africa. No disease is deadlier on the continent, especially for children. But the Trump administration's decision to terminate 90% of USAID\u2019s foreign aid contracts has local health officials warning of catastrophe in some of the world\u2019s poorest communities.",
      "Dr. Jimmy Opigo, who runs Uganda\u2019s malaria control program, told The Associated Press that USAID stop-work orders issued in late January left him and others \u201cfocusing on disaster preparedness.\u201d The U.S. is the top bilateral funder of anti-malaria efforts in Africa.",
      "Anti-malarial medicines and insecticide-treated bed nets to help control the mosquito-borne disease are \u201clike our groceries,\u201d Opigo said. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be continuous supply.\u201d",
      "As those dwindle with the U.S.-terminated contracts, he expects a rise in cases later this year of severe malaria, which includes problems like organ failure. There is no cure. Vaccines being rolled out in parts of Africa are imperfect but are expected to largely continue with the support of a global vaccine alliance.",
      "The Washington-based Malaria No More says new modeling shows that just a year of disruption in the malaria-control supply chain would lead to nearly 15 million additional cases and 107,000 additional deaths globally. It has urged the Trump administration to \u201crestart these life-saving programs before outbreaks get out of hand.\u201d",
      "Africa's 1.5 billion people accounted for 95% of an estimated 597,000 malaria deaths worldwide in 2023, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "Health workers in the three African nations most burdened by malaria \u2014 Nigeria, Congo and Uganda \u2014 described a cascade of effects with the end of most U.S. government support.",
      "The U.S. has provided hundreds of millions of dollars every year to the three countries alone through the USAID-led President\u2019s Malaria Initiative.",
      "The U.S. funding has often been channeled through a web of non-governmental organizations, medical charities and faith-based organizations in projects that made malaria prevention and treatment more accessible, even free, especially for rural communities.",
      "Uganda in 2023 had 12.6 million malaria cases and nearly 16,000 deaths, many of them children under 5 and pregnant women, according to WHO.",
      "Opigo said the U.S. has been giving between $30 million and $35 million annually for malaria control. He didn't say which contracts have been terminated but noted that field research was also affected.",
      "Some of the USAID funding in Uganda paid for mosquito-spraying operations in remote areas. Those operations were supposed to begin in February ahead of the rainy season, when stagnant water becomes breeding ground for the wide-ranging anopheles mosquito. They have been suspended.",
      "\u201cWe have to spray the houses before the rains, when the mosquitoes come to multiply,\u201d Opigo said.",
      "Already, long lines of malaria patients can be seen outside clinics in many areas every year. Malaria accounts for 30% to 50% of outpatient visits to health facilities across the country, according to Uganda National Institute of Public Health.",
      "Nigeria records a quarter of the world's malaria cases. But authorities have reduced malaria-related deaths there by 55% since 2000 with the support of the U.S. and others.",
      "That support is part of the $600 million in health assistance the west African country received from the U.S. in 2023, according to U.S. Embassy figures. It was not immediately clear whether all of that funding has stopped.",
      "The President\u2019s Malaria Initiative has supported Nigeria\u2019s malaria response with nearly 164 million fast-acting medicines, 83 million insecticide-treated bed nets, over 100 million rapid diagnostic tests, 22 million preventive treatments in pregnancy and insecticide for 121,000 homes since 2011, the embassy says.",
      "In Congo, U.S government funding has contributed about $650 million towards malaria control since 2010.",
      "Now, some of the successes in fighting malaria in Congo are being threatened, which will complicate already difficult efforts to identify and track disease outbreaks across the vast country as supplies and expertise for malaria testing are affected.",
      "Worsening conflict in Congo's east, where some health workers have fled, has raised the risk of infection, with little backup coming.",
      "With the loss of substantial U.S. support, \u201ca lot of people are going to be affected. Some people are really poor and cannot afford (malaria treatment),\u201d said Dr. Yetunde Ayo-Oyalowo, a Nigerian who runs the Market Doctors nonprofit providing affordable local healthcare services.",
      "Up to 40% of her organization's clients are diagnosed with malaria, Ayo-Oyalowo said.",
      "There is hope among health workers in Africa that, even after the dismantling of USAID, some U.S. funding will continue flowing via other groups including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. But that group also received U.S. support and has not issued a public statement on the dramatic cuts in U.S. aid.",
      "Opigo in Uganda said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health might be sources of help.",
      "But he added: \u201cWe need to manage the relationship with the U.S. very carefully.\"",

      "Georgescu reacted to the decision Sunday by calling it \u201ca direct blow to the heart of democracy worldwide!\"",

      "The BEC's rejection of Georgescu's candidacy came after the Constitutional Court annulled the first-round results two days before the Dec. 8 runoff, after allegations emerged that Russia had run a coordinated online campaign to promote the outsider, who ran as an independent.",
      "The court's unprecedented decision plunged the European Union and NATO member country into a protracted political crisis.",
      "Last month, prosecutors launched a criminal investigation against Georgescu, accusing him of \u201cincitement to actions against the constitutional order,\u201d supporting fascist groups and false declarations of electoral campaign funding and asset disclosures.",
      "Before the Nov. 24 election, Georgescu, who is under judicial control and has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, had polled in single digits and declared zero campaign spending. Allegations quickly emerged of electoral violations and Russian interference. Moscow denied that it had meddled in the election.",
      "Georgescu has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and questioned Ukraine\u2019s statehood, but says that he's not pro-Russia.",
      "The first round of the rerun is scheduled for May 4. If no candidate wins more than 50% of the ballots, a runoff will follow on May 18. The deadline for presidential candidacy applications is March 15 at midnight.",
      "George Simion, the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, who had backed Georgescu\u2019s bid, reacted to the BEC\u2019s decision on Sunday by calling it \u201ca new abuse and a continuation of the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\u201d",

      "Since Romania canceled the election, Georgescu has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre among the far right, with support coming from prominent figures such as U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Elon Musk, who have both strongly criticized Romania for annulling the vote.",
      "Musk reacted to the BEC decision in a repost of the news on X, saying: \u201cThis is crazy!\u201d",
      "Incumbent Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan also filed his candidacy on Friday as an independent under the campaign slogan \u201cHonest Romania.\u201d The BEC registered his candidacy on Sunday.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea fired several ballistic missiles into the sea Monday, South Korea\u2019s military said, hours after South Korean and U.S. troops kicked off their large annual combined drills, which the North views as an invasion rehearsal.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile firings, North Korea\u2019s fifth missile launch event this year, were detected from the North\u2019s southwestern Hwanghae province but gave no further details such as how far they flew. It said South Korea bolstered its surveillance posture and is closely coordinating with the United States.",
      "Earlier Monday, the South Korean and U.S. militaries began their annual Freedom Shield command post exercise, their first major combined training of President Donald Trump's second term. The allies have already been engaging in diverse field training exercises in connection with the Freedom Shield training.",
      "North Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry warned Monday the Freedom Shield training risks triggering \u201cphysical conflict\u201d on the Korean Peninsula. It called the training an \u201caggressive and confrontational war rehearsal\" and reiterated leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s stated goals for a \u201cradical growth\u201d of his nuclear force to counter what he claims as growing threats posed by the U.S. and its Asian allies.",
      "This year's training came after the South Korean and U.S. militaries paused live-fire training while Seoul investigates how its fighter jets mistakenly bombed a civilian area during a warm-up drill last week.",
      "About 30 people were injured, two of them seriously, when two South Korean KF-16 fighter jets mistakenly fired eight MK-82 bombs on a civilian area in Pocheon, a town near the North Korean border, on Thursday. The bombing occurred while South Korean and U.S. forces were engaging in a live-fire drill ahead of the Freedom Shield exercise.",
      "The initial assessment from the South Korean air force was that one of the KF-16 pilots entered the wrong coordinates and failed to visually verify the target before proceeding with the bombing. The second pilot had the correct coordinates but focused only on maintaining flight formation and dropped the bombs on the first pilot\u2019s instructions with recognizing the target was wrong, according to the content of the latest briefing provided to The Associated Press.",
      "Gen. Lee Youngsu, chief of staff of the South Korean air force, bowed and apologized Monday over the injuries and property damage caused by the bombing, which he said \u201cshould have never happened and must never happen again.\u201d",
      "Both the South Korean and U.S. militaries have halted all live-fire exercises in South Korea following the mistake. South Korean military officials say live-fire training will resume after they complete the investigation of the bombing and form preventative steps.",

      "Consumer prices fell in China in February for the first time in 13 months, as persistent weak demand was compounded by the early timing of the Lunar New Year holiday",
      "BEIJING -- Consumer prices fell in China in February for the first time in 13 months, as persistent weak demand was compounded by the early timing of the Lunar New Year holiday.",
      "The National Bureau of Statistics said Sunday that the consumer price index dropped 0.7% in February compared to a year ago. On a monthly basis, prices were down 0.2% from January.",
      "While many other countries wrestle with inflation, China's policymakers face flat to falling prices, and the possibility they could evolve into a deflationary spiral that would drag down the economy. The government stressed the need to increase domestic demand and consumer spending in an annual report last week to its ceremonial legislature, the National People's Congress, but held back on unveiling any dramatic new steps to boost the economy.",
      "The Lunar New Year, a time when spending rises for travel, dining out and entertainment, came in late January this year instead of February, as it's based on the cycles of the moon. Holiday spending helped drive the consumer price index up 0.5% in January, but it then fell last month compared to 2024's elevated level.",
      "Factoring out the impact of the holiday, the index rose 0.1% last month, Dong Lijuan, a statistician at the government's statistics bureau, said in a written analysis.",
      "That is still far lower than ideal. Last week's government annual report included an inflation target of 2% for this year, but it is likely to fall far short of that goal. The consumer price index was flat in 2024, rising 0.2%.",
      "A burgeoning trade war with the United States could add to China's economic headwinds.",
      "Besides the early Lunar New Year, two other factors contributed to falling prices in February, Dong said: Better weather boosted farm production, driving down the price of fresh vegetables and automakers also stepped up promotions to try to boost sales, reducing prices for new cars.",
      "The producer price index, which measures the wholesale price of goods, fell 2.2% in February, the statistics bureau said. Producer prices have been falling more sharply than consumer prices, putting pressure on companies to cut labor and other costs."

      "MAE SOT, Thailand -- Thousands of sick, exhausted and terrified young men and women, from countries all over the world squat in rows, packed shoulder to shoulder, surgical masks covering their mouths and eyes.",
      "Their nightmare was supposed to be over.",
      "Last month, a dramatic and highly publicized operation by Thai, Chinese and Myanmar authorities led to the release of more than 7,000 people from locked compounds in Myanmar where they were forced to trick Americans and others out of their life savings. But survivors have found themselves trapped once again, this time in overcrowded facilities with no medical care, limited food and no idea when they\u2019ll be sent home.",
      "One young man from India said about 800 people were being held in the same facility as him, sharing 10 dirty toilets. He said many of the people there were feverish and coughing. Like all former enslaved scammers who talked to The Associated Press, he spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern for his safety.",
      "\u201cIf we die here with health issues, who is responsible for that?\u201d he asked.",
      "The armed groups who are holding the survivors, as well as Thai officials across the border, say they are awaiting action from the detainees\u2019 home governments.",
      "It\u2019s one of the largest potential rescues of forced laborers in modern history, but advocates say the first major effort to crack down on the cyber scam industry has turned into a growing humanitarian crisis.",
      "The people released are just a small fraction of what could be 300,000 people working in similar scam operations across the region, according to an estimate from the United States Institute of Peace. Human rights groups and analysts add that the networks that run these illegal scams will continue to operate unless much broader action is taken against them.",
      "The trapped people, some of whom are highly educated and fluent in English, were initially lured to Thailand with promises of lucrative office jobs, only to find themselves locked in buildings where they describe being forced to sit at computers up to 16 hours a day running scams. Refusing to work could bring beatings, starvation and electric shocks.",
      "\u201cYour passport is confiscated, you cannot go outside and everything is like hell, a living hell,\u201d a trapped Pakistani man told The Associated Press.",
      "Cyber scams run from compounds have flourished during the pandemic, targeting people around the world. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes estimates that between $18 billion and $37 billion was lost in Asia alone in 2023, with minimal government action against the criminal industry\u2019s spread.",
      "Beijing began pushing the region's governments to crack down this year after a young Chinese actor was trafficked to Myanmar by people who promised him an acting job in Thailand. His girlfriend spearheaded a viral social media campaign that led to his release.",
      "Following that rescue, a senior Chinese government official visited Thailand and Myanmar demanding an end to the scams. In response, Thailand cut electricity, internet and gas supplies to five border towns in Myanmar.",
      "Shortly after, the ethnic militia groups that rule this part of Myanmar \u2014 the Kayin Border Guard Force and the Democratic Kayin Buddhist Army \u2014 asked some of the trapped scammers if they wanted to leave, and then escorted them out of their compounds.",
      "As the number of people released grew into the thousands, formerly enslaved scammers found themselves caught in indefinite detention just across a narrow, slow-moving river\u2019s width from freedom.",
      "Most are being held either in army camps controlled by the Kayin Border Guard Force, or repurposed scam compounds, where many have been since early February.",
      "For weeks, men and women have shared unsanitary conditions, sleeping on the floor and eating what their captors provide. At one point, the Border Guard Force said that over 7,000 people were crammed into these facilities, as China began busing citizens across the border for flights.",
      "Exclusive photos obtained by AP underscore the detainees' desperation: Surgical masks, often two per face, cover their eyes, noses and mouths as they huddle under the watchful eyes of armed guards.",
      "\u201cIt felt like a blessing that we came out of that trap, but the actual thing is that every person just wants to go back home,\u201d said another Indian man, 24, speaking softly on a contraband phone from inside a makeshift detention center. He asked to not publish his name out of concern for his safety and because the militias guarding them had confiscated their phones.",
      "Last week, fights broke out between Chinese citizens waiting to go home and the security forces guarding them, two detainees told the AP.",
      "An unconfirmed list provided by authorities in Myanmar says they\u2019re holding citizens from 29 countries including Philippines, Kenya and the Czech Republic.",
      "Authorities in Thailand say they cannot allow foreigners to cross the border from Myanmar unless they can be sent home immediately, leaving many to wait for help from embassies that has been long in coming.",
      "China sent a chartered flight Thursday to the tiny Mae Sot airport to pick up a group of its citizens, but few other governments have matched that. There are roughly 130 Ethiopians waiting in a Thai military base, stuck for want of a $600 plane ticket. Dozens of Indonesians were bused out one morning last week, pushing suitcases and carrying plastic bags with their meager possessions as they headed to Bangkok for a flight home.",
      "Thai officials held a meeting this week with representatives from foreign embassies, promising to move \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d to allow them to rescue their trapped citizens. But they warned that Thailand can only manage to receive 300 people per day, down from 500 previously, Monday through Fridays. It also announced it would let embassy staff cross over into Myanmar.",
      "\u201cThe ministry attaches very high importance to this and is aware that there are sick people, and that they need to be repatriated,\u201d Nikorndej Balankura, spokesman for Thailand\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Thursday.",
      "The Indian Embassy in Bangkok did not respond to requests for comment. The Czech Foreign Ministry says it cannot confirm a Czech citizen is among those repatriated. It says it is in touch with the embassies in Bangkok and Yangon over the issue and that the embassies have not been asked for assistance.",
      "Amy Miller, the Southeast Asia director of Acts of Mercy International who is based at the Thai-Myanmar border, says it\u2019s hard for the world to understand why all of the released workers aren\u2019t free.",
      "\u201cYou can literally, with your naked eye, stand at the border and see people inside, on their balconies, in these compounds, and yet we cannot reach them,\u201d she said. Pausing a moment, she gestured out a nearby window toward the Friendship Bridge to Myanmar just blocks away. \u201cI think what people don\u2019t understand is that to enter into another country is an act of war. You cannot just go in and receive these people out.\u201d",
      "Aiding the work on the front lines, especially for those countries with fewer resources, are a handful of small nonprofit groups with very limited funds.",
      "In a nondescript Mae Sot home, Miller\u2019s organization receives escapees and a trickle of survivors who have made it across the river with comfortable couches, clean water, food and working phones to reach their families. She said today\u2019s unprecedented numbers are overwhelming the aid available across the river.",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re looking at numbers in the thousands, the ability to get them over to Thailand and process them and house them and feed them would be impossible for most governments,\u201d said Miller. \u201cIt really does require a kind of a global response.\u201d",
      "The recent abrupt halt to U.S. foreign aid funding has made it even harder to get help to released scam center workers.",
      "The United Nations\u2019 International Organization for Migration, for example, previously funded care for victims of trafficking in scam compounds in one shelter in Cambodia, but was forced to halt that work by the Trump Administration\u2019s funding freeze announced in January, according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation. The halt to funding has also impacted a network of civil society groups that worked to stop human trafficking and rescue survivors in Thailand.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really heartbreaking to see that there\u2019s such an immense amount of people that are in need of assistance,\u201d said Saskia Kok, Head of Protection Unit in Thailand for the IOM.",
      "In a statement, U.S. officials acknowledged the high pressure impasse.",
      "\u201cThe United States remains deeply concerned about online scam operations throughout Southeast Asia, which affect thousands of Americans and individuals from many other countries,\u201d said a State Department spokesperson in a statement sent to the AP.",
      "While advocates estimate some 50 million people are living in modern slavery, mass rescues of enslaved workers are rare. In 2015, more than 2,000 fishermen were rescued from brutal conditions at sea, liberated after an Associated Press investigation exposed their plight. That same year hundreds of Indians were rescued from brick factories in India. And last year Brazilian prosecutors rescued 163 Chinese nationals working in \u201cslavery-like\u201d conditions at an electric vehicle factory construction site in northeastern Brazil.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing at the Thai-Myanmar border now is the result of years of inaction on a trafficking crisis that has had a devastating impact on thousands of people, many of whom were simply seeking better economic prospect, but were lured to these compounds on false pretenses,\u201d said Amnesty International Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman.",
      "Being forced to commit a crime under threat of violence should not be criminalized, said Freeman. \u201cHowever, in general we are aware of countries in the region repatriating their nationals from scam compounds only to then charge them with crimes.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much of an effect these releases will have on the criminal groups that run the scam centers.",
      "February marked the third time the Thais have cut internet or electricity to towns across the river. Each time, the compounds have managed to work around the cuts. Large compounds have access to diesel-powered generators, as well as access to internet provider Starlink, experts working with law enforcement say.",
      "\u201cThe resources is the one thing that they are not lacking and they\u2019ve been able to bring them to bear in the past,\u201d said Benedikt Hoffman, acting representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in the region.",
      "The armed groups that staged the crackdown have also been accused of helping to run scam compounds in Myawaddy. The head of the Kayin Border Guard Force, General Saw Chit Thu, has been sanctioned by the European Union and the United Kingdom for profiting from scam compounds and human trafficking, respectively. Compounds in the DKBA\u2019s control are less well-documented in the public record, but activists say they also control a fair number.",
      "\u201cThere is clearly a lot of pressure on the Border Guard Force to take action and helping people to leave is one of the most visible ways to do so,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cThat said, it likely also reflects an adjustment to the business model, reducing the number of people involved \u2014 and with less attention, continuing lower key operations.\u201d",
      "It will take simultaneous pressure exerted in multiple areas to truly shut down the compounds, said Hoffman.",
      "In this crackdown, there have been no major prosecutions or compounds shut down.",
      "\u201cThis doesn\u2019t affect anything,\u201d said a 23-year-old Pakistani man who had hoped to be freed only to be trapped in an army camp. The bosses, he said, are \u201crich as hell\u201d and can buy anything they need to keep the lucrative operations going. Meanwhile, he said, conditions are worsening.",
      "\u201cMy friends are in really bad condition, we can\u2019t survive here,\u201d he said, requesting anonymity out of fear for retribution from his guards. He asks a question that's been haunting him day in and day out for weeks: \u201cIs anyone coming for us?\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Syria\u2019s Druze minority is trying to navigate a new, uncertain Syria",
      "JARAMANA, Syria -- Syria\u2019s Druze minority has a long history of cutting their own path to survive among the country\u2019s powerhouses. They are now trying again to navigate a new, uncertain Syria since the fall of longtime autocrat Bashar Assad.",
      "Members of the small religious sect find themselves caught between two forces that many of them distrust: the new, Islamist-led government in Damascus and Syria\u2019s hostile neighbor, Israel, which has used the plight of the Druze as a pretext to intervene in the country.",
      "Syria\u2019s many religious and ethnic communities are worried over their place in the new system. The transitional government has promised to include them, but has so far kept authority in the hands of the Islamist former insurgents who toppled Assad in December -- Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. That and HTS\u2019s past affiliation with Sunni Muslim extremist al-Qaida, has minorities suspicious.",
      "The most explosive hostilities have been with the Alawite religious minority, to which Assad\u2019s family belongs. Heavy clashes erupted this week between armed Assad loyalists and government forces, killing at least 70, in the coastal regions that are the Alawites\u2019 heartland.",
      "In contrast, the Druze -- largely centered in southern Syria -- have kept up quiet contacts with the government. Still, tensions have broken out.",
      "Last week in Jaramana, a suburb of Damascus with a large Druze population, unknown gunmen killed a member of the government\u2019s security forces, which responded with a wave of arrests in the district.",
      "Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and military officials weighed in by threatening to send forces to Jaramana to protect the Druze. Druze leaders quickly disavowed the offer. But soon after, someone hung an Israeli flag in Sweida, an overwhelmingly Druze region in southern Syria, prompting residents to quickly tear it down and burn it.",
      "Many fear another flare-up is only a matter of time.",
      "Multiple Druze armed militias have existed for years, originally set up to protect their communities against Islamic State group fighters and drug smugglers coming in from the eastern desert. They have been reluctant to set down their arms. Recently a new faction, the Sweida Military Council, proclaimed itself, grouping several smaller Druze militias.",
      "The result is a cycle of mistrust, where government supporters paint Druze factions as potential separatists or tools of Israel, while government hostility only deepens Druze worries.",
      "On the outskirts of Sweida, a commander in Liwa al-Jabal, a Druze militia, stood on a rooftop and scanned the hills with binoculars. He spoke by walkie-talkie with a militiaman with an assault rifle below. They were watching for any movement by militants or gangs.",
      "\u201cOur arms are not for expansionist purposes. They're for self-defense and protection,\u201d said the commander, who asked to be identified only by his nickname Abu Ali for security reasons. \u201cWe have no enemies except those who attack us.\u201d",
      "Abu Ali, who is a metal worker as his day job, said most Druze militiamen would merge with a new Syrian army if it\u2019s one that \u201cprotects all Syrians rather than crushes them like the previous regime.\u201d",
      "The Druze religious sect began as a 10th-century offshoot of Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam. Over half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria. Most other Druze live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War and annexed in 1981.",
      "In Syria, the Druze take pride in their fierce independence. They were heavily involved in revolts against Ottoman and French colonial rule to establish the modern Syrian state.",
      "During Syria\u2019s civil war that began in 2011, the Druze were split between supporters of Assad and the opposition. The Sweida region stayed quiet for much of the war, though it erupted with anti-government protests in 2023.",
      "Assad reluctantly gave Druze a degree of autonomy, as they wanted to avoid being involved on the frontlines. The Druze were exempted from conscription into the Syrian army and instead set up local armed factions made of workers and farmers to patrol their areas.",
      "Druze say they want Syria\u2019s new authorities to include them in a political process to create a secular and democratic state.",
      "\u201cReligion is for God and the state is for all\u201d proclaimed a slogan written on the hood of a vehicle belonging to the Men of Dignity, another Druze militia patrolling the outskirts of Sweida.",
      "Many Druze quickly rejected Israel\u2019s claims to protect the minority. Hundreds took to the streets in Sweida to protest Netanyahu\u2019s comments.",
      "\u201cWe are Arabs, whether he or whether the Lord that created him likes it or not. Syria is free,\u201d said Nabih al-Halabi, a 60-year-old resident of Jaramana.",
      "He and others reject accusations that the Druze want partition from Syria.",
      "But patience is wearing thin over what many see as arbitrary layoffs of public sector workers, shortage of economic opportunities, and the new authorities\u2019 lack of more than token inclusion of Syrians from minority communities. For the first time, a protest took place in Sweida on Thursday against Damascus' new authorities.",
      "Interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa has promised to create an inclusive system, but the government is made up mostly of his confidantes. The authorities convened a national dialogue conference last week, inviting Syrians from different communities, but many criticized it as rushed and not really inclusive.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing from the state today, in our opinion, does not achieve the interests of all Syrians,\u201d said retired nurse Nasser Abou-Halam, discussing local politics with other residents in Sweida's public square where near-daily protests took place. \u201cIt\u2019s a one-color government, with leadership appointed through factions rather than through elections.\u201d",

      "TORONTO -- Canada\u2019s next prime minister has helped run two Group of Seven economies in crisis before and now will try to steer Canada through a looming trade war brought by U.S. President Donald Trump, a threat of annexation and an expected federal election.",
      "Former central banker Mark Carney will become prime minister after the governing Liberal Party elected him its leader Sunday in a landside vote with 85.9% support.",
      "Carney, 59, replaces Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January but remains prime minister until his successor is sworn in in the coming days. Carney is widely expected to trigger an election the coming days or weeks amid Trump\u2019s sweeping tariff threats.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t ask for this fight. But Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves,\u201d Carney said. \u201cThe Americans, they should make no mistake, in trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.\u201d",
      "Carney said Canada will keep its initial retaliatory tariffs in place until \u201cthe Americans show us respect.\u201d",
      "Carney navigated crises when he was the head of the Bank of Canada and when in 2013 he became the first noncitizen to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. His appointment won bipartisan praise in the U.K. after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries. He helped managed the worst impacts of Brexit in the U.K.",
      "The opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged.",
      "Trump\u2019s trade war and his talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, who are booing the American anthem at NHL and NBA games. Some are canceling trips south of the border, and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can.",
      "The surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered the Liberal Party\u2019s chances in a parliamentary election expected within days or weeks, and Liberal showings have been improving in opinion polls.",
      "\u201cThe Americans want our resources, our water, our land, our country. Think about it. If they succeed they would destroy our way of life,\u201d Carney said. \u201cIn America health care is big business. In Canada it is a right.\u201d",

      "After decades of bilateral stability, the vote on Canada\u2019s next leader now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with the United States.",
      "\u201cThese are dark days, dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust,\u201d Carney said. \u201cWe need to pull together in the tough days ahead.\u201d",
      "Trump has postponed 25% tariffs on many goods from Canada and Mexico for a month, amid widespread fears of a broader trade war. But he has threatened other tariffs on steel, aluminum, dairy and other products.",
      "Carney picked up one endorsement after another from Cabinet ministers and members of Parliament since declaring his candidacy in January. He is a highly educated economist with Wall Street experience who has long been interested in entering politics and becoming prime minister, but he lacks political experience.",
      "Trudeau previously offered to make him finance minister. Carney has said former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper also offered to make him finance minister.",
      "Carney is a former Goldman Sachs executive. He worked for 13 years in London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto, before being appointed deputy governor of the Bank of Canada in 2003.",
      "In 2020, he began serving as the United Nations\u2019 special envoy for climate action and finance.",
      "The other top Liberal leadership candidate was former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who received just 8% of the vote. Trudeau told Freeland in December that he no longer wanted her as finance minister, but that she could remain deputy prime minister and the point person for U.S.-Canada relations. Freeland resigned shortly after, releasing a scathing letter about the government that proved to be the last straw for Trudeau.",
      "Either Carney will call an election in the coming days or weeks, or the opposition parties in Parliament could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month.",

      "Panama has released dozens of migrants deported from the United States who were held for weeks in a remote camp on the condition that they would leave the Central American nation in 30 days",
      "PANAMA CITY -- After weeks of lawsuits and human rights criticism, Panama on Saturday released dozens of migrants who were held for weeks in a remote camp after being deported from the United States, telling them they have 30 days to leave the Central American nation.",
      "It thrust many like Hayatullah Omagh, a 29-year-old who fled Afghanistan in 2022 after the Taliban took control, into a legal limbo, scrambling to find a path forward.",
      "\u201cWe are refugees. We do not have money. We can not pay for a hotel in Panama City, we do not have relatives,\u201d Omagh told the Associated Press in an interview. \u201cI can\u2019t go back to Afghanistan under any circumstances ... It is under the control of the Taliban, and they want to kill me. How can I go back?\"",
      "Authorities have said deportees will have the option of extending their stay by 60 days if they need it, but after that many like Omagh don\u2019t know what they will do.",
      "Omagh climbed off a bus in Panama City alongside 65 migrants from China, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Nepal and other nations after spending weeks detained in poor conditions by the Panamanian government, which has said it wants to work with the Trump administration \u201cto send a signal of deterrence\u201d to people hoping to migrate.",
      "Human rights groups and lawyers advocating for the migrants were waiting at the bus terminal, and scrambled to find the released migrants shelter and other resources. Dozens of other people remained in the camp.",
      "Among those getting off buses were migrants fleeing violence and repression in Pakistan and Iran, and 27-year-old Nikita Gaponov, who fled Russia due to repression for being part of the LGBTQ+ community and who said he was detained at the U.S. border, but not allowed to make an asylum claim.",
      "\u201cOnce I get off the bus, I'll be sleeping on the ground tonight,\" Gaponov said.",
      "Others turned their eyes north once again, saying that even though they had already been deported, they had no other option than to continue after crossing the world to reach the U.S.",
      "The deportees, largely from Asian countries, were part of a deal stuck between the Trump administration and Panama and Costa Rica as the U.S. government attempts to speed up deportations. The administration sent hundreds of people, many families with children, to the two Central American countries as a stopover while authorities organize a way to send them back to their countries of origin.",
      "Critics described it as a way for the U.S. to export its deportation process.",
      "The agreement fueled human rights concerns when hundreds of deportees detained in a hotel in Panama City held up notes to their windows pleading for help and saying they were scared to return to their own countries.",
      "Under international refugee law, people have the right to apply for asylum when they are fleeing conflict or persecution.",
      "Those that refused to return home were later sent to a remote camp near Panama's border with Colombia, where they spent weeks in poor conditions, were stripped of their phones, unable to access legal council and were not told where they were going next.",
      "Lawyers and human rights defenders warned that Panama and Costa Rica were turning into \u201cblack holes\u201d for deportees, and said their release was a way for Panamanian authorities to wash their hands of the deportees amid mounting human rights criticism.",
      "Those who were released Saturday night, like Omagh, said they could not return home.",
      "As an atheist and member of an ethnic minority group in Afghanistan known as the Hazara, he said returning home under the rule of the Taliban \u2014 which swept back into power after the Biden administration pulled out of the country \u2014 would mean he would be killed. He only went to the U.S. after trying for years to live in Pakistan, Iran and other countries but being denied visas.",
      "Omagh was deported after presenting himself to American authorities and asking to seek asylum in the U.S., which he was denied.",
      "\u201cMy hope was freedom. Just freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn't give me the chance. I asked many times to speak to an asylum officer and they told me \u2018No, no, no, no, no.\u2019\u201d",
      "Still, he said that leaving the camp was a relief. Omagh and other migrants who spoke to the AP detailed scarce food, sweltering heat with little relief and aggressive Panamanian authorities.",
      "In one case, Omagh and others said, a Chinese man went on a week-long hunger strike. In another, a small riot broke out because guards refused to give a migrant their phone. The riot, they said, was suppressed by armed guards.",
      "Panamanian authorities denied accusations about camp conditions, but blocked journalists from accessing the camp and cancelled a planned press visit last week.",
      "While international aid organizations said they would organize travel to a third country for people who didn\u2019t want to return home, Panamanian authorities said the people released had already refused help.",
      "Omagh said he was told in the camp he could be sent to a third country if it gives people from Afghanistan visas. He said that would be incredibly difficult because few nations open their doors to people with a Afghan passport.",
      "He said he asked authorities in the camp multiple times if he could seek asylum in Panama, and said he was told that \u201cwe do not accept asylum.\u201d",
      "\u201cNone of them wants to stay in Panama. They want to go to the U.S.,\u201d said Carlos Ruiz-Hernandez, Panama\u2019s deputy foreign minister, in an interview with the AP last month.",
      "That was the case for some, like one Chinese woman who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity, fearing repercussions from Panamanian authorities.",
      "Upon getting off the bus, the first thing she wanted to do was find a Coca-Cola. Then, she'd find a way back to the U.S.",
      "\"I still want to continue to go to the United States and fulfill my American dream,\" she said.",

He ruled as the constitutional head of state without executive or political powers until 2005, when he seized absolute power.

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian special forces walked kilometers (miles) inside a gas pipeline to strike Ukrainian units from the rear in the Kursk region, Ukraine\u2019s military and Russian war bloggers reported, as Moscow moves to recapture parts of its border province that Kyiv seized in a shock offensive.",
      "Ukraine launched a daring cross-border incursion into Kursk i n August, in what marked the largest attack on Russian territory since World War II. Within days, Ukrainian units had captured 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of territory, including the strategic border town of Sudzha, and taken hundreds of Russian prisoners of war. According to Kyiv, the operation aimed to gain a bargaining chip in future peace talks, and force Russia to divert troops away from its grinding offensive in eastern Ukraine.",
      "But months after Ukraine\u2019s thunder run, its soldiers in Kursk are weary and bloodied by relentless assaults of more than 50,000 troops, including some from Russia's ally North Korea. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers run the risk of being encircled, open source maps of the battlefield show.",
      "According to Telegram posts by a Ukrainian-born, pro-Kremlin blogger, Russian operatives walked about 15 kilometers (9 miles) inside the pipeline, which Moscow had until recently used to send gas to Europe. Some Russian troops had spent several days in the pipe before striking Ukrainian units from the rear near the town of Sudzha, blogger Yuri Podolyaka claimed.",
      "The town had some 5,000 residents before the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, and houses major gas transfer and measuring stations along the pipeline, once a major outlet for Russian natural gas exports through Ukrainian territory.",
      "Another war blogger, who uses the alias Two Majors, said fierce fighting was underway for Sudzha, and that Russian forces managed to enter the town through a gas pipeline. Russian Telegram channels showed photos of what they said were special forces operatives, wearing gas masks and moving along what looked like the inside of a large pipe.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s General Staff confirmed on Saturday evening that Russian \u201csabotage and assault groups\u201d used the pipeline in a bid to gain a foothold outside Sudzha.

      "Valentino paraded high fashion inside a public toilets setting in one of the most unexpected backdrops of the season, especially for a house as classical as Valentino",
      "Valentino paraded high fashion inside public toilets in one of the season\u2019s most provocative backdrops, especially for a house as classical as Valentino \u2014 upending traditional notions of luxury.",
      "Yet at time when restrooms remain a cultural and political flashpoint in debates around gender identity, access, and self-presentation, the show\u2019s setting \u2014 one the designer described as \u201cproudly political\u201d \u2014 also felt like a deliberate challenge.",
      "The set was a meticulous recreation, down to the tiling, soap dispensers, mirrors and endless rows of stalls, all bathed in an unsettling, almost seedy red light.",
      "Partly inspired by David Lynch, the space set the tone for Alessandro Michele\u2019s bold new vision. With a background in costume design, Michele infuses his collections with inspirations from theater and film, crafting narratives as much as he does garments.",
      "It was one of the standout shows in Paris this season, drawing a front row as eclectic as the collection itself. Chappell Roan, Parker Posey, Jared Leto and Barry Keoghan sat amid the crimson glow, their presence adding to the surreal energy of the day.",
      "Michele often selects venues with deep historical or cultural significance \u2014 think palaces \u2014 so this public toilet setting was a clever subversion, even of his own signature style. The result? A show that explored the boundaries between public and private, intimacy and exposure, and the ever-blurred lines of identity in contemporary fashion.",
      "Models emerged from toilet cubicles, some stopping to inspect their faces in the mirrors, blurring the line between personal and performative. The clothes were pure theatricality: caps, hoods, and dark shades concealing the face, while sheer nude tops exposed breasts and the intimacy of the body, a direct contrast between covering up and revealing.",
      "Michele\u2019s designs are characterized by a kaleidoscopic mix of times and cultures, blending elements from different historical periods to create a unique aesthetic. He considers himself an \u201cart archaeologist,\u201d exploring how adornment and embellishment have evolved over the centuries.",
      "One striking example: intricately embroidered lingerie with an opulent silken bust and stiff Victorian collar, its crotch flap left provocatively undone, as if the model had to rush to the restroom. Baroque motifs and 18th-century ruffles clashed with oversized, washed-out denim jeans, while his signature maximalist mix of leopard print, faux fur, and tweed created a tension\u2014like the most opulent thrift store imaginable.",
      "There were so many styles, they defied description. And that was the point. The overloaded looks were intentional, a singular vision of excess that defines Michele\u2019s aesthetic and cements his legacy as a designer who refuses to conform.",
      "The audience buzzed with excitement. \u201cHe\u2019s upending Valentino in the same way Demna did at Balenciaga,\u201d one front-row guest remarked. The applause was loud, the reaction immediate. This wasn\u2019t just a collection, it was a statement, disruptive and irreverent, pulling a classical house into new, unexpected territory.",
      "For Michele, the public toilet was more than a backdrop \u2014 it was a space where boundaries dissolve, a setting charged with meaning. He described it as a \u201ccounter-place\u201d that blurs distinctions between public and private, intimacy and exposure, transforming the mundane into something profoundly symbolic.",
      "But as Michele put it, it was also a \u201cproudly political\u201d space, one designed to upend convention and provoke thought. Though he never explicitly linked the setting to gender politics, the casting spoke volumes. Androgynous models stood alongside male and female counterparts, all moving fluidly through the space, reinforcing the idea that identity is unfixed, and fashion, like the world it reflects, defies rigid categorization. At a time when restrooms remain at the heart of cultural and political debates on gender identity, access, and self-expression, the show\u2019s setting was impossible to ignore.",
      "With this, Michele made it clear that his vision for Valentino extends far beyond clothing. It is about identity in motion, the interplay of concealment and revelation. And above all, fashion as a stage for storytelling at its most provocative."

      "An ambush on a Syrian security patrol by gunmen loyal to ousted leader Bashar Assad escalated into clashes that a war monitor estimates have killed more than 1,000 people over four days.",
      "The attack Thursday near the port city of Latakia reopened the wounds of the country\u2019s 13-year civil war and sparked the worst violence Syria has seen since December, when insurgents led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, overthrew Assad.",
      "The counteroffensive against the Assad loyalists in the largely Alawite coastal region brought havoc to several cities and towns. Rights groups reported dozens of revenge killings resulting from Sunni militants targeting the minority Islamic sect, regardless of whether they were involved in the insurgency.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the latest violence in the war-wracked country:",
      "Tensions have been on the rise since Assad's downfall following sectarian attacks against Alawites, who ruled Syria for over 50 years under the Assad dynasty. The assaults continued despite promises from Syria\u2019s interim president that the country's new leaders will carve out a political future for Syria that includes and represents all its communities.",
      "In their ambush, the pro-Assad Alawite gunmen overwhelmed government security forces and later took control of Qardaha, Assad's hometown, as Damascus scrambled to bring in reinforcements.",
      "Defense Ministry spokesperson Col. Hassan Abdel-Ghani said Sunday that security forces have restored control of the region and will continue pursuing leaders of the galvanized insurgency.",
      "But despite authorities calling for an end to the sectarian incitement, the clashes turned deadly, and many civilians were killed.",
      "Most of the dead are apparently members of the Alawite community, who live largely in the country's coastal province, including in the cities of Latakia and Tartous. Rights groups estimate that hundreds of civilians were killed.",
      "The Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam, and it once formed the core constituency of Assad's government in the Sunni-majority country.",
      "Opponents of Assad saw Syria under the family's rule as granting privileges to the Alawite community. As the civil war intensified, militant groups emerged across the country and treated Alawites as affiliates of Assad and his key military allies, Russia and Iran.",
      "Syria's new interim government is under Sunni Islamist rule. Interim President Ahmad Al-Sharaa, a former HTS leader, has promised that the country will transition to a system that includes Syria's mosaic of religious and ethnic groups under fair elections, but skeptics question whether that will actually happen.",
      "Little is currently known about the Alawite insurgency, which is composed of remnants of Assad's web of military and intelligence branches, and who their foreign backers might be.",
      "The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 745 civilians killed, mostly in shootings. In addition, 125 members of government security forces and 148 militants with armed groups affiliated with Assad were killed. Electricity and drinking water were cut off in large areas around Latakia, the group added.",
      "Meanwhile, the Syria Campaign and the Syrian Network for Human Rights, which both advocated against Assad after the civil war began in 2011, said Saturday that both security forces and pro-Assad gunmen were \u201ccarrying out mass executions and systematic killings.\u201d",

      "The Associated Press could not verify those numbers, and conflicting death figures during attacks in Syria over the years have not been uncommon.

      "Damascus has struggled to reconcile with skeptics of its Islamist government, as well as with Kurdish-led authorities in the northeast and the Druze minority in the south. Al-Sharaa has lobbied to convince the United States and Europe to lift sanctions to pave the way for economic recovery to pull millions of Syrians out of poverty and make the country viable again.",
      "Washington and Europe are concerned that lifting sanctions before Syria transitions into an inclusive political system could pave the way for another chapter of autocratic rule.",

Such human rights violations were rampant under Assad. Blaming remnants of the former government for the outbreak of violence, and certain foreign parties supporting them, Al-Sharaa also formed a committee composed mostly of judges to investigate the violence.",
      "In a statement issued Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio urged Syrian authorities to \u201chold the perpetrators of these massacres\" accountable. Rubio said the U.S. \u201cstands with Syria\u2019s religious and ethnic minorities, including its Christian, Druze, Alawite, and Kurdish communities.\u201d"

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Australia's prime minister cautioned that the fallout from a vicious tropical storm over the weekend was \u201cfar from over\u201d as parts of two states remained inundated with perilous floodwaters on Monday, even as the initial threat from the deluge continued to recede.",
      "One person was killed and several others injured after heavy rain lashed Australia's east coast on Saturday, toppling trees and power lines and inundating some parts of Queensland and New South Wales with record downpours. The two states escaped the level of chaos forecast from the tropical low weather system, which was earlier expected to make landfall as the first tropical cyclone to hit south east Queensland in 51 years \u2014 before weakening as it approached.",
      "Still, 200,000 homes and businesses were without power in the region on Monday afternoon \u2014 after the storm prompted the biggest blackout in Queensland's history \u2014 and more than 700 schools were closed for the day.",
      "Those living near rivers and creeks were urged to evacuate or stay indoors as water levels continued to rise in some areas \u2014 with more rain forecast triggering further warnings during the day. Disaster was declared for the city of Ipswich, west of Brisbane, where a river was expected to flood overnight. People in surrounding suburbs were ordered to leave their homes.",
      "Meanwhile, in other towns where floodwaters began to recede a cleanup began as power was restored for tens of thousands of people. The scale of the damage was not immediately clear.",
      "Workers whose livelihoods were hampered by the storm will be eligible for welfare payments for up to 13 weeks beginning Tuesday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters on Monday.",
      "In the city of Lismore in New South Wales, two military trucks helping with the rescue efforts on Saturday rolled over, injuring 13 of the 36 personnel travelling in them. One remained in hospital on Monday with injuries that were not life-threatening, Australia's Defense Minister Richard Marles said.",
      "The single casualty of the crisis was a 61-year-old man who disappeared in a flooded river near the New South Wales town of Dorrigo, police said. His body was recovered on Saturday.",
      "Albanese warned residents of the two stricken states not to be \u201ccomplacent\u201d as flood warnings lingered.",
      "\u201cIf it's flooded, forget it,\u201d he said, referring to traveling in or entering inundated areas.",
      "Cyclones are common in Queensland\u2019s tropical north but are rare in the state\u2019s temperate and densely populated southeast corner that borders New South Wales. Tropical Cyclone Alfred was last week expected to become the first cyclone since 1974 to cross the Australian coast near Queensland's state capital of Brisbane, Australia\u2019s third-most populous city.",
      "But it weakened Saturday to a tropical low, defined as carrying sustained winds of less than 63 kph (39 mph).",
      "Authorities had feared similar scenes to those eastern Australia experienced during massive floods in 2011 and in a series of 2022 events \u2014 in which more than 20 people died.",

      "TOKYO -- More than 100,000 people were killed in a single night 80 years ago Monday in the U.S. firebombing of Tokyo, the Japanese capital. The attack, made with conventional bombs, destroyed downtown Tokyo and filled the streets with heaps of charred bodies.",

      "The bombing came after the collapse of Japanese air and naval defenses following the U.S. capture of a string of former Japanese strongholds in the Pacific that allowed B-29 Superfortress bombers to easily hit Japan's main islands. There was growing frustration in the United States at the length of the war and past Japanese military atrocities, such as the Bataan Death March.",
      "Ai Saotome has a house full of notes, photos and other material her father left behind when he died at age 90 in 2022.

      "To billionaire Elon Musk and his cost-cutting team at the Department of Government Efficiency, Karen Ortiz may just be one of many faceless bureaucrats",
      "NEW YORK -- To billionaire Elon Musk and his cost-cutting team at the Department of Government Efficiency, Karen Ortiz may just be one of many faceless bureaucrats. But to some of her colleagues, she is giving a voice to those who feel they can't speak out.",
      "Ortiz is an administrative judge at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission -- the federal agency in charge of enforcing U.S. workplace anti-discrimination laws that has undergone tumultuous change since President Donald Trump took office. Like millions of other federal employees, Ortiz opened an ominous email on Jan. 28 titled \u201cFork in the Road\" giving them the option to resign from their positions as part of the government\u2019s cost-cutting measures directed by Trump and carried out by DOGE under Musk, an unelected official.",
      "Her alarm grew when her supervisor directed administrative judges in her New York district office to pause all their current LGBTQ+ cases and send them to Washington for further review in order to comply with Trump's executive order declaring that the government would recognize only two \u201cimmutable\u201d sexes \u2014 male and female.",
      "Ortiz decried management\u2019s lack of action in response to the directive, which she said was antithetical to the EEOC\u2019s mission, and called upon some 185 colleagues in an email to \u201cresist\u201d complying with \u201cillegal mandates.\u201d But that email was \u201cmysteriously\u201d deleted, she said.",
      "The next day, after yet another frustrating \u201cFork in the Road\u201d update, Ortiz decided to go big, emailing the EEOC's acting chair Andrea Lucas directly and copying more than 1,000 colleagues with the subject line, \u201cA Spoon is Better than a Fork.\" In it, Ortiz questioned Lucas's fitness to serve as acting chair, \u201cmuch less hold a license to practice law.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know I take a great personal risk in sending out this message. But, at the end of the day, my actions align with what the EEOC was charged with doing under the law,\u201d Ortiz wrote. \u201cI will not compromise my ethics and my duty to uphold the law. I will not cower to bullying and intimidation.\u201d",
      "Ortiz is just one person, but her email represents a larger pushback against the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping changes to federal agencies amid an environment of confusion, anger and chaos. It is also Ortiz\u2019s way of taking a stand against the leadership of a civil rights agency that last month moved to dismiss seven of its own cases representing transgender workers, marking a major departure from its prior interpretation of the law.",
      "Right after sending her mass email, Ortiz said she received a few supportive responses from colleagues -- and one calling her unprofessional. Within an hour, though, the message disappeared and she lost her ability to send any further emails.",
      "But it still made it onto the internet. The email was recirculated on Bluesky and it received more than 10,000 \u201cupvotes\u201d on Reddit after someone posted it with the comment, \u201cWow I wish I had that courage.\u201d",
      "\u201cAN AMERICAN HERO,\u201d one Reddit user deemed Ortiz, a sentiment that was seconded by more than 2,000 upvoters. \u201cWho is this freedom fighter bringing on the fire?\" wrote another.",
      "The EEOC did not feel the same way. The agency revoked her email privileges for about a week and issued her a written reprimand for \u201cdiscourteous conduct.\u201d",
      "Contacted by The AP, a spokesperson for the EEOC said: \u201cWe will refrain from commenting on internal communications and personnel matters. However, we would note that the agency has a long-standing policy prohibiting unauthorized all-employee emails, and all employees were reminded of that policy recently.\u201d",
      "A month later, Ortiz has no regrets.",
      "\u201cIt was not really planned out, it was just from the heart,\u201d the 53-year-old told The Associated Press in an interview, adding that partisan politics have nothing to do with her objections and that the public deserves the EEOC's protection, including transgender workers. \u201cThis is how I feel and I\u2019m not pulling any punches. And I will stand by what I wrote every day of the week, all day on Sunday.\u201d",
      "Ortiz said she never intended for her email to go beyond the EEOC, describing it as a \u201clove letter\u201d to her colleagues. But, she added, \u201cI hope that it lights a fire under people.\u201d",
      "Ortiz said she has received \u201ca ton\u201d of support privately in the month since sending her email, including a thank-you letter from a California retiree telling her to \u201ckeep the faith.\u201d Open support among her EEOC colleagues beyond Reddit and Bluesky, however, has proven more elusive.",
      "\u201cI think people are just really scared,\u201d she said.",
      "William Resh, a University of Southern California Sol Price School of Public Policy professor who studies how administrative structure and political environments affect civil servants, weighed in on why federal workers may choose to say nothing even if they feel their mission is being undermined.",
      "\u201cWe can talk pie in the sky, mission orientation and all these other things. But at the end of the day, people have a paycheck to bring home, and food to put on a table and a rent to pay,\u201d Resh said.",
      "The more immediate danger, he said, is the threat to one's livelihood, or inviting a manager's ire.",
      "\u201cAnd so then that\u2019s where you get this kind of muted response on behalf of federal employees, that you don\u2019t see a lot of people speaking out within these positions because they don\u2019t want to lose their job,\u201d Resh said. \u201cWho would?\u201d",
      "Richard LeClear, a U.S. Air Force veteran and EEOC staffer who is retiring early at 64 to avoid serving under the Trump administration, said Ortiz\u2019s email was \u201cspot on,\u201d but added that other colleagues who agreed with her may fear speaking out themselves.",
      "\u201cRetaliation is a very real thing,\u201d LeClear said.",
      "Ortiz, who has been a federal employee for 14 years and at the EEOC for six, said she isn\u2019t naive about the potential fallout. She has hired attorneys, and maintains that her actions are protected whistleblower activity. As of Friday, she still had a job but she is not a lifetime appointee and is aware that her health care, pension and source of income could all be at risk.",
      "Ortiz is nonetheless steadfast: \u201cIf they fire me, I\u2019ll find another avenue to do this kind of work, and I\u2019ll be okay. They will have to physically march me out of the office.\u201d",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump first suggested buying Greenland in 2019",
      "NUUK, Greenland -- When U.S. President Donald Trump first suggested buying Greenland in 2019, people thought it was just a joke. No one is laughing now.",
      "Trump\u2019s interest in Greenland, restated vigorously soon after he returned to the White House in January, comes as part of an aggressively \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy platform that includes demands for Ukraine to hand over mineral rights in exchange for continued military aid, threats to take control of the Panama Canal, and suggestions that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.",
      "Increasing international tensions, global warming and the changing world economy have put Greenland at the heart of the debate over global trade and security, and Trump wants to make sure that the U.S. controls this mineral-rich country that guards the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America.",
      "Greenland is a self-governing territory of Denmark, a long-time U.S. ally that has rejected Trump\u2019s overtures. Denmark has also recognized Greenland\u2019s right to independence at a time of its choosing.",
      "Amid concerns about foreign interference and demands that Greenlanders must control their own destiny, the island\u2019s prime minister called early an parliamentary election for Tuesday.",
      "The world\u2019s largest island, 80% of which lies above the Arctic Circle, is home to about 56,000 mostly Inuit people who until now have been largely ignored by the rest of the world.",
      "Climate change is thinning the Arctic ice, promising to create a northwest passage for international trade and reigniting the competition with Russia, China and other countries over access to the region\u2019s mineral resources.",
      "\u201cLet us be clear: we are soon entering the Arctic Century, and its most defining feature will be Greenland\u2019s meteoric rise, sustained prominence and ubiquitous influence,\u2019\u2019 said Dwayne Menezes, managing director of the Polar Research and Policy Initiative.",
      "\u201cGreenland \u2014 located on the crossroads between North America, Europe and Asia, and with enormous resource potential \u2014 will only become more strategically important, with all powers great and small seeking to pay court to it. One is quite keen to go a step further and buy it.\u201d",
      "The following are some of the factors that are driving U.S. interest in Greenland.",
      "Following the Cold War, the Arctic was largely an area of international cooperation. But climate change, the hunt for scarce resources and increasing international tensions following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine are once again driving competition in the region.",
      "Greenland sits off the northeastern coast of Canada, with more than two-thirds of its territory lying within the Arctic Circle. That has made it crucial to the defense of North America since World War II, when the U.S. occupied Greenland to ensure that it didn\u2019t fall into the hands of Nazi Germany and to protect crucial North Atlantic shipping lanes.",
      "The U.S. has retained bases in Greenland since the war, and the Pituffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Force Base, supports missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance operations for the U.S. and NATO. Greenland also guards part of what is known as the GIUK (Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom) Gap, where NATO monitors Russian naval movements in the North Atlantic.",
      "Greenland has large deposits of so-called rare earth minerals that are needed to make everything from computers and smartphones to the batteries, solar and wind technologies that will power the transition away from fossil fuels. The U.S. Geological Survey has also identified potential offshore deposits of oil and natural gas.",
      "Greenlanders are keen to develop the resources, but they have enacted strict rules to protect the environment. There are also questions about the feasibility of extracting Greenland\u2019s mineral wealth because of the region\u2019s harsh climate.",
      "Greenland\u2019s retreating ice cap is exposing the country\u2019s mineral wealth and melting sea ice is opening up the once mythical Northwest Passage through the Arctic.",
      "Greenland sits strategically along two potential routes through the Arctic, which would reduce shipping times between the North Atlantic and Pacific and bypass the bottlenecks of the Suez and Panama canals. While the routes aren\u2019t likely to be commercially viable for many years, they are attracting attention.",
      "In 2018, China declared itself a \u201cnear-Arctic state\u201d in an effort to gain more influence in the region. China has also announced plans to build a \u201cPolar Silk Road\u201d as part of its global Belt and Road Initiative, which has created economic links with countries around the world.",
      "Then U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected China\u2019s move, saying: \u201cDo we want the Arctic Ocean to transform into a new South China Sea, fraught with militarization and competing territorial claims?\u201d A Chinese backed rare earth mining project in Greenland stalled after the local government banned uranium mining in 2021.",
      "The legislation that extended self-government to Greenland in 2009 also recognized the country\u2019s right to independence under international law. Opinion polls show a majority of Greenlanders favor independence, though they differ on exactly when that should occur. The potential for independence raises questions about outside interference in Greenland that could threaten U.S. interests in the country."

      "BERLIN -- Flight cancellations at Hamburg Airport after a surprise strike by workers affected more than 40,000 passengers on Sunday, a day before a planned wider protest across Germany amid new contract negotiations.",
      "Only 10 of more than 280 scheduled flights went as planned early Sunday, the airport said. Many service desks sat empty as would-be passengers lined up to seek information about the cancellations. One big electronic departure board overhead had \u201ccanceled\u201d in red next to the list of all flights.",
      "The surprise walkout, which reportedly took place with only about a half-hour advance notice, came before a broader series of preannounced strikes across 13 airports in Germany on Monday, organized by the ver.di union.",
      "The union, whose members work in areas including passenger services and cargo and goods screening, called for Sunday's strike by security control staff to put pressure on company representatives amid collective bargaining talks.",
      "\u201cThe behavior of the trade union ver.di is dishonorable: The strike without notice hits Hamburg Airport at the start of the vacation season,\" airport spokeswoman Katja Bromm said in a statement. She said that on Monday, arrivals would be possible, and that \u201cconsiderable disruptions and cancellations\u201d were expected.",
      "Bromm said that Sunday's walkouts were \"excessive and unfair to tens of thousands of travelers who have nothing to do with the disputes.\u201d",

      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Praised by the ancient Greek giants Homer and Euripides for its superb quality nearly 3,000 years ago, Cyprus\u2019 Commandaria is the world\u2019s oldest recorded and named wine.",
      "Despite its rich heritage, the sweet wine has struggled to find its niche in the global market. Now a number of micro-wineries in this east Mediterranean island nation are reviving traditional wine-making techniques and giving Commandaria a chance at a long-awaited comeback.",
      "Makers hope to tap rich legends around the ruby red wine.",
      "It\u2019s said to have won the world's first known wine competition during the 13th century rule of French King Philippe Augustus. English King Richard the Lionheart is said to have served it to guests at his 1191 wedding in Cyprus. And 14th century Mayor of London Henry Picard reputedly indulged the leaders of England, France, Scotland, Denmark and Cyprus in the Feast of the Five Kings.",
      "The wine, known as \u201cnama\u201d in antiquity, was renamed by the medieval Knights Hospitaller, who set up headquarters during the Third Crusade at an estate known for its wine production that they named Grande Commanderie.",
      "The island\u2019s Orthodox Church later adopted Commandaria as its communion wine during Byzantine times.",
      "Production peaked when Venice ruled Cyprus in the 15th and 16th centuries and prized the wine for its sweetness and complex bouquet.",
      "Now bottles are sold for around 20 euros ($20) to up to 150.",
      "The wine's notes of honey, raisin, walnut, fig, carob, cinnamon, coffee and caramel are attributed to the island\u2019s rich volcanic soil, said Christakis Nicolaou, community leader of Zoopigi village, home to the Commandaria museum.",
      "Annual production of the wine in recent years hovered at around 200,000 bottles because demand tapered off, according to Savvas Constantinou, a beverage inspector with Cyprus\u2019 agriculture and environment ministry.",
      "One factor is the exclusion of some 800,000 Commandaria-loving Russian tourists as a result of sanctions imposed following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Constantinou said a bid to expand into the massive Chinese market made headway five years ago but wavered after producers couldn\u2019t meet demand.",
      "Wine expert Demetri Walters, who holds the prestigious title of Master of Wines, said Commandaria sales haven\u2019t gained much traction abroad primarily because of a lack of marketing. For instance, the island\u2019s main producer KEO have been slow to understand the potential of the wine, particularly their older vintages.",
      "\u201cA shame, as their Commandaria wines are very good,\u201d Walters told the Associated Press. \u201cThe unique and antique history, the extraordinary quality across the two styles and the terrific value for money...Everyone who tastes it for the first time with me is blown away by the complexity of the wine.\u201d",
      "Walters said although sweet wines are \u201cout of fashion\u201d except in the specialist trade, this is slowly changing for Commandaria. He said the wine was entered the UK market in recent years, but as a niche offering.",
      "Wineries such as Revecca in the mountain village of Ayios Mamas have found a steady domestic and foreign following, with sales on an upward swing since it opened in 2015.",
      "Its Commandaria last year won top prize at the national wine competition. The winery employs three people and produces 3,000 bottles a year.",
      "Winery curator Nikolas Christodoulides said he\u2019s experimenting with bespoke varieties catering to clients' tastes.",
      "\u201cOur focus is on improving quality rather than being fixated on quantity,\u201d Christodoulides said. The approach has worked for one Israeli couple who, according to Christodoulides, flies to Cyprus just to replenish their stock.",
      "Commandaria is made with dark Mavro and white Xynisteri grapes that are indigenous to Cyprus. They are left in the sunshine after harvest for seven to 12 days to bring out the distinctive sweetness.",
      "The wine is matured in reused oak barrels for at least two years in line with strict production laws to conform with the European Union\u2019s protected designation of origin. That means authentic Commandaria comes only from 14 villages on the southern face of the Troodos mountain range, where they\u2019re exposed to sunlight throughout the day.",
      "Some wineries produce a darker, sweeter version made strictly from the Mavro grapes. That version is preferred at the Karseras winery in the village of Doros, with an annual average production of 40 tons.",
      "Manager Philippos Karseras is encouraged by an upswing in domestic consumption, though it isn\u2019t quite enough to make up for the loss of the Russian market.",
      "But those running the Revecca winery believe that these small wineries will gradually win back consumers.",
      "\u201cWe have ensure the consistency of our product\u2019s quality first and win over the domestic market before we can make a collective push to market Commandaria abroad,\u201d Christodoulides said."

      "The whiplash actions from the White House on tariffs \u2014 first placing them  on trading partners and then exempting some  and then doing it again  \u2014 have raised uncertainty for businesses.",
      "That sparked fears businesses might freeze in response to what they have described as \u201cchaos\u201d and pull back on hiring. U.S. households, meanwhile, are bracing for higher inflation because of tariffs, which is weakening their confidence  and could hold back their spending. That would sap more energy from the economy.",
      "Trump said Friday he wants tariffs to bring jobs back to the United States, and he gave no indication more certainty is imminent for financial markets. \u201cThere will always be changes and adjustments,\u201d he said in comments from the Oval Office.",
      "On Wall Street, Walgreens Boots Alliance climbed 7.5% after the pharmacy and drug store chain agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners. The buyout would take the struggling chain private for the first time since 1927 and give it more flexibility to make changes to improve its business without worrying about Wall Street\u2019s reaction.",
      "In other dealings early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 38 cents to $66.66 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gave up 35 cents to $70.01 per barrel.",
      "The U.S. dollar slipped to 147.72 Japanese yen from 147.94 yen. The euro fell to $1.0831 from $1.0836."

      "Canada\u2019s governing Liberals are set to choose a replacement for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau",
      "TORONTO -- Canada's governing Liberals will announce a replacement for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday as the country deals with U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threats and as a federal election looms.",
      "Liberal Party members look set to pick former central bank governor Mark Carney as the new party leader and Canada's next prime minister in a vote to be announced on Sunday evening.",
      "Carney, 59, navigated crises when he was the head of the Bank of Canada and when in 2013 he became the first noncitizen to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. His appointment won bipartisan praise in the U.K. after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries.",
      "The opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged. Trudeau announced his resignation in January, but remains prime minister until a successor is chosen and sworn in. Election laws mandate a general election before the fall, but one is expected this spring.",
      "Trump\u2019s trade war and his talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, who are booing the American anthem at NHL and NBA games. Some are canceling trips south of the border, and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can.",
      "The surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered the Liberal Party\u2019s chances in a parliamentary election expected within days or weeks, and Liberal showings have been improving steadily in opinion polls.",
      "After decades of bilateral stability, the vote on Canada\u2019s next leader now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with the United States.",
      "Carney has picked up one endorsement after another from Cabinet ministers and members of Parliament since declaring his candidacy in January. He is a highly educated economist with Wall Street experience who has long been interested in entering politics and becoming prime minister, but he lacks political experience.",
      "The other top Liberal leadership candidate is former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland. Trudeau told Freeland in December that he no longer wanted her as finance minister, but that she could remain deputy prime minister and the point person for U.S.-Canada relations. Freeland resigned shortly after, releasing a scathing letter about the government that proved to be the last straw for Trudeau.",
      "The new leader is expected to trigger an election shortly afterward. Either the new Liberal party leader will call one, or the opposition parties in Parliament could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month."

      "After more than 12 hours of talks on Thursday, the 27 leaders signed off on a scheme that would ease budget restrictions for defense spending, funnel some of the EU\u2019s unused funds toward security priorities and provide 150 billion euros ($162 billion) in loans for military purchases.",

      "The three-year war in Ukraine was also top of the agenda, but no obvious short-term solutions were found to keep the country in the fight, after the U.S. halted military support and intelligence sharing. No new weapons were pledged, no ready cash identified.",

      "It estimates that around 650 billion euros ($702 billion) could be freed up that way, and could allow each country to spend at least 3% of their gross domestic product on defense. NATO\u2019s current guideline is that allies should spend at least 2%.",
      "Seven EU countries fall short of that figure, including heavyweights Italy and Spain.",
      "It remains to be seen whether countries that pledged to hit 2% more than a decade ago and still haven\u2019t are now willing, or even able, to dig deeper into their pockets.",

      "The Associated Press has found that the Trump administration has stalled at least $60 million in funding intended largely for affordable housing developments nationwide",
      "The Trump administration has stalled at least $60 million in funding intended largely for affordable housing developments nationwide, throwing hundreds of projects into a precarious limbo, according to information and documents obtained by The Associated Press",
      "The move is part of a flurry of funding freezes, staffing cuts and contract cancellations by the Trump administration at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, changes that have instilled widespread uncertainty in the affordable housing industry.",
      "The some $60 million is intended to go to small community development nonprofits in small grants. The money is often used as seed funding for affordable housing projects, turning a concept into a viable development and consequently drawing in more public and private investment.",
      "Congress chose three nonprofits to distribute the grants, but HUD said in letters that it was cancelling contracts with two of the organizations which together were to distribute the $60 million. That's pushed millions in funding already promised to small nonprofits, or yet to be awarded, into the twilight zone.",
      "\u201cMany of those organizations have already committed funds to pay workers, such as HVAC technicians, local contractors, homeownership counselors,\u201d said Shaun Donovan, CEO of Enterprise Community Partners, one of the two groups whose contract was cancelled.",
      "\u201cThey will have to stop that work immediately. That will cost local jobs, hobble the creation of affordable homes, and stall opportunity in hundreds of communities.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for HUD said the program, called Section 4, will continue and is not being cut, but that \u201cthe department is consolidating some grants, while others remain.\"",
      "It remains unclear how or when the funding will arrive to the small nonprofits, which has thrown their work into disarray.",
      "\u201cNot knowing for me means we assume that the money is not coming, and that means that I have to pivot,\" said Jonathan Green, executive director of a nonprofit in Mississippi that's building a 36-unit affordable housing development in Biloxi.",
      "Green said about $20,000 in grant dollars are now in limbo, money that was meant to pay for an environmental review that could cost upwards of $10,000, and licenses and permits. That threatens discussions Green is having with potential partners and investors who want to see all the up-front work done first.",
      "\u201cMy fear is that, if the project stops altogether, we may never get it started again,\u201d he said.",
      "The development is supposed to be in East Biloxi, where lots still remain empty after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Before an ounce of dirt has been moved on the project, Green's organization has received enough calls from people eager to become tenants that they\u2019ve started a waiting list.",
      "That's the position hundreds of other small nonprofits have found themselves in, with not just their grant funds in question but investments on the line. For every dollar in grants disbursed by Enterprise Community Partners, the local nonprofits leverage another $95 in other capital, CEO Donovan said.",
      "Congress gave the national nonprofits the job of administering the grants, fielding and assessing hundreds of applications, so that the government doesn\u2019t have to, Donovan said.",
      "In one of the contract termination letters obtained by the AP, HUD said the contracts were cancelled at the direction of the Department of Government Efficiency. It said the group's operations \u201cwere not in compliance\" with Trump's executive order targeting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The letter also allows the organizations to appeal the termination.",
      "The Local Initiatives Support Corporation is the other group whose contract was cancelled.",
      "\u201cWithout access to this seed capital, housing projects for hardworking, families will stall, worsening shortages and pushing distressed neighbors into overcrowded conditions or homelessness,\" it said in a statement.",
      "Habitat for Humanity International is the third nonprofit disbursing the grants, but the organization has not responded to repeated requests for comment or said if their contract was cancelled.",

    "story": [
      "A union representing Transportation Security Administration workers calls the Department of Homeland Security's decision to end the collective bargaining agreement with them an \u201cunprovoked attack.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security said Friday that it is ending the collective bargaining agreement with the tens of thousands of frontline employees at the Transportation Security Administration, marking a major effort to dismantle union protections under the Trump administration. The TSA union called it on \u201cunprovoked attack\u201d and vowed to fight it.",
      "The department, in a statement announcing the termination, criticized the union whose staffers are responsible for keeping weapons off airplanes and protecting air travel. The department said that poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job and that the agreement was hindering the ability of the organization \u201cto safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe\" \u2014 an assessment that faced immediate pushback from a top Democrat in Congress and the union.",
      "\u201cThis action will ensure Americans will have a more effective and modernized workforces across the nation\u2019s transportation networks,\" the agency said in a statement. \u201cTSA is renewing its commitment to providing a quick and secure travel process for Americans.\u201d",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees is the union representing the TSA workers. The federation and the TSA's then-administrator, David Pekoske, signed the collective bargaining agreement in May of last year. It came amid a push by Homeland Security to improve the pay for the frontline workers, whose pay has historically lagged behind that of other government employees. Pekoske has credited the pay increases, which went into effect in 2023, as helping to improve employee retention and morale, areas where TSA has had challenges.",
      "The union said in a statement that the order would strip collective bargaining rights from roughly 47,000 transportation security officers, or TSOs. Those are people responsible for staffing airports around the country and checking to make sure that hundreds of thousands of passengers a day do not carry any weapons or explosives into the secure areas of airports.",
      "The union said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump's administration were violating the right of staffers to join a union. It also said that the reasons the Republican administration had given for the decision \u2014 specifically the criticisms of union activity \u2014 were \u201ccompletely fabricated.\u201d",
      "Instead, the union said, the decision was retaliation for its wider efforts challenging a range of decisions taken by the Trump administration that have affected federal workers. AFGE represents roughly 800,000 federal government workers in Washington, D.C., and across the country, and it has been pushing back on many of the administration's actions such as firing probationary employees and cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "\u201cOur union has been out in front challenging this administration\u2019s unlawful actions targeting federal workers, both in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion,\" the union said. \u201cNow our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action.\u201d",
      "The decision to end the collective bargaining agreement comes after Trump's administration pushed out Pekoske the day Trump was sworn into office. The TSA does not currently have an administrator or a deputy administrator.",
      "In a note to staff, acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said Noem made the decision to rescind officers\u2019 collective bargaining rights to align with the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cvision of maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,\u201d Stahl wrote. \u201cThis determination is made with the TSO in mind, ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.\u201d",
      "Stahl said the agency \u201cwill establish alternative procedures\u201d to address employee concerns and grievances \u201cin a fair and transparent manner.\u201d",
      "The end of the collective bargaining agreement was immediately slammed by the top Democrat on the Homeland Security committee in Congress, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson of Mississippi, who praised the work of TSA staffers in protecting air travel.",
      "\u201cAttempting to negate their legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2014 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cSince the Biden Administration provided pay increases and a new collective bargaining contract to the workforce, TSA\u2019s attrition rates have plummeted.\u201d",
      "Thompson also criticized the Homeland Security press release, saying the department was using \u201cflat out wrong anti-union talking points.\u201d He said the real aim was \u201cdiminishing\u201d the workforce so \u201cthey can transform it in the mold of Project 2025.\u201d",
      "Project 2025 was the conservative governing blueprint that Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign was not part of his agenda. Project 2025 calls for immediately ending the TSA union and eventually privatizing the entire agency.",
      "The TSA was created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when hijackers smuggled knives and box cutters through security to use as weapons as they commandeered four airplanes and slammed them into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center towers and a Pennsylvania field. The TSA's mandate when it was created in November 2001 was to prevent a similar attack in the future.",
      "Air travel since then has undergone a massive overhaul, with passengers and their luggage going through extensive screening at the airport and passenger information generally uploaded to TSA in advance of travel to facilitate screening. Increasingly, the agency has also been using facial recognition technology to scan passengers at checkpoints, leading to criticism by some members of Congress.",

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Along with fulminating against the United States, China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi reasserted China\u2019s South China Sea claims, blasted Japan for its past aggression and covered a wide range of other issues during his annual meeting with the press. Here are some of the key topics covered during his Friday press conference.",
      "China has clashed frequently with the Philippines over ownership of and access to islands in the South China Sea, whose rich fishing grounds China claims virtually in its entirety. However, Wang was quick to place blame elsewhere, saying Manila was being manipulated by forces \u201coutside the region,\u201d its standard term for the U.S.",
      "Wang called the entire conflict a \u201cshadow play,\u201d saying an unidentified regional official had used the term at a recent meeting, and said each incident was a \u201cline of script\u201d disseminated by the foreign media with the goal of \u201csmearing China.\u201d",
      "\u201cChina will continue to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in accordance with the law. When managing Second Thomas Shoal and Scarborough Shoal, we will also reflect our humanitarian spirit according to actual needs. But I want to make it clear here that infringement and provocation will inevitably bear its own fruit, and those who are willing to be chess pieces will eventually be discarded.\u201d",
      "Wang also said that Chinese cooperation with its neighbors had eliminated many of the compounds where Chinese nationals, many of them coerced or lured by false promises of legitimate jobs, are forced to contact people in China in a bid to extract money from them through false claims of debts owed or other illegal means.",
      "\u201cAll the cyber fraud parks in northern Myanmar near the border have been cleared. China, Thailand, Myanmar and Laos are working together to crack down on cyber fraud in the Thai-Myanmar border area. Our mission is to cut off the evil hands reaching out to the people and eradicate the cancer of online cyber fraud,\u201d Wang said.",
      "Such operations, usually linked to organized crime, are notoriously quick to resume operations elsewhere. China has been battling the issue for years as the gangs grown increasingly sophisticated in their access to victims' private information. Hundreds of citizens from other countries have also been caught up in such fraudulent schemes targeting victims as far away as the United States.",
      "Wang referred to the upcoming 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, saying \u201cthere are still some people in Japan who have not reflected on their mistakes.\u201d China's education and propaganda systems keep alive memories of Japan's brutal invasion and occupation of much of China before and during the war and anti-Japanese consumer boycotts and other protests pop-up over perceived slights.",
      "Wang also linked the issue to Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that was a Japanese colony until the end of the war and which maintains close ties to Japan to this day. China claims the island as its own territory and has threatened to take control by force if necessary. Wang said \u201cit is better to remember that if Taiwan causes trouble, it is to cause trouble for Japan.\u201d",
      "China also claims uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that are controlled by Japan, and regularly sends ships and planes into areas surrounding them, much as it does with Taiwan. That prompts Japan to scramble jets to defend what it says are islands legitimately absorbed before World War II because no other nation had a legal claim to them. That too has proved a source of tension in the region and a space where China can challenge the authority of the U.S. and its allies.",
      "Wand touted China as \u201cthe center of stability in Asia, an engine of economic development and a support for regional security,\u201d while blasting the U.S. for basing intermediate-range missiles around China and having \u201cdone nothing but stir up trouble and create divisions.\u201d China advocates \u201copen regionalism and share Asia\u2019s development opportunities on the basis of mutual respect, mutual benefit and win-win results.\u201d",
      "Wang said \u201cif every country stresses my country first and is obsessed with a position of strength, the law of the jungle would reign (across) the world again.\u201d While China has been the subject of suspicion and concern from the Indian Ocean to northern Japan, the South Pacific has lately emerged as a major area of competition between China on one side and the U.S., Australia and New Zealand on the other.",
      "China\u2019s secret security agreements and promises of infrastructure have prompted the three to tighten relations in recognition of the islands\u2019 strategic geographic location after years of what some have described as neglect. However, a U.S. cutoff in aid, along with generous Chinese incentives, could further push them into Beijing\u2019s arms. Three of these \u2014 Tuvalu, Palau and the Marshall Islands are also among Taiwan\u2019s handful of formal diplomatic allies.",

      "Economists had forecast that exports would rise 5% year-on-year and that imports would edge higher. China\u2019s overall trade surplus grew to $170.52 billion in the first two months of the year.",
      "China\u2019s customs agency typically publishes combined trade data for January and February to avoid any distortion from slowdowns during the week-long Lunar New Year holidays.",
      "\u201cExport growth cooled over the first two months of 2025, with tariff front-running providing less of a boost to demand than we had anticipated,\u201d said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics.",
      "\u201cThis slowdown comes before any substantial hit from tariffs, which will almost certainly lead to sharp falls in shipments to the U.S. before long,\u201d he said.",
      "Evans-Pritchard said that the slowdown in imports suggests that the pick up in demand driven by government stimulus spending late last year has \u201calready partially reversed.\u201d",
      "This week, U.S. President Donald Trump's second of two 10% hikes in tariffs on imports from China took effect and that is likely to hurt Chinese exports in coming months.",
      "To a certain extent, buyers and Chinese suppliers had rushed to beat those increases in import duties.",
      "Chinese officials have slammed the tariff increases but also expressed confidence that the economy is resilient and that trade with other countries can help compensate for any declines in exports to the U.S. after the tariffs took effect. They have also said they are open to talks on a mutually respectful basis.",
      "Last year, exports helped China attain its target economic growth rate of 5%. The government again has set the target for around 5%, despite uncertainties over the outlook for trade this year.",
      "Exports to the U.S. grew 2.3% in annual terms in January-February, while shipments to the European Union and Japan grew just 0.6% and 0.7% respectively. Exports to Russia fell 10.9%.",
      "The Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) remained China's biggest trading partner, with shipments growing 5.7% year-on-year.",
      "\u201cWhile we don't read too much into a few months of data, the breakdown does pose questions about how export trends might look once tariffs start to drag on the U.S., too,\u201d Lynn Song of ING Economics said in a report.",
      "\u201cWith tariffs coming into effect in February and March, it's likely that the impact will be seen gradually in the coming months,\u201d she said."

      "Every year, bills are introduced in state legislatures across the country seeking to end the changing of clocks twice a year",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Looking forward to more evening sunlight thanks to daylight saving time this weekend?",
      "Many in the golf industry like the time change, too, and they are pushing to make that annual switch permanent.",
      "The move is intended to encourage more evening golf and to stave off efforts to establish permanent standard time, which would leave less time for an evening on the links. And it is those late afternoon players who tend to buy food and drinks in the clubhouse.",
      "\u201cWe would lose 100 tee times a day if daylight saving time goes away,\u201d said Connor Farrell, general manager of Stone Creek Golf Course in Omaha, Nebraska. \u201cSwitching to permanent standard time would cost us $500,000 a year.\"",
      "Golf has deep roots in the history of daylight saving time, which begins for most states at 2 a.m. Sunday when clocks \u201cspring forward\u201d by one hour. Some credit goes to William Willett, a British builder and avid golfer who in 1905 published a pamphlet advocating for moving clocks ahead in April and returning them back to their regular settings in September. The U.S. adopted a version of that during World War I and again in World War II.",
      "Congress passed the Uniform Time Act in 1966 that set up the biannual time change, and lobbying efforts by the golf industry are largely credited for Congress expanding daylight saving time by a month in the mid-1980s.",
      "But for as long as it has been around, the constant clock adjusting has drawn the ire of Americans weary of losing an hour of sleep in the spring only to be faced with the early onset of darkness in the fall. That exhaustion has led to hundreds of bills introduced in nearly every state over the years to halt the practice.",
      "The National Conference of State Legislatures reports that in the last six years, 20 states have passed measures calling for a switch to year-round daylight saving time, many at the cajoling of golf industry lobbyists. But while states could switch to permanent standard time \u2014 as Arizona and Hawaii have done \u2014 Congress would need to change the law to allow permanent daylight saving time.",
      "That hindrance \u2014 along with arguments that permanent standard time would improve sleep quality and foster safer morning commutes \u2014 has seen more states consider opting out of daylight saving time. Lawmakers in more than a dozen states have introduced bills this year to make standard time permanent.",
      "Nebraska is among several states considering competing bills to make either standard time or daylight saving time permanent. That drew Joe Kohout, a lobbyist for the Nebraska Golf Alliance, to testify in favor of year-round daylight saving time.",
      "Late afternoon golf leagues account for up to 40% of the annual revenue of some Nebraska courses, Kohout said, while a majority of golf instructors reported that nearly 50% of their lessons are taught after 4 p.m.",
      "Under permanent standard time, \u201cNebraska\u2019s golf courses will lose revenue, be forced to raise prices, and in some cases could be driven out of business,\u201d he said.",
      "The Utah Golf Association is also fighting a bill to make standard time permanent.",
      "\u201cThe argument that changing clocks twice a year is an inconvenience does not outweigh the year-round benefits of having more usable daylight hours in the evenings,\u201d it posted on social media.",
      "In Indiana, golf course owner Linda Rogers succeeded in lobbying the Legislature to institute daylight saving time in 2006. Now a state senator, Rogers is fighting an effort to return to permanent standard time.",
      "\u201cDaylight savings time allows someone that, you know, worked until 5 o\u2019clock to come out and still play at least nine holes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just golf. There are so many outdoor activities that people want to be outside for and enjoy later in the summertime.\u201d",
      "The National Golf Course Owners Association, which has about 4,000 members, recently polled stakeholders on the matter. The vast majority favored either permanent daylight saving time or the status quo of changing the clocks, said CEO Jay Karen. Only about 6% backed a change to permanent standard time.",
      "\u201cIf standard time was to be made permanent, thousands of courses would be harmed by that,\u201d Karen said.",
      "Even so, Karen's group is not advocating for a change to permanent daylight saving because it could hurt hundreds of courses that cater to early morning golfers, he said. Those include courses in retirement communities, vacation resorts where late tee times interfere with dinner plans and Sun Belt courses where extreme late-day heat sees golfers favoring early tee times.",
      "\u201cWe feel like status quo is no harm, no foul,\u201d Karen said.",
      "Republican Iowa state Rep. John Wills introduced a bill this year to make the change to permanent daylight savings. But he has been under pressure to amend the bill to permanent standard time.",
      "Wills was considering it until he heard arguments on how that change could affect golf.",
      "\u2019\u201cI think I might push back in the future and say, you know, the golf industry needs this,\u201d he said."

      "Cadillac's Formula 1 team received official approval Friday to join the grid in 2026 and its owners insist the team will be ready to compete.",
      "Although the grid expansion was approved last November, it was not until Friday that governing body FIA and Formula One Management said the Cadillac F1 effort meets all the requirements to become the 11th team in the series next season.",
      "\u201cI am proud to lead the Federation in this progressive step for the championship,\u201d FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem said in a statement, who called adding an 11th team \u201ca milestone\u201d and a \u201ctransformative moment.\u201d",
      "\u201cGM/Cadillac brings fresh energy, aligning with the new FIA 2026 regulations and ushering in an exciting era for the sport.\u201d",
      "The team is owned by General Motors and TWG Motorsports, an arm of the larger TWG Global group owned by co-chairs Mark Walter and Thomas Tull. TWG Global has controlling interest in the Los Angeles Dodgers, Premier League club Chelsea, the Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League, as well as stakes in the Los Angeles Lakers and other ventures.",
      "TWG Motorsports is also the majority owner of Andretti Global, which competes in IndyCar, Indy NXT and Formula E; NASCAR team Spire Motorsports; the two-car IMSA sports car GTP program fielded by Wayne Taylor Racing; and a stake in Walkinshaw Andretti United, the Bathurst 1000-winning race team competing in Australia\u2019s Supercars Championship.",
      "\u201cThe Cadillac Formula 1 Team\u2019s presence in the paddock will inspire future competitors and fans,\" said Stefano Domenicali, President and CEO of Formula 1. \u201cTheir entry strengthens our mission to push motorsport\u2019s boundaries at the highest level. As we said in November, the commitment by General Motors to bring a Cadillac team to Formula 1 was an important and positive demonstration of the evolution of our sport.\u201d",
      "Cadillac F1 will be the second American-owned team on the grid, joining Haas F1, which is owned by California businessman Gene Haas. The Haas program does not have an American driver or a partnership with an American manufacturer, but it is sponsored by MoneyGram.",
      "Cadillac F1 anticipates being distinctively American with its partnership with General Motors and the possibility of IndyCar driver Colton Herta, a California native, in the two-car lineup. It comes at a time when F1 has three races in the United States \u2014 in Miami, Austin, Texas, and Las Vegas \u2014 and teams are battling for sponsorship from American companies as the global series gains popularity in the U.S.",
      "It took more than four years to get the project approved by FOM, despite the backing of the FIA and Ben Sulayem. At issue was an apparent breakdown in any relationship between F1 and Michael Andretti, who spent part of one season as an F1 driver and has never been warmly embraced in the European series.",
      "But Andretti sold controlling interest of his motorsports ventures to Dan Towriss late last year and is no longer involved in the project. That helped TWG and Cadillac get the F1 bid approved.",
      "\u201cFor the past years, we have worked hand in hand with GM, to lay a robust foundation for an extraordinary F1 entry,\u201d said Towriss, CEO of TWG Motorsports. \u201cNow, with 2026 in our sights, we\u2019re accelerating our efforts \u2014 expanding our facilities, refining cutting-edge technologies and continuing to assemble top-tier talent.\u201d",
      "Cadillac's powertrains will not be ready for some time and the team will lease engines from Ferrari until General Motors has a product ready to compete. The powertrains will be built in a facility on the North Carolina campus of Hendrick Motorsports in Concord, while the F1 program will be run from a new facility being built in Indiana and a second factory in Silverstone, England.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled the Cadillac Formula 1 Team is official, as the team has been accelerating its work,\u201d General Motors President Mark Reuss said. \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly grateful for the support from the FIA and Formula 1 leadership for us and for our partners at TWG. The excitement only grows as we get closer to showcasing GM\u2019s engineering expertise on the prestigious global stage of F1.\u201d",
      "Towriss told The Associated Press that Cadillac F1 already has a 2026 car built that has been to the wind tunnel and work continues at a rapid pace. The team is also hiring at a head-spinning rate with motorsports and Formula 1 team executive Graeme Lowdon named team principal, and industry veteran Russ O\u2019Blenes named CEO of TWG GM Performance Power Units \u2014 a new company that aims to make Cadillac a full-works team that builds both the chassis and power units.",
      "TWG Motorsports has more than 300 employees working on aerodynamics, chassis and component development, as well as software and vehicle dynamics simulation.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more proud of the effort put in by the entire Cadillac Formula 1 Team. This announcement is the next step in getting on the grid and continues our efforts towards building a full-works team,\" Lowdown said. \"Through the long and thorough application process, we have never lost pace in our planning or our belief in the mission. We can\u2019t wait to go racing and give fans a new team to cheer for.\u201d",
      "Towriss will not tip his hand at a possible driver lineup, but those mentioned for the two seats include Herta, who must finish fourth or higher in the IndyCar standings this season to earn the Super License required to compete in F1. Herta last weekend surprised many when he said he wasn't even sure he wanted the seat.",
      "Other drivers mentioned as candidates for the second seat are Sergio Perez, Valtteri Bottas and Zhou Guanyu, all of whom were on the F1 grid last season but don\u2019t have seats for 2025.",

    "story": [
      "Democrats are hopeful that their party's road to recovery lies in the price of eggs",
      "NEW YORK -- As their party struggles to navigate the early days of Donald Trump's second presidency, some Democrats are convinced that their road to recovery lies in the price of eggs.",
      "Instead of leaning into Trump's teardown of the federal government or his alliance with billionaire lieutenant Elon Musk, they're steering to what they perceive as the everyday concerns of Americans \u2014 none more important than grocery prices and eggs in particular.",
      "U.S. egg prices hit a record average of $4.95 per dozen in January, surpassing a previous record set in January 2023, according to federal data. In some parts of the country, they\u2019re much higher. A Safeway supermarket in San Francisco was selling a dozen eggs for $10.99 this week.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture expects egg prices to rise 41% this year. Already, some restaurants are adding temporary surcharges when customers order eggs. Denny\u2019s said its surcharge varies by region and even by restaurant, while Waffle House added a 50-cent surcharge per egg at all its restaurants.",
      "The Democratic establishment\u2019s focus on blaming Trump for those price spikes represents a stark break from its activists, who have launched a protest movement arguing that Trump is a budding dictator with no regard for the Constitution.",
      "Such concerns may be valid, some Democratic members of Congress say, but they don't resonate with working-class Americans trying to feed their families.",
      "\u201cWhen that is your day-to-day worry, the philosophical conversations about a constitutional crisis or the democracy is simply not a luxury you can afford,\u201d Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet, D-Mich. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we shouldn\u2019t worry about those things, because we should and they are important, but they are not primary in the minds of the people in Saginaw, Michigan.\u201d",
      "The message underscores the Democratic ecosystem's broad acknowledgment that the party must make changes to win back the hearts and minds of voters worried about the economy, who shifted toward Trump's GOP last fall and gave Republicans control of the White House and both chambers of Congress.",
      "It\u2019s unclear, however, whether the Democrats\u2019 newfound focus will do much in the short term to stop Trump\u2019s sweeping campaign to consolidate power in Washington or if it can harness the energy of the party\u2019s progressive base, which wants new and creative solutions to address what they view as an existential threat.",
      "Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin, whose organization helped coordinate a nationwide protest movement that put House Republicans on defense, called the Democrats\u2019 focus on eggs \u201ca communications strategy built for a 1990s policy fight.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re looking at polls that say inflation is unpopular, and they think Dems can win people with boring, tired talking points,\u201d Levin said. \u201cBut it\u2019s 2025 \u2014 this isn\u2019t how politics works anymore. And their failure to update their approach to creeping authoritarianism is a simple failure of leadership.\u201d",
      "The Democratic establishment's new approach echoed across Washington this week after Trump delivered a 99-minute speech to a joint session of Congress. Trump defended the tariffs he has threatened to impose on America\u2019s trading partners. A trade war could boost prices further on everything from fruits and vegetables to cellphones, lumber and cars.",
      "In the opening hours of Trump's presidency, the Democratic National Committee issued talking points encouraging allies to talk about \u201cTrump's plans to screw over America\u201d and highlight Trump's alliances with Musk and other tech billionaires.",
      "The DNC's talking points sounded different after Tuesday's speech.",
      "\u201cWe saw Trump ramble on about invading Greenland and planting the American flag on Mars, but what we didn\u2019t hear was a plan to lower costs and address Americans\u2019 anxiety about the looming economic disaster he\u2019s driving us toward,\u201d read the DNC talking points. \"Consumer confidence has fallen sharply, everyday costs are skyrocketing, and congressional Republicans are pushing deeply unpopular tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy.\u201d",
      "At the same time, Democratic officials shared new internal data Thursday that they say indicates inflation and the cost of living are voters\u2019 top priority. Democracy, by contrast, ranked No. 12.",
      "Public polling goes further.",
      "A Washington Post/Ipsos poll found that one month into the new administration, U.S. adults remain almost universally unhappy about the cost of groceries. According to the survey, about 9 in 10 Americans say that food prices are \u201cnot so good\u201d or \u201cpoor,\u201d including about half who say they\u2019re \u201cpoor.\u201d And a CNN/SSRS poll conducted in mid-February found that about 6 in 10 Americans said Trump had \u201cnot gone far enough\u201d in trying to reduce the price of everyday goods.",
      "But the party is hardly united on the new approach.",
      "Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, was ejected from the House chamber during Trump's speech and eventually censured for refusing to stop shouting his concerns about potential Medicaid cuts. Other Democrats silently waved small signs that read \u201cMusk steals,\u201d \u201cSave Medicaid\u201d and \u201cLies.\u201d Still others skipped the speech altogether in protest.",
      "In this week's speech, Trump blamed the surge on his Democratic predecessor.",
      "\u201cJoe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control \u2014 the egg prices out of control. We're working hard to get it back down,\" Trump charged as Democrats in the chamber booed.",
      "The industry and most experts agree that the ongoing bird flu outbreak is the main reason egg prices are setting records, although some question whether egg producers are inflating prices to boost profits.",
      "As further evidence that Trump's team is aware that the situation is becoming a political liability, Musk used his social media platform on Thursday to cast more blame on Biden.",
      "\u201cThere was an insane slaughter of 150 million egg-laying chickens ordered by the Biden administration,\u201d Musk wrote on X, neglecting to mention the millions of egg-laying chickens killed since Trump took office.",
      "Indeed, as of Thursday afternoon, 27,116,857 birds have been killed since Trump returned to the White House to limit the spread of bird flu. That\u2019s because the federal government\u2019s longstanding policy requires farmers to kill their entire flocks anytime a bird gets sick to help limit the spread of the virus.",
      "Overall, more than 166 million birds \u2014 most of them egg-laying chickens \u2014 have been slaughtered since the outbreak began in 2022.",
      "The Trump administration did unveil a plan to combat bird flu to help ease egg prices. But the impact is hard to predict given that the $1 billion plan isn\u2019t a drastic departure from the previous policy.",
      "Specifically, Trump's plan doesn\u2019t change the USDA\u2019s longstanding policy of slaughtering flocks when a sick bird is found. Instead, the plan focuses on helping farmers adopt the most effective biosecurity measures to keep the virus out and explores the prospects for a bird flu vaccine, among other moves.",
      "Rep. Josh Riley, D-N.Y., who recently confronted a bird flu outbreak in his upstate district, said almost every conversation he has with constituents centers on rising prices, especially eggs. He made a direct link between concerns about the economy and democracy.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about our democracy ... that\u2019s more of a reason to be worried about the price of eggs,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThe reason our democracy is in the situation is in, the reason our country is in the situation it\u2019s in, is because for decades, politicians have neglected the needs of everyday working people.\u201d",
      "He continued: \u201cIs it any wonder, after 40 years of shipping jobs overseas just to make Wall Street rich, after three years of egg prices skyrocketing and nobody around this place doing a goddamn thing about it, that people are really, really frustrated and believe that our democracy does not work for them? Can you blame them?\u201d",

      "That's the dilemma facing F1's team principals as sweeping regulation changes for 2026 threaten to upend the competitive order.",
      "\u201cWhoever continues to develop will probably win the championship, but you\u2019ll pay the price in 2026,\u201d Mercedes driver George Russell said Tuesday.",
      "An F1 title fight can often come down to developing and refining a car throughout the year. Mid-season upgrades were crucial to McLaren winning the constructors' title for the first time in 26 years in 2024, while Red Bull's late tweaks helped Max Verstappen defend his drivers' title.",
      "The problem is that teams that start 2025 poorly could choose to abandon development work on the current car and focus all energy on next year, which brings sweeping changes to cars and engines alike.",
      "A head start could yield big gains for years to come.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very, very busy year for us,\u201d said Red Bull team principal Christian Horner, who is balancing Verstappen's bid for a fifth consecutive title in 2025, the team's 2026 project, and a new Ford engine for next year. F1's spending cap means \u201cit\u2019s the same money for everybody, but you will apply your resource accordingly,\u201d Horner said.",
      "Red Bull was the undisputed winner the last time there was a big regulation change, even though it had just won the drivers' title with Verstappen.",
      "Red Bull's 2022 car embraced ground-effect aerodynamics far better than the opposition, and especially its 2021 title rival Mercedes, whose design was visually striking but way off the pace. Red Bull has won 47 races since then, Mercedes just five.",
      "Even the standings enforce future suffering as the price for present success. The worst-performing teams are allowed extra time to develop aerodynamics in vast and costly wind tunnels. The champion gets the least.",
      "Red Bull was third in the constructors' standings last season, largely because of Sergio Perez's run of poor form, so it gets a little more wind tunnel time this season than McLaren or Ferrari.",
      "\u201cParticularly in a regulation change, that\u2019s always going to be quite useful,\u201d Horner said.",
      "Several ambitious teams have little to lose from gambling on 2026.",
      "Williams driver Alex Albon said Red Bull's advantage last time explains why he's already testing out ideas for 2026.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s taken until now for teams to catch up, finally. It just shows you the importance of getting a head start at the very beginning, and I think that\u2019s why you\u2019re going to see this awkward year,\u201d Albon said.",
      "\u201cIn the simulator, what we\u2019re doing, there\u2019s already a focus into next year. It seems crazy to say it when we haven\u2019t even turned a wheel yet in this year\u2019s competition.\u201d",
      "Aston Martin has signed star car designer Adrian Newey, who developed Red Bull\u2019s dominant car the last time the rules changed. Newey joins next month with a focus on 2026 and the team has invested heavily to transform its factory.",
      "Sauber is in what driver Nico H\u00fclkenberg called a \u201cbuilding year\u201d before rebranding as Audi and General Motors is creating a team from scratch under the Cadillac brand for 2026.",

      "A group of Ukrainian war veteran amputees have been in Oregon learning a form of adaptive skiing for people with one leg",
      "HOODOO SKI AREA, Ore. -- Ukrainian war veteran Oleksandr Shvachka lost his left leg to Russian tank fire outside Kyiv. Three years on, the latest step in his physical and mental rehabilitation recently unfolded under a brilliant blue sky on a snow-covered mountain more than 5,000 miles (8,047 kilometers) away.",
      "Shvachka, 38, was one of five Ukrainian veterans who came to the Pacific Northwest for ski lessons this month with Oregon Adaptive Sports, an organization working to make sports more accessible to people with disabilities.",
      "On a recent day, he listened attentively to an instructor before launching himself down a slope at Hoodoo Ski Area in central Oregon, leaning on two hand-held \u201coutriggers,\u201d which resemble forearm crutches with short skis at the ends, for turns and balance as he picked up speed.",
      "Shvachka was wounded in the village of Makariv outside the capital of Kyiv in March 2022, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine the previous month. He said skiing on the mountain was an \u201camazing emotion.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a new experience, and I\u2019m so happy,\u201d he said.",
      "The Oregon city of Corvallis has been sister cities with Uzhhorod in western Ukraine for over 30 years. Its sister city association is hosting the veterans, some of whom have been recovering in Uzhhorod\u2019s rehabilitation hospital, as well as two Ukrainian ski coaches, association co-founder Carol Paulson said.",
      "The ski program's goal is to improve the veterans\u2019 physical and mental health and teach the Ukrainian ski coaches how to use adaptive ski equipment so they can share that knowledge with the war-torn country\u2019s thousands of amputees. The group had four days of lessons over the course of two weeks.",
      "\u201cIt reminds them that they can participate fully in life,\u201d Paulson said. \u201cThe best thing is the feeling that they get not only of independence, but just of well-being.\u201d",
      "In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Paulson taught adaptive skiing to Vietnam War veterans who had lost limbs. She saw how being active on the mountain improved their mood and wanted to offer the same experience to Ukrainian war veterans.",
      "\u201cThe peacefulness of skiing compared to other sports, too, is special,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet. You have the pristine snow and the breeze of the wind.\u201d",
      "For Shvachka, adaptive sports have been key in his physical and mental rehabilitation, while the other veterans provide motivation, he said.",
      "In 2023, with his prosthetic leg, Schvachka ran a 10K race organized by the U.S. Marine Corps in Washington, D.C., and competed with other Ukrainian veteran amputees in Arnold Classic Europe, an offshoot of a fitness and body-building competition founded by Arnold Schwarzenegger.",
      "In that multi-sport event, a group of eight veterans used ropes to pull four semitruck cabs weighing 35 tons (31.7 metric tons) over 65 feet (20 meters) in a little more than 30 seconds, according to the event's Instagram page, which described it as a strongman world record.",
      "Pat Addabbo, executive director of Oregon Adaptive Sports, said the ski lessons highlight the transformative power of sport.",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing here today is a great example of that \u2014 people from across the world, coming to our little ski area here in Oregon, to learn these life-changing skills that they hopefully can take home with them and teach others,\" Addabbo said.",
      "The Ukrainian veterans and ski instructors will take outriggers with them back to Ukraine so they can start teaching three-track skiing using one full-size ski and two outriggers to others who have lost limbs.",
      "\u201cI think we are starting a new era of our war veteran rehabilitation program,\u201d said Kristian Minai, one of the Ukrainian instructors.",
      "Minai also coaches Ukraine's national deaf ski team and is working on developing a national Paralympics ski team.",
      "\u201cMaybe, some day, we will see them from the podium in the Paralympic Games,\" he added with a smile."

      "Nissan Motor Corp. recently showcased its driverless technology on city streets in Yokohama",
      "YOKOHAMA, Japan -- The van makes its way slowly but surely through the city streets, braking gently when a car swerves into its lane. But its steering wheel is turning on its own, and there's no one in the driver\u2019s seat.",
      "The driverless technology from Nissan Motor Corp., which uses 14 cameras, nine radars and six LiDar sensors installed in and around the vehicle, highlights Japan's eagerness to catch up with players like Google\u2019s Waymo that have taken the lead in the U.S.",
      "Japan, home to the world\u2019s top automakers, has not kept pace with the global shift to autonomous driving, so far led by China and the U.S. But momentum is building.",
      "Waymo is going to land in Japan this year. Details haven't been disclosed, but it has a partnership with major cab company Nihon Kotsu, which will oversee and manage their all-electric Jaguar I-PACE sport-utility vehicles, first in the Tokyo area, still with a human cab driver riding along.",
      "During Nissan's demonstration, the streets were bustling with other cars and pedestrians. The vehicle stayed within the maximum speed limit in the area of 40 kph (25 mph), its destination set with a smartphone app.",
      "Takeshi Kimura, the Mobility and AI Laboratory engineer at Nissan, insists an automaker is more adept at integrating self-driving technology with the overall workings of a car \u2014 simply because it knows cars better.",
      "\u201cHow the sensors must be adapted to the car\u2019s movements, or to monitor sensors and computers to ensure reliability and safety requires an understanding of the auto system overall,\u201d he said during a recent demonstration that took reporters on a brief ride.",
      "Nissan\u2019s technology, being tested on its Serena minivan, is still technically at the industry's Level Two because a person sits before a remote-control panel in a separate location outside the vehicle, in this case, at the automaker's headquarters, and is ready to step in if the technology fails.",
      "Nissan also has a human sitting in the front passenger seat during the test rides, who can take over the driving, if needed. Unless there is a problem, the people in the remote control room and the passenger seat are doing nothing.",
      "Nissan plans to have 20 such vehicles moving in the Yokohama area in the next couple of years, with the plan to reach Level Four, which means no human involvement even as backup, by 2029 or 2030.",
      "Autonomous vehicles can serve a real need given the nation\u2019s shrinking population, including a shortage of drivers.",
      "Other companies are working on the technology in Japan, including startups like Tier IV, which is pushing an open source collaboration on autonomous driving technology.",
      "So far, Japan has approved the use of so-called Level Four autonomous vehicles in a rural area in Fukui Prefecture, but those look more like golf carts. A Level Four bus is scuttling around a limited area near Tokyo\u2019s Haneda airport. But its maximum speed is 12 kmph (7.5 mph). Nissan's autonomous vehicle is a real car, capable of all its mechanical workings and speed levels.",
      "Toyota Motor Corp. recently showed its very own \u201ccity\u201d or living area for its workers and partnering startups, near Mount Fuji, being built especially to test various technology, including autonomous driving.",
      "Progress has been cautious.",
      "University of Tokyo Professor Takeo Igarashi, who specializes in computer and information technology, believes challenges remain because it\u2019s human nature to be more alarmed by accidents with driverless vehicles than regular crashes.",
      "\u201cIn human driving, the driver takes responsibility. It\u2019s so clear. But nobody is driving so you don\u2019t know who will take responsibility,\u201d Igarashi told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIn Japan, the expectation for commercial services is very high. The customer expects perfect quality for any service \u2014 restaurants or drivers or anything. This kind of auto-driving is a service form a company, and everybody expects high quality and perfection. Even a small mistake is not acceptable.\u201d",
      "Nissan says its technology is safe. After all, a human can\u2019t be looking at the front, the back and all around at the same time. But the driverless car can, with all its sensors.",
      "When a system failure happened during the recent demonstration, the car just came to a stop and all was well.",
      "Phil Koopman, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, believes the autonomous vehicle industry is just getting started.",
      "The main problem is what\u2019s known as \u201cedge cases,\u201d those rare but dangerous situations that the machine has not yet been taught to respond to. Using autonomous fleets of a significant size for some time is needed for such edge cases to be learned, he said.",
      "\u201cWe will see each city require special engineering efforts and the creation of a special remote support center. This will be a city-by-city deployment for many years,\u201d said Koopman.",

      "WASHINGTON -- America's butterflies are disappearing because of insecticides, climate change and habitat loss, with the number of the winged beauties down 22% since 2000, a new study finds.",
      "The first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday's journal Science.",
      "\u201cButterflies have been declining the last 20 years,\u201d said study co-author Nick Haddad, an entomologist at Michigan State University. \u201cAnd we don't see any sign that that's going to end.\"",
      "A team of scientists combined 76,957 surveys from 35 monitoring programs and blended them for an apples-to-apples comparison and ended up counting 12.6 million butterflies over the decades. Last month an annual survey that looked just at monarch butterflies, which federal officials plan to put on the threatened species list, counted a nearly all-time low of fewer than 10,000, down from 1.2 million in 1997.",
      "Many of the species in decline fell by 40% or more.",
      "David Wagner, a University of Connecticut entomologist who wasn't part of the study, praised its scope. And he said while the annual rate of decline may not sound significant, it is \u201ccatastrophic and saddening\u201d when compounded over time.",
      "\u201cIn just 30 or 40 years we are talking about losing half the butterflies (and other insect life) over a continent!\u201d Wagner said in an email. \"The tree of life is being denuded at unprecedented rates.\u201d",
      "The United States has 650 butterfly species, but 96 species were so sparse they didn't show up in the data and another 212 species weren't found in sufficient number to calculate trends, said study lead author Collin Edwards, an ecologist and data scientist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "\u201cI'm probably most worried about the species that couldn't even be included in the analyses\u201d because they were so rare, said University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Karen Oberhauser, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Haddad, who specializes in rare butterflies, said in recent years he has seen just two endangered St. Francis Satyr butterflies \u2014 which only live on a bomb range at Fort Bragg in North Carolina \u2014 \u201cso it could be extinct.\u201d",
      "Some well-known species had large drops. The red admiral, which is so calm it lands on people, is down 44% and the American lady butterfly, with two large eyespots on its back wings, decreased by 58%, Edwards said.",
      "Even the invasive white cabbage butterfly, \u201ca species that is well adapted to invade the world,\" according to Haddad, fell by 50%.",
      "\"How can that be?\u201d Haddad wondered.",
      "Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal said he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.",
      "\u201cThe loss of butterflies, parrots and porpoises is undoubtedly a bad sign for us, the ecosystems we need and the nature we enjoy,\u201d Agrawal, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email. \u201cThey are telling us that our continent's health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature's beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species. They have something to teach us.\u201d",
      "Oberhauser said butterflies connect people with nature and that \u201ccalms us down, makes us healthier and happier and promotes learning.\u201d",
      "What's happening to butterflies in the United States is probably happening to other, less-studied insects across the continent and world, Wagner said. He said not only is this the most comprehensive butterfly study, but the most data-rich for any insect.",
      "Butterflies are also pollinators, though not as prominent as bees, and are a major source of pollination of the Texas cotton crop, Haddad said.",
      "The biggest decrease in butterflies was in the Southwest \u2014 Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma \u2014 where the number of butterflies dropped by more than half in the 20 years.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the butterflies that are in dry and warm areas are doing particularly poorly,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAnd that kind of captures a lot of the Southwest.\u201d",
      "Edwards said when they looked at butterfly species that lived both in the hotter South and cooler North, the ones that did better were in the cooler areas.",
      "Climate change, habitat loss and insecticides tend to work together to weaken butterfly populations, Edwards and Haddad said. Of the three, it seems that insecticides are the biggest cause, based on previous research from the U.S. Midwest, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cIt makes sense because insecticide use has changed in dramatic ways in the time since our study started,\u201d Haddad said.",
      "Habitats can be restored and so can butterflies, so there's hope, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cYou can make changes in your backyard and in your neighborhood and in your state,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cThat could really improve the situation for a lot of species.\u201d",

It's also been a key technique in improving popular AI tools like ChatGPT, optimizing financial trading and helping a robotic hand solve a Rubik's Cube.",
      "But Barto said the field was \"not fashionable\u201d when he and his doctoral student, Sutton, began crafting their theories and algorithms at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.",
      "\u201cWe were kind of in the wilderness,\u201d Barto said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWhich is why it\u2019s so gratifying to receive this award, to see this becoming more recognized as something relevant and interesting. In the early days, it was not.\u201d",
      "Google sponsors the annual $1 million prize, which was announced Wednesday by the Association for Computing Machinery.",
      "Barto, now retired from the University of Massachusetts, and Sutton, a longtime professor at Canada's University of Alberta, aren't the first AI pioneers to win the award named after British mathematician, codebreaker and early AI thinker Alan Turing. But their research has directly sought to answer Turing's 1947 call for a machine that \u201ccan learn from experience\u201d \u2014 which Sutton describes as \u201carguably the essential idea of reinforcement learning.\u201d",
      "In particular, they borrowed from ideas in psychology and neuroscience about the way that pleasure-seeking neurons respond to rewards or punishment. In one landmark paper published in the early 1980s, Barto and Sutton set their new approach on a specific task in a simulated world: balance a pole on a moving cart to keep it from falling. The two computer scientists later co-authored a widely used textbook on reinforcement learning.",
      "\u201cThe tools they developed remain a central pillar of the AI boom and have rendered major advances, attracted legions of young researchers, and driven billions of dollars in investments,\u201d said Google\u2019s chief scientist Jeff Dean in a written statement.",
      "In a joint interview with the AP, Barto and Sutton didn't always agree on how to evaluate the risks of AI agents that are constantly seeking to improve themselves. They also distinguished their work from the branch of generative AI technology that is currently in fashion \u2014 the large language models behind chatbots made by OpenAI, Google and other tech giants that mimic human writing and other media.",
      "\u201cThe big choice is, do you try to learn from people\u2019s data, or do you try to learn from an (AI) agent\u2019s own life and its own experience?\u201d Sutton said.",
      "Sutton has dismissed what he describes as overblown concerns about AI's threat to humanity, while Barto disagreed and said \u201cYou have to be cognizant of potential unexpected consequences.\u201d",
      "Barto, retired for 14 years, describes himself as a Luddite, while Sutton is embracing a future he expects to have beings of greater intelligence than current humans \u2014 an idea sometimes known as posthumanism.",
      "\u201cPeople are machines. They\u2019re amazing, wonderful machines,\u201d but they are also not the \u201cend product\u201d and could work better, Sutton said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s intrinsically a part of the AI enterprise,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand ourselves and, of course, to make things that can work even better. Maybe to become such things.\u201d",

      "OAKLAND, Calif. -- A federal judge has denied Elon Musk's request for a court order blocking OpenAI from converting itself to a for-profit company but said she could expedite a trial to consider Musk's claims against the ChatGPT maker and its CEO.",
      "U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled late Tuesday that \u201cMusk has not demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits\u201d in his request for a preliminary injunction. She offered to hold a trial in her California courtroom as soon as this fall, \u201cgiven the public interest at stake and potential for harm if a conversion contrary to law occurred.\u201d",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor, began a legal offensive against the ChatGPT maker and CEO Sam Altman a year ago, suing for breach of contract over what he said was the betrayal of its founding aims as a nonprofit.",
      "He escalated the legal dispute late last year, adding new claims and defendants, including Microsoft, and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business. Musk also added his own AI company, xAI, as a plaintiff, claiming that OpenAI was unfairly stifling business competition.",
      "He and a group of investors more recently made an unsolicited $97.4 billion bid to buy a controlling stake in the nonprofit \u2014 a move that undermined Musk\u2019s \u201cclaim of irreparable harm,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "OpenAI said it welcomed the court\u2019s decision.",
      "\u201cThis has always been about competition,\u201d a statement from the company said. \u201cElon\u2019s own emails show that he wanted to merge a for-profit OpenAI into Tesla. That would have been great for his personal benefit, but not for our mission or U.S. interests.\u201d",
      "Musk alleges in the lawsuit that the companies are violating the terms of his foundational contributions to the charity. He had invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018, his lawyer has said.",
      "Musk attorney Marc Toberoff said in a statement late Tuesday that he is pleased that the court offered an expedited trial on the core claims.",
      "\"We look forward to a jury confirming that Altman accepted Musk\u2019s charitable contributions knowing full well they had to be used for the public\u2019s benefit rather than his own enrichment,\u201d Toberoff said.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers in a hearing last month called it a \u201cstretch\u201d to claim \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to Musk, and she called the case \u201cbillionaires vs. billionaires.\u201d She questioned why Musk invested tens of millions in OpenAI without a written contract. Toberoff responded that it was because the relationship between Altman and Musk at the time was \u201cbuilt on trust\u201d and the two were very close.",
      "\u201cThat is just a lot of money\u201d to invest \u201con a handshake,\u201d the judge said.",
      "The dispute has roots in a 2017 internal power struggle at the fledgling startup that led to Altman becoming OpenAI\u2019s CEO.",
      "Emails disclosed by OpenAI show Musk had also sought to be CEO and grew frustrated after two other OpenAI co-founders said he would hold too much power as a major shareholder and chief executive if the startup succeeded in its goal to achieve better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence. Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.",
      "Altman eventually succeeded in becoming CEO and has remained so except for a period in 2023 when he was fired and then reinstated days later after the board that ousted him was replaced.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers, appointed by then-President Barack Obama in 2011, has handled a number of tech industry cases including Apple\u2019s fight with Epic Games, though she said last month that Musk\u2019s case is \u201cnothing like\u201d that one.

      "The number of monarch butterflies wintering in the mountains west of Mexico City, rebounded this year, doubling the area they covered in 2024 despite the stresses of climate change",
      "MEXICO CITY -- The number of monarch butterflies wintering in the mountains west of Mexico City rebounded this year, doubling the area they covered in 2024 despite the stresses of climate change and habitat loss, experts said Thursday.",
      "The annual butterfly count doesn\u2019t calculate the individual number of butterflies, but rather the number of acres they cover as they gather on tree branches in the mountain pine and fir forests. Monarchs from east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada overwinter there.",
      "Mexico\u2019s Commission for National Protected Areas (CONANP) said that this year, butterflies covered 4.4 acres (1.79 hectares) compared to only 2.2 acres (0.9 hectares) the year before. Last year\u2019s figure represented a 59% drop from 2023, the second lowest level since record keeping began.",
      "After wintering in Mexico, the iconic butterflies with black and orange wings fly north, breeding multiple generations along the way for thousands of miles. The offspring that reach southern Canada begin the trip back to Mexico at the end of summer.",
      "Gloria Tavera Alonso, the Mexican agency\u2019s director general of conservation, said the improved numbers owed to better climatic factors and humidity. Drought along the butterflies\u2019 migratory route had been listed as a factor in last year\u2019s decline.",
      "The impact of changes in weather year after year mean fluctuations are expected. For that, Jorge Rickards, Mexico director general for the World Wildlife Fund, said \u201cyou can't let down your guard\u201d and must continue to expand conservation efforts.",
      "Tavera Alonso credited ongoing efforts to increase the number of plants the butterflies rely on for sustenance and reproduction along their flyway.",
      "Butterflies have not been faring well north of the border.",
      "The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has been counting western overwinter populations of monarch butterflies \u2014 a separate population from those that winter in central Mexico \u2014 along the California coast, northern Baja California and inland sites in California and Arizona for the last 28 years. The highest number recorded was 1.2 million in 1997. The organization announced in February that it counted just 9,119 monarchs in 2024, a decrease of 96% from 233,394 in 2023. The total was the second-lowest since the survey began in 1997.",
      "And the first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance in the United States found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday\u2019s journal Science.",
      "Experts say that monarchs face risks across North America in large part due to the reduction in milkweed where the monarchs lay their eggs. The plant has been disappearing due to drought, wildfires, herbicides and urbanization.",
      "In December, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed that monarch butterflies receive protection as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Early humans were regularly using animal bones to make cutting tools 1.5 million years ago.",
      "A newly discovered cache of 27 carved and sharpened bones from elephants and hippos found in Tanzania's Olduvai Gorge site pushes back the date for ancient bone tool use by around 1 million years. Researchers know that early people made simple tools from stones as early as 3.3 million years ago.",
      "The new discovery, published Wednesday in Nature, reveals that ancient humans \u201chad rather more complex tool kits than previously we thought,\u201d incorporating a variety of materials, said William Harcourt-Smith, a paleoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the research.",
      "The well-preserved bone tools, measuring up to around 16 inches (40 centimeters), were likely made by breaking off the thick ends of leg bones and using a stone to knock off flakes from the remaining bone shaft. This technique was used to create one sharpened edge and one pointed tip, said study co-author Ignacio de la Torre, a researcher at the Spanish National Research Council.",
      "The bone tools were \u201cprobably used as a hand axe\u201d \u2013 a handheld blade that\u2019s not mounted on a stick \u2013 for butchering dead animals, he said.",
      "Such a blade would be handy for removing meat from elephant and hippo carcasses, but not used as a spear or projectile point. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe they were hunting these animals. They were probably scavenging,\u201d he said.",
      "Some of the artifacts show signs of having been struck to remove flakes more than a dozen times, revealing persistent craftsmanship.",
      "The uniform selection of the bones \u2013 large and heavy leg bones from specific animals \u2013 and the consistent pattern of alteration makes it clear that early humans deliberately chose and carved these bones, said M\u00edrian Pacheco, a paleobiologist at the Federal University of Sao Carlos in Brazil, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The bone show minimal signs of erosion, trampling or gnawing by other animals \u2014 ruling out the possibility that natural causes resulted in the tool shapes, she added.",
      "The bone tools date from more than a million years before our species, Homo sapiens, arose around 300,000 years ago.",
      "At the time the tools were made, three different species of human ancestors lived in the same region of East Africa, said Briana Pobiner, a paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian\u2019s Human Origins Program, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The tools may have been made and used by Homo erectus, Homo habilis or Paranthropus boisei. \u201cIt could have been any of these three, but it\u2019s almost impossible to know which one,\u201d said Pobiner.",

      "Woolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.",
      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Since then, the company has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \u201cengineer them into living animals,\u201d said CEO Ben Lamm.",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not actually resurrecting anything \u2014 you\u2019re not bringing back the ancient past,\u201d said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \u201cColossal woolly mouse.\u201d",
      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\u201d said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \u201cmake it a lot more efficient and easier,\u201d said Lynch.",
      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \u201cpresent already in some living mice,\u201d said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \u201cwe put them all together in a single mouse.\u201d",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance \u2014 a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \u201ca lot of processes and red tape\u201d before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",
      "Independent experts are skeptical about the idea of \u201cde-extinction.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou might be able to alter the hair pattern of an Asian elephant or adapt it to the cold, but it\u2019s not bringing back a woolly mammoth. It\u2019s changing an Asian elephant,\u201d said University of Montana's Preston.",
      "Still, the refinement of precision gene-editing in animals could have other uses for conservation or animal agriculture, said Bhanu Telugu, who studies animal biotechnology at the University of Missouri and was not involved in the new research.",
      "Telugu said he was impressed by Colossal\u2019s technology advances that enabled scientists to pinpoint which genes to target.",

      "But Williams, in response to a question, did take issue with Musk's recent call to dump the space station in two years, rather than waiting until NASA's projected deorbit in 2031. She noted all the scientific research being performed at the orbiting lab.",
      "\u201cThis place is ticking. It's just really amazing, so I would say we're actually in our prime right now,\u201d said Williams, a three-time space station resident. \u201cI would think that right now is probably not the right time to say quit, call it quits.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us,\" she said. \u201cWe're here. We have a mission. We're just just doing what we do every day, and every day is interesting because we're up in space and it's a lot of fun.\u201d",
      "Wilmore and Williams expected to be gone just a week or so when they launched last June aboard Boeing\u2019s new Starliner capsule, making its crew debut after years of delay.

      "China is denying the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s accusations against 12 Chinese nationals charged in connection with global cybercrime campaigns targeting dissidents, news organizations, U.S. agencies and universities",
      "WASHINGTON -- Twelve Chinese nationals \u2014 including mercenary hackers, law enforcement officers and employees of a private hacking company \u2014 have been charged in connection with global cybercrime campaigns targeting dissidents, news organizations, U.S. agencies and universities, the Justice Department says.",
      "A set of criminal cases filed in New York and Washington add new detail to what U.S. officials said Wednesday is a booming hacking-for-hire ecosystem in China, in which private companies and contractors are paid by the Chinese government to target victims of particular interest to Beijing in an arrangement meant to provide Chinese state security forces cover and deniability.",
      "The indictments come as the U.S. government has warned of an increasingly sophisticated cyber threat from China, such as a hack last year of telecom firms called Salt Typhoon that gave Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans, including U.S. government officials and prominent public figures.",
      "One indictment charges eight leaders and employees of a private hacking company known as I-Soon with conducting a sweeping array of computer breaches around the world meant to suppress speech, locate dissidents and steal data from victims. Among those charged is Wu Haibo, who founded I-Soon in Shanghai in 2010 and was a member of China's first hacktivist group, Green Army, and who is accused in the indictment of overseeing and directing hacking operations.",
      "Earlier reporting by The Associated Press on leaked documents from I-Soon mainly showed I-Soon was targeting a wide range of governments such as India, Taiwan or Mongolia, but little on the United States.",
      "But the indictment contains new revelations about I-Soon\u2019s activities targeting a wide range of Chinese dissidents, religious organizations and media outlets based in the U.S., including a newspaper identified as publishing news related to China and opposed to the Chinese Communist Party. Other targets included individual critics of China living in the U.S., the Defense Intelligence Agency and a research university.",
      "The targets were in some cases directed by China's Ministry of Public Security \u2014 two law enforcement officers were charged with tasking certain assignments \u2014 but in other instances the hackers acted at their own initiative and tried to sell the stolen information to the government afterward, the indictment says.",
      "The company charged the Chinese government the equivalent of between approximately $10,000 and $75,000 for each email inbox it successfully hacked, officials said.",
      "Phone numbers listed for I-Soon on a Chinese corporate registry rang unanswered, and I-Soon representatives did not immediately respond to an AP email requesting comment Wednesday.",
      "A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry on Thursday denied the charges, calling the U.S. \u201chypocritical\" and pointing to U.S. cyberattacks on China.",
      "\u201cChina firmly opposes the groundless accusation made by the US and urges the US to immediately stop abusing sanctions,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a press conference in Beijing.",
      "A separate indictment charges two other Chinese hackers, identified as Yin Kecheng and Zhou Shuai, in a for-profit hacking campaign that targeted victims including U.S. technology companies, think tanks, defense contractors and health care systems. Among the targets was the U.S. Treasury Department, which disclosed a breach by Chinese actors late last year in what it called a \u201cmajor cybersecurity incident.\u201d",
      "The Treasury Department announced sanctions Wednesday in connection with the hacking, and the State Department announced multimillion-dollar rewards for information about the defendants.",
      "I-Soon is part of a sprawling industry in China, documented in an AP investigation last year, of private hacking contractors that steal data from other countries to sell to the Chinese authorities.",
      "Over the past two decades, Chinese state security\u2019s demand for overseas intelligence has soared, giving rise to a vast network of these private hackers-for-hire companies that have infiltrated hundreds of systems outside China.",
      "China\u2019s hacking industry rose in the early days of the internet, when Wu and other Chinese hackers declared themselves \u201cred hackers\u201d \u2014 patriots who offered their services to the Chinese Communist Party, in contrast to the anti-establishment ethos popular among many coders.",
      "The indictment \u201cproved the close ties and interaction among China\u2019s first generation patriotic hackers,\u201d said Mei Danowski, a cybersecurity analyst who wrote about I-Soon on her blog, Natto Thoughts. They \u201call turned to entrepreneurs now \u2014 doing businesses with the governments and making profits through other means.\u201d",
      "Since I-Soon documents were leaked online last year, the company has been suffering but is still in operation, according to Chinese corporate records. They've downsized and moved offices.",
      "\"Apparently i-SOON companies have been struggling to survive,\" Danowski wrote on her blog. \u201cTo Chinese state agencies, a company like i-SOON is disposable.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Some Georgia lawmakers are trying to get rid of automated cameras that enforce school zone speed limits, saying the cameras are more about making money than the safety of children",
      "DECATUR, Ga. -- Outside Beacon Hill Middle School in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur, like along hundreds of roadsides across Georgia, the unblinking eye of a camera tickets drivers who speed through a school zone.",
      "Supporters say cameras slow down drivers and provide constant enforcement that understaffed police departments can't equal. But some state lawmakers want to ban them, saying the cameras are more about generating money for local governments and camera companies, and that some use them deceptively.",
      "More than 20 states and the District of Columbia allow automated traffic cameras to issue speeding tickets, but more than 10 other states have outlawed them. However, it would be unusual for a state to reverse its position. New Jersey had a pilot program testing cameras to enforce red lights, but pulled the plug in 2014.",
      "Georgia's fight will come to a head soon in its General Assembly, with three separate bills advancing out of committees. The state first authorized speed cameras, but only in school zones, in 2018.",
      "More than 100 representatives in Georgia's 180-member House signed on to House Bill 225, which would ban the cameras. Dale Washburn, the Macon Republican sponsoring that measure, provided a stack of emails from outraged people ticketed statewide who said lights weren't flashing, they didn't even know they were in a school zone, or the cameras were otherwise unfair.",
      "While the tickets in Georgia are civil citations and don't go on a driver\u2019s criminal record, the state does block people who don\u2019t pay from renewing their vehicle registration. Almost 125,000 unpaid violations were reported in 2024, the Georgia Department of Revenue said. The cameras generated more than $112 million in revenue in 54 Georgia cities and counties since 2019, WANF-TV found last year. Camera companies typically take a share of the revenue.",
      "\u201cThese camera companies are engaged in deceit and trickery,\u201d Washburn said. \u201cTheir goal is to write tickets, not to enhance children\u2019s safety.\"",
      "One issue with abolishing cameras is that companies have become big political donors. Two big vendors, United Kingdom-based RedSpeed and Tennessee-based Blue Line Solutions, contributed around $500,000 to Georgia campaigns in recent years, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan watchdog that tracks money in politics.",
      "Legislative leaders seem more likely to support two other bills that would keep cameras, but more closely regulate them by providing better warning signs and limiting the hours of usage.",
      "\u201cSo the objective is to alert drivers that they're entering a school zone and get them to slow down and then for them not to be cited unless they are speeding in a school zone during designated hours,\u201d said Republican Sen. Max Burns of Sylvania, who is sponsoring Senate Bill 75.",
      "An alternate House bill that is similar to Burns' would require half the money raised go to school safety.",
      "In Decatur, students surge out of Beacon Hill Middle at dismissal and walk along College Avenue, a two-lane street that's also a state highway. Unlike most places in Georgia, where most students travel home in buses or their parents' cars, a majority of Decatur's 5,300 students either walk or ride bikes home.",
      "Decatur Mayor Patti Garrett said a student at Beacon Hill was struck in a hit-and-run accident and a crossing guard elsewhere was also hit before Decatur activated its cameras last fall.",
      "\u201cWe really want to protect our most vulnerable residents, our students, and particularly when they are on foot or on a bicycle,\" Garrett said.",
      "Police Chief Scott Richards said according to a speed study conducted by the company, speeding has fallen 92%. But there are still plenty of drivers flying through the five zones where Decatur is using cameras. They issued 4,500 valid citations in January alone, he said.",
      "\u201cWe would not be able to get those reductions if it were not for the photo enforcement in school zones,\u201d Richards said.",
      "Decatur officials tout their efforts as a model, saying the city has abundant signage and only operates the cameras for a 30 minutes before and after schools begin in the morning and dismiss in the afternoon. A vehicle must be traveling 11 miles (17.7 kilometers) per hour over the speed limit to be cited.",
      "Still, Washburn and others say the amount of money involved encourages overuse and bad behavior.",
      "\u201cProfit-based law enforcement cannot be trusted,\u201d John Moore of Milledgeville wrote to Washburn in February. \u201cI hope you can convince your colleagues to vote this menace out of our state for good.\u201d"

      "Minnesota is considering a new strategy for cracking down on deepfake pornography",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Molly Kelly was stunned to discover in June that someone she knew had used widely available \u201cnudification\u201d technology to create highly realistic and sexually explicit videos and images of her, using family photos that were posted on social media.",
      "\u201cMy initial shock turned to horror when I learned that the same person targeted about 80, 85 other women, most of whom live in Minnesota, some of whom I know personally, and all of them had connections in some way to the offender,\u201d Kelly said.",
      "Backed by her testimony, Minnesota is considering a new strategy for cracking down on deepfake pornography. A bill that has bipartisan support would target companies that run websites and apps allowing people to upload a photo that then would be transformed into explicit images or videos.",
      "States across the country and Congress are considering strategies for regulating artificial intelligence. Most have banned the dissemination of sexually explicit deepfakes or revenge porn whether they were produced with AI or not. The idea behind the Minnesota legislation is to prevent the material from ever being created \u2014 before it spreads online.",
      "Experts on AI law caution the proposal might be unconstitutional on free speech grounds.",
      "The lead author, Democratic Sen. Erin Maye Quade, said additional restrictions are necessary because AI technology has advanced so rapidly. Her bill would require the operators of \u201cnudification\u201d sites and apps to turn them off to people in Minnesota or face civil penalties up to $500,000 \u201cfor each unlawful access, download, or use.\u201d Developers would need to figure out how to exclude Minnesota users.",
      "It\u2019s not just the dissemination that\u2019s harmful to victims, she said. It\u2019s the fact that these images exist at all.",
      "Kelly told reporters last month that anyone can quickly create \u201chyper-realistic nude images or pornographic video\u201d in minutes.",
      "Most law enforcement attention so far has been focused on distribution and possession.",
      "San Francisco in August filed a first-of-its-kind lawsuit against several widely visited \u201cnudification\u201d websites, alleging they broke state laws against fraudulent business practices, nonconsensual pornography and the sexual abuse of children. That case remains pending.",
      "The U.S. Senate last month unanimously approved a bill by Democrat Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, and Republican Ted Cruz, of Texas, to make it a federal crime to publish nonconsensual sexual imagery, including AI-generated deepfakes. Social media platforms would be required to remove them within 48 hours of notice from a victim. Melania Trump on Monday used her first solo appearance since becoming first lady again to urge passage by the Republican-controlled House, where it's pending.",
      "The Kansas House last month approved a bill that expands the definition of illegal sexual exploitation of a child to include possession of images generated with AI if they're \u201cindistinguishable from a real child, morphed from a real child\u2019s image or generated without any actual child involvement.\u201d",
      "A bill introduced in the Florida Legislature creates a new felony for people who use technology such as AI to generate nude images and criminalizes possession of child sexual abuse images generated with it. Broadly similar bills have also been introduced in Illinois, Montana, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Texas, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural.",
      "Maye Quade said she'll be sharing her proposal with legislators in other states because few are aware the technology is so readily accessible.",
      "\u201cIf we can\u2019t get Congress to act, then we can maybe get as many states as possible to take action,\u201d Maye Quade said.",
      "Sandi Johnson, senior legislative policy counsel for the victim\u2019s rights group RAINN \u2014 the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network \u2014 said the Minnesota bill would hold websites accountable.",
      "\u201cOnce the images are created, they can be posted anonymously, or rapidly widely disseminated, and become nearly impossible to remove,\u201d she testified recently.",
      "Megan Hurley also was horrified to learn someone had generated explicit images and video of her using a \u201cnudification\u201d site. She said she feels especially humiliated because she's a massage therapist, a profession that's already sexualized in some minds.",
      "\u201cIt is far too easy for one person to use their phone or computer and create convincing, synthetic, intimate imagery of you, your family, and friends, your children, your grandchildren,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cI do not understand why this technology exists and I find it abhorrent there are companies out there making money in this manner.\u201d",
      "However, two AI law experts \u2014 Wayne Unger of the Quinnipiac University School of Law and Riana Pfefferkorn of Stanford University's Institute of Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence \u2014 said the Minnesota bill is too broadly constructed to survive a court challenge.",
      "Limiting the scope only to images of real children might help it withstand a First Amendment challenge since those are generally not protected, Pfefferkorn said. But she said it would still potentially conflict with a federal law that says you can't sue websites for content that users generate.",
      "\u201cIf Minnesota wants to go down this direction, they'll need to add a lot more clarity to the bill,\u201d Unger said. \u201cAnd they'll have to narrow what they mean by nudify and nudification.\u201d",
      "But Maye Quade said she thinks her legislation is on solid constitutional ground because it's regulating conduct, not speech.",
      "\u201cThis cannot continue,\" she said. \"These tech companies cannot keep unleashing this technology into the world with no consequences. It is harmful by its very nature.\u201d",

      "South Korea's military says North Korea has fired several ballistic missiles into the sea",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea fired several ballistic missiles into the sea Monday, South Korea\u2019s military said, hours after South Korean and U.S. troops kicked off their large annual combined drills, which the North views as an invasion rehearsal.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile firings, North Korea\u2019s fifth missile launch event this year, were detected from the North\u2019s southwestern Hwanghae province but gave no further details such as how far they flew. It said South Korea bolstered its surveillance posture and is closely coordinating with the United States.",
      "Earlier Monday, the South Korean and U.S. militaries began their annual Freedom Shield command post exercise, their first major combined training of President Donald Trump's second term. The allies have already been engaging in diverse field training exercises in connection with the Freedom Shield training.",
      "North Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry warned Monday the Freedom Shield training risks triggering \u201cphysical conflict\u201d on the Korean Peninsula. It called the training an \u201caggressive and confrontational war rehearsal\" and reiterated leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s stated goals for a \u201cradical growth\u201d of his nuclear force to counter what he claims as growing threats posed by the U.S. and its Asian allies.",
      "This year's training came after the South Korean and U.S. militaries paused live-fire training while Seoul investigates how its fighter jets mistakenly bombed a civilian area during a warm-up drill last week.",
      "About 30 people were injured, two of them seriously, when two South Korean KF-16 fighter jets mistakenly fired eight MK-82 bombs on a civilian area in Pocheon, a town near the North Korean border, on Thursday. The bombing occurred while South Korean and U.S. forces were engaging in a live-fire drill ahead of the Freedom Shield exercise.",
      "The initial assessment from the South Korean air force was that one of the KF-16 pilots entered the wrong coordinates and failed to visually verify the target before proceeding with the bombing. The second pilot had the correct coordinates but focused only on maintaining flight formation and dropped the bombs on the first pilot\u2019s instructions with recognizing the target was wrong, according to the content of the latest briefing provided to The Associated Press.",
      "Gen. Lee Youngsu, chief of staff of the South Korean air force, bowed and apologized Monday over the injuries and property damage caused by the bombing, which he said \u201cshould have never happened and must never happen again.\u201d",
      "Both the South Korean and U.S. militaries have halted all live-fire exercises in South Korea following the mistake. South Korean military officials say live-fire training will resume after they complete the investigation of the bombing and form preventative steps.",

    "story": [
      "On \"This Week,\" Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., discussed the Democratic agenda.",
      "Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said on Sunday that he took issue with the Democratic response in the chamber to President Donald Trump\u2019s wide-ranging address to Congress last week.",
      "\"I think the lack of a coordinated response in the State of the Union was a mistake, and frankly, it took the focus off of where it should have been, which is on the fact that the president spoke for an hour and 40 minutes and had nothing to say about what he would do to bring down costs for American families that were watching that lengthy address sitting at the kitchen table, hoping that he would offer something to help them afford a new home or pay the rent to afford health care or child care,\" Schiff said on \u201cThis Week.\"",
      "Democratic lawmakers participated in various protests during Trump\u2019s speech. Some female members of Congress wore hot pink to show resistance. Other Democratic members held signs that called out Elon Musk. Some decided to boycott the speech or leave early.",
      "Schiff refuted Democratic strategist James Carville's recent proposal in a New York Times op-ed that Democrats should \u201croll over and play dead\u201d and wait for Republicans \"to crumble beneath their own weight,\" with the California senator instead saying that the right approach is focusing on \"the economic well-being of Americans.\"",
      "\"We need to have our own broad, bold agenda ... to answer really the central question which is, if you're working hard in America, can you still earn a good living?\" said Schiff. \"We need to be advancing policies and making the arguments about what we have to offer, not simply standing back and letting them collapse of our own corrupt weight. We need to effectively use litigation as we are. We need to effectively use communication to talk to new people in new ways as we are.\"",
      "Schiff also expressed frustration and disapproval of Trump\u2019s whiplash tariff agenda.",
      "Trump on Tuesday imposed a 25% tariff on goods coming from Canada or Mexico. The following day, he issued a one-month delay for auto parts. By Friday, Trump signed an executive order that extended the delay to all products under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, USMCA, which is a free trade agreement signed during Trump\u2019s first term. Roughly half of Mexican imports fall under USMCA and about 38% of imports from Canada fall under the agreement.",
      "Schiff said that Democrats have to start responding to Trump\u2019s tariffs and economic policies more effectively.",
      "\"This is deeply destructive, what they're doing,\" he said. \"We need to make that case to the American people, because they're going to feel it. But, you know, taking our eye off the ball, I think, is very dangerous, and so let's be focused on what matters most to Americans. Let's point out all the destructive harms they're doing with you know, the cutting of services, the slashing of Medicaid, and what that's going to mean for increased health costs and less access for people.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Human Rights Campaign accused Newsom of trying to \"score political points.\"",
      "In this first episode of a new podcast published Thursday, California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, an LGBTQ ally, broke with his party, saying that transgender athletes playing in female sports is \"deeply unfair.\"",
      "\"I think it's an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness. It's deeply unfair,\" Newsom said on his podcast, \"This is Gavin Newsom.\"",
      "Newsom's comments came during a conversation with conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who leads conservative group Turning Point USA and played a critical role in garnering youth support for President Donald Trump in the 2024 election.",
      "Newsom, sometimes viewed as a 2028 presidential hopeful, also agreed that the political ad that hurt former Vice President Kamala Harris the most in her presidential campaign was her previous support for providing taxpayer-funded gender transition-related medical care for detained immigrants and federal prisoners. Trump's campaign had played back her remarks in a widely-circulated ad.",
      "\"She didn't even react to it, which was even more devastating,\" Newsom said.",
      "Newsom also pointed to his own work in expanding LGBTQ rights, while referencing current law in the state of California that allows transgender athletes to participate in school sports that reflect the gender they identify with.",
      "Newsom himself was a trailblazer in expanding LGBTQ rights: in 2004, as mayor of San Francisco, he allowed same-sex marriages to proceed even though they were not yet allowed nationwide.",
      "He referenced that moment while discussing his alignment with Kirk's views on transgender athletes in women's sports.",
      "\"I've been a leader in the LGBTQ places, as, you know, back in 2004 [I] was marrying same sex couples. And I know we have [a] difference [of] opinion on marriage equality, and so I've been at this for years and years, I take a backseat to no one,\" Newsom said, before discussing how he heard people talking about transgender athletes.",
      "On the podcast, Newsom also called for compassion toward transgender individuals, even while discussing the sports issue: \"There's also humility and grace. You know, that, these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with as well.\"",
      "LGBTQ rights groups criticized Newsom's remarks, saying that they came amid national backlash to transgender individuals and their rights.",
      "The Human Rights Campaign, a major national LGBTQ rights advocacy and lobbying group, said in a statement shared on social media that with discussions nationwide in legislatures about restricting same-sex marriage or transgender rights, \"this is not a moment to sit politely in the face of authoritarian bullies or throw people under the bus for political posturing.\"",
      "\"Singling out trans kids to score political points is never going to help someone pay their rent, keep Medicaid or get a job, but it will make it seem like Gov. Newsom believes our civil rights are up for grabs,\" the organization wrote. \"Californians - and ALL Americans - need leaders who have courage in their convictions, and who will show up for them, in the faces of people who want to see us all back in the closet.\"",
      "The organization also pointed to a 2013 law in California that allowed students to be part of sport teams matching their own gender identity. The American Civil Liberties Union praised the law in 2013 as \"ensuring transgender youth have the opportunity to fully participate and succeed in schools across the state.\"",
      "Newsom briefly referenced the law in his discussion with Kirk, highlighting that it was passed before he became governor.",
      "Two members of the California state legislature, Assemblymember Chris Ward and state Sen. Caroline Menjivar, released a statement through the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus criticizing Newsom's remarks as well, saying they were \"profoundly sickened and frustrated\" by what he said.",
      "\"Sometimes Gavin Newsom goes for the Profile in Courage, sometimes not,\" they wrote. \"We woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks. All students deserve the academic and health benefits of sports activity, and until Donald Trump began obsessing about it, playing on a team consistent with one's gender has not been a problem since the standard was passed in 2013.\"",
      "Newsom's remarks came just a month after Trump signed an executive order intending on banning transgender athletes from participating in women's sports. The White House has said the action is meant to protect women in sports from harm and from facing opponents who they say have an unfair advantage.",
      "LGBTQ advocacy groups have criticized the administration's action and general rhetoric as discriminatory and as having razor-sharp focus on issues of transgender rights to the exclusion of economic and other issues.",

    "summary": "Over the next week, several judges have ordered top Trump administration officials to testify about efforts to reduce the size of the federal government.",
    "story": [
      "Plaintiffs want to know how DOGE staffers entrenched themselves within agencies.",
      "As the Department of Government Efficiency rapidly moves to reshape the federal government, several groups challenging DOGE in court are attempting to determine how Elon Musk's budget-slashers were able to rapidly entrench themselves in at least 15 agencies.",
      "Over the coming week, federal judges have ordered key Trump administration officials to testify about mass firings and the dismantling of key agencies, while DOGE representatives will likely have to turn over evidence in dozens of cases and participate in a sworn deposition for at least one case.",
      "The legal challenges materializing against DOGE could present an existential challenge for the group, whose effectiveness has in part stemmed from its ability to move quickly and make massive changes without the normal oversight.",
      "While Musk and Trump have touted DOGE's transparency -- including on DOGE's website, where it lists recently canceled contracts -- the plaintiffs challenging the group have argued that the group has relied on secrecy to hide tactics that violate federal law.",
      "\"[T]he entity has worked in the shadows -- a cadre of largely unidentified actors, whose status as government employees is unclear, controlling major government functions with no oversight,\" one lawsuit alleged.",
      "That secrecy has also made it harder for nonprofits or federal unions to successfully block DOGE in court, with many plaintiffs relying on media reporting -- rather than documentary evidence -- to prove the harms DOGE has allegedly caused.",
      "\"The court can't act based on the media reports. We can't do that,\" one federal judge said in a case about the constitutionality of Musk's power. \"The things that I'm hearing are concerning indeed and troubling indeed, but I have to have a record, and I have to make a finding the facts before I issue something.\"",
      "But that might begin to change as the cases against DOGE progress and plaintiffs are entitled to receive discovery -- i.e., the exchange of evidence -- relevant to key allegations. At least one federal judge has ordered a DOGE representative to sit for a sworn deposition about the group's access to the federal government's sensitive data.",
      "A federal judge in Washington, D.C, was scheduled Friday afternoon to consider what kind of regulations will govern the transparency behind DOGE after the group argued it shouldn't be subject to the Freedom of Information Act, and next week might provide some of the first sworn testimony about Trump's effort to rapidly reduce the size of government since retaking office.",
      "On Monday, a federal judge in Washington is holding a hearing at which the acting chief operating officer of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau has been ordered to testify about the ongoing dismantling of the agency, and a separate judge in California on Thursday is requiring the acting director of the Office of Personnel Management to testify under oath about how the Trump administration allegedly ordered the mass firing of probationary employees.",
      "\"We will prove in this case that remarkably, and I do not say this lightly, your honor, Acting Director [Charles] Ezell is not telling the truth to this court,\" a lawyer challenging the mass firings alleged, prompting the judge overseeing the case to order Ezell to testify in person.",
      "\"We're going to have Ezell come out here and he's going to be under oath right up there and these lawyers are going to quiz him,\" U.S. District Judge William Alsup said.",
      "During a court hearing on Thursday about Ezell's testimony, lawyers with the Department of Justice said the administration is considering making Ezell unavailable for testimony despite the court's order, citing logistical concerns and their potential appeal of the decision. Lawyers for the plaintiffs called the move a clear defiance of a court order and a delay tactic.",
      "\"No final decision had been made,\" a DOJ lawyer told Judge Alsup, suggesting the final decision would be made in Washington.",
      "The Trump administration has already begun its appeal in more than a dozen cases challenging Trump's executive actions, and two adverse rulings have already reached the Supreme Court.",

      "He's facing several hundred ecstatic voters huddled outside a suburban Detroit high school \u2014 the group that did not fit inside the high school's gym or two overflow rooms. The crowd screams in delight when he tells them that a combined total of 9,000 people had shown up for the rally.",
      "\u201cWhat all of this tells me, is not just in Michigan or in Vermont, the people of this country will not allow us to move toward oligarchy. They will not allow Trump to take us into authoritarianism,\u201d Sanders yelled. \u201cWe\u2019re prepared to fight. And we\u2019re going to win.\u201d",
      "At 83 years old, Sanders is not running for president again. But the stooped and silver-haired democratic socialist has emerged as a leader of the resistance to Donald Trump's second presidency. In tearing into Trump's seizure of power and warning about the consequences of firing tens of thousands of government workers, Sanders is bucking the wishes of those who want Democrats to focus on the price of eggs or \u201croll over and play dead.\u201d",
      "For now, at least, Sanders stands alone as the only elected progressive willing to mount a national campaign to harness the fear and anger of the sprawling anti-Trump movement.",
      "He drew a crowd of 4,000 in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Friday night. He faced another 2,600 or so the next morning a few hours away in Altoona, Wisconsin, a town of less than 10,000 residents. And his crowd of 9,000 in suburban Detroit exceeded his own team's expectations. By design, each stop was in a swing U.S. House district represented by a Republican.",
      "Sanders, who was just elected to his fourth Senate term from Vermont, conceded that this is not the role he expected to play at this stage of his career.",
      "In fact, his team intentionally waited in the early weeks of the Trump presidency to launch what they are now calling his \u201cstop oligarchy tour\u201d to see if a high-profile Democrat would fill the leadership void. Instead, Sanders \u2014 who is not a Democrat himself despite allying with Senate Democrats and running twice for the party's presidential nomination \u2014 has people wondering if he's considering another White House bid.",
      "\u201cThis is like presidential campaign rallies, isn\u2019t it? But I\u2019m not running for president, and this is not a campaign,\u201d Sanders told The Associated Press. \u201cYou gotta do what you gotta do. The country\u2019s in trouble and I want to play my role.\u201d",
      "Since losing the White House, Democrats across Washington have struggled to coalesce behind a consistent message or messenger to stop Trump's aggressive moves to slash the government workforce, weaken federal oversight and empower tech titan Elon Musk to execute his vision.",
      "There has been no centralized movement to organize the anti-Trump resistance.",
      "\u201cYou look around \u2014 who else is doing it? No one,\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said of Sanders' efforts. \u201cMy hope is that the dam will break in terms of Democrats going on the offense ... We need to take the argument directly to the people.\u201d",
      "Ocasio-Cortez, a longtime Sanders ally, said she would join him on the road in the coming weeks. She's also planning solo appearances in Republican-held congressional districts in Pennsylvania and New York \u2014 and perhaps others in places where Republicans have declined to hold in-person town halls where they might face protests.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about whether Bernie should or shouldn\u2019t be doing this. It\u2019s about that we all should,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he is unique in this country, and so long as we are blessed to have that capacity on our side, I think we should be thankful for it.\u201d",
      "Beyond Sanders' tour, angry voters have so far relied on grassroots groups like Indivisible to organize a series of local protests. They have been effective in pressuring Trump's allies in some cases. A number of House Republicans facing angry questions have criticized Musk or questioned the cuts being carried out at his allies' behest.",
      "Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin, who has been critical of many Democratic leaders, praised Sanders for stepping up.",
      "\u201cI wish more Democrats were traveling the country, including to red states, to rally the the majority against Musk and Project 2025,\u201d Levin said. \u201cSure as hell beats (House Democratic leader Hakeem) Jeffries traveling the country for his children\u2019s book tour during a constitutional crisis.\u201d",
      "During last month's congressional recess, Jeffries made two appearances to promote a children's book about democracy. He has also traveled to support House Democrats. This past weekend, he was in Selma, Alabama, to mark the 60th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.",
      "The truth is that few, if any, Democratic leaders have the capacity to draw such crowds on short notice or organize the related logistics on a national scale. The party\u2019s nascent class of 2028 presidential prospects, a group that includes California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, have limited national profiles and they have been reluctant to step too far into the national spotlight so far.",
      "Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, among the more outspoken Trump critics in Congress, said that Democrats must be better organized.",
      "\u201cPeople are desperate to be plugged into action right now. People see the threat. They are anxious and angry and motivated and they want to be sent in a direction to help,\u201d he said.",
      "Murphy acknowledged that Sanders still has plenty of detractors within the Democratic Party who view him and his progressive policy ideas \u2014 replacing private and job-based health insurance with a government-funded \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan, free public college, and the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d on climate policy \u2014 as too radical.",
      "Indeed, it was just five years ago when Democrats coalesced around Joe Biden to effectively block Sanders from winning the party's 2020 presidential nomination.",
      "\u201cThere still are a lot of folks who view Bernie as a danger to the party,\" Murphy said, \"whereas I see his message as the core of what we need to build on.\u201d",
      "Sanders was a staunch supporter of Biden over the last four years but criticized the Democratic Party in the aftermath of Kamala Harris' loss last fall, declaring that Trump's victory was possible only because Democrats had \u201cabandoned\u201d the working class.",
      "United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, who introduced Sanders in Michigan, said more Democrats need to \"follow his lead to focus on working-class people and working-class issues.\"",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve got to take a hard look in the mirror, in my opinion, and decide who the hell they want to represent,\" Fain said of Democrats. \u201cWe\u2019ve been clear as a union, if they aren\u2019t looking out for working-class people, we\u2019re not going to be there for them.\u201d",
      "The voters who packed venues across Wisconsin and Michigan over the weekend composed a diverse group, including some who did not support Sanders\u2019 past presidential campaigns. Most said that Democratic leaders have not done enough to stop Trump.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m here because I\u2019m afraid for our country. The last six weeks have been horrible,\u201d said Diana Schack, a 72-year-old retired lawyer who attended her first Sanders rally on Saturday. \u201cI am becoming a more avid Bernie fan, especially in light of the work he\u2019s doing traveling around the country. These are not normal times.\u201d",
      "In Kenosha the night before, Amber Schulz, a 50-year-old medical worker, demanded that her party \u201cstep up and do something.\u201d",
      "\u201cBernie is the only politician I trust,\u201d she said.",
      "Tony Gonzales, 56, an independent from Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, said he's worried that Trump will \u201cdismantle historic American standards\u201d and try to stay in office beyond this term. The Constitution bars presidents from serving more than two terms, even as Trump has suggested he deserves a third.",
      "\u201cIt's a dangerous time right now,\u201d Gonzales said. \u201cWhat Bernie has to say \u2014 and the turnout \u2014 is important. His voice is still being heard.\u201d",
      "Sanders delivered the same fiery populist message over the weekend that he has for decades, seizing on the nation's economic inequality to call for free health care, free public higher education and stronger social safety net programs. Sanders was especially focused on the team of billionaires Trump has appointed to serve as leaders in his administration, including Musk and a half dozen others.",
      "\u201cThey want to dismantle the federal government and cut programs that working people desperately need,\" Sanders warned.",
      "\u201cYes, the oligarchs are enormously powerful. They have endless amounts of money. They control our economy. They own much of the media, and they have enormous influence over our political system,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut from the bottom of my heart, I believe that if we stand together, we can beat them.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s unclear how long that Sanders, an octogenarian who was hospitalized for a heart condition during his 2020 campaign, will continue in this role. A spokesperson said Sanders hasn't had any health issues since the 2019 episode.",
      "He is not expected to slow down anytime soon. Sanders is leaning on his 2020 presidential campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, to organize his stops, backed by a handful of former presidential campaign staffers working on a contract basis.",
      "Shakir, who lost his bid to become the new chair of the Democratic National Committee, acknowledged strategic differences within the party about how best to combat Trump.",
      "Last month, veteran political strategist James Carville penned an opinion piece calling for Democrats to \u201croll over and play dead,\u201d betting that Trump and his party would ultimately suffer a political backlash from voters for going too far.",
      "\u201cOne theory is you can play dead; you can strategically retreat,\u201d Shakir said. \u201cOr, you play alive, and you go out to people and you talk to them with conviction and integrity.\u201d",

      "House Republican leaders on Saturday unveiled a GOP-led stopgap funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, that will fund the government at current levels through the end of September.",
      "Congressional Democrats, however, have vowed to block it citing major cuts to critical services such as health care.",
      "The 99-page bill moderately increases defense spending by about $6 billion more than fiscal 2024 levels, while non-defense spending is about $13 billion lower than fiscal 2024 levels, according to GOP leaders. There is an additional $6 billion for veterans' healthcare.",
      "The measure leaves out emergency funding for disasters and community project funding.",
      "President Donald Trump on Saturday urged congressional Republicans to support and vote for the short-term government funding bill.",
      "\"All Republicans should vote (Please!) YES next week. Great things are coming for America, and I am asking you all to give us a few months to get us through to September so we can continue to put the Country's 'financial house' in order,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.",
      "Trump said Republicans must \"remain united,\" adding that Democrats will \"do anything they can to shut down our Government, and we can't let that happen.\"",
      "Notably, there are funding add-ons to the bill, known as \"anomalies,\" including a $20 billion cut to IRS enforcement and a hike in funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation operation.",
      "GOP leaders say the bill was closely coordinated with the White House. Funding levels in the bill are below those previously set as part of that 2023 bipartisan funding deal.",
      "Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Democratic Whip Katherine Clark and Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar said in a statement Saturday evening that the Democrats won't be voting for the bill.",
      "\"The partisan House Republican funding bill recklessly cuts healthcare, nutritional assistance and $23 billion in veterans benefits. Equally troublesome, the legislation does nothing to protect Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, while exposing the American people to further pain throughout this fiscal year,\" the leaders said in a statement.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is plowing ahead with this GOP plan and is set to hold a vote in the House on Tuesday without the backing of Democrats.",
      "However, getting this Republican plan passed through both chambers will be a real challenge with the March 14 deadline less than a week away.",
      "Democrats are not on board with the proposal, meaning Republicans need near-unanimous support. Johnson has little room for error with his slim 218-214 majority and can only afford to lose one defection if all members are voting and present.",
      "House Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., slammed the GOP proposal in a statement released Saturday.",
      "\"I strongly oppose this full-year continuing resolution, which is a power grab for the White House and further allows unchecked billionaire Elon Musk and President Trump to steal from the American people,\" DeLauro wrote.",
      "\"By essentially closing the book on negotiations for full-year funding bills that help the middle class and protect our national security, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have handed their power to an unelected billionaire,\" she added.",

    "summary": "DOGE is sifting through Social Security payments in an anti-fraud effort that has some worried the administration could deny payments to vulnerable older Americans.",
    "story": [
      "Advocates worry mistakes could affect vulnerable older Americans.",
      "The Department of Government Efficiency is sifting through $1.6 trillion worth of Social Security payments -- records that include a person's name, birth date and how much they earn -- in an anti-fraud effort that has advocates worried the Trump administration could start denying payments to vulnerable older Americans.",
      "Details on the effort were confirmed in a recent letter to Congress by acting Social Security Administrator Lee Dudek and by several sources familiar with the project.",
      "In addition to combing through sensitive data, DOGE staffers also have been inquiring about the Social Security Administration's telephone service, sources told ABC News, which a significant portion of beneficiaries use to file initial claims. DOGE's inquiries about the telephone service have raised concerns that it may be planning either to replace the telephone service with private call centers or eliminate it as an option for filing claims, sources said.",
      "\"Any American receiving Social Security benefits will continue to receive them. The sole mission of DOGE is to identify waste, fraud, and abuse only,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement provided to ABC News on Friday.",
      "President Donald Trump and Elon Musk both alluded to the anti-fraud project in recent public statements, claiming to have already found examples of rampant abuse.",
      "\"We're also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors,\" Trump said in his speech to Congress on Tuesday.",
      "Trump has promised not to cut the program unless evidence of fraud is found.",
      "Details on the anti-fraud project though have been murky, including how DOGE staffers, who are mostly allies of Musk with no experience on complex government entitlement programs, would define what amounts to fraud, which is typically investigated by inspectors general at the agency.",
      "The SSA did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "\"DOGE has repeatedly demonstrated a lack of understanding of what the data they are accessing actually means and whether it, in fact, represents fraud,\" said Lynn Overmann, a senior adviser at the U.S. Digital Service during the Biden administration.",
      "Overmann, the executive director of the Beeck Center for Social Impact + Innovation at Georgetown University, said she is worried wrongful fraud accusations will eliminate a crucial financial lifeline for the elderly, disabled people and children who have lost a parent.",
      "\"The public deserves strong privacy protections, not reckless data experiments with their most sensitive data,\" Overmann said.",
      "About 69 million people receive a Social Security benefit each month, totaling about $1.6 trillion in benefits expected this year, according to the agency.",
      "Dudek, the acting Social Security administrator, has defended the effort in private communications as legal and necessary, several sources told ABC News. He said steps are being taken to protect privacy.",
      "In a private meeting with outside groups last Tuesday, Dudek referred to DOGE staffers as \"the DOGE kids\" and said they would \"make mistakes\" but that \"we have to let them see what is going on at SSA,\" according to three people who attended the meeting.",
      "Dudek said they were being given access to people's names, birth dates and earnings information but not disability information. He also noted that the staffers were granted expedited background checks by the FBI and had been onboarded as agency employees.",
      "\"I saw what happened when DOGE had access to Treasury data,\" Dudek said, according to one person's detailed notes reviewed by ABC News. \"That is not happening at SSA on my watch. It would be catastrophic.\"",
      "DOGE's access to the Treasury Department's payment system is tied up in the courts as outside groups insisted the staff hadn't been properly vetted first and didn't have authorization.",
      "Dudek's decision to grant DOGE access to his agency is now the subject of a separate lawsuit filed by unions and retirees.",
      "In a Feb. 25 letter Dudek sent Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the acting SSA commissioner said the six people given access to the Social Security Administration's master system, called the Enterprise Data Warehouse, were undergoing background checks.",
      "He said one of them was a \"special government employee\" while the other were \"detailees\" from other federal agencies now assigned to his agency. Dudek did not name the employees granted access, citing safety concerns.",
      "DOGE was created by Trump shortly after taking office as a way to cut government waste, and he put Musk in charge of delegating staff to the agencies.",
      "Musk has put some of his top DOGE lieutenants at the agency, according to sources, including Ethan Shaotran, 22, who is internally listed as a \"chief information officer\" at the SSA and is a software engineer who specializes in artificial intelligence. He founded Spark, an AI scheduling assistant startup that received a $100,000 grant from OpenAI in 2024.",
      "Other DOGE representatives listed as chief information officers at the SSA include Gautier \"Cole\" Killian, 24, and Nikhil Rajpal, 30, sources told ABC News.",
      "Marko Elez, is also listed as working at the SSA, sources said. Elez temporarily resigned from DOGE this year following reports of past racist social media posts but was reinstated by Musk after receiving support from Vice President J.D. Vance, among others. According to court documents, Elez was among those granted access to sensitive taxpayer information at the Treasury Department earlier this year.",
      "It was not immediately clear if Shaotran, Killian, Rajpal and Elez were among those with access to the SSA system.",
      "Dudek said that when it comes to the SSA system, DOGE staffers were granted \"read-only\" access to the vast Social Security system.",
      "\"The access for these individuals does not allow for the downloading, copying, transferring, or removing data from the agency,\" he wrote in the letter to Wyden.",
      "Concerns that DOGE might mistake legitimate payments as fraudulent was evident earlier this week when Trump declared in his speech to Congress that there were millions of dead people still collecting Social Security checks.",
      "But that isn't accurate.",
      "According to a 2023 report by the SSA inspector general, there are millions of people older than 100 included in a separate \"master death file,\" but \"almost none\" of them still receive benefits. The agency said fixing the file would cost between $5 million and $10 million.",

      "At least 24 termination letters have been sent out, according to one official.",
      "Several active research grants related to studies involving LGBTQ+ issues, gender identity and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) are being canceled at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) because they allegedly do not meet the \"priorities\" of the current administration.",
      "Starting last week, at least 24 termination letters were sent to researchers at various universities and dozens more have likely occurred, an NIH official with knowledge of the matter, who requested anonymity, confirmed to ABC News.",
      "According to copies of some of the termination letters, viewed by ABC News, canceled grants involved research around \"transgender issues\" and \"gender identity,\" including studying stress in older LGBTQ+ adults and the epidemiology of Alzheimer's disease and other dementia in LGBTQ+ older adults.",
      "\"This award no longer effectuates agency priorities,\" all of the letters read. \"Research programs based on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans. Many such studies ignore, rather than seriously examine, biological realities. It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize these research programs.\"",
      "\"The premise\u2026is incompatible with agency priorities, and no modification of the project could align the project with agency priorities,\" the letters continue.",
      "The letters state that typically NIH allows grant recipients to \"take appropriate corrective action\" before a termination decision is allowed. However, the letters declare \"No corrective action is possible here.\"",
      "It comes as President Donald Trump has made sweeping changes to the federal government in his first few weeks in office, including issuing new guidance that only recognizes two sexes, vowing to \"defend women from gender ideology extremism\" and issuing several executive orders aiming to dismantle DEI initiatives.",
      "Neither the NIH nor the White House immediately replied to ABC News' request for comment.",
      "Additionally, NIH institutes and centers are being asked to review awards for new and ongoing projects to ensure they do not \"contain any DEI research activities or DEI language that give the perception that NIH funds can be used to support these activities.\"",
      "According to a guidance document, obtained by ABC News, NIH employees are being asked to place these projects in one of four categories. Category one is if the project's purpose is solely related to DEI, in which case the award cannot be issued.",
      "Category two involves projects \"partially\" supporting DEI activities. The award can only be granted if the \"non-compliant\" activities are negotiated out of the project.",
      "Category three involves projects that do not support DEI activities but may contain DEI-related language, which must be removed before an award can be issued, and category four involves projects that do not support any DEI activities.",
      "It's unclear what it exactly means for a project to support DEI activities or contain DEI language, but the guidance document includes examples such as the purpose of a meeting being diversity or \"a statement regarding institutional commitment to diversity.\"",
      "On Wednesday, a federal judge issued a nationwide order blocking the NIH from making cuts to research funding that researchers warned could catastrophically harm medical and scientific research and potentially affect treatments in the U.S.",
      "\"As made clear by the declarations in support of a preliminary injunction against the implementation of the Rate Change Notice, the risk of harm to research institutions and beyond is immediate, devastating, and irreparable,\" U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley wrote about the attempt to cap indirect costs at 15%, adding the attempt to cut funding violated federal law.",
      "It remains to be seen if the injunction will have an effect on the projects from universities that received termination letters.",

    "story": [
      "Jerome Powell issued remarks as Trump threatened new tariffs on Canada.",
      "As President Donald Trump on Friday threatened new tariffs on Canadian products, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the  administration's tariff plan would likely raise prices for U.S. shoppers and retailers.",
      "The scale and duration of the tariffs remain unclear but a portion of the taxes on imports will probably reach consumers, Powell told an economic forum in New York City on Friday.",
      "\"We're at a stage where we're still very uncertain about what will be tariffed, for how long, at what level,\" Powell said. \"But the likelihood is some of that will find its way. It will hit the exporters, the importers, the retailers and to some extent consumers.\"",
      "The Trump administration slapped 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% tariffs on imports from China. The fresh round of duties on Chinese goods doubled an initial set of tariffs placed on China last month.",
      "Tariffs of this magnitude are widely expected to increase prices paid by U.S. shoppers, since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to consumers.",
      "\"Everybody is forecasting some inflation effect from tariffs,\" Powell said on Friday.",
      "The remarks from Powell at the annual U.S. Monetary Policy Forum marked a notable prediction from the nation's top central banker charged with keeping inflation under control.",
      "While acknowledging the likelihood of price hikes, however, Powell said the Fed's response would depend on what exactly transpires.",
      "A potentially temporary bump in prices may not warrant intervention, while a more sustained increase could require action, Powell said, noting that the strength of the economy affords the Fed time to assess the impact.",
      "\"In some cases, where we think it's a one-time thing, the textbook would be to look through it,\" Powell said. \"If it turns into a series of things and it's more than that -- [and] if the increases are larger -- that would matter.\"",
      "Powell spoke hours after Trump on Truth Social threatened to slap tariffs, sanctions and other measures on Russia in response to conduct in the war with Ukraine.",
      "The tariffs may become necessary \"based on the fact that Russia is absolutely 'pounding' Ukraine on the battlefield right now,\" Trump said.",
      "Later on Friday, Trump told reporters at the White House that he may also impose new tariffs on Canada, including a tariff on lumber and a 250% duty on dairy products.",
      "Trump indicated the U.S. could take reciprocal action against Canada's roughly 250% tariff on dairy as soon as Friday.",
      "\"Canada has been ripping us off for years on tariffs for lumber and for dairy products, 250% nobody ever talks about that 250% tariff, which is taking advantage of our farmers. So that's not going to happen anymore,\" Trump said.",
      "The potential moves could expand Trump's confrontational trade policy beyond a set of tariffs put forward this week.",
      "The tariff policy could cause \"some disturbance\" for the U.S., Trump noted in his remarks at the White House.",
      "The Trump administration has eased some of the tariffs against Canada and Mexico in recent days.",
      "Trump issued a one-month delay for tariffs on auto-related goods from Mexico and Canada. The carve-out expanded soon afterward with an additional one-month pause for goods from Mexico and Canada compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, a free trade agreement.",
      "In addition to tariffs, Powell mentioned other economic proposals pursued by the Trump administration, including measures affecting fiscal policy and regulation.",
      "\"The new administration is in the process of implementing significant policy changes,\" Powell said. \"Uncertainty around these changes and their likely effects remains high. We are focused on parsing the signal from the noise as the situation evolves. We are not in a hurry.\"",

      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Air Force fighter jets intercepted a civilian aircraft flying in the temporarily restricted airspace near Donald Trump's Florida home Sunday, bringing the number of violations to more than 20 since the president took office on Jan. 20.",
      "North American Aerospace Defense Command said in a statement that Sunday's incident, which took place as Trump finished a round of golf at his West Palm Beach golf course, saw F-16s deploy flares to get the attention of the civilian pilot. Jets also conducted an intercept on Saturday morning shortly after Trump arrived at the course from his private Mar-a-Lago club and residence.",
      "The airspace intrusions in the heavily congested south Florida airspace have prompted fighter jet intercepts but did not alter Trump's schedule or impact his security, officials said. NORAD says the flares may have been visible from the ground but that they burn out quickly and don\u2019t pose danger.",
      "Federal officials maintain a permanent flight restriction over Trump's club that expands to a radius of 30 nautical miles when the president is in residence.",
      "Violations, and intercepts, are relatively routine, but NORAD is raising alarm over the frequency of the intrusions since Trump's inauguration, saying it has responded to more than 20 incidents and blames civilian pilots for not following regulations requiring them to check for airspace restrictions before taking off.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump, the real estate developer turned commander in chief, is laying bare his style of diplomacy in the early weeks of his new term: It\u2019s a whole lot like a high-stakes business deal, and his No. 1 goal is to come out of the transaction on top.",
      "The tactics are clear in his brewing trade war with Canada and Mexico, in his approach to Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and in his selection of the first country he will visit in his second term.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump approaches diplomacy and engages in a very transactional manner, with economics as the foundation and driving force behind international affairs,\" retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, the president's special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, explained at an event in Washington this past week.",
      "For Trump, it\u2019s about leverage, not friendship; dollars as much as values; and hard power versus soft.",
      "It's not just a matter of negotiating style. At stake is the post-World War II international order as Trump's actions raise doubts about American leadership around the globe.",
      "He's shaping a foreign policy that's more inward looking and conscious of the bottom line, dismissing American soft-power levers such as the U.S. Agency for International Development as dubious and riddled by waste and suggesting that the United States might not defend fellow NATO members that aren't meeting defense spending benchmarks set by the alliance.",
      "Politics and presidents to a certain degree are all transactional. But Trump, who helped make himself a household name by burnishing an image as an intrepid real estate dealmaker, is taking it to another level as he navigates an increasingly complicated world.",
      "The Republican president, in his previous life as a real estate titan, saw every deal as one in which there were clear winners and losers. In his return to the White House, he is more demonstrably injecting a what's-in-it-for-me approach to his dealings with both friend and foe.",
      "Edward Frantz, a University of Indianapolis historian who has studied the American presidency, said Trump's \u201cledger\u201d approach might not be the most practical way to conduct diplomacy.",
      "Frantz observed that Trump, 78, a baby boomer and football fan, seems inspired in his foreign policymaking by the ethos of legendary pro football coach Vince Lombardi, who famously said, \u201cWinning isn't everything. It's the only thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut diplomacy, especially in a more complicated world, might be more like soccer,\u201d Frantz said. \"Sometimes you just need a tie. Sometimes you need to just survive and move on.\u201d",

He also made the kingdom his first overseas stop during his first White House term after the Saudis promised $450 billion in U.S. investment.",

      "In his dealings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump has highly focused on who has the leverage. Putin has \u201cthe cards\u201d and Zelenskyy does not, Trump has said repeatedly.",
      "Zelenskyy appeared to be making some strides in assuaging Trump after their recent rocky meeting in the Oval Office ended with Trump and Vice President JD Vance criticizing the Ukrainian leader for what they said was insufficient gratitude for the tens of billions of dollars in U.S. assistance provided in the three years since Russia invaded.",
      "Zelenskyy said later that how that meeting went down was \u201cregrettable.\" He also made clear he was ready to sign off on a minerals deal with the U.S. \u2014 even without the explicit American security guarantees sought by the Ukrainians \u2014 that Trump wants.",
      "In his Tuesday address before a joint session of Congress, Trump acknowledged Zelenskyy\u2019s fence-mending efforts. Trump also announced plans to send top advisers to Saudi Arabia this week for talks with Ukrainian officials.",
      "But soon Trump was back to criticizing Zelenskyy, saying he does not have the leverage to keep fighting the war with Russia.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine, and they don\u2019t have the cards,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn terms of getting a final settlement, it may be easier dealing with Russia, which is surprising, because they have all the cards.\"",
      "Trump\u2019s push on Zelenskyy \u2014 and pivot toward Moscow \u2014 marks a significant departure from traditional U.S. foreign policy toward Russia since the Cold War.",
      "Others before Trump, including Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, have tried resets with Russia, but perhaps never at a time as fraught. Deep skepticism toward Moscow, even in the best moments in the relationship, has been the standard operating posture in both Republican and Democratic administrations.",
      "But Trump, who ran on a promise to quickly end the war, has veered from Democratic President Joe Biden's approach of making no major decision that could impact Ukraine without Kyiv's involvement.",
      "At the same time, the new Republican administration has taken steps toward a more cooperative line with Putin, for whom Trump has long shown admiration.",
      "Trump has ordered a pause on U.S. military aid for and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, halted offensive cyberoperations against Russia by U.S. Cyber Command and disbanded a program aimed at seizing the assets of Russian oligarchs as a means to punish the Kremlin for its invasion.",
      "Kellogg, who also served in Trump's first White House, recalled seeing Trump's \u201ctransactional diplomacy approach\u201d early in the first term. Kellogg said that the president's first question in meetings with foreign leaders was often the same.",
      "\"As I found the very first time we were in the Cabinet room when a foreign official came in, the comment was, \u2019What is the trade imbalance between our two nations?''' Kellogg recalled, speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations event.",
      "The trade ledger has been top of mind for Trump as he argues that for too long America has been played by friends and adversaries, including neighbors Canada and Mexico.",
      "Trump last week announced 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada amid widespread fears of the economic fallout from a broader trade war. He then postponed most of them.",
      "The White House insists the pending tariffs are about stopping the smuggling of fentanyl. Trump has also at times suggested that the tariffs could be resolved by fixing the trade deficit.",

      "Conservatives have long talked about cutting government, but Republicans in Congress have shied away from approving deep reductions because of fear of how voters would react",
      "DENVER -- For decades, conservatives in Congress have talked about the need to cut government deeply, but they have always pulled back from mandating specific reductions, fearful of voter backlash.",
      "Now, President Donald Trump's administration is trying to make major cuts in government through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, run by billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 an initiative led by an unelected businessman who's unlikely to ever run for office and was appointed by a termed-out president who no longer needs to face voters again.",
      "The dynamic of cutting government while also cutting out those who answer to voters has alarmed even some fiscal conservatives who have long pushed for Congress to reduce spending through the means laid out in the Constitution: a system of checks and balances that includes lawmakers elected across the country working with the president.",
      "\u201cSome members of the Trump administration got frustrated that Congress won't cut spending and decided to go around them,\u201d said Jessica Reidl of the conservative think tank The Manhattan Institute. Now, she said, \u201cno one who has to face voters again is determining spending levels.\u201d",
      "That may be changing.",
      "On Thursday, facing mounting court challenges to the legality of Musk ordering layoffs, Trump told his Cabinet that Musk could only make recommendations about government reductions. And there were more signs that Congress, after sitting on the sidelines for nearly the first two months of Trump's administration, is slowly getting back into the game.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican senators told Musk that he needed to ask Congress to approve specific cuts, which they can do on an up-or-down, filibuster-free vote through a process known as recission.",
      "Senators said Musk had never heard of the process before. That was a striking admission given that it's the only way for the executive branch to legally refuse to spend money that Congress has given it.",
      "\u201cTo make it real, to make it go beyond the moment of the day, it needs to come back in the form of a rescission package,\u201d said Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a longtime advocate of spending reductions who said he introduced the idea of recission to Musk during the lunch meeting of the GOP caucus.",
      "Of course, letting Congress have the final word may be constitutional, but it would open up the process to individual representatives or senators balking at cuts because of home-state interests or other concerns, as some have already. But Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and an economist in George W. Bush's administration, said that \u201cmessy\u201d process is a superior one.",
      "\u201cThere's always this instinct in people to insulate decisions from politics,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cIt's a mistake in a democracy. It's really messy. You're not going to get the cleanliness of a corporate reorganization.\u201d",
      "Riedl noted she has advocated for deep cuts for decades, but there's a reason Congress has balked.",
      "\u201cIf Congress won't pass certain spending cuts, it's because the American people don't want it enough,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I want spending levels to be cut, it's my job to persuade the people of America to agree with me.\u201d",
      "Trump and his supporters argue they did just that in the last presidential election when he promised to shake up Washington: \u201cThe people elected me to do the job and I\u2019m doing it,\u201d Trump said during his address to Congress last week.",
      "A corporate-style approach to government has long been the goal of conservatives, especially one segment that has recently called for a more CEO-style leader who is less tied down by democratic commitments to voters. Musk has embodied that, bringing the same disruptive, cost-cutting zeal he brought to his private companies. Some of his DOGE moves mirrored steps he took to slash the social media site Twitter, including the email offering buyouts, both times called \u201cFork in the Road.\u201d",
      "Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, said the effort seems more destructive than just an attempt to shrink government in ways conservatives have long advocated.",
      "\u201cIt is usurping the role of Congress on spending and program design, using cuts as a backdoor way to impound and close agencies created by Congress,\u201d Moynihan said. \u201cIt is implementing an unprecedented scale of disruption.\u201d",
      "Grover Norquist, an anti-tax activist whose pledge to make government small enough to \u201cdrown it in a bathtub\u201d has made him an icon for small-government conservatives, cheered the DOGE project. He said Congress has to authorize any real reductions, but hoped that DOGE's cuts show the legislative branch that voters will not panic when government is shrunk.",
      "\u201cIf we do something for three years, they'll make it the law,\u201d Norquist said of Congress. \u201cThey'll see it's safe, they'll see it's successful. They'll come in and put their name on it.\u201d",
      "Norquist acknowledged that Congress has repeatedly balked at the level of cuts that he would like to see, even under unified Republican control. He asserted that \u201c95%\u201d of Republicans support such reductions but \u201cthat wasn't enough to get it across the finish line\u201d in an era where the majority party usually only has a razor-thin margin of control in either chamber.",
      "The past nearly half-century of politics has been defined by conservatives pledging to cut government spending, only to see it continue to grow. Republican Ronald Reagan swept into the presidency in 1980 pledging to cut government, but when he left eight years later its size had increased. The trend continued through Trump\u2019s first term and during Democrat Joe Biden's presidency.",
      "Now, however, Trump will not face voters again, despite occasional quips about seeking a constitutionally prohibited third term. He has been open about his grudge against the federal bureaucracy, which he blames for many of his troubles during his initial four years in office.",
      "\u201cI don't think previous presidents have had the same animus towards the federal government this one has,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said.",
      "He noted that Trump has launched a second cost-cutting initiative through traditional channels \u2014 his own Office of Management and Budget, which asked agencies to prepare for mass layoffs. That, Holtz-Eakin said, makes those coming reductions likelier to stick than DOGE cuts.",
      "Holtz-Eakin said there are initial signs of voter discontent over the pace, depth and chaos of the cuts. \"The usual way you visit that on a president is you wipe out his party in the midterms,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cYou never evade the voters.\u201d"

      "A new law in South Dakota prohibiting the use of eminent domain to acquire land for carbon capture pipelines challenges the viability of a proposed project snaking through five Midwest states",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- A new law in South Dakota prohibiting the use of eminent domain to acquire land for carbon capture pipelines raises questions about the viability of a proposed 2,500 mile (4,023-kilometer) project snaking through five Midwest states.",
      "Summit Carbon Solutions, the company behind the estimated $8.9 billion pipeline, vowed to keep pursuing the project despite South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden's announcement Thursday that he had signed a bill into law that will make routing the line much more difficult. The law bans Summit from forcing South Dakota landowners to allow the pipeline through their property.",
      "Plans call for the pipeline to carry greenhouse gas emissions from more than 50 ethanol plants in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota to a spot in North Dakota, where it would be permanently stored underground.",
      "It's unclear whether Summit will pursue legal action but the company said in a statement that \u201call options are on the table\" and the project \u201cmoves forward\u201d in other states. The company promised it would have more news soon.",
      "Large pipeline projects typically rely on eminent domain, with companies arguing that even if most landowners agree to grant access to their property, a project can be scuttled if only a few refuse.",
      "Summit says the company, which has secured over 2,700 easements across the region, has approval for routes in Iowa and North Dakota and a leg in Minnesota.",
      "The current proposed route would cut through nearly 700 miles (1,126.5 kilometers) of South Dakota before entering North Dakota, so rerouting to the east through Minnesota would be a big challenge.",
      "A Summit spokesperson did not respond to questions Friday about whether the company would consider a new route.",
      "The sponsor of the South Dakota bill, Republican Rep. Karla Lems, said Summit could either reroute its pipeline through Minnesota into North Dakota or \u201cnegotiate with landowners in South Dakota\u201d and go around opponents.",
      "Gov. Rhoden said the South Dakota law wasn't intended to kill the project and suggested Summit see it as \u201can opportunity to reset.\u201d",
      "Minnesota is a relatively small part of Summit\u2019s overall project. The only segment approved in the state is a 28-mile (45-kilometer) leg from an ethanol plant near Fergus Falls to the North Dakota border. Summit\u2019s project also includes two legs in southern Minnesota that would go into Iowa.",
      "A Minnesota Public Utilities Commission spokesperson did not respond to phone or email messages.",
      "The country's transition to electric vehicles has been slower than many people expected, but most think a shift away from internal combustion engines will eventually happen.",
      "Nearly 40% of the nation's corn crop is brewed into ethanol, which is blended into most gasoline sold in the U.S. Midwest farmers and the ethanol industry therefore see it as essential to have new markets as less of the fuel additive goes to power cars.",
      "They see passenger jet fuel as a potentially huge new market for ethanol. However, under current rules the process for turning ethanol into aviation fuel would need to emit less carbon dioxide to qualify for tax breaks intended to reduce greenhouses.",
      "The carbon capture pipeline is a key part of achieving those goals, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said.",
      "Walt Wendland, who runs an ethanol plant in Onida, South Dakota, said the \u201cethanol industry is a margin business\u201d and the new state law will put South Dakota ethanol producers at a disadvantage.",
      "\u201cEver since I built a plant, I never wanted an advantage, just don\u2019t put me at a disadvantage,\u201d Wendland said.",
      "It has been four years since Summit proposed building the pipeline, along with two other companies that later abandoned their plans. It has been a challenging process for Summit, which dealt with lawsuits in Nebraska and elsewhere, opposition before a regulatory commission in Iowa and now the eminent domain ban in South Dakota.",
      "In its statement, Summit expressed optimism about the future but didn't offer specifics about how it could build a pipeline without eminent domain authority in South Dakota.",
      "Since the pipeline was proposed, the federal government\u2019s approach to climate change also has changed dramatically. Democratic President Joe Biden increased tax incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to encourage carbon capture as an effort to slow climate change.",
      "However, Republican President Donald Trump has emphasized the need for more oil and gas drilling and coal mining, and has put far less emphasis on alternative energy. Trump has not indicated whether his views will lead to changing federal policy regarding carbon capture pipelines.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The leaders of both Canada and Mexico got on the phone with President Donald Trump this past week to seek solutions after he slapped tariffs on their countries, but China\u2019s president appears unlikely to make a similar call soon.",
      "Beijing, which unlike America's close partners and neighbors has been locked in a trade and tech war with the U.S. for years, is taking a different approach to Trump in his second term, making it clear that any negotiations should be conducted on equal footing.",
      "China\u2019s leaders say they are open to talks, but they also made preparations for the higher U.S. tariffs, which have risen 20% since Trump took office seven weeks ago. Intent on not being caught off guard as they were during Trump's first term, the Chinese were ready with retaliatory measures \u2014 imposing their own taxes this past week on key U.S. farm imports and more.",
      "\u201cAs Washington escalates the tariff, Beijing doesn\u2019t see other options but to retaliate,\u201d said Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean Beijing doesn\u2019t want to negotiate, but it cannot be seen as begging for talks or mercy.\u201d",
      "As the world's second-largest economy, China aspires to be a great power on both the regional and global stage, commanding respect from all countries, especially the United States, as proof that the Communist Party has made China prosperous and strong.",
      "After the U.S. this past week imposed another 10% tariff, on top of the 10% imposed on Feb. 4, the Chinese foreign ministry uttered its sharpest retort yet: \u201cIf war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we\u2019re ready to fight till the end.\u201d",
      "The harsh rhetoric echoed similar comments in 2018, when Trump launched his first trade war with China and it scrambled to line up tit-for-tat actions. Beijing\u2019s leaders have since developed a toolkit of tariffs, import curbs, export controls, sanctions, regulatory reviews and measures to limit companies from doing business in China.",
      "All are designed to inflict pain on the U.S. economy and businesses in response to the American measures.",
      "That allowed the Chinese government to react swiftly to Trump\u2019s recent across-the-board doubling of new tariffs on Chinese goods by rolling out a basket of retaliatory measures, including taxing many American farm goods at up to 15%, suspending U.S. lumber imports and blacklisting 15 U.S. companies.",
      "Beijing showed restraint in its response to leave room for negotiation, analysts say.",
      "Xi Jinping\u2019s leadership of the ruling Communist Party spans both of Trump\u2019s terms, giving Beijing more continuity in its planning. He is the one who decided it's not yet time to speak with Trump, said Daniel Russel, vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not a scheduling issue, it\u2019s leverage for China,\u201d said Russel, who previously served as the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. \u201cXi won\u2019t walk into a call if there\u2019s a chance he\u2019ll be harassed or humiliated and for both political and strategic reasons, Xi won\u2019t play the role of a supplicant.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead, China is hitting back promptly \u2014 but judiciously \u2014 to each set of tariffs,\u201d Russel said.",
      "At his annual press conference Friday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that \u201cno country should fantasize that it can suppress, contain China while developing good relations with China.\u201d",
      "\u201cSuch two-faced acts not only are bad for the stability of bilateral relations but also will not build mutual trust,\" Wang said. He added that China welcomes cooperation with the U.S., but noted that \u201cif you keep pressuring, China will firmly retaliate.\u201d",
      "Scott Kennedy, a trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the Chinese this time are \u201cnot psychologically shocked\u201d by Trump\u2019s \u201cshock-and-awe\u201d tactics.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve seen this before,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThese are the kind of things that they\u2019ve anticipated.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s economy has slowed but is still growing at nearly a 5% annual pace, and under Xi, the party is investing heavily in advanced technology, education and other areas. It has stronger trade ties with many other countries than during Trump's first term and has diversified where it gets key products, for example, buying most of its soybeans from Brazil and Argentina instead of the U.S.",
      "In turn, the percentage of Chinese goods sold to the U.S. has fallen.",
      "\u201cThey are better prepared to absorb the effect of the shocks, compared to several years ago,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 80% of Mexico's exports go to the U.S., and Canada sends 75% of its exports here.",
      "China has learned from its previous dealings with Trump, Russel said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum are facing a reversal of Trump\u2019s previous trade policies, with tariffs imposed and then postponed twice on at least some goods.",
      "\u201cBeijing has seen enough to know that appeasing Trump doesn\u2019t work,\" Russel said. In the first go-around, Trudeau and Sheinbaum \"bought a little time, but the pressure only came roaring back stronger.\u201d",
      "Trudeau flew to Mar-a-Lago to meet Trump in December after the president-elect threatened tariffs. But in announcing retaliatory tariffs Tuesday, Trudeau sternly warned: \u201cThis is a time to hit back hard and to demonstrate that a fight with Canada will have no winners.\u201d",

      "Teixeira pleaded guilty last year to six counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information under the Espionage Act, following his arrest in the most consequential national security breach in years.",
      "In his court-martial, Teixeira faces charges of disobeying orders and obstructing justice. At a hearing last year, military prosecutors said a court-martial is appropriate given that obeying orders is the \u201cabsolute core\u201d of the military. But Teixeira\u2019s lawyers argued that further action would amount to prosecuting him twice for the same offense.",

Teixeira also admitted posting information about a U.S. adversary\u2019s plans to harm U.S. forces serving overseas.",
      "Before he was sentenced in November in U.S. District Court in Boston, Teixeira showed little emotion as he stood in court and apologized for his actions.

      "Facing spiking energy demand, U.S. states are pressing for ways to build new power plants faster as policymakers try to protect residents from higher electric bills and keep their economies on track",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Facing projections of spiking energy demand, U.S. states are pressing for ways to build new power plants faster as policymakers increasingly worry about protecting their residents and economies from rising electric bills, power outages and other consequences of falling behind Big Tech in a race for electricity.",
      "Some states are dangling financial incentives. Others are undoing decades of regulatory structures in what they frame as a race to serve the basic needs of residents, avoid a catastrophe and keep their economies on track in a fast-electrifying society.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen anything quite like this,\u201d said Todd Snitchler, president and CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, which represents independent power plant owners.",
      "The spike in demand for electricity is being driven, in large part, by the artificial intelligence race as tech companies are snapping up real estate and seeking power to feed their energy-hungry data centers. Federal incentives to rebuild the manufacturing sector also are helping drive demand.",
      "In some cases, Big Tech is arranging its own power projects.",
      "But energy companies also are searching for ways to capitalize on opportunities afforded by the first big increase in electricity consumption in a couple of decades, and that is pitting state political leaders against each other for the new jobs and investment that come with new power plants.",
      "Moves by states come as a fossil fuel - friendly President Donald Trump and Republican-controlled Congress take power in Washington, D.C., slashing regulations around oil and gas, boostingdrilling opportunities and encouraging the construction of pipelines and refineries that can export liquefied natural gas.",
      "States are seeking action, with the National Governors Association asking Congress to make it easier and faster to build power plants and criticizing the U.S. as among the slowest developed nations in approving energy projects.",
      "But there may be less that the federal government can do right away about a looming power shortage, since greenlighting power plants to feed the electric grid is largely the province of state regulators and regional grid operators.",
      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro wants to establish an agency to fast-track the construction of big power plants and dangle hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks for projects providing electricity to the grid.",
      "The state, and the country, needs more power plants to win the artificial intelligence race and provide reliable and affordable power to residents, said Shapiro, who suggested Pennsylvania may leave the regional grid operated by PJM Interconnection in favor of \u201cgoing it alone.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has proven over the last number of years too darn hard to get enough new generation projects off the ground because of how slow PJM\u2018s queue is,\u201d Shapiro told a news conference on Feb. 27.",
      "Indiana, Michigan and Louisiana are exploring ideas to attract nuclear power while Maryland lawmakers are floating ideas about commissioning the construction of a new power plant there.",
      "In Ohio, a lawmaker wants to restrict the influence of electric utilities in hopes of giving independent power producers more incentive to build power plants to feed the state's fast-growing tech sector.",
      "The bill, which awaits a vote, won the support of the Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel, the state's residential ratepayer watchdog, and business groups whose members care about electric prices. However, it split the energy sector between companies operating in competitive markets and those operating under state utility monopolies.",
      "In Missouri, utilities including Ameren and Evergy, as well as the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, labor unions and the state's top utility regulator are backing legislation to repeal a nearly half-century old law preventing utilities from charging customers to build a power plant until it is operational.",
      "The law was approved in a 1976 voter referendum when states were looking to hedge against utilities saddling ratepayers with financing upfront, potentially bloated, inefficient or, worse, aborted power projects.",
      "Consumer and environmental groups protested the bill, saying it would result in new natural gas plants that are likelier to be more costly to ratepayers.",
      "Last year, similar legislation passed almost unanimously in Kansas, along with companion legislation extending tax breaks to new power plants.",
      "Within months, Evergy announced alongside the state's leaders that it would build two 705-megawatt natural gas plants and said the legislation will \u201chelp Kansas compete with other states for investment and ultimately save customers money.\u201d",
      "John Coffman, the utility consumer counsel for the Consumers Council of Missouri, said utilities are playing the two states, Missouri and Kansas, against each other and were planning to build the power plants anyway.",
      "But, he said, \u201cThey're just looking for opportunities to squeeze more money out of the process.\"",
      "Snitchler said action is being spurred by states realizing that longstanding power reserves are dwindling, especially as coal-fired and nuclear power plants retire, and now all sorts of power companies are leaping at the chance to make money.",
      "A pitfall he sees in the race to build plants is an undoing of protections that some states once adopted to shield ratepayers and put the risk of building expensive power projects onto corporate shareholders.",
      "\u201cThe problem, of course, is it shifts the risk back on the people who perhaps should not be bearing it,\u201d Snitchler said.",
      "A Pennsylvania state lawmaker, Sen. Gene Yaw, wants to set up a massive power plant-financing fund like Texas, which established a $10 billion low-interest loan program after the state was wracked by a deadly winter blackout in 2021.",
      "Yaw, a Republican, has no misgivings about Pennsylvania helping finance power plants. Even by conservative estimates, the state will need dozens more power plants to meet projections of rising demand, he said.",
      "\u201cAnd what do we have underway or planned right now? Nothing,\" Yaw said. \"And we haven\u2019t built anything since 2019. So we\u2019ve got to do something to encourage people to come here and build in Pennsylvania just to maintain the status quo.\"",

      "Alabama this weekend is marking the 60th anniversary of a key event in the civil rights movement, when voting rights marchers were attacked in Selma on March 7, 1965",
      "SELMA, Ala. -- Charles Mauldin was near the front of a line of voting rights marchers walking in pairs across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama on March 7, 1965.",
      "The marchers were protesting white officials\u2019 refusal to allow Black Alabamians to register to vote, as well as the killing days earlier of Jimmie Lee Jackson, a minister and voting rights organizer who was shot by a state trooper in nearby Marion.",
      "At the apex of the span over the Alabama River, they saw what awaited them: a line of state troopers, deputies and men on horseback. After they approached, law enforcement gave a warning to disperse and then unleashed violence.",
      "\u201cWithin about a minute or a half, they took their billy clubs, holding it on both ends, began to push us back to back us in, and then they began to beat men, women and children, and tear gas men, women and children, and cattle prod men, women and children viciously,\u201d said Mauldin, who was 17 at the time.",
      "Selma on Sunday marked the 60th anniversary of the clash that became known as Bloody Sunday. The attack shocked the nation and galvanized support for the U.S. Voting Rights Act of 1965. The annual commemoration paid homage to those who fought to secure voting rights for Black Americans and brought calls to recommit to the fight for equality.",
      "For foot soldiers of the movement, the celebration comes amid concerns about new voting restrictions and the Trump administration\u2019s effort to remake federal agencies they said helped make America a democracy for all",
      "\u201cThis country was not a democracy for Black folks until that happened,\u201d Mauldin said of voting rights. \u201cAnd we\u2019re still constantly fighting to make that a more concrete reality for ourselves.\u201d",
      "Speaking at the pulpit of the city\u2019s historic Tabernacle Baptist Church, the site of the first mass meeting of the voting rights movement, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said what happened in Selma changed the nation. But he said the 60th anniversary comes at a time when there is \u201ctrouble all around\u201d and some \u201cwant to whitewash our history.\u201d But he said like the marchers of Bloody Sunday, they must keep going.",
      "\u201cAt this moment, faced with trouble on every side, we\u2019ve got to press on,\u201d Jeffries said to the crowd that included the Rev. Jesse Jackson, multiple members of Congress and others gathered for the commemoration.",
      "U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell of Alabama said they are gathering in Selma for the 60th anniversary \u201cat a time when the vote is in peril.\u201d",
      "Sewell noted the number of voting restrictions introduced since the U.S. Supreme Court effectively abolished a key part of the Voting Rights Act that required jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination to pre-clear new voting laws with the Justice Department",
      "Sewell this week reintroduced legislation to restore the requirement. The proposal has repeatedly stalled in Congress. The legislation is named for John Lewis, the late Georgia congressman who was at the lead of the Bloody Sunday march.",
      "The annual celebration will conclude with a ceremony and march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. At the time, the Bloody Sunday marchers walked in pairs across the Selma bridge. Mauldin was in the third pair of the line led by Lewis and Hosea Williams.",
      "\u201cWe had steeled our nerves to a point where we were so determined that we were willing to confront. It was past being courageous. We were determined, and we were indignant,\u201d Mauldin recalled in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Mauldin, who took a blow to the head, said he believes law enforcement officers were trying to incite a riot as they attacked marchers.",
      "Kirk Carrington was just 13 on Bloody Sunday. As the violence erupted, a white man on a horse wielding a stick a chased him all the way back to the public housing projects where his family lived.",
      "Carrington said he started marching after witnessing his father get belittled by his white employers when his father returned from service in World War II. Standing in Tabernacle Baptist Church where he was trained in non-violent protest tactics 60 years earlier, he was brought to tears thinking about what the people of his city achieved.",
      "\u201cWhen we started marching, we did not know the impact we would have in America. We knew after we got older and got grown that the impact it not only had in Selma, but the impact it had in the entire world,\u201d Carrington said.",
      "Dr. Verdell Lett Dawson, who grew up in Selma, remembers a time when she was expected to lower her gaze if she passed a white person on the street to avoid making eye contact.",
      "Dawson and Mauldin said they are concerned about the potential dismantling of the Department of Education and other changes to federal agencies. Trump has pushed to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the federal government.",
      "Support from the federal government \u201cis how Black Americans have been able to get justice, to get some semblance of equality, because left to states\u2019 rights, it is going to be the white majority that\u2019s going to rule,\u201d Dawson said.",
      "\u201cThat that\u2019s a tragedy of 60 years later: what we are looking at now is a return to the 1950s,\u201d Dawson said."

    "summary": "Amy Gleason, the acting administrator of the U.S. DOGE Service, is not a household name",
    "story": [
      "Amy Gleason, the acting administrator of the U.S. DOGE Service, is not a household name",
      "When her daughter was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease in 2010, Amy Gleason attacked the challenge.",
      "She carried binders of medical records to doctors\u2019 appointments across six health systems seeking the best care for juvenile dermatomyositis. She volunteered at a nonprofit searching for a cure. She also started a health care company to create record-sharing software that would make life easier for chronically ill patients and families.",
      "Within five years, President Barack Obama\u2019s White House recognized Gleason as a \u201cChampion of Change\u201d in the industry. When the coronavirus struck in 2020, she was a health care technologist in the first Trump White House who worked grueling hours building data systems to guide the federal response. (And her daughter was a thriving college student.)",
      "Now, her journey has improbably led to President Donald Trump naming her the acting administrator of the U.S. DOGE Service, a position that seems to convey extraordinary power. Except almost no one has heard of her and everyone knows the man the president says is actually leading the unparalleled effort to gut the federal workforce and shutter agencies: Elon Musk.",
      "While Musk has claimed his Department of Government Efficiency is fully transparent, until last week the White House press secretary would not even say Gleason's name \u2014 which does not appear on the DOGE website.",
      "In his address to Congress Tuesday, Trump made clear that Musk is in charge, saluting him as the head of DOGE, with Musk smiling down on the president from the visitors' gallery. Yet government lawyers have argued in court that Gleason and not Musk is the agency\u2019s leader.",
      "The confusion has added to the mystery around the role of Gleason, who did not respond to a phone call or text message for comment.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone really knows for sure what her role is and whether she actually has any oversight of any of the people doing the work, or is she just there as a punching bag and a distraction to keep their actual activities shielded from the public,\u201d said Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group that sued the DOGE Service and Gleason seeking access to records that would shed light on their operations.",
      "DOGE claims credit for saving more than $100 billion through mass firings, cancellations of contracts and grants, office closures and other cuts that have paralyzed entire agencies. Many of those claimed savings have turned out to be overstated or unproven.",
      "On one level, Gleason fits the mold of a Musk employee, one willing to work arduous hours to meet his goals. Former colleagues say she is an effective behind-the-scenes operator and say her rise is the story of a former nurse who got into health care technology to help patients and doctors and climbed through merit.",
      "\u201cFrom my perspective, I can\u2019t imagine somebody I\u2019d rather have there,\u201d said Jamie Grant, a former Republican lawmaker in Florida who worked with Gleason to start a health care company. \u201cSomebody saying yes to that job right now better believe in the mission and better have a spine and be talented and she\u2019s that in spades.\u201d",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Gleason had served as the acting administrator at DOGE for weeks. But that was not the widely held understanding of her position internally, according to three people with knowledge of the office\u2019s operation who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution.",
      "While the exact nature of Gleason\u2019s portfolio was not well defined, what was clear is that she was working closely with DOGE leaders. She attempted to push civil service staffers in the office to hire at least two people who failed screening reviews for prospective hires; both were later hired by DOGE, according to two of the people who spoke to The Associated Press.",
      "The uncertainty over her role \u2014 and when she was appointed to it \u2014 could have far-reaching implications in a series of ongoing lawsuits filed to blunt the impact of Musk's radical paring of the government workforce.",
      "Under questioning from U.S. District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly recently, government attorneys struggled to explain who was in charge of DOGE or Musk's precise role. That led Kollar-Kotelly to wonder if the office was running afoul of the Constitution\u2019s appointments clause because Musk had not been nominated to lead the office, or received confirmation from the Senate.",
      "The Trump administration announced the following day that Gleason was DOGE's acting administrator, a question they had previously refused to answer.",
      "Unlike many DOGE workers, Gleason has no prior ties to Musk. She recently worked as chief products officer at Nashville-based health care firms founded by Brad Smith, who worked in the prior Trump administration on health care and is also a DOGE adviser.",
      "Smith and Gleason began working on Trump\u2019s transition after the November election, and her role in Trump's orbit has grown. In December, she rejoined the United States Digital Service, where she had previously worked from 2018 through 2021 on high-level government health care technology initiatives.",
      "On his first day back in office, Trump signed an executive order rebranding USDS as the US DOGE Service and giving it a mandate to help Musk\u2019s cost-cutting initiative. Soon, dozens of Musk acolytes associated with DOGE began arriving at agencies across the government demanding access to sensitive data systems and pushing for drastic changes.",
      "While 21 others in the office resigned in protest rather than carry out Musk\u2019s initiatives, Gleason accepted a position that thrust her into an unfamiliar spotlight.",
      "Health care entrepreneur Travis Bond, Gleason\u2019s colleague over two decades at companies in Florida, said Gleason will hate the public attention but excel in her new role.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure they could have picked a better person. She just thinks, eats and breathes this stuff,\u201d he said.",
      "Bond, Gleason and Grant in 2011 launched CareSync Inc., which developed an app to allow patients suffering from chronic disease to keep their medical records in one place. After benefiting from a $7.25 million grant from one Florida county, CareSync found it hard to attract buyers for subscriptions that cost up to $199 annually.",
      "CareSync pivoted in 2015, taking advantage of a new federal rule that allowed Medicare providers to bill for chronic care management services delivered remotely. The company raised millions of dollars from investors and began rapidly adding staff and serving more than 20,000 patients nationwide. By summer 2018, CareSync ran out of cash and closed without notice, firing 300 workers and leaving creditors owed millions.",
      "Gleason recalled later that she was \u201ctrying to figure out what in the world to do in life\u201d after that experience and applied for the USDS with encouragement from Aneesh Chopra, U.S. chief technology officer under Obama. Chopra declined comment.",
      "She focused on improving technology systems at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. During the pandemic, she worked under White House response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx to develop laboratory and hospital data reporting systems. Birx praised Gleason last week in an interview with CNN as a \u201creally competent, hardworking, focused woman who understands the value of data.\u201d",
      "Near the end of her three-year stint in 2021, Gleason reflected on her work in a podcast interview, saying the digital service sought to \u201cempower the civil servants and to bring new approaches in technology to the government and to help modernize their efforts.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur mission is really to do the greatest good, for the greatest number of people, in the greatest need,\u201d she said."

      "Hantavirus, found throughout the world, is spread by contact with rodents or their urine or feces. It does not spread between people. There is no specific treatment or cure, but early medical attention can increase the chance of survival.",
      "An infection can rapidly progress and become life-threatening.",
      "\u201cIt really starts like the flu: body aches, feeling poorly overall,\u201d said Dr. Sonja Bartolome of UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. \u201cEarly in the illness, you really may not be able to tell the difference between hantavirus and having the flu.\u201d",
      "The virus can cause a severe and sometimes deadly lung infection called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency began tracking the virus after a 1993 outbreak in the Four Corners region \u2014 the area where Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah meet.",
      "The majority of U.S. cases since then have been in western states, especially the southwest. Between 1993 and 2022, there were 864 reported U.S. cases. New Mexico had the highest number over that time, at 122, followed by Colorado at 119.",
      "The CDC has offered to test samples involved in Arakawa's case to learn more about the strain of virus that infected her and to perform pathology testing.",
      "New Mexico reported a total of 129 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome with 52 deaths between 1975 and 2023. according to the state health department. That includes seven in 2023 and another seven in 2024.",
      "Symptoms start one to eight weeks after exposure and initially can include fatigue, fever and muscle aches, according to the CDC. As the disease progresses, symptoms can include coughing, shortness of breath and tightness in the chest as the lungs fill with fluid. About a third of people who develop respiratory symptoms from the disease can die, the CDC says.",
      "\u201cIf you are ill and then progressing to the sort of symptoms interfering with the things you would normally do during the day, you do need to seek medical attention,\u201d Bartolome said.",
      "The best way to avoid the germ is to minimize contact with rodents and their droppings. Use protective gloves and a bleach solution for cleaning up rodent droppings. Public health experts caution against sweeping or vacuuming which can cause virus to get into the air.",

      "State Sen. Colton Moore, a Republican from Trenton, had sought the arrest warrant against Keith Williams, a lawyer in the House speaker's office, after the two men were involved in a scuffle outside the House chamber in January.

      "WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department on Friday celebrated its decision to drop a federal lawsuit against a Louisiana petrochemical plant accused of worsening cancer risks for residents in a majority-Black community, saying the dismissal showed that officials are \u201cdelivering on President (Donald) Trump\u2019s promise to dismantle radical DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) programs and restore integrity to federal enforcement efforts.\u201d",
      "The dismissal Wednesday of the two-year-old case underscored the Trump administration's commitment to \u201celiminate ideological overreach and restore impartial enforcement of federal laws,'' Justice said in a statement.",
      "At the same time, the Environmental Protection Agency withdrew its formal referral of the case to the Justice Department. The agency said the action aligns with EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin\u2019s pledge to end the use of \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d as an enforcement tool that Zeldin was too often used to advance liberal ideological priorities.",
      "Dismissal of the case unraveled one of former President Joe Biden\u2019s highest-profile targets for an environmental justice effort aimed at improving conditions in places disproportionately harmed by decades of industrial pollution. Biden\u2019s EPA sued the Denka Performance Elastomer plant in early 2023, alleging it posed an unacceptable cancer risk and demanding cuts in toxic emissions of cancer-causing chloroprene.",

      "The action is one of a series the Trump administration has taken as it moves quickly to reverse the environmental justice focus of Biden\u2019s administration, placing roughly 170 environmental justice-focused staffers on administrative leave. Dropping the Denka case relieves pressure on a company that has spent years fighting federal lawsuits and investigations over its impact on public health.",
      "Denka, based in Japan, bought the former DuPont plant in LaPlace, Louisiana, a decade ago. It\u2019s located near an elementary school in a community about 30 miles outside New Orleans.",
      "The site produces neoprene, a synthetic rubber that is found in products such as wetsuits and laptop sleeves. The Justice Department sued the company in early 2023, accusing it of emitting unacceptable levels of chloroprene, a chemical that may be especially harmful to children. A judge had scheduled a bench trial for April.",
      "Dismissal of the case reflects the Justice Department's \u201crenewed commitment to enforce environmental laws as Congress intended \u2014 consistently, fairly and without regard to race,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson, who oversees the department\u2019s Environment and Natural Resources Division.",
      "Zeldin, a former Republican congressman who took over the EPA in late January, said the dismissal was \u201ca step toward ensuring that environmental enforcement is consistent with the law. While EPA\u2019s core mission includes securing clean air for all Americans, we can fulfill that mission within well-established legal frameworks, without stretching the bounds of the law or improperly implementing so-called \u2018environmental justice.'\u201d",
      "Denka said the dismissal was \u201clong-overdue\u201d and ends litigation that it said lacked scientific and legal merit. The lawsuit was a \u201cdraining attack on our business,\" the company said.",
      "\u201cThe focus should be on the real-world data that shows no adverse health effects, even at substantially higher emission levels,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "The government\u2019s lawsuit said air monitoring showed that long-term concentrations near the Denka plant are as high as 15 times the amount recommended for long-term exposure to chloroprene.",
      "The EPA under Biden issued a related rule aimed at reducing industrial pollution that gave Denka a fast deadline to lower its emissions. The company said it was being singled out and other manufacturers were given far more time to comply. The company also said the plant has significantly reduced its emissions in recent years, since the sale was completed in 2015. The company won an extension of its deadline.",
      "The Denka plant is located in an industrial stretch of Louisiana from New Orleans to Baton Rouge that is officially called the Mississippi River Chemical Corridor. It\u2019s known informally as Cancer Alley for the high incidence of cancer among residents who live near the industrial corridor, which has about 200 fossil fuel and petrochemical operations. The area accounts for about 25% of the petrochemical production in the United States."

    "summary": "President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's campaign of disruption is engulfing the federal government",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's campaign of disruption is engulfing the federal government",
      "WASHINGTON -- A series of decisions revealed Friday provided a glimpse of the turmoil engulfing federal agencies since President Donald Trump and Elon Musk launched their campaign of disruption, upending how government functions in ways big and small.",
      "Some changes appeared designed to increase political control over agencies that have historically operated with some degree of autonomy, such as requiring Environmental Protection Agency officials to seek approval from the Department of Government Efficiency for any contracts exceeding $50,000.",
      "Other directives increased burdens on federal workers, who have already endured insults, layoffs and threats from the president and other top officials. For example, government credit cards issued to civilian employees at the Pentagon were altered to have a $1 limit, choking off their ability to travel for work.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration became another target. The administration canceled a collective bargaining agreement with 47,000 workers who screen travelers and luggage at airports around the country, eliminating union protections in a possible prelude to layoffs or privatization.",
      "The cascading developments are only a fraction of the upheaval that's taken place since Trump took office, but they still reshaped how hundreds of thousands of public servants do their jobs, with potentially enduring consequences. The ongoing shakeup is much more intense than the typical whiplash that Washington endures when one administration gives way to another, raising fundamental questions about how government will function under a president who has viewed civil servants as an obstacle to his agenda.",
      "The White House has wrestled with political blowback over Musk\u2019s role and legal challenges that have tried to block or slow down his work. Republicans who are facing growing pressure in contentious town halls have started to speak up.",
      "\u201cI will fully admit, I think Elon Musk has tweeted first and thought second sometimes,\u201d said Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., during a virtual meeting with constituents on Friday. \u201cHe has plunged ahead without necessarily knowing and understanding what he legally has to do or what he is going to be doing.\u201d",
      "The overhaul of the federal government is happening at lightning speed, reflecting years of preparation by Trump's allies and the president's decision to grant Musk sweeping influence over his administration. Musk, a billionaire entrepreneur with no previous experience in public service, has shown no interest in slowing down despite admitting that he'll make mistakes in his crusade to slash spending and downsize the workforce.",
      "The government is facing even more dramatic changes in the coming weeks and months. Trump has directed agencies to prepare plans for widespread layoffs, known as reductions in force, that will likely require more limited operations at agencies that provide critical services.",
      "The Department of Veterans Affairs could shed 80,000 employees, while the Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security Administration are considering plans that would cut their workforces in half.",
      "Trump has vowed not to reduce Social Security benefits, but Democrats argue that layoffs would make it harder to deliver payments to 72.5 million people, including retirees and children.",
      "There are also concerns that politics could interfere with Social Security. Trump has feuded over transgender issues with Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, and his administration recently said children born in the state would no longer have a Social Security number assigned at birth. Instead, parents would have to apply for one at a local office.",
      "Leland Dudek, the acting commissioner of Social Security, rescinded the order on Friday.",
      "\u201cIn retrospect, I realize that ending these contracts created an undue burden on the people of Maine, which was not the intent,\u201d he said in a statement. Dudek added that \u201cas a leader, I will admit my mistakes and make them right.\u201d",
      "More than a month after Trump took office, there\u2019s still confusion about Musk\u2019s authority. In public statements and legal filings, administration officials have insisted that Musk does not actually run DOGE and has no direct authority over budgets.",
      "But Trump has contradicted both statements. He said Tuesday that DOGE is \u201cheaded by Elon Musk\u201d in a prime-time speech to a joint session of Congress, and he said Thursday that \u201cElon will do the cutting\u201d if agency leaders don\u2019t reduce their spending.",
      "Their approach has energized people like David Sacks, a venture capitalist serving as a Trump adviser on cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence, who praised the administration as moving \u201cfaster than any startup that I\u2019ve been part of.\u201d",
      "Trump denied reports of friction between Musk and Cabinet officials, particularly Secretary of State Marco Rubio, during a meeting Thursday.",
      "\u201cElon gets along great with Marco,\u201d the president said. The State Department had no immediate comment.",
      "Norm Eisen, executive chair of State Democracy Defenders Fund, an organization that has been suing the Trump administration, said the president \u201cmade clear that Musk and DOGE have been calling the shots.\u201d",
      "Musk serves as a presidential adviser, not a Senate-confirmed official, which Eisen argued makes his role unconstitutional. He said Trump's comments are \"an admission that the vast chaos that Musk and DOGE have wrought without proper approval and documentation is illegal \u2014 and so must be completely unwound.\u201d",
      "Many of the changes sweeping through Washington were ignited by Trump's executive orders. One order issued last week said agencies must develop new systems for distributing and justifying payments so they can be monitored by DOGE representatives.",
      "The EPA distributed guidance intended to ensure compliance.",
      "\u201cAny assistance agreement, contract or interagency agreement transaction (valued at) $50,000 or greater must receive approval from an EPA DOGE team member,\" said the documents obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said the involvement of Musk\u2019s \u201cunvetted, inexperienced team raises serious concerns about improper external influence on specialized agency decision-making.\u201d",
      "Republicans have shied away from holding town hall meetings with constituents after critics started using them to vent their frustration.",
      "Some protesters gathered outside Huizenga's district office in Holland, Michigan, calling on him to answer questions in person.",
      "\u201cI would like to ask him why he thinks that someone like Musk can go in and simply blow up agencies without seemingly even knowing what they\u2019re doing,\u201d said Linda Visscher, a Holland resident.",
      "She said increasing the efficiency of government was a good idea, but she doesn't agree with \u201cjust taking the blowtorch to it.\"",
      "____",

      "In much of his victory speech, Carney, 59, attacked Trump, who has imposed tariffs on Canada and said he wants to make the country the 51st US state. \"Americans should make no mistake,\" he said. \"In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.\"",

      "Carney, who will lead a minority government in parliament, could either call a snap general election himself or opposition parties could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month.",
      "The governing Liberals have seen a remarkable political turnaround since Trudeau's exit, as Canadians have been galvanised by Donald Trump's trade threats and support for annexing their country",
      "At the beginning of the year, they trailed the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, by more than 20 points in election polls.",
      "They have since narrowed the gap and some polls show them statistically tied with Poilievre's party.",
      "Much of Carney's speech focused on what he called Trump's \"unjustified tariffs\" on Canada, America's largest trading partner.",
      "The US imposed levies of 25% on Canadian goods last Tuesday, but rowed back within days to exempt goods compliant with an existing trade agreement.",

      "\"We're getting over the shock, but let us never forget the lessons: we have to look after ourselves and we have to look out for each other. We need to pull together in the tough days ahead.\"",
      "Carney also pledged to \"secure our borders\" - a key demand of Trump who has accused Canada of failing to control the flow of migrants and fentanyl going south.",
      "The US president even got a mention in Carney's attacks on his main opponent, Conservative leader Poilievre.",
      "\"Pierre Poilievre's plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,\" said Carney.",
      "\"Because a person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him, not stand up to him.\"",
      "Shortly before Carney took to the stage, Trudeau gave an emotional farewell speech, reflecting on his 12 years as Liberal leader.",
      "He warned that Canada was facing an \"existential challenge\" from the US under Trump.",
      "The Conservatives have had to pivot politically since Trudeau's resignation, and are attacking Carney as not representing change but rather being \"just like Justin\".",
      "They accuse the Liberals of a \"sneaky\" plan to win a fourth term by simply substituting their leader.",

Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States.",

      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "In his time at the Bank's Threadneedle Street headquarters, he oversaw considerable changes in how the institution worked. At the start of his tenure, the Bank assumed responsibility for financial regulation after the abolition of the Financial Services Authority.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",

      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Mr Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Carney's time at the bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "He is also known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "His political ambitions have been rumoured for years, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",

      "The problem was in bits of software called APIs (application programming interfaces), which allow different computer systems to talk to each other.",
      "The engineer says that at Medefer those APIs were not properly secured, and could potentially have been accessed by outsiders, who would have been able to see patient information.",
      "He said it was unlikely that patient information was taken from Medefer, but that without a full investigation, the company could not have known for sure.",
      "\"I've worked in organisations where, if something like this happened, the whole system would be taken down immediately,\" he said.",
      "On discovering the flaw the engineer told the company that an external cybersecurity expert should be bought in to investigate the problem, which he says the company did not do.",
      "Medefer says the external security agency has confirmed that it has found no evidence of any breach of data and that all the company's data systems were currently secure.",
      "It says the process of investigating and fixing the API flaw was \"extremely open\".",
      "Medefer said it had reported the issue to the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office)  and the CQC (Care Quality Commission), \"in the interests of transparency\", and that the ICO had confirmed there is no further action to be taken as there is no evidence of a breach.",
      "The engineer, who had been contracted in October to test for flaws in the company's software, left the company in January.",
      "In a statement Dr Bahman Nedjat-Shokouhi, founder and CEO of Medefer, said: \"There is no evidence of any patient data breach from our systems.\"",
      "He confirmed that the flaw had been discovered in November and a fix was developed in 48 hours.",
      "\"The external security agency has asserted that the allegation that this flaw could have provided access to large amounts of patients' data is categorically false.\"",
      "The security agency will complete its review later this week.",
      "Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi added: \"We take our duties to patients and the NHS very seriously. We hold regular external security audits of our systems by independent external security agencies, undertaken on multiple occasions every year.\"",
      "Cybersecurity experts, who have looked at information supplied by the software engineer, have expressed their concern.",
      "\"There is the possibility that Medefer stored data derived from the NHS not as securely as one would hope it would be,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey.",
      "\"The database might be encrypted and all the other precautions taken, but if there is a way of glitching the API authorisation, anyone who knows how could potentially gain access,\" he added.",
      "Another expert pointed out that as Medefer deals with highly-sensitive, medical data, the company should have bought in cybersecurity experts as soon as the problem was identified.",
      "\"Even if the company suspected that no data was stolen, when facing an issue that could have resulted in a data breach, especially with data of the nature in question, an investigation and confirmation from a suitably qualified cybersecurity expert would be advisable,\" says Scott Helme, a security researcher.",
      "Medefer was founded in 2013 by Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi, with a goal to improve outpatient care. Since then its technology has been used by NHS trusts across the country.",
      "In a statement the NHS spokesperson said those trusts are responsible for their contracts with the private sector.",
      "\"Individual NHS organisations must ensure they meet their legal responsibilities and national data security standards to protect patient data when appointing suppliers, and we offer them support and training nationally on how this should be done.\""

      "Hackers thought to be working for the North Korean regime have successfully cashed out at least $300m (\u00a3232m) of their record-breaking $1.5bn crypto heist.",
      "The criminals, known as Lazarus Group, swiped the huge haul of digital tokens in a hack on crypto exchange ByBit two weeks ago.",
      "Since then, it's been a cat-and-mouse game to track and block the hackers from successfully converting the crypto into usable cash.",
      "Experts say the infamous hacking team is working nearly 24 hours a day - potentially funnelling the money into the regime's military development.",
      "\"Every minute matters for the hackers who are trying to confuse the money trail and they are extremely sophisticated in what they're doing,\" says Dr Tom Robinson, co-founder of crypto investigators Elliptic.",
      "Out of all the criminal actors involved in crypto currency, North Korea is the best at laundering crypto, Dr Robinson says.",
      "\"I imagine they have an entire room of people doing this using automated tools and years of experience. We can also see from their activity that they only take a few hours break each day, possibly working in shifts to get the crypto turned into cash.\"",
      "Elliptic's analysis tallies with ByBit, which says that 20% of the funds have now \"gone dark\", meaning it is unlikely to ever be recovered.",
      "The US and allies accuse the North Koreans of carrying out dozens of hacks in recent years to fund the regime's military and nuclear development.",
      "On 21 February the criminals hacked one of ByBit's suppliers to secretly alter the digital wallet address that 401,000 Ethereum crypto coins were being sent to.",
      "ByBit thought it was transferring the funds to its own digital wallet, but instead sent it all to the hackers.",
      "Ben Zhou, the CEO of ByBit, assured customers that none of their funds had been  taken.",
      "The firm has since replenished the stolen coins with loans from investors, but is, in Zhou's words, \"waging war on Lazarus\".",
      "ByBit's Lazarus Bounty programme is encouraging members of the public to trace the stolen funds and get them frozen where possible.",
      "All crypto transactions are displayed on a public blockchain, so it's possible to track the money as it's moved around by the Lazarus Group.",
      "If the hackers try to use a mainstream crypto service to attempt to turn the coins into normal money like dollars, the crypto coins can be frozen by the company if they think they are linked to crime.",
      "So far 20 people have shared more than $4m in rewards for successfully identifying $40m of the stolen money and alerting crypto firms to block transfers.",
      "But experts are downbeat about the chances of the rest of the funds being recoverable, given the North Korean expertise in hacking and laundering the money.",
      "\"North Korea is a very closed system and closed economy so they created a successful industry for hacking and laundering and they don't care about the negative impression of cyber crime,\" Dr Dorit Dor from cyber security company Check Point said.",
      "Another problem is that not all crypto companies are as willing to help as others.",
      "Crypto exchange eXch is being accused by ByBit and others of not stopping the criminals cashing out.",
      "More than $90m has been successfully funnelled through this exchange.",
      "But over email the elusive owner of eXch - Johann Roberts - disputed that.",
      "He admits they didn't initially stop the funds, as his company is in a long-running dispute with ByBit, and he says his team wasn't sure the coins were definitely from the hack.",
      "He says he is now co-operating, but argues that mainstream companies that identify crypto customers are betraying the private and anonymous benefits of crypto currency.",
      "North Korea has never admitted being behind the Lazarus Group, but is thought to be the only country in the world using its hacking powers for financial gain.",
      "Previously the Lazarus Group hackers targeted banks, but have in the last five years specialised in attacking cryptocurrency companies.",
      "The industry is less well protected with fewer mechanisms in place to stop them laundering the funds.",
      "Recent hacks linked to North Korea include:",
      "The 2019 hack on UpBit for $41mThe $275m theft of crypto from exchange KuCoin (most of the funds were recovered)The 2022 Ronin Bridge attack which saw hackers make off with $600m in cryptoApproximately $100m in crypto was stolen in an attack on Atomic Wallet in 2023",

      "And while most of us don't have access to these lounges, experts say we are almost certainly helping pay for them. And they don't come cheap.",
      "\"Yes, it's an arms race, and they're getting extraordinary,\" says Clint Thompson, the news editor at the flight and travel website The Points Guy. \"From what we do know, we're talking up to tens of millions of dollars per lounge.",
      "\"Like the new [American Express-owned] Centurion lounge in Atlanta, I believe they spent about $100m to make that happen.\"",

      "\"We are working very closely with the companies involved and academic groups to work together to design a regulatory structure that is good for them, but at all costs ensures the safety of these products remains as high as it possibly can,\" he said.",

      "\"It is not deregulation, it is pro-innovation regulation,\" he told BBC News.",

      "The government is keen for lab-grown food firms to thrive because it hopes they can create new jobs and economic growth.",
      "The UK is good at the science, but the current approvals process is much slower than in other countries. Singapore, the US and Israel in particular have faster procedures.",
      "Ivy Farm Technologies in Oxford is ready to go with lab-grown steaks, made from cells taken from Wagyu and Aberdeen Angus cows.",
      "The firm applied for approval to sell its steaks to restaurants at the beginning of last year. Ivy Farm's CEO, Dr Harsh Amin, explained that two years was a very long time to wait.",
      "\"If we can shorten that to less than a year, while maintaining the very highest of Britain's food safety standards, that would help start-up companies like ours to thrive.\"",
      "Dr Alicia Graham has a similar story. Working at Imperial College's Bezos centre in west London, she has found a way to grow an alternative to sugar.

      "What is the Spring Statement and when is it?",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors the government's spending plans and performance, will publish its forecast on the UK economy on Wednesday 26 March.",
      "It will also provide estimates on the cost of living for households and whether it thinks the government will stick to its self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending.",
      "Reeves will present the watchdog's main findings to Parliament, and alongside this will make her Spring Statement on the economy.",
      "After she has spoken, the opposition, likely to be either Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch or shadow chancellor Mel Stride, will respond.",
      "What is the chancellor expected to announce?",
      "Reeves has committed to one major economic event - the Budget - each year, to \"give families and businesses stability and certainty on tax and spending changes\".",
      "That means no big policy announcements are made on 26 March, but that's not stopping them being made beforehand.",
      "With the economy seen to be underperforming and global factors, such as US trade tariffs, indirectly impacting the UK, there is growing speculation over whether the chancellor will break her self-imposed rules on borrowing.",
      "The OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the \u00a39.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029/30 financial year, has been wiped out.",
      "Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\". Her two main rules are:",

      "Government sources have been keen to state that this event is not a major one because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "A debateable tax hiking policy could be announced, however, if Reeves decides to extend the freeze on the thresholds at which people start to pay different rates of income tax.",
      "The policy is known as a hidden tax rise or stealth tax, as it takes effect over time as people are dragged into paying more tax as their pay goes up, without the tax rate rising at all.",

      "Reeves decided not to extend the threshold freeze in her first Budget, arguing that doing so \"would hurt working people\" and \"take more money out of their payslips\".",
      "Whether any other spending cuts are announced in the Spring Statement or in the Spending Review in June, or even delayed until the next Budget, remains to be seen.",
      "How is the UK economy doing?",
      "Recent figures show UK economic growth has been sluggish - not shrinking, but not growing as desired.",
      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, according to the latest official figures.",
      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target, and is forecast to go higher. Inflation could dictate whether interest rates are lowered further from their current 4.5%.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump further in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "Pressure has also increased on the chancellor's tax and spending plans after a surplus in government finances missed official forecasts, prompting speculation from economists that she could break her fiscal rules as things stand.",
      "Borrowing costs for the UK surged in January in part due to concerns over the UK's economic outlook, threatening Reeves's economic plans. The costs have since fallen back but remain higher than this time last year.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, despite tariffs not directly targeting the UK, would lower growth and raise inflation."

      "\"I don't know Gail's, so it's not necessarily a chain to me,\" she says. \"I'm just happy to have something extra in town.\"",
      "She likes a latte and a croissant and somewhere she can read a book for an hour.",
      "At Gail's prices that would set her back \u00a36.50. Yes, it's pricey, she says, but she is still planning to \"give it a whirl\".",
      "Gail's - a name that suggests a traditional, single-owner, cafe - favours attractive old buildings, often ones vacated as bank branches close, especially if it is a corner site that means it's more visible to passers by.",
      "It has 170 outlets mostly clustered in London and the south east. But this year it plans to open around 40 more, including Ely, Cambridgeshire later this month, Bath in April, and Buxton, Derbyshire in May.",
      "At Friday's opening in Macclesfield there was a flurry of interest in the new place on the square.",
      "Even in the wake of the cost of living crisis, we are increasingly choosing a coffee out as a treat. Nearly two-thirds of people said they went to a coffee shop more than once a week, according to World Coffee Portal, spending more than \u00a36 per visit on average.",
      "So coffee shops are weathering the tough economic climate better than most businesses. There are now 11,450 branded chain outlets across the UK, up from 9,800 five years ago.",
      "Speciality chains like Black Sheep Coffee, Coffee#1 and Blank Street are springing up in city centres, while the giants like Costa and Starbucks are opening drive-throughs and outlets in retail parks.",
      "Caffe Nero has bought up several smaller chains, in different parts of the country, and is retaining their independent branding so it can make the most of local loyalties.",
      "With enthusiasm for coffee so strong it's something of a mystery to Gail's chief executive Tom Molnar why people object to his chain. He feels misunderstood.",
      "Mr Molnar - a joint owner with private equity backing - has been working on expanding the brand since he joined in 2003, but says it's not just about coffee. Its role as a neighbourhood bakery - baking fresh in-store and in regional bakery hubs every day - is key.",
      "He's hoping to roll Gail's out to many more neighbourhoods, including less affluent ones.",
      "\"It's not supposed to be posh,\" he insists.",
      "But for now they pick very carefully where to open, using an algorithm to help select the most promising postcodes.",
      "It flags up things like whether there is a local butcher, bookshops, a park, schools, churches or a farmers' market.",
      "\"I prefer a place that's evolving and growing rather than some place that's too established,\" he says.",
      "If the algorithm homes in on a particular High Street it is a vote of confidence in that town's future.",
      "But retail experts warn that the very nature of the places that Gail's is picking means there are likely to be accusations of gentrification, increasing prices and rents for existing businesses and residents.",
      "\"Gail's is moving into areas with strong local identities. And when that happens, there will always be a reaction,\" says Kate Hardcastle, founder of Insight with Passion.",
      "\"It's not just about a bakery opening, I think it's also about what it represents.",
      "\"Some will see it as a sign of investment and revitalisation, while others worry it's another step back to our High Streets looking like carbon copies of each other,\" she says.",
      "In Flour, Water, Salt - a direct rival to Gail's selling sourdough bread, bagels, coffee-iced buns and sausage rolls - that is just yards from the new shop, some loyal customers are adamantly opposed to the newcomer.",
      "\"Gail's isn't welcome here,\" says Karen Pearson, a businesswoman who lives just outside Macclesfield. She and her friends are worried that the arrival of Gail's means the town is \"on the up\", when in fact they would rather it \"stayed like it is\".",
      "They're not keen on big corporations coming into the town, concerned they might squeeze out independents.",
      "But firefighter and local councillor Anthony Harrison, reckons Gail's is no match for a place like Flour, Water, Salt. \"It's just a posh Greggs,\" he says.",
      "Independents may not be as under threat as people fear, says Graham Soult, a retail consultant from the north of England.",
      "Local owners can offer a more personal touch, respond to local tastes and demands,  he says, while it can be hard for chains to deviate from their given formula.",
      "\"I think a lot of independents are really adept at navigating all the things that are thrown at them,\" he says.",
      "Despite difficult times, the number of independent coffee shops has risen over the last five years from 11,700 to around 12,400 now.",
      "Flour, Water, Salt's manager Toby Johnstone isn't worried. It could mean more footfall, with more people trying his shop too.",

    "story": [
      "Giant trolley scales are being trialled at a Tesco store in Gateshead sparking a mixed reaction from shoppers.",
      "Trolleys are weighed before checkout to identify any items customers who have used Scan as you Shop might have missed or scanned twice.",
      "But some shoppers are unsure whether the new technology will take off with some likening it to airport security. \"Am I at border control or Tesco?\" one Reddit user posted, while another joked \"No clubcard? Deported!\"",
      "Others questioned whether the scales were aimed at cracking down on self-scan shoplifters or cutting back on checkout staff. Tesco declined to comment.",
      "Tesco Clubcard members already have the option to use Scan as you Shop handsets as they fill their trolleys then check out and pay at the end.",
      "Now in the Gateshead Trinity Square Extra store, shoppers can push their trolley on to the scales and if the weight matches the items they've scanned they pay as normal. If there is a discrepancy a staff member will do a manual rescan of the whole trolley.",
      "'Treated like a thief'",
      "Although some Reddit users who commented on the photo of the scales were positive with one saying \"they are 10x more convenient and faster\", many were more critical of their introduction.",
      "\"More and more the honest shopper is treated like a thief,\" one said, while another wrote \"the point of all this is to save on staff\".",
      "Business retail consultant Ged Futter told the BBC this was about loss prevention and staffing costs.",
      "\"There is no way this is about making it quicker for the shopper. It's supposed to be scan and go - this is scan and stop while your trolley is weighed.\"",
      "He said self-scan had increased the rate of shoplifting but instead of putting staff back on tills, supermarkets were trying to use even more technology to stop thefts.",
      "\"This is supermarkets saying, 'we know there are thefts so what we are going to do is treat every customer in exactly the same way to reduce theft'.",
      "\"They're forgetting that trust is the most important thing for all of the retailers and it works both ways. If customers don't feel trusted or think they're being treated like thieves they will go somewhere else.\"",
      "The British Retail Consortium has said shoplifting is \"out of control\" after its annual crime survey found incidents of customer theft reported by retailers in the UK rose by 3.7 million to 20.4 million, and cost retailers \u00a32bn.",
      "Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics revealed shoplifting offences reported by police in England and Wales rose by 23% to more than 492,000 over the same period.",
      "That is the highest figure since current recording practices began in 2003.",
      "Retail criminologist Prof Emmeline Taylor told the BBC she had seen similar trolley scales used in European supermarkets and there was \"definitely an element of trying to control loss\" but added \"let's not forget a lot of scan and go loss can be accidental\".",
      "A random audit of 20,000 scan and go baskets found 43% had at least one error, a 2022 global study on self-checkout found.",
      "Prof Taylor said Tesco's scales were \"quite foreboding and reminiscent of security scanners\".",
      "\"They don't want to give the impression that they are pointing the finger at their honest customer,\" she said.",
      "\"They will need to balance how they respond when there is a weight discrepancy because you can lose a customer for life if they feel they've been wrongly accused of something.\"",
      "She said she could see customers getting frustrated using the scales.",
      "\"You've left your handbag in the trolley, you've got to take your child out of the seat, you might be queueing behind someone who has been stopped and you can't get through so the trial needs to focus on minimising friction points in the customer experience.\"",
      "The scales are the latest example of supermarkets turning to technology to streamline time and costs. The ratio of self-scan to staffed tills continues to be fiercely debated. Some shoppers love the speed and convenience while others are fed up of hearing \"unexpected item in the bagging area\".",
      "In August upmarket north of England supermarket chain Booths got rid of self-scan altogether, while Asda and Morrisons said they would put more staff back on manned tills."

      "The White House administration cannot have failed to notice the chorus of criticism that all the pressure for a peace deal is being piled on just Ukraine, not Russia. So it is possible that Trump's threat is an attempt to present itself as being more even-handed.",

      "US President Donald Trump's cuts to the government workforce have started to hit, but overall hiring last month remained stable as growth in other sectors offset those losses.",
      "The Labor Department said federal employment dropped by 10,000 in February.",
      "Across the economy, employers added 151,000 jobs, while the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1%, from 4% in January.",
      "The monthly report from the government is a closely-watched signal of economic health that was under particular scrutiny this month, amid rising concern about the economic disruption sparked by Trump administration policy changes.",
      "Analysts had been forecasting about 170,000 new jobs. The monthly gain in February was similar to the average monthly rise of 168,000 over the past year, the Labor Department said.",
      "Hiring was driven by healthcare and financial firms. The manufacturing sector also added about 10,000 jobs, gains that were highlighted by the Trump administration.",
      "Government hiring slowed sharply, while analysts cautioned that the report did not yet reflect the full extent of the cuts that the White House has announced.",
      "Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the report felt \"reassuringly in line with expectations, showing payrolls growth only modestly weaker than in recent months\".",
      "\"Yet, while the worst fears were not met, the report does confirm that the labour market is cooling,\" she warned.",
      "\"Furthermore, with no shortage of headwinds confronting the US economy, the softening trend is likely to persist and may potentially deepen given the toxic combination of federal government layoffs, public spending cuts, and tariff uncertainty related inertia.\"",
      "Even before Donald Trump took office as president, financial analysts had been surprised at the long-running streak of growth in the US labour market, which came despite pressure from price increases and high interest rates.",
      "In his first weeks, Trump's changes to US policy have added to pressures on the economy, generating widespread uncertainty.",
      "His changes include tariffs on America's top three trade partners, some of which have since been reversed, and cuts to federal jobs and spending, efforts that are facing challenges in the courts.",
      "In remarks at the White House, Trump acknowledged that \"there could be some disturbance\" in the economy. But he said he thought reducing the size of government and moving forward with tariffs would unleash private sector growth.",
      "\"I think the labour market's going to be fantastic but it's going to have high-paying manufacturing jobs as opposed to government jobs,\" he said, adding that he could not commit to policy certainty on trade.",
      "\"There will always be changes,\" he said.",
      "Polls indicate that the moves have the support of his base. But financial analysts have warned that they are contributing to worries in financial markets, hurting consumer sentiment and fuelling weakness across a range of other economic indicators.",
      "The latest jobs report showed average hourly pay up 4% compared with a year ago, but the number of people reporting they were working part-time because of slack business conditions jumped.",

      "Private firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that layoff announcements in February jumped to their highest level since July 2020, driven by government cuts.",
      "But the number of companies warning of job cuts coming in the next few months also jumped, while starting to spread to new sectors, noted Andy Challenger, vice president of the firm.",
      "The Labor Department report \"falls squarely in line with big slow cooling of the labour market that we've seen for two years - that story of that nice soft landing,\" he said.",

      "President Donald Trump's decision to establish official government cryptocurrency reserves in the US has drawn criticism from industry watchers.",
      "He has signed an executive order creating what he calls a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as well as a Digital Asset Stockpile, which will consist of other forms of digital currency.",
      "The funds will be stocked with coins forfeited to the federal government as part of criminal or civil proceedings.",
      "White House AI and crypto tsar David Sacks likened them to a \"a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency\", drawing comparison to the Kentucky military base that stores a significant portion of US gold assets.",
      "However, some crypto enthusiasts have criticised the government for not being bolder, while others have raised question marks about the lack of transparency over the process.",
      "Sacks has ordered a full accounting of the federal government's existing crypto reserves, which he estimated at 200,000 Bitcoin alone. That's worth $17.5bn (\u00a313.6bn) at today's prices.",
      "Speaking to reporters at the White House ahead of a special crypto summit on Friday, Sacks said that it was a \"real shame that we did not maximise value for the American taxpayer.\"",

      "Jason Yanowitz, Co-Founder of crypto firm Blockworks, agrees with the idea of a Bitcoin reserve but says the inclusion of other coins sets a \"horrible precedent\" and \"makes no sense.\"",

      "Other analysts though have been more positive.",
      "\"This approach makes much more sense than buying the assets,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.",
      "\"It would surely be bizarre for the US to sell dollars to buy crypto, when the dollar is the globe's reserve currency and therefore a source of enormous influence.\"",
      "'Won't cost a dime'",
      "Further details are expected when the president speaks to the first crypto summit at the White House.",
      "It is unclear how a crypto reserve would benefit Americans, but Sacks told reporters it \"will not cost taxpayers a dime\".",
      "It is also unclear whether the planned reserve could face legal hurdles, or if it might require an act of Congress.",
      "The US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited in the reserve, said Sacks, and will instead keep it as an asset. While the reserve will exclusively contain Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies will go into a separate stockpile.",
      "His implication that the US government would not buy Bitcoin led prices of the world's largest cryptocurrency to fall by more than 5%.",

    "summary": "From handheld to space-based, new methane detectors are making it easier to track the greenhouse gas.",
    "story": [
      "In and around Washington DC, volunteers and activists have been walking through streets and homes to see how healthy the air is.",
      "They're armed with industry-grade monitors that detect the presence of several gases. The devices look a bit like walkie-talkies.",
      "But they are equipped with sensors that reveal the extent of methane, turning this invisible gas into concrete numbers on a screen.",
      "Those numbers can be worrying. In a 25-hour period, neighbourhood researchers found 13 outdoor methane leaks at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit. They have also found methane leaks within homes.",
      "A key concern has been health. Methane and other gases, notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves, are linked to higher risks of asthma.",
      "Djamila Bah, a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organisation Action in Montgomery, reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organisation.",
      "\"It's very heartbreaking and alarming when you're doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they can't change for now,\" Ms Bah says.",
      "Methane might be a hazard to human health, but it is also powerful greenhouse gas.",
      "While it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one-quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialisation.",
      "Methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors. Chief among these are fossil fuels, waste and agriculture.",
      "But methane is not always easy to notice.",
      "It can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers. It can also be visualised using infrared cameras, as methane absorbs infrared light.",
      "Monitoring can be ground-based, including vehicle-mounted devices, or aerial, including drone-based measurement. Combining technologies is especially helpful.",
      "\"There is no perfect solution,\" says Andreea Calcan, a programme management officer at the International Methane Emissions Observatory, a UN initiative.",
      "There are trade-offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis, which could extend to thousands of facilities.",
      "Thankfully, she has seen an expansion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade. So there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane, at any scale. And the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high-emitting events, she says.",
      "At a larger scale, satellites are often good at pinpointing super-emitters: less frequent but massively emitting events, such as huge oil and gas leaks. Or they can detect the smaller and more spread-out emitters that are much more common, such as cattle farms.",
      "Current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter, says Riley Duren, the CEO of the Carbon Mapper, a not-for-profit organisation that tracks emissions.",
      "He likens this to film cameras. A telephoto lens offers higher resolution, while a wide-angle lens allows a larger field of view.",
      "With a new satellite, Carbon Mapper is focusing on high resolution, high sensitivity and rapid detection, to more precisely detect emissions from super-emitters. In August 2024 Carbon Mapper launched the Tanager-1 satellite, together with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Earth imaging company Planet Labs.",
      "Satellites have struggled to spot methane emissions in certain environments, such as poorly maintained oil wells in snowy areas with lots of vegetation. Low light, high latitudes, mountains and offshore areas also present challenges.",
      "Mr Duren says that the high-resolution Tanager-1 can respond to some of these challenges, for instance by essentially sneaking peeks through gaps in cloud cover or forest cover.",
      "\"In an oil and gas field, high resolution could be the difference between isolating the methane emissions from an oil well head from an adjacent pipeline,\" he says. This could help determine exactly who is responsible.",
      "Carbon Mapper began releasing emissions data, drawing on Tanager-1 observations, in November.",
      "It will take several years to build out the full constellation of satellites, which will depend on funding.",
      "Tanager-1 isn't the only new satellite with a focus on delivering methane data. MethaneSAT, a project of the Environmental Defense Fund and private and public partners, also launched in 2024.",
      "With the increasing sophistication of all these satellite technologies, \"What was previously unseeable is now visible,\" Mr Duren says. \"As a society we're still learning about our true methane footprint.\"",
      "It's clear that better information is needed about methane emissions. Some energy companies have sought to evade methane detection by using \"enclosed combustors\" to obscure gas flaring.",
      "Translating knowledge into action isn't always straightforward. Methane levels continue to rise, even as the information available does as well.",
      "For instance, the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) uses satellite data to detect methane emissions notify companies and governments. The MARS team gathered a large quantity of methane plume images, verified by humans, to train a machine learning model to recognise such plumes.",
      "In all the locations that MARS constantly monitors, based on their history of emissions, the model checks for a methane plume every day. Analysts then scrutinise any alerts.",
      "Because there are so many locations to be monitored, \"this saves us a lot of time,\" says Itziar Irakulis Loitxate, the remote sensing lead for the International Methane Emissions Observatory, which is responsible for MARS.",
      "In the two years since its launch, MARS has sent out over 1,200 alerts for major methane leaks. Only 1% of those have led to responses.",
      "However, Ms Irakulis remains optimistic. Some of those alerts led to direct action such as repairs, including cases where emissions ceased even though the oil and gas operator didn't officially provide feedback.",
      "And communications are improving all the time, Ms Irakulis says. \"I have hope that this 1%, we will see it grow a lot in the next year.\"",
      "At the community level, it's been powerful for residents, such as those in the Washington DC area, to take the air pollution readings themselves and use these to counter misinformation. \"Now that we know better, we can do better,\" says Joelle Novey of Interfaith Power and Light.",

      "Currently, smacking is unlawful in England, except in cases where it amounts to a \"reasonable punishment\".",
      "Now the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) wants that legal defence to be removed, using an amendment to a law which is currently making its way through Parliament.",
      "The Department for Education said the government had no plans to change the law on smacking, but that it was committed to giving every child the best start in life.",
      "Prof Andrew Rowland, RCPCH officer for child protection, said: \"Now is the time for this Victorian-era punishment to go.\"",
      "If enough MPs backed the amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, tabled by Labour MP Jess Asato in January, then the defence of smacking as a \"reasonable punishment\" would be completely outlawed in England.",
      "Currently, the situation on smacking children is different depending on where you are in the UK.",
      "In Scotland and Wales, corporal - or physical - punishment is illegal, but in England and Northern Ireland the \"reasonable punishment\" defence still stands.",
      "In England, the defence is included in the Children Act of 2004, but smacking children has been permitted by law since 1860.",
      "Scotland was the first UK country to ban corporal punishment in November 2020, followed by Wales in March 2022.",
      "Prof Rowland said there were 67 countries around the world which had already adopted smacking bans, with a further 20 committing to do so.",
      "The government said it was \"looking closely\" at the changes made in Scotland and Wales, but had no plans to legislate on smacking at this stage.",
      "A spokesperson said the bill in its current form represented the \"single biggest piece of child protection legislation in a generation\".",
      "\"This government has prioritised significant reform of the children's social care system, driving better child protection and information sharing between education, health and social workers to stop vulnerable children falling through the cracks,\" they added.",
      "Parents at a baby sensory group in Sale, Greater Manchester, told the BBC they were all against smacking children, but some were unsure about whether it was right for the government to intervene.",
      "Mum Leanne Casey, said parents \"should be able to discipline how they see fit\", but added: \"I don't agree with smacking children though, so if a ban is what it takes then I'd agree that is what you need to do.\"",
      "Dad Oli Harrison said he would \"never intervene\" in another person's parenting methods, but added that a ban would \"probably be beneficial\" to avoid it being seen as a \"grey area\".",
      "When looking at populations as a whole, Prof Rowland said physical punishment \"undoubtedly harms children's health\".",
      "He said there were no scientific studies which provided robust evidence that smacking had any positive effect on children's wellbeing.",
      "Calls for a ban on smacking intensified after the death of 10-year-old Sara Sharif.",
      "Sara was murdered in August 2023 after a \"campaign of torture\" by her father and stepmother which lasted for two years.",
      "Her father, who had fled to Pakistan after the murder, had phoned police in England claiming he had \"legally punished\" Sara before her death.",
      "It is unlawful in England to assault a child causing actual or grievous bodily harm, or cruelty, but Prof Rowland said academic studies had shown children who were punished physically were at an increased risk of serious physical assault.",
      "He said a complete ban on smacking would make it easier for the authorities to \"draw a line and say there are never any circumstances involved where physical punishment of children is ever legal\".",
      "Other organisations, including the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, have also backed the amendment.",
      "Joanna Barrett, from the charity, said smacking had been associated with \"depression, anxiety, increased aggression, and antisocial behaviour\".",
      "She said a legal change was needed \"urgently\", adding that \"right now we know physical punishment remains a part of childhood for too many young people in England\".",
      "Not everyone agrees. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Nicky Campbell on Thursday, Simon Calvert from campaign group Be Reasonable challenged the doctors' calls.",
      "He argued that unreasonable chastisement, such as beating a child, was already illegal, and voiced concerns the proposal could mean \"a mum tapping a tot on the back of the hand\" faces criminal prosecution.",
      "Lynn Perry, chief executive of the Barnardo's children's charity, said: \"No violence against children is acceptable. And yet children continue to face less legal protection against physical assault than adults.\"",

      "Financial pressures",

      "'Busy day'",
      "But at Eglinton, pupils are encouraged to dress up as well as dressing their potatoes.",
      "\"The children are dressing up, we're having a book swap so they can bring in books they no longer read and swap them for new ones, and we've also got parents and grandparents coming in and out to read stories to the different classes,\" Ms McGuinness said.",

      "Critics of the programme said its success was limited, but some academics and MPs have described it as a \"tragedy\" for young people from less privileged backgrounds.",

      "At Keswick School in Cumbria, the subject is studied after hours as an extra option.",
      "For the last 10 years it has been taught to GCSE level by Marcella Jackson who said it is not just for the academic elite.",
      "\"We offer Latin to pupil premium students, to children from different sets, abilities and backgrounds,\" Ms Jackson said.",

      "A British Society study in 2020 found that while only 3% of state schools offered Latin at Key Stage 3, that figure rose to 49% in the fee-paying sector.",
      "Only two of the region's schools - Polam Hall in Darlington, and Queen Elizabeth Grammar in Hexham - had taken advantage of the 2022 government Latin programme, but one of a group of MPs working to promote the study of the classics is determined the current government does not give up on Latin in state schools.",
      "York Central's Rachael Maskell, who is a Labour member of the All Party Parliamentary Classics Group, said it would be a tragedy if the subject does end up purely in the private sector.",
      "She said: \"Giving young people from less privileged backgrounds access is really important.",
      "\"We cannot have the whole classics agenda being in the hands of the few, so let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater and [instead] ensure there is something there for the benefit of classical education across the UK.\"",
      "'Latin is for everyone'",

      "Prof Holmes-Henderson's message was \"nil desperandum\" - do not despair.",
      "She said there were alternative sources of funding for a subject that is still part of the national curriculum and the region can still be at the heart of Latin's revival.",

    "summary": "Stars like Charli XCX have made see-through outfits all the rage at big events, but not everyone's a fan.",
    "story": [
      "Six months ago, a viral TikTok trend made us obsessed with being very demure and very mindful - but now, modesty has taken a back seat among celebrities who have made see-through outfits all the rage on red carpets and catwalks.",
      "At the Brit Awards last week, big winner Charli XCX went full brat as she wore a sheer black dress, prompting hundreds of complaints to media watchdog Ofcom.",
      "She used one of her acceptance speeches to address the controversy of her outfit. \"I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples,\" she said. \"I feel like we're in the era of 'free the nipple' though, right?\"",
      "The nearly naked look has been a talking point at other award ceremonies - including last Sunday's Oscars and the Grammys in February, when Kanye West's girlfriend Bianca Censori dropped her coat on the red carpet to reveal an almost entirely invisible dress.",
      "The love for transparent textiles has continued at London and Paris fashion weeks, with many of the celebrities watching on also getting the memo.",
      "At Stella McCartney's Paris show, US actress and Michael Jackson's daughter Paris Jackson wore a translucent black off-the-shoulder maxi dress with only a nude-coloured thong underneath.",
      "Rapper Ice Spice sported a black lace catsuit with a feathered coat at the show.",
      "Naked dressing was a key trend in some designers' spring/summer collections, and the theme has continued in autumn/winter looks too.",
      "As Vogue wrote in January: \"For a period of time, sheerness was few and far between, but nowadays, 'naked dressing' is commonplace every season.\"",
      "Dior's latest collection embraced see-through material and presented it in an ethereal way, with intricate detailing and gender-fluid silhouettes.",
      "Creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri described her collection as \"demonstrating how clothing is a receptacle that affirms cultural, aesthetic and social codes\".",
      "The trend divides opinion but is certainly part of a wider movement - last summer Charli XCX's definition of being a brat included wearing \"a strappy white top with no bra\".",
      "Sheer dressing is a nod to the minimalist looks of the 1990s - think transparent blouses and Kate Moss wearing a thin slip dress - and with our love for nostalgia fashion, it's no wonder it is taking off again.",
      "The trend also had a resurgence a decade ago. The \"free the nipple\" movement was everywhere in the early 2010s, with Rihanna stirring up headlines with her sheer crystal-embellished dress at the CFDA awards in 2014.",
      "Charli XCX's Brits outfit was praised by some on social media. \"Stop policing women's bodies,\" one person wrote, while another said she looked comfortable in her outfit so \"why is society judging?\"",
      "But many found it too risque for prime-time TV. Ofcom received 825 complaints  about the Brits ceremony, the majority relating to Charli's outfit and Sabrina Carpenter's eye-opening pre-watershed performance.",
      "\"Maybe think about putting this on at a time when kids ain't gonna be watching,\" one person wrote on social media.",
      "'Challenging fashion norms'",
      "Fashion stylist and CEO of clothing brand Mermaid Way, Julia Pukhalskaia, calls the choice to wear revealing dresses a \"provocative statement\", but says it's a \"way to reclaim the right to govern one's body\".",
      "The controversy around it feeds into a wider dialogue about women's rights and double standards when it comes to dress codes, she adds.",
      "Abhi Madan, creative director of fashion brand Amarra, believes the trend \"is about embracing freedom and boldness in fashion\".",
      "The idea of freeing the nipple \"isn't just about exposure - it's a movement towards body positivity and challenging conventional fashion norms\", he argues.",
      "\"Designers are now integrating sheer elements not just for shock value but to create a refined and elegant silhouette that empowers wearers.\"",
      "It seems many Hollywood stars this year were feeling empowered as chiffon, lace and tulle were in plentiful supply at the Oscars.",
      "Shock value is surely a factor for some, too, though.",
      "At Vanity Fair's Oscars afterparty, Julia Fox wore a mesh dress with only long wavy hair to cover some of her modesty.",
      "There were other interpretations of the naked dress - Megan Thee Stallion wore a green dress with strategically placed foliage and nipple coverings, while Zoe Kravitz opted to cover up the front but expose the back as a beaded mesh panel revealed her buttocks in her Saint Laurent dress.",
      "\"This year, naked dressing seemed to particularly thrive at the event,\" the New York Times noted.",
      "However, not everyone is on board. The Times fashion director Anna Murphy wrote that she's over the trend because \"it's only women who do this\".",
      "\"It is not an equal opportunities endeavour. It is, rather, a manifestation of the kind of thing that keeps this world unequal. That women's bodies are for public consumption and men's, usually, aren't,\" she wrote.",
      "Some men have been embracing the nearly naked trend, though. In 2022, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet wore striking a backless red top at Venice Film Festival, and at the 2023 Grammys Harry Styles freed the nipple in a plunge harlequin jumpsuit.",
      "It's the women who will continue to cause more of a stir on runways and red carpets - and society will still be split on whether it's redefining conventional notions of modesty in fashion, a product of misogyny, or simply seeking attention.",

    "summary": "Yo Yo Honey Singh, who transformed Indian hip-hop, has made a comeback after a long battle with drug abuse.",
    "story": [
      "About 15 years ago, an Indian rapper of humble origins broke onto the country's then-infertile hip-hop music scene and transformed it forever.",
      "He teased, cajoled and vexed his listeners, daring them to explore the \"devilish\" contours of his mind, as he sang rash rhymes about parties, drugs and \"seducing\" women. His songs played in clubs and weddings, blaring from stereos at big parties and roadside tea stalls alike.",
      "Then, at the peak of his career, he vanished. Seven years later, Yo Yo Honey Singh is back - with a new album and an ongoing music tour, claiming to be a changed man after a prolonged battle with drug abuse and mental health struggles.",
      "The 41-year-old singer and producer was once one of India's biggest music stars, a figure who \"moved the cultural gravity of hip-hop music\", says music journalist Bhanuj Kappal in Famous, a recent Netflix documentary on Singh.",
      "But he was also deeply controversial - and, by his own admission, an \"aggressive and reckless man\", routinely accused of promoting vulgarity, debauchery and violence through his music.",
      "Many criticised Singh's lyrics for depicting violence against women and rape, an image that gained further traction in the press after his former wife and childhood sweetheart accused him of domestic violence in her divorce filing. Singh has denied the charge.",
      "Seven years later, the singer is no longer the defiant hitmaker who once ruled the charts with his provocative, foot-tapping anthems.",
      "A lot has changed in the intervening years, including Indian hip-hop, which has evolved into a thriving, dynamic space. Artists once inspired by his sound have now surpassed him as the genre's leading voices.",
      "Singh also seems different. From someone who described himself as \"the all-knowing master of the universe\", he now identifies as a God-fearing man who believes in good energies, the cyclic nature of life and \"scientific astrologers\".",
      "He claims his music is now more conscious, moving beyond drugs to something deeper. But loyal fans say it's lost its edge and his latest tracks haven't left a mark.",
      "\"He has a core audience that will stick with him forever... but his vision is old now. It's outdated,\" Kappal says.",
      "But Singh is not ready to be written off, yet.",
      "Instead of trying to conceal or defend his personal struggles with fame and drugs, he has made it the centrepiece of his comeback.",
      "Since his return, Singh has candidly admitted his struggles with addiction and mental health. \"Drugs destroyed me completely,\" he told Lallantop, a digital news platform. \"I lost myself to fame, money and women. I was like a devil, completely satanic.\"",
      "In interviews, he is witty and relaxed, speaking with the clarity of a tormented artist who, after battling his inner demons, seems to have unlocked a spiritual truth",
      "\"What goes around comes around, I really believe that,\" he said recently. \"It took a lot of time for me to get out from where I was stuck. But I am back now.\"",
      "Born Hridesh Singh in Punjab state, he grew up in a cramped Delhi neighbourhood. Those tough early years shaped his music and still echo in his work today.",
      "\"This ghetto was my home, my hood, always will be,\" he's often heard saying.",
      "Singh always knew he wanted a career in music. He started as a college DJ, later moving into production full-time. \"I wanted to make beats and produce music, not sing or write,\" he says.",
      "But after years as a small-time producer in Punjab, he realised it wouldn't be enough. \"My sounds were too urban for the place. People didn't understand it. For that, I had to go beyond the state.\"",
      "So he went solo. In 2011, Singh released The International Villager, his breakout album. Blending Punjabi folk - its dhol beats and string melodies - with global hip-hop, he created something entirely new.",
      "For three months, it seemed the formula had failed. Then everything changed. Overnight, the songs went viral, topped charts, won awards - and catapulted Singh into Bollywood.",
      "Brown Rang, a song about a brown man's global ambition, became YouTube's most-watched video in 2012. Shot in Dubai on a million-dollar budget, it introduced many Indians to the bling of hip-hop - fast cars, baggy clothes, gem-studded watches and gold chains - set to slick, thumping beats.",
      "Despite mounting criticism over his misogynistic lyrics, Singh packed stadiums and churned out hits, breaking into Bollywood with songs for stars like Shah Rukh Khan and Akshay Kumar.",
      "\"A lot of times, my lyrics were trash, even I knew that. But people were still listening to it because the sound was so good and fresh,\" he told Lallantop.",
      "But Singh's ascent to fame coincided with his personal downfall.",
      "\"I was drowning in drugs and alcohol, smoking 12-15 joints and downing bottles. I abandoned my family, lost control. This one time, I got so high I bit a friend on his stomach eight times,\" he told Lallantop.",
      "In 2017, Singh broke down mid-tour - a moment that shook him. He quit music and substances, returned to Delhi and began recovery with a global team of doctors and therapists. \"I told my family I was mentally unwell. I can't do anything till I get better.\"",
      "Singh says he's been sober for seven years, except for the occasional beer.",
      "\"I have been to hell and back,\" he says in Famous. \"Even now, I wake up hazy because of the medicines.\"",
      "Fans, however, appreciate Singh's raw honesty about his self-destructive tendencies - and his effort to overcome them.",
      "\"No-one's perfect. But at least Singh tries to be better. He may have left the scene briefly but his music never stopped playing,\" says Nandini Gupta, a Delhi-based  student.",
      "Others see his transformation as performative, noting his new music remains problematic. \"Though toned down, he is still objectifying women and talking only about money and fame,\" says listener Bushra Neyazi.",
      "No matter how you see it, Singh's redemption feels like another challenge to his audience - pushing them to accept his complicated past and give his music another chance.",
      "\"I was away for seven years, but I will drive everyone mad again in the next seven,\" he said recently.",

    "story": [
      "Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman died of natural causes about a week after his wife Betsy Arakawa, who died after contracting a rare virus, a New Mexico medical investigator has said.",
      "Hackman, 95, died at his Santa Fe home from coronary artery disease, with advanced Alzheimer's disease a contributing factor.",
      "Ms Arakawa, 65, died in the same house from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. Her cause of death was listed as natural.",
      "Authorities believe she passed away about seven days before her husband, to whom she had been married for more than 30 years. During his career, Hackman won two Academy Awards for The French Connection and Unforgiven.",
      "It is likely that Ms Arakawa died first on 11 February, Dr Heather Jarrell of the New Mexico Medical Investigator's Office told a news conference on Friday.",
      "She said it was \"reasonable to conclude\" that Hackman had died on 18 February.",
      "Ms Arakawa's last known movements and correspondence were on 11 February, when she was seen going to a grocery store, a CVS pharmacy and a pet store, before returning home in the early evening.",
      "Given that Hackman was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease it is \"quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased\", said Dr Jarrell.",

      "At the news conference, New Mexico Public Health Veterinarian Erin Phipps emphasised that hantavirus infections were extremely rare.",
      "HPS is transmitted through contact with rodent droppings, urine or saliva, often when contaminated dust is inhaled.",
      "She noted that 136 cases had been reported in the state over the past 50 years, with 42% resulting in fatalities.",
      "Dr Phipps said evidence of rodent activity had been found in some buildings on the property, though the risk inside the main house was considered \"low\".",
      "Investigators are trying to determine how Ms Arakawa contracted the illness. Hackman tested negative for hantavirus.",
      "The couple were found in their home after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through the window.",
      "The remains were discovered in advanced stages of decomposition.",
      "Hackman's body was in a sideroom next to the kitchen, with a walking cane and a pair of sunglasses nearby, according to a search warrant affidavit.",
      "Ms Arakawa's body was in the bathroom, with scattered pills close to her.",
      "Sheriff's deputies found medication for thyroid and blood pressure treatment, along with pain reliever Tylenol, according to a court-filed inventory.",
      "Citing privacy laws, authorities did not disclose who had been prescribed the drugs.",
      "One of the couple's three dogs was also found dead inside a crate near Ms Arakawa, while the other two dogs were alive.",
      "The cause of death for the dog is yet to be determined, officials say. Dr Phipps told reporters that dogs did not get sick from hantavirus.",
      "Initial investigations found no signs of forced entry or foul play at the couple's $3.8m (\u00a33m) home. Tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative, and no significant gas leaks were detected.",
      "Hackman is survived by three adult children from his previous marriage.",
      "Hackman met Ms Arakawa when she was working part-time at a California gym in the mid-1980s, the New York Times has previously reported.",
      "He won best actor Oscar for his role as Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in William Friedkin's 1971 thriller The French Connection, and another for best supporting actor for playing Little Bill Daggett in Clint Eastwood's Western film Unforgiven in 1992.",
      "A relative latecomer to Hollywood, Hackman saw his breakthrough come in his thirties, when he was nominated for an Oscar for portraying Buck Barrow in 1967's Bonnie and Clyde - opposite Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway - and again for I Never Sang for My Father in 1970.",
      "Both films saw him recognised in the supporting actor category. He was also nominated for best leading actor in 1988 for playing an FBI agent in Mississippi Burning.",
      "He played more than 100 roles during his career, including supervillain Lex Luthor in the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman movies in the 1970s and 1980s.",
      "Hackman featured opposite many other Hollywood heavyweights including Al Pacino in 1973's Scarecrow and Gene Wilder in 1974's Young Frankenstein.",
      "His last big-screen appearance came as Monroe Cole in Welcome to Mooseport in 2004, after which he stepped back from Hollywood for a quieter life in New Mexico."

      "A message sent by Marsalek to fellow spy Orlin Roussev - who ran the UK-based group from a former guest house in Norfolk - demonstrated inside knowledge of Putin's thinking. He wrote: \"Personally I find Grozev not to be a very valuable target but apparently Putin seriously hates him.\"",
      "After 2020, the spy cell followed Grozev and Dobrokhotov throughout Europe, spying on them on aeroplanes, in hotels and in private properties.",
      "They discussed kidnapping and even killing the men. There was talk of smuggling Dobrokhotov out of the UK in a small boat from the Norfolk coast, after which he would be taken back to Russia.",
      "Dobrokhotov said it was clear this would have resulted in his death.",
      "It was in January 2023, the month before police arrested members of the cell in the UK, that Dobrokhotov said he was \"warned that I shouldn't leave the country because it can be dangerous\".",
      "He had not realised that he was being followed by the Bulgarian spies, who got so near to him on one flight that they saw the Pin code for his mobile phone.",
      "He thinks the police action sends a signal.",
      "\"Vladimir Putin doesn't understand messages in words, only in actions,\" Dobrokhotov said.",
      "\"So he understands messages like, for example, Ukraine got long-range missiles. That's a message that he can understand.",
      "\"And when his spies are arrested and imprisoned for a big sentence, that's also a message that he can understand.\"",
      "He thinks the use of Bulgarians working in normal jobs shows the limits of Russian espionage after so many professional spies were expelled from the West, but that spy cells like the Bulgarian one are no less dangerous.",
      "Speaking about what motivates him, Dobrokhotov said he wants \"to change Russia\" because he does not want to live in a country that \"kills people just because they're doing journalism or because they are criticising the government\".",
      "He said that \"while we are existing, it is very difficult for Vladimir Putin to feel strength inside the country\" and that \"we will be someone who he will try to eliminate for the rest of his life\".",
      "\"We're in a situation that only some of us will survive, either we or Vladimir Putin and his team.\"",
      "On Friday Vanya Gaberova, 30, Katrin Ivanova, 33, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, were found guilty of conspiracy to spy, while Roussev, 47, and Biser Dzhambazov, 43, had previously admitted the same charge. A sixth Bulgarian, Ivan Stoyanov, 34, pled guilty to spying. Ivanova was also convicted of possessing multiple false identity documents."

      "She was also seen having a close encounter with a dancer dressed as a soldier wearing a bearskin hat during the show, broadcast live on ITV.",
      "Essex star Charli XCX, who won five awards, wore a see-through black dress and addressed the controversy over her outfit during one of her speeches on the night: \"I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples. I feel like we're in the era of 'free the nipple' though, right?\"",
      "An Ofcom spokesperson said: \"We are assessing the complaints against our rules, but are yet to decide whether or not to investigate.\"",
      "These complaints numbers are not huge by Ofcom's standards.",
      "The most complaints the watchdog has received was 58,000 in 2021, about Piers Morgan's criticism of the Duchess of Sussex on Good Morning Britain. Ofcom found ITV was not in breach of broadcasting rules.",
      "An episode of Celebrity Big Brother on Channel 4 got 45,159 complaints in 2007 and the same show, on Channel 5, got 25,327 complaints in 2018.",

      "Carpenter was honoured with the recently resurrected global success award.",
      "The prize was originally created in 2013 to recognise British acts who had sold millions of records and concert tickets abroad. The previous recipients were One Direction (2013-14), Sam Smith (2015), Adele (2016-17) and Ed Sheeran (2018-19).",

      "Just ask Lady Gaga.",
      "Her rise to fame in 2009-10 was unlike anything we'd seen before. One of the first pop stars to harness the power of the internet, she seemed to exist in a permanent onslaught of TMZ photos and gossip blogs.",
      "Their appetite was voracious. She wore through so many looks and sounds in the space of three years that one critic wrote she was \"speed-running Madonna's entire career\".",
      "And as her fame grew, the headlines became more unhinged. She staged a satanic ritual in a London hotel... She was secretly a hermaphrodite... She planned to saw her own leg off \"for fashion\".",
      "When she attended the 2010 MTV Awards in a dress made entirely of meat, nobody seemed to get the joke: Gaga was presenting herself as fodder for the tabloids, there to be consumed.",
      "On stage, she was an object of worship for her fans, the Little Monsters. But anyone who isn't a megalomaniac knows that that sort of adulation is a distant illusion.",
      "\"I'm alone, Brandon. Every night,\" Gaga told her stylist in the 2017 documentary, Five Foot Two.",
      "\"I go from everyone touching me all day and talking at me all day to total silence.\"",
      "Now 38, and happily engaged to tech entrepreneur Michael Polansky, Gaga admits that those years of solitude scared her.",

      "\"And I think that the greatest gift has been meeting my partner, Michael, and being in the mayhem with him.\"",
      "The couple have been together since 2020, and revealed their engagement at the Venice Film Festival last September - where Gaga wore her million-dollar engagement ring in public for the first time.",
      "In person, it's dazzling, with a huge, oval-cut diamond set on a 18-karat white and rose gold diamond pav\u00e9 band.",

      "\"A long time ago, we were in the back yard, and he asked me, 'If I ever proposed to you, like, how do I do that?'",
      "\"And I just said, 'Just get a blade of grass from the back yard and wrap it around my finger and that will make me so happy'.\"",
      "It was a deeply romantic gesture that came tinged with sadness. Gaga's back yard in Malibu had previously played host to the wedding of her close friend, Sonja Durham, shortly before she died of cancer in 2017.",
      "\"There was so much loss, but this happy thing was happening for me,\" she recalls of Polansky's proposal.",
      "\"To get engaged at 38... I was thinking about what it took to get to this moment.\"",
      "Those feelings ultimately informed a song on her new album, Mayhem.",

      "She calls it a \"thank you\" to her partner. And fans might have a reason to thank him, too.",
      "Mayhem marks Gaga's full throttle return to pop, after a period where she'd been preoccupied with her film career, and spin-off albums that dabbled in jazz and the classic American songbook.",
      "Speaking to Vogue last year, the singer revealed it was her fianc\u00e9 who'd nudged her in that direction.",
      "\"He was like, 'Babe. I love you. You need to make pop music',\" she said.",
      "\"On the Chromatica tour, I saw a fire in her,\" Polansky added. \"I wanted to help her keep that alive all the time and just start making music that made her happy.\"",
      "'Angriest song'",
      "With that approach, the album goes right back to the sucker-punch sound of Gaga's early hits like Poker Face, Just Dance and Born This Way.",
      "On the latest single, Abracadabra, she even revisits the \"roma-ma-ma\" gibberish of Bad Romance \u2013 although this time there's a reference to death, as she sings, \"morta-ooh-Gaga\".",
      "In the album's artwork, her face is reflected in a broken mirror. In the videos, she squares off against earlier versions of herself.",
      "There's an overwhelming sense that the artist Stefani Germanotta is reckoning with the stage persona she created.",
      "It all comes to a head on a track called Perfect Celebrity where she sings, \"I became a notorious being\" \u2013 a lyric that, like the meat dress before it, strips away her humanity.",
      "\"That's probably the most angry song about fame I've ever written,\" she says.",
      "\"I'd created this public persona that I was truly becoming in every way - and holding the duality of that, knowing where I begin and Lady Gaga ends, was really a challenge.",
      "\"It kind of took me down.\"",
      "How did she reconcile the public and private sides of her life?",
      "\"I think what I actually realised is that it's healthier to not have a dividing line and to integrate those two things into one whole human being,\" she says.",
      "\"The healthiest thing for me was owning that I'm a female artist and that living an artistic life was my choice.",
      "\"I am a lover of songwriting. I'm a lover of making music, of rehearsing, choreography, stage production, costumes, lighting, putting on a show.",
      "\"That is what it means to be Lady Gaga. It's the artist behind it all.\"",
      "In previous interviews, the musician has spoken of how she dissociated from Lady Gaga. For a time, she believed the character was responsible for all her success, and she had contributed nothing.",
      "Mayhem marks the moment where she reclaims ownership of her music, not just from \"Lady Gaga\" but from other producers and writers in her orbit.",
      "\"When I was younger, people tried take credit for my sound, or my image [but] all of my references, all of my imagination of what pop music could be, came from me.",
      "\"So I really wanted to revisit my earlier inspirations and my career and own it as my invention, for once and for all.\"",
      "From the outset, it was obvious that Gaga was excited about this new phase.",
      "Last summer, after performing at the Olympics opening ceremony, she took to the streets of Paris and played early demos of her new music to fans who'd gathered outside her hotel.",
      "It was a spur of the moment decision, yet it marked another effort to restore the spontaneity of her early career.",
      "\"This has been something I've done for almost 20 years, where I played my fans my music way before it came out,\" she says.",
      "\"I used to, after my shows, invite fans backstage, and we'd hang out and I'd play them demos and see what they thought of the music.",
      "\"I'm sure you can imagine that after 20 years, you don't expect that people are still going to show up to hear your music and be excited to see you. So, I just wanted to share it with them, because I was excited that they were there.\"",
      "As an interviewer, this is a full-circle moment for me, too. I last interviewed Lady Gaga in 2009, as Just Dance hit number one in the UK.",
      "Back then, she was giddy with excitement, chatting enthusiastically about her love of John Lennon, calling herself a \"heroin addict\" for English tea, and promising to email me an MP3 of Blueberry Kisses \u2013 an unreleased song that is, quite brilliantly, about performing a sex act while your breath smells of blueberry flavoured coffee.",
      "Over the years, I've seen her interviews become more guarded. She'd wear outrageous costumes or jet-black sunglasses, deliberately putting a barrier between her and the journalist.",
      "But the Gaga I meet in New York is the same one I spoke to 16 years ago: comfortable with herself, and brimming with enthusiasm.",
      "She puts that ease down to \"growing up and living a full life\".",
      "\"Being there for my friends, being there for my family, meeting my amazing fianc\u00e9 - all of these things made me a whole person, instead of the most important thing being my stage persona.\"",

      "The NHS is \"looking into\" allegations that patient data was left vulnerable to hacking due to a software flaw at a private medical services company.",
      "The flaw was found last November at Medefer, which handles 1,500 NHS patient referrals a month.",
      "The software engineer who discovered the flaw believes the problem had existed for at least six years.",
      "Medefer says there is no evidence the flaw had been in place that long and stressed that patient data has not been compromised.",
      "The flaw was fixed a few days after being discovered.",
      "In late February the company commissioned an external security agency to undertake a review of its data management systems.",
      "An NHS spokesperson said: \"We are looking into the concerns raised about Medefer and will take further action if appropriate.\"",
      "Medefer's system allows patients to book virtual appointments with doctors, and gives those clinicians access to the appropriate patient data.",
      "However, the software bug, discovered in November, made Medefer's internal patient record system vulnerable to hackers, the engineer said.",
      "The software engineer, who does not want to be named, was shocked by what he uncovered.",
      "\"When I found it, I just thought 'no, it can't be'.\"",
      "The problem was in bits of software called APIs (application programming interfaces), which allow different computer systems to talk to each other.",
      "The engineer says that at Medefer those APIs were not properly secured, and could potentially have been accessed by outsiders, who would have been able to see patient information.",
      "He said it was unlikely that patient information was taken from Medefer, but that without a full investigation, the company could not have known for sure.",
      "\"I've worked in organisations where, if something like this happened, the whole system would be taken down immediately,\" he said.",
      "On discovering the flaw the engineer told the company that an external cybersecurity expert should be bought in to investigate the problem, which he says the company did not do.",
      "Medefer says the external security agency has confirmed that it has found no evidence of any breach of data and that all the company's data systems were currently secure.",
      "It says the process of investigating and fixing the API flaw was \"extremely open\".",
      "Medefer said it had reported the issue to the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office)  and the CQC (Care Quality Commission), \"in the interests of transparency\", and that the ICO had confirmed there is no further action to be taken as there is no evidence of a breach.",
      "The engineer, who had been contracted in October to test for flaws in the company's software, left the company in January.",
      "In a statement Dr Bahman Nedjat-Shokouhi, founder and CEO of Medefer, said: \"There is no evidence of any patient data breach from our systems.\"",
      "He confirmed that the flaw had been discovered in November and a fix was developed in 48 hours.",
      "\"The external security agency has asserted that the allegation that this flaw could have provided access to large amounts of patients' data is categorically false.\"",
      "The security agency will complete its review later this week.",
      "Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi added: \"We take our duties to patients and the NHS very seriously. We hold regular external security audits of our systems by independent external security agencies, undertaken on multiple occasions every year.\"",
      "Cybersecurity experts, who have looked at information supplied by the software engineer, have expressed their concern.",
      "\"There is the possibility that Medefer stored data derived from the NHS not as securely as one would hope it would be,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey.",
      "\"The database might be encrypted and all the other precautions taken, but if there is a way of glitching the API authorisation, anyone who knows how could potentially gain access,\" he added.",
      "Another expert pointed out that as Medefer deals with highly-sensitive, medical data, the company should have bought in cybersecurity experts as soon as the problem was identified.",
      "\"Even if the company suspected that no data was stolen, when facing an issue that could have resulted in a data breach, especially with data of the nature in question, an investigation and confirmation from a suitably qualified cybersecurity expert would be advisable,\" says Scott Helme, a security researcher.",
      "Medefer was founded in 2013 by Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi, with a goal to improve outpatient care. Since then its technology has been used by NHS trusts across the country.",
      "In a statement the NHS spokesperson said those trusts are responsible for their contracts with the private sector.",

      "The FSA is to develop new regulations by working with experts from high-tech food firms and academic researchers.",
      "It says it aims to complete the full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the two-year process it is starting.",
      "But critics say that having the firms involved in drawing up the new rules represents a conflict of interest.",
      "The initiative is in response to concerns by UK firms that they are losing ground to competition overseas, where approvals processes take half the time.",
      "Prof Robin May, the FSA's chief scientist, told BBC News that there would be no compromise on consumer safety.",
      "\"We are working very closely with the companies involved and academic groups to work together to design a regulatory structure that is good for them, but at all costs ensures the safety of these products remains as high as it possibly can,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "When Branneisha Cooper was overweight, she felt both invisible and like she stood out.",
      "Her friends would get attention when they were out together, while she was overlooked. But she also had a sense that everyone was staring at her, scrutinising her.",
      "Everyday scenarios were daunting: fairground rides (would she fit in the seat?), working out (would it hurt?), clothes shopping (would she find attractive clothing in her size?).",
      "At the end of 2022, Branneisha, now 28 and working in Texas for a major retailer, began using weight-loss injection Mounjaro. She's lost about six stone (38kg).",
      "Things changed quickly. Suddenly, she could exercise without her body getting sore, colleagues made more small talk with her and she felt comfortable going on adventurous dates with her boyfriend. She was go-karting, dancing and going to arcades - activities that previously made her feel self-conscious.",
      "But despite feeling like she had a \"second chance at life\", weight loss was bittersweet.",
      "\"It was almost like I had stepped into a different world overnight,\" Branneisha recalls. \"People were suddenly more friendly, more attentive, and I was given opportunities and respect that didn't exist before.\"",
      "\"That rapid shift was jarring and really opened my eyes to just how deeply size bias is ingrained in our culture,\" she continues. \"Psychologically, it was a lot to process because while I was the same person, the way I was perceived had completely changed.\"",
      "Weight-loss transformations are nothing new. In the 90s and 00s, they filled the pages of tabloid newspapers, sold celebrity diet regimes and inspired popular TV series like The Biggest Loser, You Are What You Eat and Celebrity Fit Club.",
      "But in the 2020s, the advent of weight-loss injections like semaglutide and tirzepatide (marketed under brand names Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro) has meant people can lose huge amounts of weight rapidly, without undergoing invasive surgery. The jabs suppress people's appetites, causing them to feel fuller sooner.",
      "Wegovy has been available on the NHS in England, Wales and Scotland since September 2023 with strict eligibility criteria, but weight-loss drugs are expected to become more accessible when Mounjaro becomes available through NHS England later this year.",
      "The jabs, which are not suitable for everyone and can have severe side effects, are also available from pharmacies in the UK for people who can't get them prescribed by their GPs.",
      "So other than the physical difference, how does the way you're perceived change when you lose weight quickly and look different to the world?",
      "People who have used the injections have told BBC News that rapid weight loss has caused a massive shift in the way they are treated - by both strangers and loved ones - as well as a change in how they approach their lives.",
      "'Strangers are a lot more chatty'",
      "Branneisha's feeling of sticking out and being overlooked at the same time while overweight is one others can relate to.",
      "When you're overweight, people either avoid eye contact or \"really stare and glare at you\", says Jess Phillips, 29, a primary school teacher from Sittingbourne, Kent.",
      "She previously felt uncomfortable taking flights, travelling on public transport and eating at restaurants. Finding suitable seating worried her, as well as the feeling she was \"taking other people's space\".",
      "People had even shouted \"fat\" at her from cars and at a festival.",
      "A trip in 2023 to Sorrento, on the Italian coast, was a major catalyst for starting weight-loss injections last June.",
      "\"Everyone was staring at me the whole time,\" she says. \"They're just not used to people being that big out there.\"",
      "Since losing weight, Jess has noticed a big difference in how she's treated in public.",
      "\"Strangers seem to be a lot more chatty with me than they ever were before,\" she explains.",
      "She feels \"more invisible in a nice way\", she continues. \"I don't feel like people are looking at me when I go to different places. I feel nicely anonymous... I'm not standing out in any particular way.\"",
      "This is something that Jeannine A Gailey, sociology professor at Texas Christian University, explored in her 2014 book The Hyper(in)visible Fat Woman.",
      "\"My argument is that those who are marginalised, including fat people, become hyper-visible and hyper-invisible\", meaning they're sometimes ignored and sometimes made into a \"spectacle\", she tells the BBC.",
      "Amy Toon, 34, a content creator from Solihull, felt this way. Before starting on the drugs, she shopped online \"because of the overwhelming fear of people looking at me\", she says. \"I just didn't want to leave the house.\"",
      "Since losing weight, \"people are a lot more smiley and just make eye contact,\" she says. \"I never had that before. It's really strange and it's also really sad at the same time.\"",
      "Society has preconceptions about how overweight people are expected to behave, and treats them accordingly, says Caleb Luna, an assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara specialising in fat studies.",
      "\"Fat people are expected to hide and shrink ourselves and not be proud,\" says Prof Luna.",
      "Weight isn't a protected characteristic in the UK or in most other parts of the world, meaning it isn't illegal to discriminate based on size, except if the person's weight is classed as a disability.",
      "Academics say that anti-fat bias can have significant implications, from how people are perceived in job interviews to how doctors interact with them. People make \"all kinds of personality assumptions\" about other people based on their body size, according to Prof Luna.",
      "\"I don't understand why there's this rage that some people seem to feel upon looking at someone who's overweight,\" says Alix Harvey, a 35-year-old marine biologist from Plymouth who's lost around three stone (20kg) after starting weight-loss injections last year. \"It's socially acceptable to hate fat people.\"",
      "'People see the drugs as cheating'",
      "Weight-loss drugs have helped people like Branneisha, Jess, Amy and Alix lose weight - but they're not right for everyone. Some in the healthcare industry have concerns about the wrong people getting hold of the jabs - including those who are already a healthy weight or have a history of eating disorders.",
      "Common side effects of semaglutide and tirzepatide include diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice). Rarer side effects include acute gallstone disease and pancreatitis, and the NHS warns that there is also a risk of hypoglycaemia, which happens when your blood sugar level drops too low.",
      "Jonathan Pinkney, professor of endocrinology and diabetes at the University of Plymouth, says while there are \"great expectations and hope around the drugs\", trials show people \"do tend to relapse\" after they stop taking them, meaning the weight loss isn't sustained.",
      "Alix says this worries her. \"Am I going to be treated differently again? Because I like the way I'm currently being treated.\"",
      "Some people who take the medication say there's stigma attached to using the drugs to lose weight, too, which Alix says puts some people off taking the injections.",
      "\"I didn't expect the hatred,\" she says, noting that some people see the use of weight-loss injections as \"cheating\" and a \"socially unacceptable\" way to lose weight.",
      "\"A lot of people see it as the lazy way out,\" Amy says, referring to comments about weight-loss drugs left on her social media videos.",
      "For sustained weight loss, the injections need to be used as part of a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise.",
      "\"People think that it's a magic wand then it's not,\" Amy says. \"It doesn't just melt the fat away.\"",
      "\"Even if you injected yourself once a week and a pound a week just evaporated from your body, what would that matter?\" Alix says. \"Why is that cheating?\"",
      "\"You basically can't win,\" she says, referring to the stigma attached to both being overweight and using injections to lose weight.",
      "'The larger me deserved that same attention and love'",
      "People who've lost weight using the jabs tell the BBC their self-confidence has massively improved. Many say they feel much happier to take trains and planes. Some say they now wear brighter colours and tighter clothes. Others say they're more vocal sharing their opinions at work.",
      "Amy says she now feels comfortable taking her children swimming, while Jess says she's been able to book her first-ever ski trip, something she'd never thought was possible before.",
      "\"I actually think it must be annoying how confident I am at the moment,\" Jess laughs.",
      "But many of the women we spoke to were left feeling sad for their previous selves, or frustrated at the unfairness of their past treatment.",
      "\"It's so sad that your weight can define you,\" Amy says. \"I haven't changed at all as a person. The only thing that has changed my appearance.\"",
      "Branneisha echoes these thoughts.",
      "\"It makes me sad when I have experiences that are different now because the larger me deserved that same attention and love,\" Branneisha says. \"Being smaller now makes me sad for my former self because people looked at me differently.\"",

      "According to consultant dermatologist Dr Jonathan Kentley, LED technology works by causing the skin to absorb light energy, which then triggers cellular changes in a process known as photobiomodulation (PBM).",
      "\"This allows new blood vessels and skin cells to be formed, along with more collagen and elastin,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"PBM has also been used to treat acne as it has anti-inflammatory effects and reduces the amount of oil in the skin,\" he adds.",

      "Since then, medical-grade devices have been used by dermatologists \"for many years\", according to Dr Kentley.",
      "But at-home masks have only been on the retail market for about five years and cost a fraction of the medical devices.",
      "The main differences between medical devices and High Street masks are the strength of the LEDs, the number of bulbs on the device and how close they sit to the skin's surface when being used.",

      "Nasal tanners are designed to be sprayed into the nostrils and claim to work by administering a substance known as Melanotan II, a chemical that darkens skin pigmentation.",
      "It is illegal to sell medicinal products containing Melanotan II in the UK but as the tanners are sold cosmetically they fall outside that remit.",
      "However, they are not covered by UK cosmetics regulations, meaning they are not subjected to the same scrutiny as other over-the-counter beauty products.",
      "Experts have said they have not been fully researched and could contain toxic ingredients.",
      "Ms Eagle said she purchased tanners online believing they would give her a quick and easy bronzed look ahead of a planned holiday to Fuerteventura in April 2023.",
      "They had been recommended to her by someone she knew, but she said she did not realise they were unlicensed and unregulated.",
      "The 47-year-old, from King's Lynn in Norfolk, inhaled the spray twice a day, believing it would give her tan \"time to build up before we actually get into the sunshine\".",
      "But on the second day of the trip she was rushed to hospital after the apparent allergic reaction spiralled.",
      "\"I literally could not breathe,\" she said.",

      "\"I can't even explain it, but I was suffocating inside. It was as if I was drowning within my own body.\"",
      "Ms Eagle said she became suspicious after her stepdaughter, who also used a tanner, spotted a Facebook post from someone who said they had also suffered a bad reaction.",
      "She told her hospital consultant, who asked where she had bought the tanner and what was in it.",
      "He also became suspicious, she said.",
      "\"Of course, there was nothing on it apart from a pretty label on the front, no ingredients whatsoever. There was nothing, really, I could show him. And that was a frightening thing,\" she said.",

      "\"The higher the dosage, the more risks that are involved and more side effects are likely to be involved.\"",
      "Cancer risk fears",
      "He said the samples that did not contain the active ingredient were not necessarily safer as they could include other chemicals that \"could be toxic\".",
      "\"Any unlicensed product really comes with a whole host of dangers. There's no safety data. There are no long-term studies as to the impact on people's health,\" Mr Childs added.",
      "Another concern is that nasal tanners are often promoted for use in conjunction with sessions on sunbeds to maximise their effectiveness as part of a tanning routine.",
      "Cancer charities believe this could significantly increase the risk of developing skin cancer.",
      "Kerry Rafferty, who started charity Melanoma-Me after her own diagnosis, described the products as \"skin cancer in a bottle\".",
      "\"It's absolutely terrifying, you've got these tanners that nobody really knows what's in them and then they [could be] accelerated by the sunbed use, which we know causes melanoma, so it is a big worry,\" she said.",
      "\"I think that this could be one of the reasons that there is an increase in melanoma at the moment.\"",
      "Data from North West Cancer Research showed people in the north-west of England were 13% more likely to develop skin cancer than those in the rest of the country.",
      "Chief executive Alastair Richards said the desire for \"that tanned look\" can often lead people to resort to the excessive use of sunbeds and products like nasal tanners.",

      "'It's not just about money'",
      "As recently as 2015, the UK was ranked the best country in the world for end-of-life care by the Economist Intelligence Unit. However, Association for Palliative Medicine president Dr Sarah Cox says: \"That's not the case any longer. We're not getting the funding we need. But it is not just about money \u2013 it is the way services are organised.\"",
      "There are many reasons people end up dying in hospital when they would have preferred to have done so at home. Palliative care staff I have spoken say when people are in their final weeks some decide they need to go to hospital as they become frightened or do not want to be a burden on their loved ones, while in other cases families believe that being in hospital will help prolong their relative's life.",
      "But, ultimately, the lack of palliative care is thought to be the crucial factor in most cases, experts say. And so accident and emergency departments in hospitals become the safety net.",

      "'Palliative care is not good enough - there's no plan to fix it'",
      "'Focus on palliative care not assisted dying'",
      "'We felt on our own looking after mum in her last days'",
      "The Marie Curie report found around half of people in England and Wales end up going to A&E at least once in their final three months, and one in eight spend 30 days or more in hospital. And a hospital death is not always in the relative comfort of a bed on a ward.",
      "Hospital palliative care doctor Dr Rachel Clarke says she can spend whole days in A&E trying her best to care for patients dying in resuscitation areas and in corridors. \"It's a travesty people end their lives like that.\"",
      "Specialist palliative care is actually provided by a range of different organisations. \"People receive it from hospitals, from community NHS teams, from social care and from hospices,\" says Dr Cox.",
      "\"But families tell us that there is a lack of coordination between the different parts of the system. People struggle to get the help they need and end up in hospital.\"",
      "This is exactly what happened to Terry, who was rushed to hospital in an ambulance because of a fluid build-up related to his cancer two weeks before he died and never returned home. With better support at home, it is quite possible he would never have needed to be admitted.",
      "On top of the financial pressures felt by the rest of the NHS, experts say that a combination of demographic changes, different parts of the system acting in isolation and cash being spent in the wrong places have all brought the palliative care system to this point.",
      "And the problems are becoming more acute each year. For the 30 years up to 2011, the number of people dying in the UK was falling but that has changed as the people born during the boom in births following World War Two have grown old. Over the next decade, the number of deaths a year is expected to increase by 12%.",
      "The difficulties faced by hospices",
      "Where it works well, palliative care makes all the difference to those who use it. Hospices are a major provider of care, supporting 300,000 people a year - mainly in the community, not just inside their own buildings, contrary to popular belief.",
      "St Christopher's Hospice in south London is helping more than 1,700 people with terminal illnesses across five London boroughs. It receives referrals from GPs, district nursing teams and hospitals.",
      "Palliative care nurse Grace Larder says she provides many types of support to her patients, who have a range of conditions from motor neurone disease and Parkinson's to liver failure. This includes pain control and care for other physical problems, along with helping them with psychological and financial needs.",
      "\"We really develop relationships with people,\" she says. \"There's one patient I've been working with for nearly two years. You want to do your best.\"",
      "Most people she cares for tell her that they want to die at home, she says \u2013 but that's only possible if they get the right care.",
      "But many hospice services are in financial difficulties. Only around a third of St Christopher's funding comes from the NHS; the rest comes from fundraising and charitable donations.",
      "Any drugs the hospice provides has to come from their own funds too so they try to anticipate what their patients will need in advance and work with the patient's GP to have them prescribed on the NHS.",
      "A parliamentary report warned the current approach to funding is not sustainable.",
      "\"What other health service has to get by like that?\" says Helen King, who manages the team of nurses at St Christopher's. She points out that they are fortunate to have an affluent local community that donates generously.",
      "\"[But] the fact remains we get more money from our shops - from selling second-hand clothing - than we do from the government.\"",
      "Training is 'virtually non-existent'",
      "The government has recognised there is a problem and provided an extra \u00a3100m of funding this year to the sector \u2013 although hospice services have said this will mostly go on the rising costs they are facing.",
      "As for hospitals offering palliative care, audits show that four in 10 hospitals, for example, do not have specialist services available seven days a week - despite this having been set as a national standard in 2004.",
      "In practice, that means there is no specialist palliative care support from doctors or nurses available during evenings and weekends either in person or on-call, says Dr Clarke. \"You would never have that for other specialities like cardiology or renal so why should it happen for palliative care?\"",

      "In the US, DEI is under attack. But under a different name, it might live on",
      "After White House clash, Starmer faces decision about who he can trust",
      "This is compounded by the fact that palliative care training is \"virtually non-existent\" for the other staff who pick up the burden, who often lack the confidence to speak to patients and families about dying and prescribe the right drugs, she says.",
      "\"We will come into work and find patients really suffering \u2013 in pain, breathless, agitated or with nausea and vomiting. It is hard to over-state how lamentably badly-resourced palliative care services are.\"",
      "Meanwhile, in the community, GPs are left to pick up the pieces. But Dr Catherine Millington-Sanders from the Royal College of General Practicioners says that, given an \"unrelenting workload\" and staffing shortages, it is difficult to provide the care patients need, particularly home visits.",
      "\"Families and unpaid carers bear the brunt,\" she says.",
      "Money would help - but it won't fix it",
      "So what is the solution? More money would help, but it wouldn't fix everything.",
      "Earlier this year the Health Economics Unit and Nuffield Trust think-tank found that plenty was being spent on people in the final year of their life. Nearly \u00a312bn was going on their healthcare, the report found \u2013 that works out at in excess of \u00a318,000 per person for everyone who dies.",
      "But the overwhelming majority of that \u00a312bn \u2013 85% - goes on hospitals and emergency care, rather than support in the community.",
      "It is, essentially, a false economy, as support in hospital tends to be more expensive.",
      "Dr Sam Royston, executive director of research at the charity, says these findings go a long way to explaining why \"too many people are dying in places where they don't want or need to be\".",
      "He adds: \"There must be a clear long-term ambition for all UK governments to shift health expenditure on people at the end of life from hospital to community.\"",
      "According to Dr Royston, just shifting 20% of the money spent caring for dying people in hospital would be transformative for community services as it would double current spending.",
      "Is better coordination the solution?",
      "What would a better system look like? First of all, more could be done to identify people's needs before they are admitted to hospital, Dr Royston believes.",
      "He points to a service in Bradford called React which works in emergency departments to identify and assess patients and diverting them towards teams in the community who can support them instead.",
      "A study found it reduced average unplanned bed days in patients' final year of life from 38 to 18.",
      "But to reduce the number of people going to hospital in the first place, there needs to be greater co-ordination of services too, given the complexity of support and variety of providers, says Dr Cox.",
      "She says there need to be electronic records that detail the wishes of people who are at the end of life that health and care staff can access: \"These electronic systems are available in some areas but not others,\" she says.",
      "She also argues providing a central hub or phone line to help people navigate and coordinate care would be transformational.",
      "She points to a system that has been set up in Cambridgeshire between a local hospice service, NHS 111 and the local ambulance service. It provides people at the end of their life with access to a specialist nurse 24 hours a day, simply by calling the NHS 111 advice line.",
      "\"A service like this can make a huge difference, providing equipment, responsive visits as well as telephone advice and signposting to other services,\" adds Dr Cox.",
      "And better training for non-specialist staff is also essential, Dr Cox and Dr Clarke agree.",
      "\"My utopia would be that you don't actually need lots of specialist palliative care services because everybody is so good at supporting patients at the end of life,\" adds Dr Clarke.",
      "\"If we were able to support people in the community properly, it would be better for them and would actually cost the NHS less.\"",
      "She adds: \"We need to prioritise this - you only die once.\"",

      "That NHS test, which is processed in a laboratory, measures the level of PSA released by the prostate, a small gland involved in the production of semen.",
      "A high PSA level does not mean you have cancer but is a warning sign which can then lead to further scans and tests to rule out the disease.",
      "PSA levels can be high for a number of other reasons - including an infection, recent vigorous exercise or sex - or in some rare cases remain normal despite cancer.",
      "Google search data suggests interest in testing has risen sharply since the Olympic cyclist Sir Chris Hoy went public with his own diagnosis in October 2024.",
      "Dozens of companies now sell self-testing kits designed to measure PSA levels.",

      "The UK medicines regulator, the MHRA, says in its guidance that over-the-counter PSA kits are \"not a reliable indicator of prostate cancer\" and must not \"claim to detect cancer\".",
      "Instead, some at-home tests are marketed online as a way to \"screen\" for the disease, language the regulator says would be acceptable under the current rules.",

      "\"As your experience shows, these rapid tests appear to have questionable accuracy,\" says Amy Rylance, assistant director of health improvement at Prostate Cancer UK.",

    "story": [
      "An autistic woman with a learning disability was wrongly locked up in a mental health hospital for 45 years, starting when she was just seven years old, the BBC has learned.",
      "The woman, who is believed to be originally from Sierra Leone, and who was given the name Kasibba by the local authority to protect her identity, was also held on her own in long-term segregation for 25 years.",
      "Kasibba is non-verbal and had no family to speak up for her. A clinical psychologist told File on 4 Investigates how she had begun a nine-year battle to release her.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC it was unacceptable that so many disabled people were still being held in mental health hospitals and said it hoped reforms to the Mental Health Act would prevent inappropriate detention.",
      "More than 2,000 autistic people and people with learning disabilities are still detained in mental health hospitals in England - including about 200 children. For years, the government has pledged to move many of them into community care, because they do not have any mental illness.",
      "The government promised to take action after a BBC undercover investigation in 2011 exposed the criminal abuse of people with learning disabilities at Winterbourne View private hospital near Bristol.",
      "But all key targets in England have been missed. In the past few weeks, in its plan for 2025-26, NHS England said it aimed to reduce the reliance on mental health inpatient care for people with a learning disability and autistic people, delivering a minimum 10% reduction.",
      "However, Dan Scorer, head of policy and public affairs at the charity Mencap, is not impressed. \"Hundreds of people are still languishing, detained, who should have been freed and should be supported in the community, because we haven't seen the progress that was promised,\" he told us.",
      "Dr Patsie Staite learned of Kasibba's incarceration in 2013 when she was a rookie clinical psychologist carrying out a routine review of her care. But it would take nine years to free her.",
      "\"I hadn't ever seen anyone living in the situation that she was living in. And I think what was really shocking was it was all legitimised,\" Dr Staite told the BBC. She said the apparently legitimate hospital setting masked the reality that Kasibba \"was locked up for sometimes more than 23 hours a day\".",
      "Returning to the site of the hospital - which cannot be named to help protect Kasibba's identity - Dr Staite pointed out a hole in the fence. It had been cut out, she said, so Kasibba could watch people walking by from the outside space of the locked annex where she was held.",
      "It is thought Kasibba, who is now in her 50s, was trafficked from Sierra Leone before the age of five. She lived in a children's home for a while, but that placement broke down and, by the age of seven, she was moved into the long-stay hospital.",
      "Dr Staite said that staff had described Kasibba as \"dangerous\" and an \"eye-gouger\".",
      "She discovered a single incident in the records which appeared to have led to these accusations of violence. Decades earlier, when Kasibba was 19 and before she was placed in long-term segregation, a fire alarm had gone off and the locked ward was being evacuated.",
      "Kasibba was distressed and, in the confusion, she was approached by another patient. She scratched her, causing a cut to the other patient's eye.",
      "\"That was how the incident was talked about ever since, 'she's an eye gouger and she caused so much harm to this other person',\" said Dr Staite. But \"it just didn't ring true\", she said, that a middle-aged woman with a learning disability who had lived in the hospital for decades could be that dangerous.",
      "After months of work, Dr Staite submitted a 50-page report to Camden Council - the local authority in north London which had originally placed Kasibba in the hospital. Dr Staite said it had already been accepted that Kasibba did not have a mental illness and her report concluded she was not dangerous and was safe to live in the community.",
      "A team of health and social care professionals was then set up in 2016, calling themselves \"the escape committee\". Their mission was to free Kasibba.",
      "Lucy Dunstan, from disability rights organisation Changing Our Lives, was appointed to be Kasibba's independent advocate and to build a compelling case for why it was safe for her to leave the hospital.",
      "But Kasibba's release could only be signed off by the Court of Protection, which makes decisions for people who do not have the mental capacity to make their own.",
      "Ms Dunstan said when she first met Kasibba, hospital staff simply introduced her as \"the eye-gouger\".",
      "She said she recalls looking at Kasibba through a small window in the door that kept her locked in. \"She was just lying on the the settee. It was a very empty room. Her life was completely impoverished,\" she said.",
      "It would be six years from first having met Kasibba before Ms Dunstan got a call to tell her that the Court of Protection had ruled she could leave hospital. \"I cried. Joy. Relief. Admiration for her. Pride,\" she said. \"It's not about me and what we did, but that she did it and she showed them.\"",
      "Now Kasibba lives in the community with the help of support workers, who engage with her and communicate with gentle touches, gestures and clear language. Her care manager said she loved fashion, was proud of her home and enjoyed social interaction.",
      "\"She has the most amazing sense of humour. She's a beautiful human being,\" the manager said. \"After about two weeks of working here she actually came up and gave me a hug. This is not an eye-gouger, you know.\"",
      "The Mental Health Bill going through parliament will mean autistic people and those with learning disabilities in England and Wales, who do not have a mental health condition, will no longer be able to be detained for treatment.",
      "But the government has said it will not bring in any changes until it is satisfied there is sufficient alternative support in the community. And it will still allow people to be detained in hospital legally for up to 28 days for assessment.",
      "Jess McGregor, executive director of adults and health at Camden Council, said it was a \"tragedy\" that Kasibba had spent most of her life held in hospital. \"I'm personally sorry,\" she said. \"She shouldn't have experienced what she did.\"",
      "The NHS mental health trust, which cannot be named to protect Kasibba's identity, said at no point had the care it delivered been brought into question and the service was rated as outstanding by the Care Quality Commission.",
      "The trust told File on 4 Investigates that anyone assessed as needing long-term segregation had a self-contained property with their own bedroom, bathroom, living room and garden.",
      "The trust said from 2010 it had been working with local authorities to put plans in place to support the discharge of all long-term residents to more appropriate care, where possible within the community, but said they were prevented from doing so by a legal case brought by the families of other patients.",
      "It said its staff had then worked tirelessly for years supporting local authorities to put the necessary support in place in the community and they were able to successfully close the service in 2023."

      "She said: \"[Governments] can use our country specific estimates on the stage, timing, and speed of current and forecasted transitions in weight to identify priority populations experiencing the greatest burdens of obesity who require immediate intervention and treatment, and those that remain predominantly overweight and should be primarily targeted with prevention strategies.",

      "Netflix's new drama Toxic Town revisits one of the UK's biggest environmental scandals: the Corby toxic waste case.",
      "The series tells the story of families fighting for justice after children in the Northamptonshire town were born with birth defects, believed to be caused by industrial pollution.",
      "Corby's steel and iron industry expanded rapidly in the 1930s with the construction of Stewarts and Lloyds steelworks.",
      "By the 1970s, half the town worked in the mills, but when the steelworks closed in the 1980s, toxic waste from the demolition process was mishandled, leading to widespread contamination.",
      "In 2009, after a long legal battle, the High Court ruled Corby Borough Council was negligent in managing the waste.",
      "Families affected won an undisclosed financial settlement in 2010, held in trust until the children turned 18.",
      "Alongside the drama, a BBC Radio Northampton podcast series offers a deeper look into the real-life events, using original court transcripts and newly uncovered documents.",
      "Introducing... The Toxic Waste Scandal",
      "Hosted by George Taylor, 32, who was born with an upper limb defect linked to the case, the podcast features testimony and interviews with those directly impacted.",
      "Here are some of the key voices behind the story.",
      "'The first person you are going to blame is yourself'",
      "George Angus Taylor was born on 11 March 1992 to parents Fiona and Brian, in Corby.",
      "Brian had worked at Stewart and Lloyds, a job that left him covered in dust and debris at the end of each shift.",
      "Fiona, a former Boots No7 beauty consultant, vividly remembers George's birth, an event that would change their lives forever.",
      "Born \"navy blue\" as a result of pre-foetal circulation issues, he was immediately ventilated and placed in intensive care.",
      "It was then Fiona noticed something unusual.",
      "\"I remember just seeing his little hand; his pinkie ring finger and middle finger,\" she says.",
      "\"It was like a fist; you know how babies make a fist? Then his index finger; his thumb was sticking out.",
      "\"I just kept thinking, 'He's here because of me,' and you just look for blame. You look, and the first person you are going to blame is yourself.\"",
      "At 14, doctors discovered a tumour in George's hand so large that amputation became a real possibility.",
      "The surgery, experimental at the time, was gruelling. \"When I woke up, I was so full of morphine,\" he remembers.",
      "\"They said it was like climbing Everest with no practice \u2013 my body just shut down.\"",
      "The experience, particularly the smell, left lasting memories. \"They burn flesh as they [operate]: very quiet sizzling, like sausages in a pan. And that's the smell that still comes to you from time to time.\"",
      "Despite everything, George was determined to move forward. \"The first time I saw my hand, I wasn't shocked. I wasn't sad. It was better than before.\"",
      "But George was not alone. Other children in Corby were born with similar conditions.",
      "'Did I do this?'",
      "Lisa Atkinson was a security guard at the Corby steel mills, where her duties involved outside patrols, checking parking permits, and often having to move dust that had settled over everything.",
      "On 27 June 1989, she gave birth to her daughter, Simone, at Kettering General Hospital.",
      "Simone was born with three fingers on each hand.",
      "Doctors reassured Lisa, saying the only thing she would not be able to do was play the piano.",
      "Just as Fiona Taylor did with George, Lisa initially questioned whether she was responsible for her daughter's condition.",
      "\"There was probably part of me that sat there and went, 'What did I do? Did I do this?'\" she says.",
      "\"Because I've had a couple of miscarriages before Simone... I always thought maybe I was lucky; maybe I was given Simone... but she wasn't quite perfect. But I was lucky to have had that baby and not the two previous ones.\"",
      "Despite her initial self-doubt, Lisa \"knew\" she had done nothing wrong, as she had neither drunk nor smoked during pregnancy.",
      "She recalls the lack of follow-up care or investigation into her daughter's condition.",
      "\"You're let out into the world with a child that's a little bit different,\" she says.",
      "\"But there was nowhere to go. There was no follow-up or anything, no 'We're going to look into it.' So you just deal with it. And you did, because you had to.\"",
      "Lisa quickly adjusted to life with Simone's condition, saying: \"It shocked other people more than it shocked me. I got used to it really, really quickly.\"",
      "Winning the subsequent legal case against the borough council brought with it overwhelming attention.",
      "\"I'm not famous, but I feel like that's how famous people must feel... It was crazy.\"",
      "Growing up, Simone, now 35, faced relentless bullying.",
      "\"I had a great family and friends... but [school] was hard. I wasn't a very confident child, and I was an easy target,\" she remembers.",
      "Simone coped by using humour. She would joke that her mum had chopped off her fingers or that she was part alien, turning her differences into something entertaining.",
      "\"It was a bit of a front, because if I make a joke about myself, nobody else can. Just accept that's who you are; it's not going to change.\"",
      "At 18, she was offered surgery to reshape her hands, but declined.",
      "\"They admitted they didn't really know if it would help. By then, I'd adapted. I live with daily pain, but I didn't want to risk making things worse.\"",
      "Meeting her now-husband, she initially hid her hands, subtly positioning herself to avoid detection.",
      "Eventually, she told him - through a long message and sending him a link to the 2020 Horizon documentary about the case.",
      "His response? \"It's really not a big deal.\"",
      "Today, she is grateful for the legal battle her family fought. \"It set me up for life,\" she says.",
      "\"I was able to start my own life, and I went to university. I've got my own house and my daughter had the best start in life.\"",
      "'It felt like we were an inconvenience'",
      "Lewis Waterfield was born in 1994 with deformities to both hands.",
      "His father worked near the contaminated site as a roofer, and his pregnant mother often visited him there.",
      "\"My dad noticed something wasn't right straight away,\" Lewis recalls.",
      "As a child, he endured disruptive hospital stays, including an unsuccessful attempt to graft a toe on to his hand to create a functioning finger.",
      "\"I've had extensive surgery, but there are limits to what can be done.\"",
      "During the legal battle, Lewis's parents fought to prove a link between industrial pollution and birth defects.",

      "Corby Borough Council ceased to exist in 2021 when it merged with other authorities to become North Northamptonshire Council.",
      "In 2010, its then chief executive, Chris Mallender, issued a formal apology over the scandal.",
      "\"The council extends its deepest sympathy to the children and their families,\" it said.",
      "\"Although I accept that money cannot properly compensate these young people for their disabilities and for all that they've suffered to date and their problems in the future, the council sincerely hopes that this apology, coupled with today's agreement, will mean they can now put their legal battle behind them and proceed with their lives with a greater degree of financial certainty.\"",

      "The lawyer, a KC or King's Counsel, who has not been named by the party but whose credentials have been verified by the BBC, said: \"I have seen a number of statements made by Mr Lowe MP which are attributed to me and which describe my reactions to the process conducted by the party into the allegations made against both Mr Lowe MP and his constituency manager.",
      "\"I find myself in the unfortunate and regrettable position of having to make this statement to correct the record.\"",
      "The lawyer added: \"I have not expressed either 'dismay' or 'shock' at any time as to the process. Nor have I said 'there is zero credible evidence against [Mr Lowe]', let alone said this 'repeatedly'.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Civil Service will be reformed under \"radical\" plans to be announced this week, Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden has told the BBC.",
      "Speaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, he said parts of the Civil Service \"would and can\" be smaller, with the government expected to prioritise frontline jobs, like border guards and prison officers. He did not give a figure for reducing staff levels.",
      "As part of the measures, senior staff will have performance-related pay and those failing to meet required standards could be dismissed if they do not improve within six months.",
      "Public sector union, the FDA, accused the government of delivering a \"soundbite, not a credible plan for change\", describing it as a \"re-treading of failed narratives\".",
      "Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said Labour's plans were \"weak and anaemic\" compared to what his party had been planning.",
      "He said before losing power in the general election, Conservative ministers had begun a process to reduce the Civil Service by 12%.",

      "McFadden is aiming to redirect resources from the backrooms to frontline roles, such as border guards and prison officers.",
      "While he avoided setting a figure on how big the Civil Service should be in the future, arguing it \"narrows the discussion too much\" he did say \"the central Civil Service would and can become smaller\".",
      "He also said he wanted to see more civil servants working outside London \"where the state can get better value for money\".",
      "As part of the measures any civil servants performing below expectations may be \"incentivised\" to leave their jobs, with McFadden promising a new \"mutually agreed exits\" process.",
      "For senior civil servants there will be performance-related pay and new measures to tackle poor performance. This will include putting those found to be under-performing on development plans. If there is no improvement in their performance after six months senior civil servants could then be dismissed.",
      "Higher number of digital and data apprenticeships",
      "The proposals will also see one in 10 civil servants employed in a digital or data role within five years, to be delivered through apprenticeships and retraining staff.",
      "Currently there are 25,000 digital and data civil servants, making up 5% of the civil service workforce.",
      "No timescale has been given by the government on when they want to bring in the wider changes to the Civil Service.",
      "Asked if he wanted more civil servants to return to office working, McFadden said he personally thought there was \"value to being in the office\" and it was \"generally a good thing\".",
      "Asked if the government was copying Elon Musk's efforts to reduce the US state, McFadden said: \"Performance management is part of every big organisation, but it's an important thing for you and your viewers to remember: we're a centre-left government.",
      "\"We believe in good public provision, that's why we fought the election, saying we wanted to have more teachers in schools, more neighbourhood police officers, why we wanted to get waiting lists down.",
      "\"That will guide us in our actions, it's up front in our policies, so we will be radical about this, but it's about getting bang for our buck in terms of the outcomes for the public, it isn't an ideological approach to stripping back the state.\"",
      "But Dave Penman, general secretary of the civil servants union FDA, said: \"If the government is serious about transforming public services they must set out what the substance of reform looks like, not just the retreading of failed ideas and narratives.\"",
      "He added meaningful reform \"must put substance before headlines\", and that if McFadden wanted civil servants to focus on delivery - while government departments simultaneously cut resources - \"ministers need to set realistic priorities\".",
      "\"[The] government should get on with the difficult job of setting those priorities rather than announcing a new performance management process for civil servants every other month,\" Mr Penman explained.",
      "Mike Clancy, head of the Prospect union which represents more than 32,000 civil servants, said: \"Nobody would say the Civil Service is perfect, and our members are willing partners in reform, but this government must end the tradition of treating the Civil Service as a political punchbag.",
      "\"A serious reform agenda must start not from blunt headcount targets, but from an appraisal of the specialist skills needed in areas like science and data, and a realisation that the current pay system does not compete with the private sector for these skills.\"",
      "In 2016, the Civil Service headcount stood at 384,000 - the lowest level since World War Two.",
      "However, over the past decade that number has steadily risen, with the Institute for Government (IfG) think tank putting the figure for 2024 at 515,085.",

      "In the coming week, the government is also expected to set out changes to the welfare system, aimed at cutting the overall bill.",
      "Asked on the programme if the government were planning to make changes to disability benefits, McFadden said: \"They will be part of this discussion.\"",
      "\"We don't believe it is good that if somebody could work with a bit of support that they're left to live a life on benefits.\"",
      "He said 2.8 million people were currently on long-term sickness benefits and added that, if the government did not act, the level would rise to more than four million.",

      "What is the chancellor expected to announce?",
      "Reeves has committed to one major economic event - the Budget - each year, to \"give families and businesses stability and certainty on tax and spending changes\".",
      "That means no big policy announcements are made on 26 March, but that's not stopping them being made beforehand.",
      "With the economy seen to be underperforming and global factors, such as US trade tariffs, indirectly impacting the UK, there is growing speculation over whether the chancellor will break her self-imposed rules on borrowing.",
      "The OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the \u00a39.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029/30 financial year, has been wiped out.",
      "Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\". Her two main rules are:",

      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending",

      "Government sources have been keen to state that this event is not a major one because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "A debateable tax hiking policy could be announced, however, if Reeves decides to extend the freeze on the thresholds at which people start to pay different rates of income tax.",
      "The policy is known as a hidden tax rise or stealth tax, as it takes effect over time as people are dragged into paying more tax as their pay goes up, without the tax rate rising at all.",
      "Thresholds were frozen by the previous Conservative government until April 2025, but the chancellor could decide to extend the freeze to raise about \u00a37bn a year, according to consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics and investment bank Citi.",
      "Reeves decided not to extend the threshold freeze in her first Budget, arguing that doing so \"would hurt working people\" and \"take more money out of their payslips\".",
      "Whether any other spending cuts are announced in the Spring Statement or in the Spending Review in June, or even delayed until the next Budget, remains to be seen.",
      "How is the UK economy doing?",
      "Recent figures show UK economic growth has been sluggish - not shrinking, but not growing as desired.",
      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, according to the latest official figures.",
      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target, and is forecast to go higher. Inflation could dictate whether interest rates are lowered further from their current 4.5%.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump further in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "Pressure has also increased on the chancellor's tax and spending plans after a surplus in government finances missed official forecasts, prompting speculation from economists that she could break her fiscal rules as things stand.",
      "Borrowing costs for the UK surged in January in part due to concerns over the UK's economic outlook, threatening Reeves's economic plans. The costs have since fallen back but remain higher than this time last year.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, despite tariffs not directly targeting the UK, would lower growth and raise inflation."

      "The act has been used to halt attempts to deport migrants deemed to be in the UK illegally, and it stopped flights carrying asylum seekers taking off for Rwanda.",
      "Badenoch has not proposed leaving the ECHR, but has argued some foreign criminals and migrants in the UK illegally have successfully used the act to avoid deportation - saying, for example, this would undermine their right to family life.",
      "She also believes some judges generously interpret the provisions of the act when rejecting deportation.",
      "The Conservatives are suggesting an amendment to the government's Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill - which is currently at the committee stage - that would disapply the act in immigration cases.",
      "The policy would give her a clear political dividing line with Labour.",
      "Under the ECHR, migrants could still appeal against deportation to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.",
      "Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that the Conservatives' proposal \"looks like an outsourcing\" of immigration decisions to the Strasbourg court.",
      "\"I don't think that really deals with the issue and I'm afraid it's symptomatic of the kind of gimmicks without action that we saw for a long, long period of time,\" he said.",
      "Later in the programme, Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp defended the proposal, saying it would make a \"very big difference\". He said judges have expanded definitions under the EHCR \"in ways that defy common sense\".",
      "\"Of course we believe in rights, but where you have courts just constantly expanding the definition in a way that was never contemplated at the beginning...it gets out of hand,\" he said.",
      "Philp said membership in the ECHR requires \"proper consideration\", which the Conservatives will be thinking about \"in a very carefully considered manner in the coming months\".",
      "UK may have to leave human rights treaty, says Badenoch",
      "Stop the Boats slogan was too stark, Rishi Sunak tells BBC",
      "Badenoch said the amendment she is suggesting would be \"critical to shift immigration powers from the courts to Parliament and elected ministers, enabling more effective control over our borders\".",
      "\"Operating in Britain's national interest means recognising the government's primary purpose: defending our borders, values, and people. Our amendment aims to restore control and prioritise national security,\" she said.",
      "The Home Office source said: \"The Tories left the asylum system in utter chaos.",
      "\"They had 14 years to make changes and instead spent hundreds of millions of pounds on the failed Rwanda scheme, as small boat crossings hit a record high.",
      "\"This amendment is totally unworkable.",
      "\"Instead of dealing with mad proposals that will never work, the Labour government is getting a grip of the asylum system, increasing removals of those with no right to be here, saving millions on asylum hotels and looking at ways of tightening the application of Article 8 to ensure the system works more effectively.\"",
      "The ECHR was established in 1950 by a number of countries including the UK.",
      "The treaty, which sets out the rights and freedoms people are entitled to in the 46 signatory countries, is overseen by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.",
      "It is separate to the European Union - so the UK remained part of both after Brexit."

      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has defended the decision to suspend one of his MPs, as he warned against \"constant infighting\" within political parties.",
      "Writing in the Telegraph, Farage acknowledged the row had \"dented\" the \"sense of unity\" in Reform but said it would have been \"inconceivable\" not to take action.",
      "They are his first public comments since MP Rupert Lowe was suspended from Reform, and he will now sit as an independent while an inquiry is carried out.",
      "Lowe is accused of workplace bullying, and also separately making threats of physical violence against the party's chairman. He denies the claims.",
      "Responding to Farage's Telegraph piece, he said it was an \"entirely false and poisonous narrative\".",
      "Lowe - who is the MP for Great Yarmouth - has said there is \"zero credible evidence\" against him, and that he was suspended in response to him criticising Farage in an interview earlier this week.",

      "Farage wrote: \"If the last general election taught us anything, it is that the public does not like political parties that engage in constant infighting.\"",
      "He said Reform had built a unified party, but that \"thanks to one of our MPs, Rupert Lowe, unloading a barrage of criticisms against our operations and its main actors, that sense of unity has been dented\".",
      "Farage said Lowe had fallen out with his parliamentary colleagues \"in one way or another\" since his election eight months ago.",
      "\"We did our best to keep a lid on things but, in the end, containment strategies invariably fail,\" said Farage.",
      "Reform, the successor to Farage's Brexit Party, has been riding high in recent polls but the row has exposed divisions within the party and means its five MPs are now down to four.",
      "Lowe is accused of workplace bullying made by two female employees in his offices.",
      "He has also been referred to police by Reform over allegations he made threats of physical violence at least twice to party chairman Zia Yusuf.",
      "The party has appointed a lawyer to conduct an investigation into the allegations. Lowe previously said he had \"cooperated and spoken at length\" with the lawyer.",
      "Reform UK refers MP Rupert Lowe to police",
      "Farage hits back at Reform MP's leadership criticism",
      "In his Telegraph piece, Farage said Reform had a \"duty of care\" to its staff, and it was \"entirely right\" to carry out an independent inquiry.",
      "\"It is inconceivable that we could simply ignore such allegations,\" he added.",
      "Responding to Farage's piece, Lowe issued a new 250-word statement on X, saying he had \"enormous respect\" for him - but \"you know that this is an entirely false and poisonous narrative\".",
      "He said he only learnt of the proceedings against him after he gave an interview to the Daily Mail in which he criticised Farage.",
      "Lowe said he had asked Farage to have dinner with him to resolve the situation, adding: \"This should have ALL happened behind closed doors. As I pushed for, over and over again.\"",
      "On Friday, Tim Montgomerie, a former Conservative commentator who defected to Reform last December, said as soon as he arrived in Reform he had \"picked up these tensions\" between Farage and Lowe.",
      "\"I don't know obviously these individual allegations but I think this was going to come to a head at some point anyway,\" he told BBC Newsnight.",
      "The splits emerged publicly when the Daily Mail published its interview with Lowe on Thursday, where he said Reform under Farage remained a \"protest party led by the Messiah\"."

    "published": "Sat, 08 Mar 2025 14:26:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The PM seizes the spotlight as Trump upends the world order - but he faces serious challenges in the UK.",
    "story": [
      "\"Trump may be the best thing to happen to Starmer,\" says a diplomat, suggesting the brash property tycoon busy upending the world order might be just what the strait-laced prime minister - who's been dragging in the polls - needs.",
      "One of Labour's business backers calls it \"the PM's finest hour\" - a Remainer leader putting Britain at the heart of international action as Trump rattles the Western world's cage.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer has certainly been incredibly visible \u2013 in the White House, leading a European summit at Lancaster House last weekend, hugging Zelensky, plotting a peacekeeping path with Macron.",
      "It's hard for the Conservatives and other opponents to compete with the prime minister's international moves dominating the news.",
      "Moments of crisis like the one we're living through are often when the public tunes into politics and looks to their leaders. With a shaky global situation, does No 10 look more solid than before?",
      "Some of his colleagues are certain. One government source tells me all the international activity is \"almost Blair-esque\", or even a moment like Thatcher and the Falklands which enabled the 80s Conservative prime minister to burnish her reputation and win successive election victories.",
      "Another minister suggests other leaders \"get their knickers in a twist\" publicly reacting to Trump's unpredictable comments and actions - \"but Keir has spent his whole career dealing with extreme circumstances. What he is able to do is get people to focus on the things that really matter.\"",
      "But impressive-looking diplomacy doesn't mean the UK is getting what it wants \u2013 missiles are still falling, overnight again in Donetsk and Kharkhiv. Donald Trump's commitment to guaranteeing Ukraine's security, even NATO's future, is shaky too.",
      "So let's take a calm look. Polling suggests there has been a nudge upwards for Sir Keir's personal ratings and for Labour, after a dreadful start in office and a steep, fast drop in the polls.",
      "His government would not be the first to be swept away by the intensity and glamour of global diplomacy which, however difficult or worthy, doesn't necessarily translate into significant brownie points at home.",
      "Perhaps in these wild times, we're seeing the prime minister carve out a role as \"reassurer in chief\". In political circles it's long been common to find criticisms of Sir Keir Starmer for, frankly, being a bit dull, and not willing to play the minute-by-minute political game. But with Trump in the White House stoking drama the PM's colleagues believe his steadiness has become an asset.",
      "And he's shown willingness to take action \u2013 increasing defence spending, albeit after months of pressure, getting European leaders together and drawing up military plans for after a peace deal. A senior government source says: \"The global crisis means people looking at us again, and the government has been making an argument that people are responding to: that we have got their backs.\"",
      "But aligning yourself with an American president doesn't always work out. Tony Blair's chinos weren't the only thing that became uncomfortable about his relationship with George W Bush.",
      "So while there's evidence the public are looking at Sir Keir a touch more favourably since his White House trip, as one union leader warns, \"for it to count he has to show the same mojo at home\".",
      "Take the row over sentencing this week. Or forthcoming arguments over cutting welfare, which ministers have been falling over themselves to soften the ground for.",
      "But overshadowing everything, priority number one: the grisly state of the economy and getting it to grow.",
      "In around a fortnight Rachel Reeves will be on her feet in Parliament, probably announcing cuts to public spending running to billions. Government sources point to some better statistics on wages, and cuts to interest rates, but Reeves is under enormous pressure to explain how the economy is going to escape the doldrums it has been stuck in for ages.",
      "All the Kodak moments, and grip and grins with international leaders in the world won't change that. The PM \"can walk and talk at the same\" time, one ally says. But there are, they acknowledge, \"only so many hours in the day\".",
      "Helping Ukraine against Putin's Russia has a clear moral story the prime minister finds easy to tell, and compelling to try to shape. In contrast, \"how do you bring prosperity to the regions? That's a real puzzle.\"",
      "In the next few days, starting with the PM's right-hand man Pat McFadden in the studio tomorrow, you will see the government try to kick up the pace of what is happening at home. First up - perhaps not a box-office hit - they'll be looking at making the Whitehall machine work better, including making it easier to get rid of civil servants.",
      "Ministers tell me Downing Street is being run more effectively than before Christmas and has a clearer sense of direction, after early embarrassment over being far less prepared than promised.",
      "Sir Keir chairs regular meetings with individual cabinet ministers in charge of the government's \"missions\". I'm told he \"cross-examines\" them and their officials - and if their answers aren't up to snuff, they get called in for another meeting. \"He is a very nice man, but he is a hard man too,\" one of them confides.",
      "As well as slimming down parts of the civil service, there'll be more on the government's plans to cut billions off the welfare bill. Labour will argue it's for good reason, to help people stuck on benefits - while critics will say it's a way for the government to save money off the backs of some of the most vulnerable people in the country.",
      "On Thursday, the prime minister is expected to make his own speech in an attempt to weave it all together into a grand narrative about safety abroad and at home. One government source said the last few weeks had galvanised Sir Keir's thinking on this: when things are uncertain on the international stage, \"everything feels a bit wobbly\" and domestic security is amplified: you look around and feel your job isn't secure, your street isn't safe.",
      "This thinking has been a long time coming. \"Security\" was a word and concept used by Reeves and Sir Keir in opposition - but recently he's been making a more ideological argument than those close to him are used to hearing.",
      "As well as making the case that what happens around the world is inextricably linked to what happens at home, he holds that the old international consensus among Western leaders has failed for millions of voters.",
      "That argument was crystallised into a long memo he sent to his cabinet ministers and political team in the middle of February. In it he wrote: \"The government's challenge was to shape this new era. Not to defend institutions that are broken or old ideas that have failed, but to be the voice of working people who more than anything want security in their lives, and a country that is on the up again.\"",
      "He wrote that politicians were wrong to think markets had solutions for almost everything. \"We were cowed by the market - we came to act as if it always knew best and the state should sit it out.\"",
      "He also said governments had failed on immigration, failed to understand the public's concerns and also - to tell the truth. \"We ended up treating all immigration as an untrammelled good. Somehow, politics ended up being too scared to say what is obvious - that some people are genuine refugees and some aren't; that people coming here to work can be a positive, but that an island nation needs to control its borders.\"",
      "Some extracts from the letter have been revealed before. But what is notable, reading the whole document, is the prime minister closes his letter to colleagues with a call to provide \"security\" for the country, alongside renewing public services. He writes: \"Now is our moment to be bigger and bolder - to put pedal on metal on wholescale reform and change our politics and our country. Security and renewal are our twin tasks - we must now deliver them.\"",
      "You'll hear more of that argument from ministers in the coming days - we had a glimpse of it in the studio last Sunday morning too.",
      "The profound uncertainty Donald Trump's arrival in the White House has given the prime minister a moment to step into the spotlight on the world stage.",
      "And his government is now much more overtly weaving an argument that working to establish security round the world is fundamentally connected to sorting out security at home.",
      "There is a reason why, fresh from all the diplomatic handshakes, Sir Keir was back in the more familiar hi-vis and hard hat announcing defence jobs in Belfast.",
      "No 10 wants you to see and believe that crisis abroad can mean opportunity at home. This spasm in global security has given a prime minister sometimes accused of being a blank page a clearer story to tell.",
      "But in the end, for any prime minister, it is what happens on home turf, not foreign adventures that matter the most. A sceptical public will take a lot of convincing to believe government can improve their situation \u2013 make it easier to manage the bills, buy a house, or for their kids to find a decent job.",
      "As as a senior figure in the Labour movement concludes, \"he likes the statesman role but the bottom line is, change in people's lives will be the decider.\"",

      "Abramovich sold Chelsea in 2022, after he was sanctioned by the UK government over Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "The \u00a32.5bn raised was meant to be used for humanitarian causes linked to the Ukraine war but it remains frozen in a UK bank account.",
      "Labour ministers are coming under increasing pressure to meet Abramovich's representatives or the members of the foundation that was set up to manage the funds.",
      "The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) told the BBC its officials are in talks with Abramovich's representatives.",
      "But multiple sources said there have been no meetings between any Labour ministers and members of the foundation set up to oversee the funds since the general election last year.",
      "Sources close to the foundation said there was a deadlock and a political decision by a minister is needed to negotiate and sign off an agreement that can break the impasse.",
      "One source said: \"For three years, the government has been saying it's been working very hard to release the money. But they are not having meetings with the foundation. There has been no meeting with a minister since Labour took over, for example.\"",
      "The BBC understands the FCDO has acknowledged a request for a meeting between the foundation's board and Foreign Secretary David Lammy.",
      "Abramovich's representatives did not wish to comment, but those with knowledge of the situation acknowledged little contact or progress had been made on releasing the funds under the four prime ministers to have held power since the sale of the club.",
      "The issue has taken on new urgency after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced that part of the UK's overseas aid budget was being diverted to defence. In 2024/25, the UK is sending \u00a3282m in aid to Ukraine.",

      "Alison Griffin, of charity Save the Children, said: \"This money has been sitting gathering dust - and interest - when it could and should have been spent helping the children of Ukraine cope with the horrors of a full-scale war that has lasted over three years.\"",
      "The delay in releasing the funds centres on a disagreement between the UK government and Abramovich's lawyers.",
      "Abramovich was granted a special licence to sell Chelsea, providing he could prove he would not benefit from the sale.",
      "At the time, Abramovich said proceeds from the sale would be donated via a foundation \"for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine\", and his position has not changed.",
      "Abramovich - a Russian billionaire who made his fortune in oil and gas - cannot access the \u00a32.5bn under UK sanctions but the money still legally belongs to him.",

    "summary": "Campaigners voice concern as an investigation shows a police unit blocked requests for information.",
    "story": [
      "A national policing unit has been criticised for telling local forces to block the release of information under laws designed to safeguard the public's right to know.",
      "The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) has advised forces not to reveal information on topics including the use of banned surveillance software and the spread of super-strength drugs, the BBC has found.",
      "Campaign group Big Brother Watch said the NPCC team \u2013 known as the central referral unit (CRU) \u2013 was acting like an \"authoritarian censor\" rather than a public body.",
      "The CRU said it acted in line with legislation and only recommended how local forces should respond to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests.",
      "The BBC was alerted to the unit's involvement in local forces' FOI responses while researching the spread of potent synthetic opioids.",
      "Sixteen forces - more than a third of the UK's total number - had given us details about crimes linked with the drugs, but then retracted their responses at the unit's request.",
      "The unit argued the information would undermine national security as it could be exploited by drug traffickers.",
      "Our subsequent investigation found the CRU had advised local forces on 1,706 occasions in the first three months of 2024 - equivalent to one in every 11 requests submitted to forces in that time.",
      "On another occasion, it cited concerns about \"negative press\" when advising forces to retract earlier responses and instead neither confirm nor deny if their officers had used the facial recognition search engine PimEyes, according to documents obtained by Liberty Investigates.",
      "The software has been banned by Scotland Yard.",
      "Jake Hurfurt, the head of research and investigations at Big Brother Watch, said pressurising police forces to retract data was \"the practice of an authoritarian censor not an accountable public body\".",
      "\"It is alarming that the NPCC is going beyond giving advice to individual forces and instead seemingly orchestrating how every force responds to sensitive transparency requests,\" he said.",
      "The CRU said it was legitimately discussing \"negative press\" or \"media attention\" when researching what information was already published, but those factors did not influence whether it favoured disclosure.",
      "It also said it had had a smaller volume of work in each year since 2020.",
      "What is Freedom of Information?",
      "FOI laws came into force in the UK in January 2005 and allow anyone to apply to government or public bodies to see information, such as crime statistics or details on expenditure.",
      "Using those laws, citizens can ask for information from people in power - sometimes including details they might prefer had stayed a secret.",
      "The Freedom of Information Act presumes each request should lead to information being disclosed, unless a legal exemption applies.",
      "Our investigation revealed the CRU did not follow the so-called \"applicant-blind principle\" when responding to FOI requests.",
      "The principle states everyone should get the same level and quality of response, regardless of whether it is their first request or they use the act regularly in their work.",
      "The CRU, however, recorded whether requesters were members of the media and their organisation.",
      "It said it was not subject to the applicant-blind principle because it was only an advisor, but would stop the practice from March 2025.",
      "It also said it could not share records of when it had conducted public interest tests or if and when it had favoured the disclosure of information that was in the spirit of FOI laws.",
      "Akiko Hart, director of human rights advocacy group Liberty, said: \"It's incredibly concerning that police have continually tried to downplay, hide and rescind information that is in the public interest.",
      "\"At a time when public trust in police is at an all-time low, transparency in their actions has never been more important. The police have a statutory duty to provide information held by them when requested by the public and journalists, and must not try to circumvent this.\"",
      "In 2022, an independent review was conducted into a separate government unit that advised other departments on their FOI responses. The review found poor practice and recommended the unit's replacement.",
      "The so-called Clearing House was part of the Cabinet Office. It was alleged to have profiled journalists and treated their FOI requests inappropriately.",
      "The review rejected its approach of circulating the names of requesters who had asked the same questions of several departments \u2013 a so-called round robin requester \u2013 to help it coordinate similar responses.",
      "The government's response was to say it would pilot a new system \"immediately\", but the BBC found the NPCC's CRU still matched names to round robin requests 18 months after the Clearing House recommendations were published.",
      "Claire Miller, former data journalism editor and an expert in FOI, said further investigation was needed as the CRU did not seem to be \"operating within the spirit of the FOI Act.\"",
      "\"It does not seem to have taken on board the criticisms of and recommendations for the Clearing House, which perhaps it should have done,\" she said.",
      "The NPCC declined to give an interview but instead issued a statement.",
      "Chief Constable Rob Carden, its digital, data and technology lead, said: \"Policing is firmly committed to being open and transparent. Compliance with the Freedom of Information Act 2000 is one important way we remain accountable to the public.",
      "\"We always strive to share as much as we can in our responses with a presumption to disclose.  However, there are circumstances where information cannot be disclosed and needs to be redacted, and on occasions withheld, to ensure police can continue to use tactics to protect the public or to prevent sensitive information being exploited by criminals to cause harm.  These instances are strictly sanctioned with clear parameters, as set out in legislation.\"",
      "He said complaints about how forces applied the FOI Act could be referred to the Information Commisioner's Office (ICO).",
      "A spokeperson for the ICO said the data watchdog had used its powers \"proactively numerous times\" in the last two years to ensure police forces were compliant.",
      "They said: \"We will continue to take action when necessary, including keeping under review whether any central co-ordination in this sector is having a negative impact on compliance with the law when we examine the complaints that come to us.\"",
      "Author Martin Rosenbaum, a former FOI lead for the BBC, said the performance of police forces when it came to handling FOI requests had \"seriously deteriorated\".",
      "\"The ICO has taken enforcement action against 15 police forces because of their FOI failings, which is more than one in three forces nationally, and is the worst record of any part of the public sector,\" he said.",
      "Surrey and South Yorkshire police were among the forces issued with enforcement notices in 2024 for failing to answer requests within the 20 days set out by law.",
      "The ICO spokesperson said there was nothing to stop public bodies like the police seeking advice from a central body on how to correctly interpret the law, but it must not stop them meeting deadlines for responses or any other FOI requirements.",

      "The pastry can be produced in the town of Melton Mowbray and its surrounding region, including Nottingham to the north and Northampton to the south, but The Melton Mowbray Pork Pie Association (MMPPA) applied for this area to be reduced.",
      "However, the request was refused by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) in decision notice published on Wednesday.",
      "The pie's status is called Protected Geographical Indication (PGI).",
      "Matthew O'Callaghan, chairman of the MMPPA, said when the group originally applied for the protection - awarded in 2008 - they \"had historical evidence as to where the boundaries should go\".",
      "He said: \"In the south, the boundary was originally the road between Leicester and Stamford.\"",
      "But Defra suggested it be extended because a company in Wellingborough, which had been making the pork pies for decades, objected as it would have been outside the area, Mr O'Callaghan said.",
      "Mr O'Callaghan added: \"We agreed the area would be almost doubled so as to go down to the south to include this producer in Wellingborough.\"",
      "However, he said the producer - Saxby's - had closed and no pork pies had been made in that area for at least 10 years.",
      "Mr O'Callaghan said the association therefore thought it was reasonable to ask Defra to amend the region to the original proposal.",
      "\"It would not have affected anybody currently producing Melton Mowbray pork pies,\" he added.",
      "He said the association was \"disappointed\" the application was rejected \"because we think what people want when they buy a Melton Mowbray pork pie is a pie tied to a historic area\".",
      "Explaining the area they wanted the protection reduced to, he said it was between \"the Leicester to Stamford road - the A47 [to the south], the Great North Road the A1 [to the east], the River Trent in the north, including Nottingham, and then to the west, the River Soar\".",
      "Defra's notice rejecting the application said: \"The proposed amendment would reduce the geographical production area and exclude certain producers from using the PGI designation.",
      "\"This would directly affect market access and impose new trade restrictions, which is not permitted under the regulation.\"",
      "It added: \"The applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to show that the quality, reputation, or characteristics of the product are now exclusive to the proposed smaller area.\"",
      "The association has been advised if it opts to appeal against the decision, the deadline is 2 April.",

      "\"But Trump has clarified the debate,\" Mr Laroche says. \"It's not that the Americans are talking of removing their nuclear deterrent \u2013 let's be clear, that does not seem to be on the table right now.\"",
      "\"But the credibility of US nuclear dissuasion is not what it was. That has opened the debate, and led the Germans to look more favourably on the idea of coming under a French and/or British umbrella.\"",
      "Last month the likely next German chancellor Friedrich Merz surprised the country's partners by saying it might be the moment for discussion with Paris and London on the subject.",
      "How a French or Franco-British European nuclear deterrent might operate is still far from clear.",
      "According to Mr Haroche, one option might be to position French nuclear-armed planes in other countries, such as Germany or Poland. The decision to press the trigger would still rest entirely with the French president, but their presence would send a strong signal.",
      "Alternatively, French bombers could patrol European borders, in the same way they regularly do French borders today. Or airfields could be developed in other countries to which French bombers could quickly deploy in an emergency.",
      "Numbers are an issue. Are 300 French warheads enough against Russia's thousands? Maybe not \u2013 but in an alliance with the UK 300 become 550. Also (to repeat the point) the American nuclear deterrent is still in theory in place. There are US nuclear bombs in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.",
      "Another question is whether to reformulate the French nuclear doctrine so as to state unambiguously that \"vital interests\" cover European allies too.",
      "Some say there is no need, because the strategic vagueness that exists already is part of the very deterrent.",
      "But Mr Haroche says there is a political dimension to stating more clearly that France will use its arsenal to defend other European countries.",
      "\"If the US is to be less present, then European countries will be depending much more on each other. Our strategic world becomes more horizontal,\" he says.",
      "\"In this new world it is important to build trust and confidence among ourselves. For France to signal it is prepared to take on risk in support of others \u2013 that helps create a solid front.\"",

    "summary": "The Chancellor has earmarked \"several billion pounds\" in draft spending cuts to welfare.",
    "story": [
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has earmarked \"several billion pounds\" in draft spending cuts to welfare ahead of her Spring Statement, according to the BBC.",
      "When asked about the welfare budget, the Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood said: \"Our current situation is unsustainable\u2026 we've seen a huge rise in that welfare budget.\"",
      "BBC Verify has examined this budget and where the cuts might fall.",
      "How big is the welfare budget?",
      "Before looking at where the welfare budget might be cut, it is necessary to understand the size of the budget and how it has grown.",
      "At the time of the October 2024 Budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that total spending on health and disability benefits would rise from \u00a364.7bn in 2023-24 to \u00a3100.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "And the OBR projected that the biggest contributor to this increase would be from welfare spending on working-age adults, defined as those aged between 16 and 64.",
      "The OBR projected spending on this sector would rise from \u00a348.5bn in 2023-24 to \u00a375.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "Why is the welfare bill growing?",
      "The OBR cited rising numbers of people coming on to incapacity and disability benefits as driving its latest forecasts.",
      "The forecaster is essentially assuming the trend of rising benefits claims in recent years will continue.",
      "In the five years after 2009-2010, more people were coming off incapacity benefits than on.",
      "But in recent years - and especially since the 2020-21 Covid pandemic - more people have been coming on to benefits than off them.",
      "And the OBR forecast the share of the working-age population in receipt of an incapacity benefit would rise from 7% in 2024 to a record high of 7.9% in 2029.",
      "The reasons for this are not totally clear.",
      "Some experts point to the damaging and lasting impact of the pandemic on physical health.",
      "Others reference the rise in mental ill health, especially among younger people.",
      "The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has reported that the number of people aged 18 to 24 who are not in education, employment or training (Neet) rose to 907,000 at the end of last year, a 30% increase on the level before the pandemic in 2020 (although the ONS also cautioned the survey used to collect the data was potentially unreliable).",
      "Other experts place the emphasis on financial incentives in the welfare system - where people can get higher payments for being on sickness benefits than from being unemployed or in low-paid, part-time work.",
      "The standard allowance for a single person on Universal Credit is \u00a3311.68 per month. If someone is deemed to have \"limited capacity for work-related activity\", the criteria to receive incapacity benefits, they are eligible for an extra \u00a3416.19 per month on top.",
      "But there is no consensus on what's causing the trend.",
      "\"It is not yet known what factors are driving this increase,\" says Eduin Latimer of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.",
      "\"Figuring out what is behind the recent rise must surely be a top priority for the government if it is going to be able to respond appropriately.\"",
      "Which elements of the welfare bill might be cut?",
      "Ministers have not said where they will seek cuts, but the largest element of the working-age welfare bill is incapacity or long-term sickness benefits - paid via Universal Credit or the legacy system of Employment and Support Allowance.",
      "If the government wants to make significant savings from the working-age welfare bill it will probably need to find some savings here.",
      "But the second largest single element of the working-age welfare bill is Personal Independence Payments (PIP) - a benefit for people under state pension age who need help with daily activities because of a long-term illness or disability. PIP claimants can be in work.",
      "In 2023-24, PIP totalled \u00a318bn and that's projected to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30. That would mean the number of claimants rising from 2.7 million to 4.2 million.",
      "As with the rise in the overall welfare bill, there's no consensus among experts on what's driving rising PIP claims, but this is also somewhere the government might well look to make some savings.",
      "The previous Conservative government had explored making it harder for younger people with mental health conditions to claim PIP.",
      "Can significant savings be made?",
      "Many experts, such as the Resolution Foundation think tank and the Institute for Employment Studies, agree that more working-age people should be helped and encouraged into work, and that there is a case for reform of the working-age welfare system.",
      "But some argue that making sustainable, long-term savings requires upfront government investment in employment support programmes - schemes which aim to help people overcome barriers to getting into work.",
      "Analysts also warn that reducing spending on the welfare bill has been historically difficult.",
      "At the 2015 general election, the Conservative manifesto promised to cut \u00a312bn from the annual welfare budget.",
      "While some significant savings were initially found, ministers were forced to change policy after a political backlash over some of the cuts.",
      "The OBR later concluded \u00a34bn of the \u00a312bn a year promised cuts had not been achieved.",

      "From speeches watched by millions to a position as her party's deputy leader at Westminster, Mhairi Black appeared to be one of politics rising stars.",
      "However, away from the House of Commons the SNP MP was \"flailing through life\" and became ill through depression and anxiety, she has told the BBC.",
      "Black believes it was only through a \"life-changing\" diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that she was able to regain control of her life.",
      "The former Paisley and Renfrewshire South representative also said her party's performance at last year's general election, where the party dropped from 48 MPs to eight, was due to \"self-inflected\" woes.",
      "Black stood down as an elected politician in 2024 after nine years, having first won her seat aged just 20.",
      "She said her decision came after years in a \"toxic\" and \"bullying\" environment that was \"consuming my entire life\", with her mental health suffering badly until she was diagnosed with ADHD around 2018.",
      "\"Everything was fried - my body, my mind was emotionally fried,\" she told the BBC's Scotcast podcast.",
      "The interview comes ahead of the release of a new BBC documentary, Mhairi Black: Being Me Again.",
      "She said: \"I couldn't go out without throwing up. I would have panic attacks everywhere I went.",
      "\"I didn't understand what was going on and why I was feeling like this, I'm just beating myself up more, because I'm thinking, well, everybody else is managing to get into work okay. Why are you the one that can't cope with it?\"",
      "The documentary - which will air on BBC Scotland at 21:00 on Sunday and is available on iPlayer from Friday -  shows her discussing the condition and her last year at Westminster.",
      "She describes how anxiety became depression, and saw her take time off from Westminster duties - a decision that brought criticism for her attendance record at parliament and holding a lack of surgeries in her constituency.",
      "\"Westminster didn't have a capacity for signing off, so it looked to the rest of the world like I've no been turning up, when in actual fact I was in the foetal position in my house,\" she says.",
      "For Black, the diagnosis of ADHD has had a \"life-changing\" impact on her life.",
      "She told Scotcast: \"It was massive because it felt as though someone had just handed me the instruction manual for my own brain, and suddenly I was able to think like, I'm not mad, I'm just wired differently.",
      "\"It allowed me to stop beating myself up so much because there were times when I would struggle to do things that other folk do effortlessly.\"",
      "Black compares the condition to the BBC's Sherlock series, where Benedict Cumberbatch's famous detective would use his \"mind palace\" to work out cases.",
      "\"It feels like there's constantly three conversations in my head \u2013 and a song,\" she laughs.",
      "However, Black told Scotcast she decided not to go public with her diagnosis at the time as it \"would get used against me\" in Westminster - an aggressive culture that her wife Katie was surprised by.",
      "She recalls: \"When she [Mhairi] started telling me about her experiences since being in parliament, I almost couldn't believe what I was hearing.",
      "\"It was very different to what I'd believed. I was surprised how isolated she was.\"",
      "Black recounts seeing punch-ups and bullying during her time as an MP, and although she raised concerns with her party, the support offered was not enough.",
      "She said: \"I think leadership at all levels have been aware of people who've been unhappy with how they've been treated, and I imagine most people would agree that we could be better at how we handle it.\"",
      "Elected as the SNP dominated the Scottish vote, her departure from Westminster came on a night when, in her own words, \"the SNP got an absolute doing\".",
      "Black felt the SNP's poor result happened due to \"in-fighting that was spilling out into the public domain\".",
      "She added that this was not helped by power being centred around leader Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell who was the party's chief executive.",
      "She said: \"The reason that I think it spilled out into the public was because a lot of people had hit their limit because they felt like their voices weren't being listened to within the party.",
      "\"There were a lot of folk who weren't comfortable with the idea of the chief executive and the leader of the party basically being a couple in one house.\"",
      "Black added she believed the SNP worked best when on the left politically, and that if the views of current deputy Kate Forbes became party policy there would be a \"mass exodus\" of members.",
      "Forbes is known for her conservative views on issues such as gay marriage, abortion and trans rights.",
      "Black was a headline act from her first days in Parliament, when her initial Commons speech saw her decry poverty and was viewed 10 million times within days.",
      "It came after a whirlwind time when she overturned Douglas Alexander's majority in 2015, as part of an SNP surge that saw the party take nearly every constituency in Scotland.",
      "Black had been energised by the independence referendum in 2014, which she calls a \"magical\" time.",
      "Defeat in the independence vote \"felt like a death\" she says, but within months she was standing for election - a time that saw social media posts she made as a teenager resurface, including declarations of love for Smirnoff Ice and views on football.",
      "\"The way it was twisted to make her out be a drunken, bigoted wee lout was one of the worst times of my life,\" recalls her father.",
      "It did not hurt her at the polls though,  and she carried that bluntness into her Westminster career.",
      "'I get death threats all the time'",
      "However, a vulnerability was underneath the surface - at one point the documentary shows a stuffed panda bear given to her by her mum to keep her company in London.",
      "In 2018 she spoke at length about the abuse she had suffered online, repeating some of the many foul-mouthed  slurs sent to her about her appearance and sexuality, including that you \"can't put lipstick on a pig\" and that she was \"too ugly to be raped\".",
      "\"It's difficult to describe how you can feel so alone and unsafe and under attack with nothing more than your phone sitting there,\" she reflects.",
      "\"I get death threats all the time but there was one in particular where the police came to my flat down in London and the house up in Scotland.",
      "\"It was like two in the morning and the phrase used was a 'an imminent death threat'.",

      "\"People deserve a representative that wants to be there and I don't think that's me anymore.  I've done my bit,\" she says.",

    "summary": "The briefing that Rachel Reeves will make large spending cuts this month is very significant.",
    "story": [
      "The government briefing that Rachel Reeves will make large spending cuts this month is very significant, in several different ways.",
      "First, it confirms what had been rumoured - that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent forecaster, believes that the chancellor's 'headroom' has been eliminated.",
      "This is the \u00a310bn worth of leeway which, as of last October, the OBR believed the government had before breaking its self-imposed borrowing rules.",
      "Why has that headroom disappeared? The government's clear view is that this is because of global factors  - tariffs being imposed by President Trump, broader uncertainty emanating from the new US administration, persistent inflation in the UK and elsewhere, and the rising cost of government borrowing.",
      "But there will be a big political argument about this.",
      "The Conservatives will contend that the cost of government borrowing was rising even before President Trump took office and that the tax rises in Reeves's Budget in October were a major factor, as well as in stunting growth.",
      "Chancellor set to cut welfare spending by billions",
      "Labour ministers tread carefully as welfare reform looms",
      "What is the OBR and why does it matter?",
      "Relatedly, it is worth stressing that this month was not meant to be a big economic moment for the government.",
      "Over recent years, a fiscal rhythm has developed where there is one Budget a year and then a second (spring or autumn) statement which also contains significant tax and spend measures and is akin to a mini-budget.",
      "Reeves wanted to end that, with an autumn Budget and then a much more limited event in spring at which the OBR published updated forecasts but the government did not respond with major economic measures.",
      "Government sources say that this will not be a fiscal event because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "Yet the Charter for Budget Responsibility, recently updated by the Labour government, said that it was committed to one major fiscal event a year in order to \"give families and business more certainty\" not only about tax but \"spending changes\" too.",
      "The government did reserve the right to change that approach \"in the case of an economic shock\".",
      "Does that mean the government believes the effect of President Trump has been an economic shock?",
      "There are clear political sensitivities in where the cuts are likely to fall. The Labour Party has many factions and ideological nuances but all of its MPs are committed to a generous welfare state and many will be antsy at the prospect of welfare cuts.",
      "Those in government are adamant, though, that the numbers - which are rising fast - of claimants and the amount being spent by government are simply unsustainable.",
      "There will be reform as well as cuts  - Reeves has identified what she sees as \"perverse incentives\" in the system.",
      "In a preview of the potential rows to come, one Labour MP, speaking on the condition of anonymity, was critical, saying: \"There is always money for war, yet none left for the most vulnerable to lift them out of hardship.\"",
      "\"Austerity is a choice. Poverty is a political choice,\" they added.",
      "However others, including from the left of the party, said they recognised the welfare system was \"old fashioned\" and needed reform.",
      "\"We have people who can work but don't just automatically because the system is inflexible,\" one said.",
      "Notably the next target for cuts appears to be the civil service.",
      "Privately ministers and officials have been dismayed by the quality of the Whitehall machine.",
      "The government is expected to demand major reductions in the numbers of civil servants, though this is unlikely to take the form of a specific numerical target.",
      "Ministers are also understood to have discussed major changes to the machinery of government, namely how government departments are organised, though this work is considered unlikely to come to fruition this month."

    "summary": "The prime minister will soon need evidence to show he can be a bridge between Trump and Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's decision to pause military aid to Ukraine may well prove to be one of the most significant moments in the conflict since Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion.",
      "As far as the UK is concerned, it will not change Sir Keir Starmer's approach, but makes the issues he has been focusing on for the past few days more acute and more urgent.",
      "The prime minister still views his core tasks as finding a way to bring presidents Trump and Zelensky back together, and drawing up the foundations of a workable peace deal that can be presented to the US.",
      "As we saw in the House of Commons on Monday, where MPs from different parties lined up to laud the prime minister for his sure-footed diplomacy, it is a strategy with broad support across the political spectrum.",
      "But how deep is that support? We may be about to find out.",
      "UK won't be derailed by Ukraine aid freeze - Rayner",
      "Ukraine's shock over US military aid pause",
      "It is one thing for the prime minister to vow to do all he can to bring presidents Trump and Zelensky back together.",
      "But to be a bridge between both countries, Sir Keir will in time need evidence that he has influence on both sides of that bridge.",
      "Towards the end of his statement in the Commons, the prime minister was asked about US media reports that Trump was considering withdrawing military aid.",
      "He replied that this was not his understanding of the US position. Evidently, this shortly turned out to be wrong.",
      "We now know that at some point later on Monday, Starmer and Trump spoke on the phone - their third phone call in four days.",
      "But we do not know whether Trump gave Starmer prior warning of his decision on military aid or not.",
      "It may be that Starmer tried to persuade Trump not to go ahead and failed. Or it may be that Trump did not tell Starmer what he was about to do.",
      "Neither of those scenarios would be especially positive for the prime minister.",
      "Vance comments row",
      "As it is, it seems Downing Street is still waiting on full details of the US administration's decision and how it will work.",
      "And it is worth stressing that this is a temporary pause in aid, not a permanent cessation. It may simply be another attempt by Trump to pressure Zelensky. The aid may resume.",
      "Or, this may be the clearest example that  - despite the unquestionable warmth Starmer has managed to foster with the US president - the fundamental frames through which they view this conflict and the western alliance more generally are irreconcilably different.",
      "Into this increasingly fraught transatlantic environment has come JD Vance, the US vice-president, scoffing at the idea Ukraine could be protected by \"20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\".",
      "So far only the UK and France have publicly committed troops towards policing any potential peace deal in Ukraine, and his comments were interpreted by many as having been a jibe at both countries.",
      "Vance has now insisted he was talking about other, unnamed countries - confining the diplomatic fallout for the time being.",
      "Yet even if Vance was referring to other countries which might be willing to take on some of the military burden of protecting Ukraine, it is hardly encouraging for the UK in its convening role in Europe if the response of the US vice-president is to mock their capabilities.",
      "Perhaps that is merely a more blunt-speaking approach from a new US administration determined to do away with niceties.",
      "After all, most European countries are now admitting themselves that their defence spending has been far too low for far too long.",
      "But all the signs suggest that before long, questions about Sir Keir Starmer's approach to Ukraine may give way to much more fundamental questions about Britain's place in a profoundly changed world."

      "Meat, dairy and sugar grown in a lab could be on sale in the UK for human consumption for the first time within two years, sooner than expected.",
      "The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is looking at how it can speed up the approval process for lab-grown foods.",
      "Such products are grown from cells in small chemical plants.",
      "UK firms have led the way in the field scientifically but feel they have been held back by the current regulations.",
      "Dog food made from meat that was grown in factory vats went on sale in the UK for the first time last month.",
      "In 2020, Singapore became the first country to authorise the sale of cell-cultivated meat for human consumption, followed by the United States three years later and Israel last year.",
      "However, Italy and the US states of Alabama and Florida have instituted bans.",
      "The FSA is to develop new regulations by working with experts from high-tech food firms and academic researchers.",
      "It says it aims to complete the full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the two-year process it is starting.",
      "But critics say that having the firms involved in drawing up the new rules represents a conflict of interest.",
      "The initiative is in response to concerns by UK firms that they are losing ground to competition overseas, where approvals processes take half the time.",
      "Prof Robin May, the FSA's chief scientist, told BBC News that there would be no compromise on consumer safety.",
      "\"We are working very closely with the companies involved and academic groups to work together to design a regulatory structure that is good for them, but at all costs ensures the safety of these products remains as high as it possibly can,\" he said.",
      "But critics such as Pat Thomas, director of the campaign group Beyond GM, are not convinced by this approach.",
      "\"The companies involved in helping the FSA to draw up these regulations are the ones most likely to benefit from deregulation and if this were any other type of food product, we would be outraged by it,\" she said.",
      "The science minister, Lord Vallance, took issue with the process being described as \"deregulation\".",
      "\"It is not deregulation, it is pro-innovation regulation,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"It is an important distinction, because we are trying to get the regulation aligned with the needs of innovation and reduce some of the bureaucracy and duplication.\"",
      "Lab-grown foods are grown into plant or animal tissue from tiny cells. This can sometimes involve gene editing to tweak the food's properties. The claimed benefits are that they are better for the environment and potentially healthier.",
      "The government is keen for lab-grown food firms to thrive because it hopes they can create new jobs and economic growth.",
      "The UK is good at the science, but the current approvals process is much slower than in other countries. Singapore, the US and Israel in particular have faster procedures.",
      "Ivy Farm Technologies in Oxford is ready to go with lab-grown steaks, made from cells taken from Wagyu and Aberdeen Angus cows.",
      "The firm applied for approval to sell its steaks to restaurants at the beginning of last year. Ivy Farm's CEO, Dr Harsh Amin, explained that two years was a very long time to wait.",
      "\"If we can shorten that to less than a year, while maintaining the very highest of Britain's food safety standards, that would help start-up companies like ours to thrive.\"",
      "Dr Alicia Graham has a similar story. Working at Imperial College's Bezos centre in west London, she has found a way to grow an alternative to sugar. It involves introducing a gene found in a berry into yeast. This process enables her to produce large amounts of the crystals that make it taste sweet.",
      "It doesn't make you fat, she says, and so is a potential sweetener and healthy substitute in fizzy drinks.",
      "In this case I am allowed to taste it. It was incredibly sweet and slightly sour and fruity, reminding me of lemon sherbet. But Dr Graham's firm, MadeSweetly, is not allowed to sell it until it gets approval.",
      "\"The path to getting approval is not straightforward,\" she tells me.",
      "\"They are all new technologies, which are not easy for the regulator to keep up with. But that means that we don't have one specific route to product approval, and that is what we would like.\"",
      "The FSA says it will complete a full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the next two years and have the beginnings of a faster and better system for applications for approvals of new lab-grown foods.",
      "Prof May of the FSA says the purpose of working with experts from the companies involved as well as academics is to get the science right.",
      "\"It can be quite complex, and it is critical that we understand the science to make sure the foods are safe before authorising them.\"",
      "But Ms Thomas says that these high-tech foods may not be as environmentally friendly as they are made out to be as it takes energy to make them and that in some cases their health benefits are being oversold.",
      "\"Lab-grown foods are ultimately ultra-processed foods and we are in an era where we are trying to get people to eat fewer ultra-processed foods because they have health implications,\" he said.",

      "It is considered a difficult and risky area to land in.",

      "Researchers found that changes in a particular gene, one of the building blocks of biological code that produces the blueprint for how our bodies work, alters the chemical signals that tell our brains we've had enough to eat.",
      "The scientists say their findings, published in the journal Science, reveal something \"powerful\" about the biology of obesity risk.",
      "\"By studying dogs, we've honed in on some interesting new biology here,\" explained lead researcher Dr Eleanor Raffan from the University of Cambridge's department of physiology, development and neuroscience.",
      "She added that the discovery showed that \"owners of slim dogs are not morally superior - and the same is true of slim people\".",
      "\"If you have a high genetic risk of obesity, you're prone to gaining weight unless you put a huge effort into not doing so. And those with low genetic risk just don't have to work so hard.\"",
      "This canine-human biological link came from the researchers' examination of the genetics of 250 labradors. The team looked for pieces of genetic code that were common in overweight dogs.",
      "They picked out one gene in particular - called DENND1B - that was associated with a higher body mass in the labradors. And when they searched through a library of genetic information from thousands of humans, they discovered that the same gene was associated with a higher body mass in people, too.",

      "But the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.",
      "A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy.",
      "\"That's why we have almost doubled the budget for the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to \u00a3295 million for the next financial year, and just launched a new campaign to help make more families aware of our offer of a \u00a37,500 heat pump grant.\"",
      "What is a heat pump and how much do they cost?",
      "Half of homes need heat pump by 2040, government told",
      "Most UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases.",
      "With home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges.",
      "Heat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.",
      "About half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support.",
      "One of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.",
      "Ed Matthew, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.",
      "\"It has been absolutely critical for making it affordable for households to buy this technology,\" he said.",
      "In its first year, the scheme only spent a third of the funding allocated due to low public interest. But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget.",
      "Mr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review it recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive.",
      "\"They do not want to take their foot off the brake here. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said.",
      "He also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.",
      "Despite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028.",
      "But Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year.",
      "\"The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,\" she said.",
      "Madeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation.",
      "\"The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,\" she said.",
      "This explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.",
      "Ms Gabriel and Mr Matthew agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity.",
      "In a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills.",
      "\"Once the consumer can save money [with heat pumps], I think it really changes the level of interest. We're moving from early adopters that think it's the right thing to do to, actually, this is just a sensible financial investment choice,\" Ms Lee said.",

      "A new part of the immune system has been discovered and it is a goldmine of potential antibiotics, scientists have said.",
      "They've shown a part of the body known to recycle proteins has a secret mode that can spew out an arsenal of bacteria-killing chemicals.",
      "The researchers in Israel say it transforms our understanding of how we are protected against infection.",
      "And gives a new place to look for antibiotics to tackle the growing problem of superbugs that resist our current drugs.",
      "The discovery centres on the proteasome \u2013 a tiny structure that is found in every cell of the body.",
      "Its main role is to chop up old proteins into smaller chunks so they can be recycled to make new ones.",
      "But a series of experiments, detailed in the journal Nature, shows the proteasome detects when a cell has been infected by bacteria.",
      "It then changes structure and role. It starts transforming old proteins into weapons that can rip open the outer layer of bacteria to kill them.",
      "Prof Yifat Merbl, from the Weizmann Institute of Science, told me: \"This is really exciting, because we never knew that this was happening.",
      "\"We discovered a novel mechanism of immunity that is allowing us to have a defence against bacterial infection.",
      "\"It's happening throughout our body in all the cells, and generates a whole new class of potential natural antibiotics.\"",
      "The research team went through a process they called \"dumpster diving\" to find these natural antibiotics.",
      "They were tested on bacteria growing in the laboratory and on mice with pneumonia and sepsis. The researchers said they were getting results comparable to some established antibiotics.",
      "And when the researchers took cells in the laboratory and disabled the proteasome they were far easier to infect with bacteria like Salmonella.",
      "Prof Daniel Davis, the head of life sciences and an immunologist at Imperial College London, said the findings were \"extremely provocative and very interesting\" as they changed our understanding of how our body fights infection.",
      "\"What's really exciting about this, is it's a totally undiscovered process by which anti-germ molecules are made inside our cells, it feels profoundly important and surprising.\"",
      "But he cautioned that turning this into a new source of antibiotics is an idea that \"still needs to be tested\" and that will take time.",
      "More than a million people a year are estimated to die from infections that are resistant to drugs like antibiotics.",
      "Drug-resistant infections killing millions - study",
      "But despite the need, there has been a lack of research into developing new antibiotics to keep up with demand.",
      "Against that bleak background, having somewhere new to look is a source of optimism for some scientists.",
      "Dr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at King's College London, told the BBC: \"It's a potential goldmine for new antibiotics, that's quite exciting.",
      "\"In previous years it's been digging up soil [to find new antibiotics], it is wild that it's something we have within us, but comes down to having the technology to be able to detect these things.\"",
      "She also says there could be fewer issues with developing them into drugs because they are already products of the human body so the \"safety side of it might be a lot easier\"."

      "The software engineer who discovered the flaw believes the problem had existed for at least six years.",
      "Medefer says there is no evidence the flaw had been in place that long and stressed that patient data has not been compromised.",
      "The flaw was fixed a few days after being discovered.",
      "In late February the company commissioned an external security agency to undertake a review of its data management systems.",
      "An NHS spokesperson said: \"We are looking into the concerns raised about Medefer and will take further action if appropriate.\"",
      "Medefer's system allows patients to book virtual appointments with doctors, and gives those clinicians access to the appropriate patient data.",

      "The software engineer, who does not want to be named, was shocked by what he uncovered.",
      "\"When I found it, I just thought 'no, it can't be'.\"",
      "The problem was in bits of software called APIs (application programming interfaces), which allow different computer systems to talk to each other.",
      "The engineer says that at Medefer those APIs were not properly secured, and could potentially have been accessed by outsiders, who would have been able to see patient information.",
      "He said it was unlikely that patient information was taken from Medefer, but that without a full investigation, the company could not have known for sure.",
      "\"I've worked in organisations where, if something like this happened, the whole system would be taken down immediately,\" he said.",
      "On discovering the flaw the engineer told the company that an external cybersecurity expert should be bought in to investigate the problem, which he says the company did not do.",
      "Medefer says the external security agency has confirmed that it has found no evidence of any breach of data and that all the company's data systems were currently secure.",
      "It says the process of investigating and fixing the API flaw was \"extremely open\".",
      "Medefer said it had reported the issue to the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office)  and the CQC (Care Quality Commission), \"in the interests of transparency\", and that the ICO had confirmed there is no further action to be taken as there is no evidence of a breach.",
      "The engineer, who had been contracted in October to test for flaws in the company's software, left the company in January.",
      "In a statement Dr Bahman Nedjat-Shokouhi, founder and CEO of Medefer, said: \"There is no evidence of any patient data breach from our systems.\"",
      "He confirmed that the flaw had been discovered in November and a fix was developed in 48 hours.",
      "\"The external security agency has asserted that the allegation that this flaw could have provided access to large amounts of patients' data is categorically false.\"",
      "The security agency will complete its review later this week.",
      "Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi added: \"We take our duties to patients and the NHS very seriously. We hold regular external security audits of our systems by independent external security agencies, undertaken on multiple occasions every year.\"",
      "Cybersecurity experts, who have looked at information supplied by the software engineer, have expressed their concern.",
      "\"There is the possibility that Medefer stored data derived from the NHS not as securely as one would hope it would be,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey.",
      "\"The database might be encrypted and all the other precautions taken, but if there is a way of glitching the API authorisation, anyone who knows how could potentially gain access,\" he added.",
      "Another expert pointed out that as Medefer deals with highly-sensitive, medical data, the company should have bought in cybersecurity experts as soon as the problem was identified.",
      "\"Even if the company suspected that no data was stolen, when facing an issue that could have resulted in a data breach, especially with data of the nature in question, an investigation and confirmation from a suitably qualified cybersecurity expert would be advisable,\" says Scott Helme, a security researcher.",
      "Medefer was founded in 2013 by Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi, with a goal to improve outpatient care. Since then its technology has been used by NHS trusts across the country.",
      "In a statement the NHS spokesperson said those trusts are responsible for their contracts with the private sector.",

    "summary": "Despite opposition investors are still looking at deep-sea mining technology.",
    "story": [
      "There's one. And another. This robot was hunting for rocks. A three-pronged claw descended from above and plucked a stone off the seabed.",
      "All the while, the autonomous machine's on-board camera scanned for creatures that might be resting on those rocks, to avoid snatching an innocent lifeform from its habitat.",
      "The test, carried out in a harbour in November, demonstrated one approach to mining for polymetallic nodules, potato-sized lumps containing metals scattered on the seabed in vast quantities, in much deeper parts of the ocean.",
      "Such metals are sought-after for use in renewable energy devices and batteries, for example. But deep-sea mining is a controversial means of obtaining them because of its potentially significant environmental impacts.",
      "\"We felt that a vehicle that used AI to look for life and avoid it could have much less of an environmental footprint,\" explains Oliver Gunasekara, co-founder and chief executive of Impossible Metals.",
      "The firm's system is 95% accurate at detecting lifeforms of 1mm or greater in size, he says.",
      "The robot's arms are similar to those that pick and place items in automated warehouses \u2013 they are optimised for speed. Plus, each claw kicks up a relatively small puff of sediment as it plucks its target off the seafloor. Impossible Metals aims to further reduce this disturbance.",
      "Such a system is not likely to convince everyone that deep-sea mining is a good idea, however.",
      "\"Mining would by its nature remove the very substrate of life in and on the deep seafloor, no matter the technology,\" says Jessica Battle, who leads the global no deep-seabed mining initiative at the WWF.",
      "Deep-sea mining is highly controversial partly because the deep seabed is more or less untouched and still relatively poorly understood. \"If you're not sure what's down there, then leave it alone,\" says John Childs at Lancaster University. \"That's been the widespread position from science [to date].\"",
      "Scars left by mining experiments in the past, using highly disruptive technologies, have been severe.",
      "In 1979, deep-sea mining equipment made large tracks in one part of the Pacific Ocean seabed and these remain there today, researchers say. Wildlife has reportedly still not fully returned to the area 40 years later.",
      "Opposition to deep-sea mining has been fierce enough to scupper entire companies.",
      "Nautilus Minerals sought to begin deep-sea mining work in the late 2010s. After protests and financial upsets, the company went bankrupt in 2019.",
      "Minerals found on the deep seabed including manganese, nickel, cobalt, gold and silver are all considered important materials for the green energy transition.",
      "Currently, such metals are sourced from mines on land, which themselves have a significant environmental impact.",
      "No commercial deep sea mining operations are underway today, though that could change this year if the first set of international regulations governing these activities is published, possibly in July.",
      "Mr Gunasekara's firm is currently building a larger version of its robot in a 20-foot shipping container, big enough to carry out commercial-scale operations. It will have 12 robot arms with grabbing claws.",
      "He adds that \"hundreds\" of such bots would need to harvest the seabed at a time, bringing the spoils to a ship on the surface. The recovered nodules would then be transported to processing sites on land.",
      "Unlike some other methods, in which heavy subsea equipment is tethered to support ships, Impossible Metals' vessel would not have to remain in a precise spot for a long period, meaning its engines would not create as much noise. This would lessen the impact on wildlife, claims Mr Gunasekara.",
      "He also argues that deep-sea mining would reduce the need for mining on land: \"Anyone that doesn't want to do deep-sea mining is implicitly saying we need to do more land-based mining.\"",
      "Jovana Jovanova at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands is working on a different robot arm system that could gather metals from the seafloor. She stresses that those working in this field should seek to develop technology \"in sync\" with the environment.",
      "Some deep-sea materials might be removed using more invasive methods, however. Seabed Solutions, a Norwegian firm, is working on a saw-based device to extract mineral-containing crusts or layers. The company says it is trying to reduce the volume of sediment disturbed by this process.",
      "\"You shield the cutting area and you ensure that it is under pressure,\" says managing director B\u00e5rd Brekke J\u00f8rgensen. \"You have a suction head interface [on] your cutting tool.\"",
      "The Metals Company, a firm launched by former Nautilus Minerals investor Gerard Barron, is working on a different technique.",
      "Mr Barron, chief executive, is bullish about the company's prospects, despite the protests and lawsuits his firm has faced.  Among the problems is a class action lawsuit filed by investors over the company's reporting of proceeds from a partner company in 2023 -  Mr Barron says \"there's absolutely nothing in it\".",
      "Those calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining are \"virtue signalling\" he says, adding that the new Trump administration in the US may help his company.",
      "\"We have many of our best supporters assuming very important roles in the new administration,\" says Mr Barron.",
      "The Metals Company intends to file an application for deep-sea mining in the Pacific Ocean with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) later this year. The ISA is yet to confirm how it would regulate such activities.",
      "Dutch company Allseas, which is working with Mr Barron's firm, has developed mining machinery for scooping polymetallic nodules off the seabed and sending them to a support ship on the surface.",
      "The Metals Company's own tests suggest that the debris plumes created by this process would spread for hundreds of metres from the mining area, rather than many kilometres, and that deposited sediment gradually clears over time.",
      "Claims that sediment would be distributed many kilometres from the mining area were \"total nonsense\", says Mr Barron.",
      "Jeroen Hagelstein, a spokesman for Allseas, says his firm has adjusted the force of waterjets used to dislodge nodules in an attempt to minimise sediment disturbance.",
      "Some sediment brought to the surface with the nodules gets dumped back into the ocean.  Mr Hagelstein says his colleagues are considering whether to return it at a depth of three or four kilometres rather than discarding it at the surface, though he adds that this may require too much energy to adequately reduce the overall environmental impact.",
      "Mr Barron acknowledges that his firm's machinery might affect lifeforms living on or around the nodules. \"If you're a sponge sitting on a nodule and we come and collect you, there will be an impact,\" he says. Though he points out that many nodules would also be left behind.",
      "Ann Vanreusel at Ghent University has studied deep-sea wildlife. She says the sought-after polymetallic nodules are themselves home to some creatures, which use them as a substrate. So even if mining machinery created zero sediment disturbance, pollution and noise, removing nodules would still impact the ecosystem.",
      "Dr Childs also mentions the importance of the deep sea to many indigenous cultures. Mining could interfere with this, he suggests.",
      "And there's another issue. The market for metals metals sought by deep-sea mining firms is notoriously volatile, meaning the business case for deep-sea mining may not be as strong as some hope, says Lea Reitmeier at the London School of Economics.",

      "When BBC News contacted the CMA for a response to these comments, they pointed us to Mr Bamford's LinkedIn post, where he said: \"We are not blind to the length of time that this investigation has taken... We know pace matters to business confidence and investment.\"",
      "He added the reason this investigation took so long was because the relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI had been changing over that time.",
      "In 2024, while Mr Bokkerink was chair, the CMA also issued similar \"found not to qualify\" decisions on other AI partnerships it reviewed involving firms including Microsoft, Amazon and Google.",
      "In April of same year, the CMA's chief executive Sarah Cardell said the body had \"real concerns\" about an \"interconnected web\" of AI partnerships between big tech firms.",

      "The governing Liberals have seen a remarkable political turnaround since Trudeau's exit, as Canadians have been galvanised by Donald Trump's trade threats and support for annexing their country",
      "At the beginning of the year, they trailed the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, by more than 20 points in election polls.",
      "They have since narrowed the gap and some polls show them statistically tied with Poilievre's party.",

      "\"We're getting over the shock, but let us never forget the lessons: we have to look after ourselves and we have to look out for each other. We need to pull together in the tough days ahead.\"",
      "Carney also pledged to \"secure our borders\" - a key demand of Trump who has accused Canada of failing to control the flow of migrants and fentanyl going south.",

      "\"Pierre Poilievre's plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,\" said Carney.",

      "Shortly before Carney took to the stage, Trudeau gave an emotional farewell speech, reflecting on his 12 years as Liberal leader.",
      "He warned that Canada was facing an \"existential challenge\" from the US under Trump.",
      "The Conservatives have had to pivot politically since Trudeau's resignation, and are attacking Carney as not representing change but rather being \"just like Justin\".",
      "They accuse the Liberals of a \"sneaky\" plan to win a fourth term by simply substituting their leader.",

      "Mr Fares said he saw families killed in their own homes, and women and children covered in blood. Some families ran to their rooftops to hide but were not spared the bloodshed. \"It is horrific,\" he said.",
      "The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights documented more than 740 civilians killed in the coastal cities of Latakia, Jableh and Banias. A further 300 members of the security forces and remnants of the Assad regime are reported to have died in clashes.",
      "The BBC has not been able to independently verify the death toll.",
      "Mr Fares said things stabilised when the Syrian army and security forces arrived in the city of Banias. They pushed other factions out of the city and provided corridors for families to access safe areas, he said.",
      "Ali, another resident of Banias who asked us not to use his full name, corroborated Mr Fares' account. Ali, who lived in Kusour with his wife and 14-year-old daughter, fled his home with the assistance of security forces.",
      "\"They came to our building. We were too scared just listening to the fire and screams of people in the neighbourhood. We learned about the deaths from sporadic Facebook posts when we managed to connect. But when they came to our building, we thought we are done,\" he said.",
      "\"They were after money. They knocked on our neighbour's door taking his car, his money and all the gold or valuables he had in his home. But he was not killed.\"",
      "Ali and his family were picked up by his Sunni neighbours, who follow a different branch of Islam, and are now staying with them. \"We lived together for years, Alawites, Sunnis and Christians. We never experienced this,\" he told me.",
      "\"The Sunnis rushed to protect Alawites from the killing that happened and now the official forces are in town to restore order.\"",
      "Ali said families were taken to a school in a neighbourhood that is predominantly Sunni, where they will be protected until members of the factions that carried out the killings are ousted from Banias.",
      "The violence started on Thursday after Assad loyalists - who refused to give up arms - ambushed security forces around the coastal cities of Latakia and Jableh, killing dozens of them.",
      "Ghiath Dallah, an ex-brigadier general in Assad's army, has announced a new rebellion against the current government, saying he was establishing the \"Military Council for the Liberation of Syria\".",
      "Some reports suggest that former security officers of the Assad regime who refused to give up arms are forming a resistance group in the mountains.",
      "Mr Fares said most of the Alawite community reject them and blame Dallah and other hardline Assad loyalists for the violence.",
      "\"They benefit from the bloodshed that's happening. What we need now is official security to prevail and to prosecute the killers from the factions who did the mass killing so the country restores safety,\" he said.",
      "But others also blame interim president Ahmad al-Sharaa, saying he dismantled Syria's security, army and police establishments with no clear strategy for dealing with thousands of officers and personnel left unemployed.",
      "Some of these individuals, especially among the police, had nothing to do with the killing during Assad's regime. The new authorities also dismissed thousands of public employees from their work.",
      "With 90% of Syria's population living below the poverty line and thousands left without an income, it's fertile ground for a rebellion.",
      "There is a split in views in Syria over what is happening. The wider community condemns the killing of any civilians and demonstrations have been organised in Damascus to mourn the deaths and condemn the violence.",
      "But over the past two days, there were also calls for \"Jihad\" in different parts of Syria. Residents in Banias said that along with the factions, there were some civilians who were armed and joined forces in the killing.",
      "Syria's majority Sunnis have faced atrocities at the hands of the Assad regime's forces over the past 13 years. This fuelled sectarian hatred mainly towards the Alawite minority, where members of the community are affiliated with war crimes.",
      "According to human rights groups, there is evidence that Alawite security officers were involved in the killing and torture of thousands of Syrians, the majority of which are Sunni Muslims, during the Assad regime.",
      "Those members of the army and security forces who were killed are mostly from the Sunni community and now some in the Sunni community are calling for retaliation, but the president has called for calm.",
      "Sharaa, whose Islamist forces toppled Assad three months ago, must now balance providing safety for all with pursuing justice for the crimes of the Assad regime and its henchmen.",
      "While he has authority over some of the troops who helped him to power, some factions are clearly out of his control. Those factions also include foreign fighters with a radical Islamist agenda.",
      "To lead Syria into a safe and democratic future, many argue Sharaa needs to end the presence of any foreign fighters and deliver a constitution that protects the rights of all Syrians, regardless of their background or religion.",

      "For 50 years, his family's clothing business in India's northwestern textile city of Ludhiana has made jackets, sweaters and sweatshirts. But with the early onset of summer this year, the company is staring at a washout season and having to shift gears.",
      "\"We've had to start making t-shirts instead of sweaters as the winter is getting shorter with each passing year. Our sales have halved in the last five years and are down a further 10% during this season,\" Goel told the BBC. \"The only recent exception to this was Covid, when temperatures dropped significantly.\"",
      "Across India as cool weather beats a hasty retreat, anxieties are building up at farms and factories, with cropping patterns and business plans getting upended.",
      "Data from the Indian Meteorological Department shows that last month was India's hottest February in 125 years. The weekly average minimum temperature was also above normal by 1-3C in many parts of the country.",
      "Above-normal maximum temperatures and heatwaves are likely to persist over most parts of the country between March and May, the weather agency has warned.",
      "For small business owners like Goel, such erratic weather has meant much more than just slowing sales. His whole business model, practised and perfected over decades, has had to change.",

      "\"Production this year would be only around 30% of the normal yield,\" said Vidyadhar Joshi, a farmer who owns 1,500 trees.",
      "The sweet, fleshy and richly aromatic Alphonso is a prized export from the region, but yields across the districts of Raigad, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri, where the variety is predominantly grown, are lower, according to Joshi.",
      "\"We might make losses this year,\" Joshi adds, because he has had to spend more than usual on irrigation and fertilisers in a bid to salvage the crop.",
      "According to him, many other farmers in the area were even sending labourers, who come from Nepal to work in the orchards, back home because there wasn't enough to do.",
      "Scorching heat is also threatening winter staples such as wheat, chickpea and rapeseed.",
      "While the country's agriculture minister has dismissed concerns about poor yields and predicted that India will have a bumper wheat harvest this year, independent experts are less hopeful.",
      "Heatwaves in 2022 lowered yields by 15-25% and \"similar trends could follow this year\", says Abhishek Jain of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (Ceew) think tank.",
      "India - the world's second largest wheat producer - will have to rely on expensive imports in the event of such disruptions. And its protracted ban on exports, announced in 2022, may continue for even longer.",
      "Economists are also worried about the impact of rising temperatures on availability of water for agriculture.",
      "Reservoir levels in northern India have already dropped to 28% of capacity, down from 37% last year, according to Ceew. This could affect fruit and vegetable yields and the dairy sector, which has already experienced a decline in milk production of up to 15% in some parts of the country.",
      "\"These things have the potential to push inflation up and reverse the 4% target that the central bank has been talking about,\" says Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist with Bank of Baroda.",
      "Food prices in India have recently begun to soften after remaining high for several months, leading to rate cuts after a prolonged pause.",
      "GDP in Asia's third largest economy has also been supported by accelerating rural consumption recently after hitting a seven-quarter low last year. Any setback to this farm-led recovery could affect overall growth, at a time when urban households have been cutting back and private investment hasn't picked up.",
      "Think tanks like Ceew say a range of urgent measures to mitigate the impact of recurrent heatwaves needs to be thought through, including better weather forecasting infrastructure, agriculture insurance and evolving cropping calendars with climate models to reduce risks and improve yields.",
      "As a primarily agrarian country, India is particularly vulnerable to climate change.",
      "Ceew estimates three out of every four Indian districts are \"extreme event hotspots\" and 40% exhibit what is called \"a swapping trend\" - which means traditionally flood-prone areas are witnessing more frequent and intense droughts and vice-versa.",
      "The country is expected to lose about 5.8% of daily working hours due to heat stress by 2030, according to one estimate. Climate Transparency, the advocacy group, had pegged India's potential income loss across services, manufacturing, agriculture and construction sectors from labour capacity reduction due to extreme heat at $159bn in 2021- or 5.4% of its GDP.",

      "\"You know, I don't know,\" he told me. \"Do you know? Does anyone know? I'm not a medical doctor or a psychiatrist. He changes his mind every two or three hours. So [for him] to be leader of the free world, it is preoccupying for everybody.\"",
      "While the US threat is dominating Canadian politics - Carney described the current situation as \"dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust\" - there are still domestic political matters to focus on too, not least the prospect of a general election.",
      "Once sworn in as prime minister in the coming days, Carney will have to decide whether to call a snap election. If he doesn't, the opposition parties in parliament could force one later this month through a no-confidence vote.",
      "Before Trudeau said he was stepping down, the Liberal Party was facing electoral oblivion.",
      "After nine years in power, he'd become a liability and a lightning rod for public anger over the rising cost of living despite record levels of government spending and a ballooning national debt.",
      "The stage appeared to be set for the Liberals to be swept from power by a Conservative Party under the stewardship of the young, populist leader Pierre Poilievre, who had turned lambasting Trudeau into something of a sport.",
      "Now, not only has he lost the advantage of a deeply unpopular opponent, his political style is at risk of appearing out of step. In the current environment, even a loose alignment with the politics of Trump is a potential liability with Canadian voters.",
      "The Republican president, for his part, recently said Canada's Conservative leader was not Maga enough.",
      "The Liberal Party is suddenly feeling a sense of rejuvenation - the gap in the opinion polls with the Conservatives, once a gulf, has narrowed dramatically. And you could feel that palpable sense of optimism in the room on Sunday evening.",
      "Aware of the danger, Poilievre accused Liberals of \"trying to trick Canadians\" to elect them to a fourth term. But his statement also highlighted how Trump is changing the political messaging on this side of the border.",
      "\"It is the same Liberal team that drove up taxes, housing costs, and food prices, while Carney personally profited from moving billions of dollars and thousands of jobs out of Canada to the United States,\" Poilievre wrote.",
      "\"We need a new Conservative government that will put Canada First - for a change.\"",
      "Trump's election has led Canada to rally to round its flag and has propelled a former central bank governor \u2013 an archetypal member of the country's political elite \u2013 to the highest office in the land.",
      "The Conservatives may still lead in the polls, but for the first time in a long time, the Liberals believe that, under Carney, they have a fighting chance again."

      "Fighting back the tears, 22-year-old rubbish collector Okuku Prince recalls the moment his best friend's lifeless body was found at a massive rubbish dump in Uganda's capital, Kampala.",
      "The landslide at the Kiteezi dump last August killed 30 people, including his friend Sanya Kezia.",
      "\"I think some people are still underneath the garbage,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Many of them eked out a living by washing and selling whatever discarded items they found that still had value - anything from fishing nets to plastic bottles, glass jars and the components of old electronic devices.",
      "A blame-game erupted after the fatal collapse, with Kampala's city council and central government accusing each other of negligence, while some of the dead still languished under tonnes of rubbish without the dignity of a burial.",
      "When government tractors did eventually dig up Kezia's body, there were injuries to the 21-year-old's face.",
      "It was horrifying for his friend to see him enveloped by stinking, rotting waste.",
      "\"We're not safe here. Unless they [repair] it, maybe level it. Otherwise, people are not safe,\" says Mr Prince, who before becoming a rubbish-picker had been studying law at the Islamic University of Uganda.",
      "Unable to afford tuition fees after his family became financially unstable, his daily routine is now a far cry from libraries and lecture halls.",
      "Youth unemployment is at crisis levels in Uganda, and there are many like Mr Prince who often risk their health and abandon their dreams just to make a living.",
      "\"I come here to the dump in the morning, collect polythene bags, take them for washing and sell them,\" says Mr Prince. \"I make 10,000 shillings [equivalent to $2.70 or \u00a32.10] a day.\"",
      "The collapse has left him in further financial distress as he used to live by the side of the dump - but has had to move because of safety concerns.",
      "The houses of others were also destroyed during rescue operations.",
      "Compensation money has been paid to the families of those who died, but not to around 200 people who lost their homes, local authorities have admitted to the BBC.",
      "Officials are \"waiting for the valuation and budget allocation\", says Dr Sarah Karen Zalwango, the new head of public health and the environment at the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA).",
      "Some argue that the Kiteezi collapse was inevitable because basic common sense was ignored.",
      "\"You can't take four million people, get all that waste, mingled - degradable and non-degradable - and take it to one dumping site. No, that's not how we [ought to] do it. But we've been doing it for over 20 years,\" Frank Muramuzi, a Kampala-based urban planner, tells the BBC.",
      "The Kiteezi landfill was built in 1996, with financing from the World Bank, to provide a single, major depository for solid waste generated by Kampala.",
      "As Kampala has grown, so too has its biggest rubbish dump.",
      "On the northern edge of the city, it now covers 15 hectares (37 acres) - an area the size of more than 22 football pitches - with its stench spreading further still.",
      "Birds of prey can be seen flying overhead.",
      "The city's residents and businesses generate an estimated 2,500 tonnes of waste every day, half of which ends up in dumping sites across the city - the biggest being Kiteezi.",
      "But the problem is that Kiteezi lacks the on-site recycling, sorting and incineration facilities that landfills are supposed to have.",
      "\"With each layer of trash piled up, the bottom layers become weaker, especially as the decay and decomposition of organic waste increases the temperature,\" Mr Muramuzi explains.",
      "\"Without vents, methane and other gases remain trapped at the bottom, further multiplying the fragility of the loosely held structure.\"",
      "Yet this can easily be fixed, he adds, so long as the government commits to periodic monitoring and audits which factor in environmental, social and economic needs.",
      "Had that already been in place, \"the havoc that happened in Kiteezi would have been avoided\", he says.",
      "So, if the solution is this simple, why is it not already happening?",
      "The answer seems to be a combination of power struggles and financial mismanagement.",
      "Ultimate responsibility for keeping Kampala \"clean, habitable, and sustainable environment\" lies with the KCCA, but Mayor Erias Lukwago, from the opposition Forum for Democratic Change party, says his office lacks the necessary power to enact the changes.",
      "The KCCA says it has repeatedly proposed plans to decommission Kiteezi but says the funds needed to do so - $9.7m - exceed the city's budget and have not been made available by central government.",
      "\"All the support we have been getting is courtesy of development partners and donors like Bill and Melinda Gates, GIZ, and WaterAid\u2026 but their capacity is very limited,\" the Kampala mayor said recently.",
      "\"If we were getting adequate funding from the central government, we would be very far right now.\"",
      "There is no word from the government on whether it will allocate funds for Kampala's biggest dump.",
      "It did pay $1,350 to each of the families of the deceased, saying any further money would only be forthcoming if government agencies were \"found to be responsible\".",
      "A month later, a report furnished by the country's police and crime investigation department led to President Yoweri Museveni - a noted political opponent of Kampala's mayor - sacking three senior KCCA officials, including the authority's executive and public health directors.",
      "James Bond Kunobere, Kampala's solid waste management officer, admits that last year's deadly collapse was a much-needed wake-up call.",
      "At present, the authorities in the Ugandan capital are drafting plans to turn organic waste into compost and reduce \"unnecessary waste\" coming into the city.",
      "But they want the public to take some responsibility too. At the moment people pay one of the seven private waste firms operating in Kampala to collect their rubbish, which is all bundled together with little thought given to recycling.",
      "\"We haven't changed the mindset of residents to sort waste,\" Mr Kunobere tells the BBC.",
      "\"If you sort, waste has different destinations. If you mix, it all goes to one - the landfill.\"",
      "Experts say such initiatives are important but do not address the bigger structural inadequacies at Kiteezi.",
      "And for people whose lives have been shattered by recent events there, it is too little too late.",
      "\"They promised us compensation, but I haven't received anything - almost everyone is complaining too,\" Mr Prince tells the BBC.",
      "\"We lost our friend. All that transpired in the process was sorrow.\"",

    "summary": "Indian deportee tells BBC about his risky journey and how Trump\u2019s tactics are spreading fear.",
    "story": [
      "Gurpreet Singh was handcuffed, his legs shackled and a chain tied around his waist. He was led on to the tarmac in Texas by US Border Patrol, towards a waiting C-17 military transport aircraft.",
      "It was 3 February and, after a months-long journey, he realised his dream of living in America was over. He was being deported back to India. \"It felt like the ground was slipping away from underneath my feet,\" he said.",
      "Gurpreet, 39, was one of thousands of Indians in recent years to have spent their life savings and crossed continents to enter the US illegally through its southern border, as they sought to escape an unemployment crisis back home.",
      "There are about 725,000 undocumented Indian immigrants in the US, the third largest group behind Mexicans and El Salvadoreans, according to the most recent figures from Pew Research in 2022.",
      "Now Gurpreet has become one of the first undocumented Indians to be sent home since President Donald Trump took office, with a promise to make mass deportations a priority.",
      "Gurpreet intended to make an asylum claim based on threats he said he had received in India, but - in line with an executive order from Trump to turn people away without granting them asylum hearings - he said he was removed without his case ever being considered.",
      "About 3,700 Indians were sent back on charter and commercial flights during President Biden's tenure, but recent images of detainees in chains under the Trump administration have sparked outrage in India.",
      "US Border Patrol released the images in an online video with a bombastic choral soundtrack and the warning: \"If you cross illegally, you will be removed.\"",
      "\"We sat in handcuffs and shackles for more than 40 hours. Even women were bound the same way. Only the children were free,\" Gurpreet told the BBC back in India. \"We weren't allowed to stand up. If we wanted to use the toilet, we were escorted by US forces, and just one of our handcuffs was taken off.\"",
      "Opposition parties protested in parliament, saying Indian deportees were given \"inhuman and degrading treatment\". \"There's a lot of talk about how Prime Minister Modi and Mr Trump are good friends. Then why did Mr Modi allow this?\" said Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, a key opposition leader.",
      "Gurpreet said: \"The Indian government should have said something on our behalf. They should have told the US to carry out the deportation the way it's been done before, without the handcuffs and chains.\"",
      "An Indian foreign ministry spokesman said the government had raised these concerns with the US, and that as a result, on subsequent flights, women deportees were not handcuffed and shackled.",
      "But on the ground, the intimidating images and President Trump's rhetoric seem to be having the desired effect, at least in the immediate aftermath.",
      "\"No-one will try going to the US now through this illegal 'donkey' route while Trump is in power,\" said Gurpreet.",
      "In the longer term, this could depend on whether there are continued deportations, but for now many of the Indian people-smugglers, locally called \"agents\", have gone into hiding, fearing raids against them by Indian police.",
      "Gurpreet said Indian authorities demanded the number of the agent he had used when he landed back home, but the smuggler could no longer be reached.",
      "\"I don't blame them, though. We were thirsty and went to the well. They didn't come to us,\" said Gurpreet.",
      "While the official headline figure puts the unemployment rate at only 3.2%, it conceals a more precarious picture for many Indians. Only 22% of workers have regular salaries, the majority are self-employed and nearly a fifth are \"unpaid helpers\", including women working in family businesses.",
      "\"We leave India only because we are compelled to. If I got a job which paid me even 30,000 rupees (\u00a3270/$340) a month, my family would get by. I would never have thought of leaving,\" said Gurpreet, who has a wife, a mother and an 18-month-old baby to look after.",
      "\"You can say whatever you want about the economy on paper, but you need to see the reality on the ground. There are no opportunities here for us to work or run a business.\"",
      "Gupreet's trucking company was among the cash-dependent small businesses that were badly hit when the Indian government withdrew 86% of the currency in circulation with four hours notice. He said he didn't get paid by his clients, and had no money to keep the business afloat. Another small business he set up, managing logistics for other companies, also failed because of the Covid lockdown, he said.",
      "He said he tried to get visas to go to Canada and the UK, but his applications were rejected.",
      "Then he took all his savings, sold a plot of land he owned, and borrowed money from relatives to put together 4 million rupees ($45,000/\u00a336,000) to pay a smuggler to organise his journey, Gurpreet told us.",
      "On 28 August 2024, he flew from India to Guyana in South America to start an arduous journey to the US.",
      "Gurpreet pointed out all the stops he made on a map on his phone. From Guyana he travelled through Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, mostly by buses and cars, partly by boat, and briefly on a plane - handed from one people-smuggler to another, detained and released by authorities a few times along the way.",
      "From Colombia, smugglers tried to get him a flight to Mexico, so he could avoid crossing the dreaded Dari\u00e9n Gap. But Colombian immigration didn't allow him to board the flight, so he had to make a dangerous trek through the jungle.",
      "A dense expanse of rainforest between Colombia and Panama, the Dari\u00e9n Gap can only be crossed on foot, risking accidents, disease and attacks by criminal gangs. Last year, 50 people died making the crossing.",
      "\"I was not scared. I've been a sportsman so I thought I would be OK. But it was the toughest section,\" said Gurpreet. \"We walked for five days through jungles and rivers. In many parts, while wading through the river, the water came up to my chest.\"",
      "Each group was accompanied by a smuggler - or a \"donker\" as Gurpreet and other migrants refer to them, a word seemingly derived from the term \"donkey route\" used for illegal migration journeys.",
      "At night they would pitch tents in the jungle, eat a bit of food they were carrying and try to rest.",
      "\"It was raining all the days we were there. We were drenched to our bones,\" he said. They were guided over three mountains in their first two days. After that, he said they had to follow a route marked out in blue plastic bags tied to trees by the smugglers.",
      "\"My feet had begun to feel like lead. My toenails were cracked, and the palms of my hands were peeled off and had thorns in them. Still, we were lucky we didn't encounter any robbers.\"",
      "When they reached Panama, Gurpreet said he and about 150 others were detained by border officials in a cramped jail-like centre. After 20 days, they were released, he said, and from there it took him more than a month to reach Mexico, passing through Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala.",
      "Gurpreet said they waited for nearly a month in Mexico until there was an opportunity to cross the border into the US near San Diego.",
      "\"We didn't scale a wall. There is a mountain near it which we climbed over. And there's a razor wire which the donker cut through,\" he said.",
      "Gurpreet entered the US on 15 January, five days before President Trump took office - believing that he had made it just in time, before the borders became impenetrable and rules became tighter.",
      "Once in San Diego, he surrendered to US Border Patrol, and was then detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).",
      "During the Biden administration, illegal or undocumented migrants would appear before an immigration officer who would do a preliminary interview to determine if each person had a case for asylum. While a majority of Indians migrated out of economic necessity, some also left fearing persecution because of their religious or social backgrounds, or their sexual orientation.",
      "If they cleared the interview, they were released, pending a decision on granting asylum from an immigration judge. The process would often take years, but they were allowed to remain in the US in the meantime.",
      "This is what Gurpreet thought would happen to him. He had planned to find work at a grocery store and then to get into trucking, a business he is familiar with.",
      "Instead, less than three weeks after he entered the US, he found himself being led towards that C-17 plane and going back to where he started.",
      "In their small house in Sultanpur Lodhi, a city in the northern state of Punjab, Gurpreet is now trying to find work to repay the money he owes, and fend for his family.",

      "Six months ago, a viral TikTok trend made us obsessed with being very demure and very mindful - but now, modesty has taken a back seat among celebrities who have made see-through outfits all the rage on red carpets and catwalks.",
      "At the Brit Awards last week, big winner Charli XCX went full brat as she wore a sheer black dress, prompting hundreds of complaints to media watchdog Ofcom.",
      "She used one of her acceptance speeches to address the controversy of her outfit. \"I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples,\" she said. \"I feel like we're in the era of 'free the nipple' though, right?\"",
      "The nearly naked look has been a talking point at other award ceremonies - including last Sunday's Oscars and the Grammys in February, when Kanye West's girlfriend Bianca Censori dropped her coat on the red carpet to reveal an almost entirely invisible dress.",
      "The love for transparent textiles has continued at London and Paris fashion weeks, with many of the celebrities watching on also getting the memo.",
      "At Stella McCartney's Paris show, US actress and Michael Jackson's daughter Paris Jackson wore a translucent black off-the-shoulder maxi dress with only a nude-coloured thong underneath.",
      "Rapper Ice Spice sported a black lace catsuit with a feathered coat at the show.",
      "Naked dressing was a key trend in some designers' spring/summer collections, and the theme has continued in autumn/winter looks too.",
      "As Vogue wrote in January: \"For a period of time, sheerness was few and far between, but nowadays, 'naked dressing' is commonplace every season.\"",
      "Dior's latest collection embraced see-through material and presented it in an ethereal way, with intricate detailing and gender-fluid silhouettes.",
      "Creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri described her collection as \"demonstrating how clothing is a receptacle that affirms cultural, aesthetic and social codes\".",
      "The trend divides opinion but is certainly part of a wider movement - last summer Charli XCX's definition of being a brat included wearing \"a strappy white top with no bra\".",
      "Sheer dressing is a nod to the minimalist looks of the 1990s - think transparent blouses and Kate Moss wearing a thin slip dress - and with our love for nostalgia fashion, it's no wonder it is taking off again.",
      "The trend also had a resurgence a decade ago. The \"free the nipple\" movement was everywhere in the early 2010s, with Rihanna stirring up headlines with her sheer crystal-embellished dress at the CFDA awards in 2014.",
      "Charli XCX's Brits outfit was praised by some on social media. \"Stop policing women's bodies,\" one person wrote, while another said she looked comfortable in her outfit so \"why is society judging?\"",
      "But many found it too risque for prime-time TV. Ofcom received 825 complaints  about the Brits ceremony, the majority relating to Charli's outfit and Sabrina Carpenter's eye-opening pre-watershed performance.",
      "\"Maybe think about putting this on at a time when kids ain't gonna be watching,\" one person wrote on social media.",
      "'Challenging fashion norms'",
      "Fashion stylist and CEO of clothing brand Mermaid Way, Julia Pukhalskaia, calls the choice to wear revealing dresses a \"provocative statement\", but says it's a \"way to reclaim the right to govern one's body\".",
      "The controversy around it feeds into a wider dialogue about women's rights and double standards when it comes to dress codes, she adds.",
      "Abhi Madan, creative director of fashion brand Amarra, believes the trend \"is about embracing freedom and boldness in fashion\".",
      "The idea of freeing the nipple \"isn't just about exposure - it's a movement towards body positivity and challenging conventional fashion norms\", he argues.",
      "\"Designers are now integrating sheer elements not just for shock value but to create a refined and elegant silhouette that empowers wearers.\"",
      "It seems many Hollywood stars this year were feeling empowered as chiffon, lace and tulle were in plentiful supply at the Oscars.",
      "Shock value is surely a factor for some, too, though.",
      "At Vanity Fair's Oscars afterparty, Julia Fox wore a mesh dress with only long wavy hair to cover some of her modesty.",
      "There were other interpretations of the naked dress - Megan Thee Stallion wore a green dress with strategically placed foliage and nipple coverings, while Zoe Kravitz opted to cover up the front but expose the back as a beaded mesh panel revealed her buttocks in her Saint Laurent dress.",
      "\"This year, naked dressing seemed to particularly thrive at the event,\" the New York Times noted.",
      "However, not everyone is on board. The Times fashion director Anna Murphy wrote that she's over the trend because \"it's only women who do this\".",

      "\"I would like to stress I don't think at the end of the day that the Americans will take Greenland by force.\"",
      "President Trump first talked about a Greenland takeover in his first term of office before returning to the theme at the start of this year.",
      "But now, after blindsiding supposed allies with his latest moves on Ukraine, tariffs, as well as the Middle East, Denmark is urgently trying to assess the true threat.",
      "For many younger Danes, control of Greenland is plain wrong - an unfathomable colonial hangover.",
      "It doesn't mean they want it handed straight over to the US instead.",
      "\"We do have connections to Greenland,\" says music student Molly. \"Denmark and Greenland are quite separated I would say but I still have friends from there so this does affect me quite personally.\"",
      "\"I find it really scary,\" says 18-year-old music student Luukas.",
      "\"Everything he sees, he goes after. And the thing with the oil and money, he doesn't care about the climate, he doesn't care about anyone or anything.\"",
      "His friend Clara chips in that Trump is now so powerful he can \"affect their day-to-day life\" from thousands of miles away, in what is an era of unprecedented jeopardy.",
      "In light of President Trump's suspension of military aid for Ukraine and his deep reluctance to fund Europe's security, Denmark has been at the heart of the drive to boost defence spending across the continent.",
      "The country has just announced it will allocate more than 3% of its GDP to defence spending in 2025 and 2026 to protect against future aggression from Russia or elsewhere.",
      "Meanwhile, security analyst Hans Tino Hansen stands in front of a huge screen in what he calls his \"ops room\", at his Copenhagen headquarters.",
      "\"This map is where we update on a daily basis our threat picture based on alerts and incidents all over the world,\" says Hans, who has been running Risk Intelligence for the past 25 years.",
      "As part of Denmark's increased defence spending, it's bolstering its strength in the \"High North\" with an extra two billion euros announced in January and three new Arctic naval vessels and investment in long-range drones.",
      "Hans believes Arctic security can be tightened further, not by an American takeover - but with new deals that restore US influence.",
      "\"If you make more agreements, both on defence and security, but also economic ones and on raw materials, then we are more or less going back to where we were in the 50s and 60s.\"",
      "But the story stretches further back than the mid-20th Century.",
      "\"If you look at this globe, Greenland is the most centrally located place on Earth,\" says world-renowned geologist Prof Minik Rosing, gesticulating in his wood-panelled office.",
      "The serenity of his room reflects the temperament of a man who grew up in a settlement of just \"seven or eight people\" in the Nuuk fjord of the island.",
      "But a key reason his homeland is now coming under increasing scrutiny from outsiders is the rich mineral deposits beneath the Arctic ice.",
      "We've seen how Ukraine's natural resources have caught President Trump's eye in much the same way.",
      "\"All these minerals that they talk about like rare metals, rare earth elements - they are actually not rare. What is rare is the use of them,\" he reasons.",
      "Prof Rosing says the vastness of Greenland and the lack of infrastructure are just two elements why the island may not be the cashpoint some Americans are hoping for.",
      "\"They are a minuscule part of the mining industry and the economy of extracting them is very uncertain, whereas the investment to start extracting is very high. The risk of the investment is too high relative to the potential gain.\"",
      "The current Greenlandic government says there will be a vote on independence at some point following next week's election.",
      "Although surely unintentional, President Trump's designs on the island have shone a light on a desire found among the Inuit to finally break free from 300 years of Danish control.",
      "But Prof Rosing believes, despite all the latent mineral wealth, his fellow Greenlanders are in no hurry to forego the annual block grant of the equivalent of \u00a3480m (\u20ac570m) it receives from Copenhagen.",
      "This accounts for easily more than half of the island's public budget.",
      "\"People talk about health services, schools, the next outboard engine they want on their boat and what is the price of gas and all of these things that normal people do,\" he says.",
      "\"It's not like they stand up with a big knife, wave it in the air and shout independence, independence.\"",
      "In terms of Trump's apparent obsession with taking Greenland, Fogh Rasmussen fears there may be a troubling conclusion to be drawn.",
      "One that would render the Danes unable to do business with a man whose view on territorial integrity is so wildly incompatible from theirs.",
      "\"I understand very well the American strategic interest in the minerals, but when it comes to mining in Greenland, they have shown no interest,\" he says.",
      "\"That leaves me with the concern that maybe it's not about security, maybe it's not about minerals, maybe it is just a question of expanding the territory of the United States.",
      "\"And that's actually a point where we are not able to accommodate President Trump.\"",

    "summary": "Yo Yo Honey Singh, who transformed Indian hip-hop, has made a comeback after a long battle with drug abuse.",
    "story": [
      "About 15 years ago, an Indian rapper of humble origins broke onto the country's then-infertile hip-hop music scene and transformed it forever.",
      "He teased, cajoled and vexed his listeners, daring them to explore the \"devilish\" contours of his mind, as he sang rash rhymes about parties, drugs and \"seducing\" women. His songs played in clubs and weddings, blaring from stereos at big parties and roadside tea stalls alike.",
      "Then, at the peak of his career, he vanished. Seven years later, Yo Yo Honey Singh is back - with a new album and an ongoing music tour, claiming to be a changed man after a prolonged battle with drug abuse and mental health struggles.",
      "The 41-year-old singer and producer was once one of India's biggest music stars, a figure who \"moved the cultural gravity of hip-hop music\", says music journalist Bhanuj Kappal in Famous, a recent Netflix documentary on Singh.",
      "But he was also deeply controversial - and, by his own admission, an \"aggressive and reckless man\", routinely accused of promoting vulgarity, debauchery and violence through his music.",
      "Many criticised Singh's lyrics for depicting violence against women and rape, an image that gained further traction in the press after his former wife and childhood sweetheart accused him of domestic violence in her divorce filing. Singh has denied the charge.",
      "Seven years later, the singer is no longer the defiant hitmaker who once ruled the charts with his provocative, foot-tapping anthems.",
      "A lot has changed in the intervening years, including Indian hip-hop, which has evolved into a thriving, dynamic space. Artists once inspired by his sound have now surpassed him as the genre's leading voices.",
      "Singh also seems different. From someone who described himself as \"the all-knowing master of the universe\", he now identifies as a God-fearing man who believes in good energies, the cyclic nature of life and \"scientific astrologers\".",
      "He claims his music is now more conscious, moving beyond drugs to something deeper. But loyal fans say it's lost its edge and his latest tracks haven't left a mark.",
      "\"He has a core audience that will stick with him forever... but his vision is old now. It's outdated,\" Kappal says.",
      "But Singh is not ready to be written off, yet.",
      "Instead of trying to conceal or defend his personal struggles with fame and drugs, he has made it the centrepiece of his comeback.",
      "Since his return, Singh has candidly admitted his struggles with addiction and mental health. \"Drugs destroyed me completely,\" he told Lallantop, a digital news platform. \"I lost myself to fame, money and women. I was like a devil, completely satanic.\"",
      "In interviews, he is witty and relaxed, speaking with the clarity of a tormented artist who, after battling his inner demons, seems to have unlocked a spiritual truth",
      "\"What goes around comes around, I really believe that,\" he said recently. \"It took a lot of time for me to get out from where I was stuck. But I am back now.\"",
      "Born Hridesh Singh in Punjab state, he grew up in a cramped Delhi neighbourhood. Those tough early years shaped his music and still echo in his work today.",
      "\"This ghetto was my home, my hood, always will be,\" he's often heard saying.",
      "Singh always knew he wanted a career in music. He started as a college DJ, later moving into production full-time. \"I wanted to make beats and produce music, not sing or write,\" he says.",
      "But after years as a small-time producer in Punjab, he realised it wouldn't be enough. \"My sounds were too urban for the place. People didn't understand it. For that, I had to go beyond the state.\"",
      "So he went solo. In 2011, Singh released The International Villager, his breakout album. Blending Punjabi folk - its dhol beats and string melodies - with global hip-hop, he created something entirely new.",
      "For three months, it seemed the formula had failed. Then everything changed. Overnight, the songs went viral, topped charts, won awards - and catapulted Singh into Bollywood.",
      "Brown Rang, a song about a brown man's global ambition, became YouTube's most-watched video in 2012. Shot in Dubai on a million-dollar budget, it introduced many Indians to the bling of hip-hop - fast cars, baggy clothes, gem-studded watches and gold chains - set to slick, thumping beats.",
      "Despite mounting criticism over his misogynistic lyrics, Singh packed stadiums and churned out hits, breaking into Bollywood with songs for stars like Shah Rukh Khan and Akshay Kumar.",
      "\"A lot of times, my lyrics were trash, even I knew that. But people were still listening to it because the sound was so good and fresh,\" he told Lallantop.",
      "But Singh's ascent to fame coincided with his personal downfall.",
      "\"I was drowning in drugs and alcohol, smoking 12-15 joints and downing bottles. I abandoned my family, lost control. This one time, I got so high I bit a friend on his stomach eight times,\" he told Lallantop.",
      "In 2017, Singh broke down mid-tour - a moment that shook him. He quit music and substances, returned to Delhi and began recovery with a global team of doctors and therapists. \"I told my family I was mentally unwell. I can't do anything till I get better.\"",
      "Singh says he's been sober for seven years, except for the occasional beer.",
      "\"I have been to hell and back,\" he says in Famous. \"Even now, I wake up hazy because of the medicines.\"",
      "Fans, however, appreciate Singh's raw honesty about his self-destructive tendencies - and his effort to overcome them.",
      "\"No-one's perfect. But at least Singh tries to be better. He may have left the scene briefly but his music never stopped playing,\" says Nandini Gupta, a Delhi-based  student.",
      "Others see his transformation as performative, noting his new music remains problematic. \"Though toned down, he is still objectifying women and talking only about money and fame,\" says listener Bushra Neyazi.",
      "No matter how you see it, Singh's redemption feels like another challenge to his audience - pushing them to accept his complicated past and give his music another chance.",
      "\"I was away for seven years, but I will drive everyone mad again in the next seven,\" he said recently.",

      "\"Now, I don't know if you've been following the news but I've been keeping my ears open, and it seems like everyone everywhere is super-mad about everything all the time.\"",
      "But for his new job, the stand-up is sitting down. Mulaney is hosting a talk show on Netflix, complete with a couch and celebrity guests. And the whole thing is live, in part because he likes it better that way. \"It feels like there's more at stake,\" he said. \"I love that. It's the best.\"",
      "I asked, \"Explain that feeling \u2013 it's like coming up against a cliff and kind of dangling over it?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"It's dangling over it all the time.\"",
      "It began as an experiment during the Netflix Comedy Festival last year, called \"Everybody's in L.A.,\" talking about \"L.A. things,\" like earthquakes and coyotes. Now the show is back with a broader focus, and a new name, \"Everybody's Live With John Mulaney.\" It will go live every Wednesday night, starting this week. \"It's a fun feeling to know that hopefully a lot of people are watching,\" he said, \"and it's live, globally, with no delays, and you could really damage your career!\"",
      "To watch a teaser for \"Everybody's Live With John Mulaney,\" click on the video player below:",
      "And he knows all about live TV. For Mulaney, \"Saturday Night Live\" is home turf. He started as a writer there in 2008, and helped create some of the show's biggest characters, like Bill Hader's Stefon. Mulaney would often change the script at the last second to throw Hader off, like during this Halloween skit:",
      "Stefon: \"Have you heard of Blacula, the Black Dracula? Well, they have a Jewish Dracula.\"Seth Meyers: \"Oh, what's his name?\"Stefon: \"Sidney Applebaum!\"",
      "Seems like this was the thing John Mulaney was born to do. Raised in Chicago, Mulaney says he grew up feeling that comedy was his destiny. Asked if he has a memory of when he realized that he was funny, Mulaney said, \"Always interesting in these things, 'cause you don't want to sound egotistical, but I don't remember a time when I didn't think I was funny.\"",
      "Not long after graduating from Georgetown, he joined \"SNL,\" and a career was launched. He made his mark in New York, but he's fascinated with Southern California, where he now lives year-round.",
      "He took us record shopping at one of his favorite places, the legendary Amoeba Music in Hollywood.",
      "I asked, \"When you come out to places like this, do people come up to you? Or do they leave you alone?\"",
      "\"A little bit,\" he said. \"My joke is that I'm like Louis Farrakhan: I mean a lot to a small group of people.\"",
      "Truth is, Mulaney is a lot bigger than he'll admit. In his most recent special, \"Baby J,\" he played to a sold-out crowd and focused on his drug addiction, and recovery. He describes a 2020 intervention on his behalf staged by friends like Seth Meyers and Fred Armisen: \"Let me just call this out now, I don't mean to be weird, it was a star-studded intervention.\"",
      "It's funny now, of course: Mulaney says he's been clean for more than four years.",
      "Asked if sobriety is something he thinks about every day, Mulaney replied, \"Well, that's a good question. I don't think about cocaine, opioids, and benzodiazeprine every day. I'll acknowledge that I understand the vigilance I need. I do not think about it every day. I just don't. I do think about the ways that I can lead my life to perhaps never feel the kind of strain that got me there. So, yeah, sobriety maybe being, like, a bigger term than just abstaining from the chemicals, I definitely think about it every day.\"",
      "Mulaney credits his wife, actress Olivia Munn, with helping him navigate his recovery. You might remember her from Aaron Sorkin's \"The Newsroom,\" or \"X-Men: Apocalypse,\" in which she played Psylocke. But she's a bit of a superhero in real life as well; she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2023, and has shared her whole journey online, from the initial test to a double mastectomy. Other women have since credited her with saving their lives.",
      "Mulaney said, \"There's this lifetime risk assessment test that is really the only reason her cancer was discovered. And seeing so many women publicly and privately come to her that [say] they discovered how high their risk was from that, it's astonishing.\"",
      "She's also mom to their two young children, Malcom and Mei. \"I have this feeling a lot of times, I go, 'I can't believe I know this person, let alone am married to her,'\" he said.",
      "Fatherhood has given him not only new material, but also a whole new outlook on life.",
      "From his November 2024 monologue on \"Saturday Night Live\":",
      "\"My wife and I just welcomed a baby girl into our family. \u2026 My wife takes care of the five-week-old, and I take the two-year-old out. And that's not fair. That's not an equal distribution of labor at all. Saying, 'You have a five-week-old, I'll take a two-year-old,' that's like saying, 'I'll transport this convict across state lines. You hold a potato.'\"",
      "John Mulaney has made a good life making people laugh. Now, as a husband and father of two, he says he has something to live for.",
      "Asked how fatherhood has changed how he looks at the world, Mulaney replied, \"I'm in the world now that I'm a father. My head was my only home before that.

      "For Lindsey Vonn, it was a reluctant farewell \u2013 the last run of her stellar career, at the Alpine World Ski Championships in Are, Sweden, in 2019. In the world of alpine skiing, few have been more decorated. She's won almost every major title, from World Cup Championships to Olympic medals, as the trophy case in her home proves.",

      "She was fast, reaching speeds of up to 85 mph. She was also fearless, and resilient. Crash after terrible crash, she always fought her way back. But 2013 was one of her hardest seasons. Vonn's right knee bore the brunt of a crash in the World Cup Super-G, and it was never the same. Flash forward almost six years, on the day of her last race \u2013 bum knee and all \u2013 she still managed to take home the bronze.",
      "At 34, Lindsey Vonn was retired.",
      "\"Skiing was always my sun, and everything in my life revolved around it: What time I woke up, what I ate, when I went to bed. It was all dictated around what's best for my skiing career,\" she said. \"And then, I woke up one day and my sun is gone.\"",
      "Ski racing is all Vonn ever wanted. Her dad, a former alpine skier himself, moved the family from Minnesota to Vail, Colorado, just so that Lindsey could train for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Those same slopes she now sees from her home in Park City, Utah.",
      "\"This is kind of just where I go to, you know, re-group and recharge my batteries,\" she said. \"And the dogs love it.\"",
      "In retirement, Vonn has kept many of her corporate sponsors, which helped her buy homes in Miami and Beverly Hills. She continued to wow red carpets, and not racing gave her more time to pour into her foundation, helping under-served girls achieve their own athletic dreams.",
      "But that knee kept getting worse. \"I just couldn't do the things I love to do anymore,\" she said. \"It was really bad. I couldn't straighten it all the way. I couldn't flex it all the way. And so, I was just stuck in this half-state that ended up causing hip pain, back pain, neck pain. It wasn't just my knee, unfortunately. It was kind of everything. It's like you get to the end of your rope and you gotta make a decision. So, I did.\"",
      "A knee replacement \u2013 the outer portion of her right knee is now titanium.",
      "But she didn't do it just to get back into skiing. \"I don't need to ski,\" she said. \"I am Lindsey. I am not a skier; I'm a person that loves to ski. And that's a really big distinction for me, in my mind, in my heart.\"",
      "I asked, \"How soon afterwards did you wonder how far you could push it?\"",
      "\"It was pretty quickly after!\" she laughed.",
      "Only four months, in fact. She took her coaches to New Zealand to acquaint her new knee with her old sport. \"It just was such a drastic difference that I thought, well, if I can do all of these things that used to hurt me before, where would that take me? And my mind starts to wander, and here we are.\"",
      "And where she is, is back on the U.S. ski team, hoping to qualify for one more trip to the Olympics: Italy 2026.",
      "\"I will be at a disadvantage,\" Vonn said. \"I am 40, and at that time next year I will be 41. But I know my skiing is there. I think I'm actually skiing better now than I was last few years of my career.\"",
      "She admits there has been some good-natured ribbing: \"For sure. There's one girl that calls me Grandma, which I don't exactly appreciate! But there's definitely some jokes around the team that, you know, I raced in my first Olympics before one of the girls was born.\"",
      "She knew there would be some raised eyebrows, but she got more than that, with some critics going so far as to question her sanity. \"These past few weeks have been tough,\" she posted on Instagram last month. \"I know they are only a few voices out of many\u2026 But it still hurts.\"",
      "A post shared by L I N D S E Y  \u2022  V O N N (@lindseyvonn)",
      "She told us, \"What I didn't expect was people to criticize me as a person and why I'm doing it, and that I can't handle life outside of ski racing.\"",
      "She dismisses most of it, choosing to concentrate on training smarter, not harder. \"It's not like I'm preparing for another ten years of my skiing career,\" she said. \"I'm just preparing for one year, for literally two races.\"",
      "She's put the rest of her life on hold for the moment \u2013 a single goal does require a singularity of focus, much like making her banana bread does. And there's a purpose to that: \"I need to put on weight, man,\" she said. \"I'm about 20 pounds less than when I was racing before.\"",
      "That brand of determination, she says, came from her mom, Lindy Lund. \"She would have given anything to play tennis, to play squash, to ride a bike, and she couldn't,\" Vonn said.",
      "Her mom suffered a stroke while pregnant with Lindsey in 1984. It was debilitating, but she soldiered on without complaint. When she was diagnosed with ALS (once known as Lou Gehrig's Disease), she \u2013 like her daughter \u2013 wasn't about to give up. \"She thought that she could beat the odds, and she could be the one that would live 20 more years, and she lasted one,\" Vonn said. \"Man, it was hard. I still got her number in my phone. I still message her.\"",
      "She said her mom would want her to be flying high once again, even though winning another downhill will be an uphill battle. In a sport measured in hundredths of a second, the difference between first and last can be miniscule. But on this second go-around, Lindsey Vonn is taking time to savor the view just as much as the chase.",
      "\"The fact that I'm even talking about going to the Olympics right now is something I never thought I would ever do,\" she said. \"So, I'm already winning!\"",

    "summary": "In 1996, a group of elderly, mostly forgotten Cuban musicians recorded an album that became a critical and commercial phenomenon worldwide. Now, the Grammy Award-winning album has inspired a Broadway musical.",
    "story": [
      "Remember \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" the album?\u00a0 Even if you don't, now there's \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" the musical, an exuberant blast from the past \u2013 old Cuban music for a new audience. The Broadway version is a stand-in for the city's corroded grandeur, and for the studio where, in 1996, a group of old, mostly forgotten Cuban musicians recorded the album.",
      "Justin Cunningham, as Juan de Marcos: \"What follows is the story of a band. Not ours, though we will do our best. Some of what follows is true. Some of it only feels true.\"",
      "The true part: the real person this actor is playing, Juan de Marcos Gonzalez, had already located and brought together the old musicians before music producers Ry Cooder and Nick Gold showed up in Havana. When their plan to make an album pairing Cuban and West African performers fell through, they went with Plan B, and recorded with the group Juan de Marcos had assembled.",
      "\"I was so happy, because they were my idols,\" Juan said. \"You know, I grew up with, you know, listening to their music. And then suddenly, I was the bandleader.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did any of the people involved, including you, have any idea that what became 'Buena Vista Social Club' would be something big?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"They became pop stars. It was like an unbelievable thing.\"",
      "The unexpected and irresistible phenomenon that resulted is the subject of the Oscar-nominated 1999 Wim Wenders documentary.",
      "\"It was just ubiquitous; I mean, you would hear this music everywhere,\" said music journalist and Substack contributor Judy Cantor-Navas, the author of \"Cuba on Record.\" \"To say that, 'Yes, we're listening to this old Cuban music that is suddenly selling millions of albums,' seemed like something that was very unlikely.\"",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think people loved the music so much?\"",
      "\"Cuban music has really appealed to so many different kinds of people,\" said Cantor-Navas. \"They say that it has, you know, the perfect combination of the Afro-Cuban rhythms and the Spanish melodies that came together in Cuba. It's just this very infectious music that, like, gets in your soul.\"",
      "It wasn't just the music they loved. It was who the musicians were \u2013 the improbable last act of their careers. The album won a Grammy, and has sold more than 8 million copies worldwide.",
      "\"And they were so happy, you know, because they came back to the stage,\" said Juan de Marcos. \"Because if you are a musician, and you are an artist, you are always an artist, you know? And even when you're retired, you have this small candle in your heart.\"",
      "Singer-dancer Omara Portuondo was 67; singer Ibrahim Ferrer was 70. Other band members were as old as 90. They began touring the world, even singing to me for a \"Sunday Morning\" story 25 years ago. \"I still have to pinch myself to make sure I'm not asleep and dreaming,\" Ferrer said then. \"I never thought I'd have so much success.\"",
      "The play tells the imagined origin story of the musicians, their careers, and their personal struggles, with hints of romance, decades before their fame late in life.",
      "Marco Ramirez wrote the Broadway show. \"I'm Cuban American. I was born and raised in Miami, but my parents and my family's Cuban,\" he said. \"And so, for me what brought me to this was the music. It was music that I was raised around my entire life.",
      "He was 14 when the album came out: \"This was a moment of intense pride, of us realizing that the world cared about our music, and that these songs that I was used to hearing on my grandfather's little yellow Sony boom box above the washing machine, these were songs that suddenly the whole world cared about. That meant everything to me.\"",
      "Saheem Ali, the director of the show, grew up in Kenya. His father, an airline pilot, brought the album home. He became obsessed with it. \"I kept listening to it on repeat,\" he said. \"Something about the lyrics spoke to me. I learned the lyrics without knowing what I was talking about, 'cause Swahili's my first language.",
      "\"I knew nothing about their stories, absolutely nothing. The first time I knew about the stories was reading Marco's script. That's what excited me about this musical. People are gonna know about them now in a way that young people like me never had a chance to.\"",
      "Brought to life on a Broadway stage, the old songs as they were played in the 1940s and '50s at the actual Buena Vista Social Club, a members-only Havana nightclub for working class Black Cubans. It was shut down after Fidel Castro came to power in 1959. The events of the Cuban Revolution lurk at the edges of the show.",
      "Playing yesterday's Cuban music on Broadway are some of today's finest Cuban musicians, most of whom now live outside Cuba, because making a living there is tough.",
      "Juan de Marcos said, \"The people going to see the real Cuba, they are going to get a piece of our country when they attend the musical. We have nothing in our country. We don't have oil, we don't have gold, but we have the music, beautiful ladies, good coffee, the best cigars, and the best rum. And the music, which is the most important thing, like food for us.\"",

      "Daffodils",
      "Sprouting in beautiful shades of yellow, orange, peach, white, cream, and even pink, daffodils\u2014known by their botanical name Narcissus\u2014are an early sign that spring has sprung.",
      "Some tried-and-true cultivars are the 'Golden Ducat', 'Rip Van Winkle', and 'Petit Four'\u2014all examples of the double daffodil, featuring one or more flowers to a stem. Another common variety is the trumpet daffodil, which has a center that is as long or longer than its petals. Large-cupped daffodils are defined by their prominent cups, while small-cup iterations have short cups that are less than one-third the length of the petals.",
      "Don't worry about recognizing all the different varieties; just choose what you like from your local garden center or online resource. Because no matter the type, daffodils (and other small bulbs) are so rewarding. The blooms last for two or three weeks in the garden and bring such color to your landscape. They are also low maintenance.",
      "Here are some tips to help you make the most of these perennial crowd-pleasers.",
      "Daffodils are winter-hardy in zones 3 through 8 and will return to bloom again year after year so long as they are planted in full or partial sun and in any soil that's not soggy.If your goal is to have drifts of daffodils, include varieties recommended for naturalizing and forming carpets on lawns and into woodlands. That way, the 100 bulbs you plant this fall will gradually multiply to 300, then 600, then 1,000, and so on.When planting en masse, it helps to create a planting \"map\" in advance on paper that can be transferred onto the ground with granular lime, as Martha does (see photo).Daffodil bulbs should be planted about two to three times as deep as the bulbs are high, so if you have one that's 2 inches tall, plant it 4 to 6 inches below the top of the soil.When harvesting for arrangements, grasp the stem at the base and pull rather than cutting, as viruses in bulbs can be passed along to other plants when using pruners to trim stems.Don't cut back daffodils too soon. Once the flowers bloom and fade, allow the whole plant to die back to the ground to create food for the bulbs so they can multiply.After removing spent foliage, apply a balanced 10-10-10 fertilizer over the entire area, and then add a layer of mulch. Fertilize the area again in the fall.",

It feels like looking into the mirror. They do not want to be in this story either. Men have been working since dawn to herd the wild jacks into this pen. The town has gathered to solve the problem of the rabbits, who chew through rangeland and cropland, who eat the golden wheat your papa turns into money. Worse than the locusts, says Papa. Every hide brings a penny bounty. So many turnipy sweating bodies and a festive feeling in the air like a penny rubbed between two fingers, like blood shocked into a socket. A smell that reminds you of the room where babies are born. When you try to turn and run away, Papa grabs you. There's Mr. O'Malley, Mr. Waldowko, Mr. Zalewski, Mrs. Haage. You can't remember any more names. A hundred jointed arms come swinging into the pen that is alive with jackrabbits, the place of no escape. Now there is only madness. Terror of cudgels, terror of ax handles and hammers, terror of being trampled. \"Papa! Help! Stop!\" Rabbits run over your feet. \"Settle down, Harp\u2014\u00ad \" Papa is angry. He pours your name over your head like scalding water. The rabbits are angry. The rabbits are crying and dying, the clubs coming down, down, down. \"If you ain't gonna help, stay clear of us, boy\u2014\u00ad \" You are six today. Your family will have a party after supper. The cake was cooling when you left for town. You feel sick thinking about it. Cherries come slopping out of the rabbits. Gray skins are splitting, slipping under bootheels and wooden bats. Papa shows you what to target: the skulls and the spines of the screaming jacks. It's the fastest way to stop their screaming. There is another way, a voice cries out inside you. Smash it flat. You watch Papa click into his rhythm and begin to kill alongside the rest of the men.",
      "You meet your baby sister's gaze through the fan of her clean fingers. Lada is sitting on your mother's lap. Three girls you know are watching from outside the fence. The girls are allowed to squeal and shield their faces. You wish you were a girl with them. Down, down, down come the clubs and the planks. Your stomach bulges and flattens. You are screaming with the rabbits. Your birthday wish is to get to the end of this sound. Quiet comes at last. The men's arms rest against their sides like tools in a shed. Women are hanging the dead jacks to dry by their long ears. Every twitching rabbit's foot has stilled. Inside of you, the screaming continues. It goes on and on and on. Papa finds you where you have hidden your eyes behind your hands, your tears inside your palms. \"We can't let the jacks overrun the whole prairie. No one likes it, Son.\" This is a lie. Many had liked it. You shut your eyes along with the dead rabbits, because you did not want to see whose faces were smiling.",
      "\"Here,\" says Papa. \"One is still living. You cannot be softhearted, Harp.\"",
      "Your father puts the club in your hands. And after that, you are always afraid.",

      "An Oprah's Book Club pick, Eric Puchner's \"Dream State\" (Doubleday) is a sweeping saga that explores how choices \u2013 big and small \u2013 shape lives and families for decades.",
      "It starts, very charmingly, with the planning for a wedding at a summer house in Montana. Cece is about to marry Charlie, but then Charlie's best friend shows up, and their plans veer off in ways nobody expects.",
      "Read an excerpt below.",
      "\"Dream State\" by Eric Puchner",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "By the time it occurred to Cece that her mother was dying, she was dead. Even then, it seemed like possibly a mistake, like there was no way in hell her mother would have agreed to it. Cece hunched through the memorial service, unable to speak or move or smile. People hugged her, one after another, a series of random blows. At the national cemetery, she stood on the perfect lawn rolling down to a smudge of ocean in the distance, the tombstones a run of dominoes waiting to be tipped, feeling like she'd been beamed to an alien planet. She could not fathom her own fingers. It was a military burial, with guards of honor and a flag-folding ceremony and a lone bugler playing \"Taps.\" The long, sorrowful notes floated over the cemetery, turning everything into the tragic plot point in a movie: the gravesites and their wilting flowers, the guards of honor frozen like statues, the hole in the ground where her mother would be lowered and transformed into a skeleton. Such was the grace and beauty of the bugler's playing that Cece, returning to Earth for a moment, couldn't help being moved. It seemed to give form to the precious void inside her. Then the bugler stopped in midnote, as if he'd forgotten what song he was performing. He turned red with embarrassment. Finally, he took the bugle from his lips and shook it, and it played the lost note for a second, as if possessed by a ghost. It wasn't a real instrument at all, Cece realized, but a stereo made to look like one. The thing had run out of charge. A couple of the mourners giggled. Cece glanced behind her, startled. Later, in the middle of the eulogy, the bugle began playing again from its case.",
      "Strangeness and sorrow. Strangeness and sorrow. Cece went back to school, amazed that her life still existed.\u00a0My mother is dead,\u00a0she told herself, over and over, not immune to its dramatic value. It was precisely this sense of being in a play or a movie that made her death feel temporary. At any minute the play would end and her mother would be alive again, taking her to the beach like she used to every weekend; Cece would massage her head while they watched stupid shows together, dizzy with the smell of sweat and jojoba oil. (That smell! When Cece was little, she used to suck on her mother's hair, put strands of it in her mouth.) Cece missed her so much it howled through her like a wind. She stopped eating. On the soccer field she stood there shivering, staring at the grass. Her friends, understanding at first, eventually gave up on her, stopped asking her to parties and the Galleria, to bonfires at the beach. When her father wasn't home, Cece sometimes sneaked into his room and stripped the mattress, gazing at the orphaned sweat stain, pale as a shadow, where her mother used to sleep.",
      "Once, the phone rang and Cece picked it up: her mother's hair salon asking to confirm an appointment. \"She died,\" Cece said, perhaps too softly to be heard, because the woman on the phone said, \"I believe so, yes. A coloring. Missed the last one, so wanted to confirm.\" The next day, Cece drove to the hair salon and showed up for the appointment. The hairdresser didn't question who she was. He led her to a chair, then grabbed a book of color swatches and handed it to her. Cece flipped through the book\u2014a rainbow of tiny rabbit's feet\u2014and found one that matched her mother's hair. She smelled the swatch, but of course it smelled like nothing. She cried and cried, for the first time since the funeral. The hairdresser, perhaps used to such things, ignored her. He painted and foiled Cece's hair, then rinsed it out and revealed the hideous product of her grief.",

      "I have always longed to be known, truly known, by another human being. Sometimes we live for years with yearnings that we cannot name. Until a crack appears in the sky and widens and reveals us to ourselves, as the pandemic did, because it was during lockdown that I began to sift through my life and give names to things long unnamed. I vowed at first to make the most of this collective sequestering: if I had no choice but to stay indoors, then I would oil my thinning edges every day, drink eight tall glasses of water, jog on the treadmill, sleep long, luxurious hours, and pat rich serums on my skin. But, only days in, I was spiralling in a bottomless well. Words and warnings swirled and spun, and I felt as if all human progress was swiftly reversing to an ancient stage of confusion: don't touch your face; wash your hands; don't go outside; spray disinfectant; wash your hands; don't go outside; don't touch your face. Did washing my face count as touching? I always used a face towel, but one morning my palm grazed my cheek and I froze, the tap water still running. I was alone in my house in Maryland, in suburban silence, the eerie roads bordered by trees that themselves seemed stilled. No cars drove past. I looked out and saw a herd of deer striding across the clearing of my front yard. About ten deer, or maybe fifteen, nothing like the lone deer I would see from time to time chewing shyly in the grass. I felt frightened of them, their unusual boldness, as though my world was about to be overrun not just by deer but by other lurking creatures I could not imagine. My joints throbbed, and the muscles of my back, and the sides of my neck, as if my body knew too well that we are not made to live like this.",
      "In this new suspended life, I one day found a gray hair on my head. It appeared overnight, near my temple, tightly coiled, and in the bathroom mirror I first thought it was a piece of lint. A single gray hair with a slight sheen to it. I unfurled it to its full length, let it go, and then unfurled it again. I didn't pull it out. I thought: I'm growing old. I'm growing old and the world has changed and I have never been truly known. A rush of raw melancholy brought tears to my eyes. This is all there is, this fragile breathing in and out. Where have all the years gone, and have I made the most of life? But what is the final measure for making the most of life, and how would I know if I have?",

    "story": [
      "New Mexico officials have announced the cause of death for actor\u00a0Gene Hackman\u00a0and his wife Betsy Arakawa, a week after they were found dead\u00a0at their home in Santa Fe. Hackman died of heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor, and Arakawa died several days before him of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Chief Medical Investigator Dr. Heather Jarrell said Friday.",
      "Investigators had been trying to determine a cause of death for the couple since they died in their home last month.",
      "How did Gene Hackman die?",
      "Hackman, 95, and Arakawa, 65, were found dead in their home in a gated community in Santa Fe on Feb. 26, but appear to have died earlier in the month.",
      "Hackman likely died around Feb. 18, when the last activity was detected on his pacemaker, Jarrell said during a Friday news conference.",
      "An autopsy determined that Hackman died of heart disease and also suffered from advanced Alzheimer's. He tested negative for hantavirus.",
      "\"He was in a very poor state of health,\" Jarrell said. \"He had significant heart disease, and I think ultimately that is what resulted in his death.\"",
      "Arakawa likely died first, with Feb. 11 being the last time that she was known to be alive, Jarrell said. People with hantavirus infections can initially feel flu-like symptoms for roughly three to six days and then start to have fluid in and around their lungs.",
      "\"At that point, a person can die very quickly, within 24-48 hours, roughly speaking, without medical treatment,\" Jarrell said. \"It's not uncommon to find someone down on the floor as part of a terminal collapse, so to speak, and that may very well have been what happened.\"",
      "Asked if Hackman was aware of his wife's passing, Jarrell said: \"That question's difficult to answer, but I can tell you that he was in an advanced state of Alzheimer's and it's quite possible that he was not aware that she was deceased.\"",
      "There was no food in Hackman's stomach, meaning he had not eaten recently before he died, Jarrell said. She didn't find evidence of dehydration.",
      "Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said there was no indication of a caretaker at the home.",
      "What is hantavirus?",
      "Hantaviruses are found worldwide, carried by rodents and transmitted from animals to humans, Dr. Erin Phipps, the state public health veterinarian with the New Mexico Health Department, told reporters Friday. The hantavirus found in New Mexico is found throughout the state, primarily in deer mice but in other rodents too, Phipps said.",
      "The hantavirus strain in the Southwest has a mortality rate of about 38%-50%, Jarrell said. Hantavirus can be contracted from exposure to excrement from a mouse species that carries the virus.",
      "\"Avoiding contact with or breathing in aerosolized rodent urine or feces, especially in a poorly ventilated area, is key,\" Phipps said.",
      "The various strains in the U.S. aren't transmissible from person to person.",
      "A hantavirus infection is characterized by flu-like symptoms, including fever, muscle aches, cough and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea that can progress to shortness of breath and heart or lung failure, Jarrell said.",
      "The illness is rare, with the state Health Department reporting there were only seven confirmed cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in New Mexico in 2024. In the last 50 years, officials have identified 136 infections in New Mexico residents, including five in Santa Fe County.",
      "\"This is a serious disease \u2014 42% of these infections here in New Mexico were fatal,\" Phipps said. Most infections occur around the home or workplace, she said.",
      "State health investigators conducted a risk assessment of the couple's property Wednesday, Phipps said. While the main residence itself was deemed a low risk for hantavirus exposure, signs of rodent entry were found on other structures on the property, she said.",
      "Investigation into Hackman's and Arakawa's deaths",
      "Mendoza said last Friday there were no apparent signs of foul play in the deaths. The initial findings from the autopsies found no external trauma on either of the bodies, Mendoza said.",
      "Hackman's body was found in a mudroom near the kitchen with a cane and sunglasses nearby, according to an affidavit for a search warrant.",
      "The sheriff's office found medication for blood pressure and thyroid issues as well as Tylenol during a search of the home, according to an inventory of the search filed in court. Some pills were scattered on a bathroom countertop near where Arakawa's body was found, according to the affidavit. Mendoza wouldn't say who was prescribed the medication, citing patient privacy laws.",
      "One of the couple's three dogs also was found dead in a crate near Arakawa, while their two other dogs were found alive. Phipps said the dog may have died from dehydration or starvation. Dogs don't get sick from hantavirus, she said.",
      "Investigators also collected two cellphones from the home and a monthly planner, Mendoza said. No surveillance cameras had been found at the home, according to the sheriff.",
      "\"I think everybody here understands that they were very private individuals and a very private family,\" Mendoza said.",
      "The sheriff's office said Tuesday that the company that provides natural gas service for the home made no significant findings after looking for gas leaks and carbon monoxide, the colorless, odorless gas that can be fatal by depriving people from getting enough oxygen. Mendoza said last Friday that both bodies tested negative for carbon monoxide.",
      "Hackman, who won Oscars for his performances in 1971's \"The French Connection\" and the 1992 Western \"Unforgiven,\" was honored at Sunday's Academy Awards in Los Angeles.",
      "\"He received two Oscars, but more importantly, he won the hearts of film lovers all over the world,\" actor Morgan Freeman said of Hackman at the awards ceremony. \"Gene always said, 'I don't think about legacy. I just hope people remember me as someone who tried to do good work.' So I think I speak for us all when I say, Gene, you'll be remembered for that and for so much more.\"",

      "Over a week after they were found, investigators said Arakawa, 65, likely died days before Hackman, 95,\u00a0and they had different causes of death.",
      "Here's what we know from officials.",
      "How did Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa die?",
      "Hackman died of heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributory factor, New Mexico's chief medical investigator, Dr. Heather Jarrell, said at a news conference on Friday, March 7.",
      "\"He had very extensive heart disease,\" she said.",
      "Arakawa's cause of death was hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a severe respiratory illness, Jarrell said. Hantavirus is spread mainly by rodents, and infections are rare, but Jarrell noted the strain in the Southwest has a high mortality rate of about 38-50%.",
      "It does not spread from person to person, and Hackman tested negative for hantavirus, Jarrell said.",
      "Both Hackman and Arakawa tested negative for carbon monoxide poisoning. They also tested negative for COVID-19, the flu and other common respiratory viruses, Jarrell said.",
      "How long had Hackman and Arakawa been dead?",
      "\"There is no reliable scientific method to accurately determine the exact time or date of death,\" Jarrell said.",
      "But with data from Hackman's pacemaker, which showed the last record of heart activity on Feb. 18, \"it is reasonable to conclude that Mr. Hackman probably died around Feb. 18,\" she said.",
      "Arakawa's last known communication and activity was on Feb. 11, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said. She had an email conversation with a massage therapist and was seen at a local grocery store, CVS and pet food store before returning to her home, he said.",
      "Based on that information, Jarrell said it is \"reasonable to conclude\" Arakawa died before Hackman, but the exact day was not known.",
      "A search warrant issued on Feb. 26, the day Arakawa and Hackman's bodies were found, states the two showed signs of decomposition, bloating in the face and mummification of hands and feet.\u00a0Mummification preserves a body after death and can happen naturally when the skin dries out, according to the National Library of Medicine.",
      "It is unclear what Hackman knew during the time between Arakawa's death and his own. He showed evidence of advanced Alzheimer's disease, Jarrell said.",
      "Where were Hackman and Arakawa found?",
      "Hackman and Arakawa were found dead in their home outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico, according to deputies who responded to the house at about 1:45 p.m. local time on Feb. 26.",
      "Hackman was found in what is believed to be the home's mudroom. It appeared he had fallen suddenly, the search warrant says. He was found wearing sweatpants, a long-sleeve T-shirt and slippers.",
      "Arakawa was found in a bathroom near the front door of the home, according to the warrant. The door to the bathroom was opened.",
      "Arakawa was on the ground, wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt. An opened orange prescription bottle and scattered pills were seen on a countertop near Arakawa, the warrant says.",
      "The pills were a thyroid medication that had been taken as prescribed, Jarrell said. They were not believed to have contributed to Arakawa's death.",
      "Hackman and Arakawa's dog also found dead",
      "One of Hackman and Arakawa's dogs was found dead in a closet of the bathroom where Arakawa's body was discovered, the warrant says. Mendoza said the dog, named Zinna, was in a kennel or crate.",
      "As of March 7, investigators were awaiting autopsy results for Zinna. Arakawa had picked Zinna up from a veterinary hospital on Feb. 9 after a procedure, Mendoza said.",
      "Dogs do not get sick from hantavirus, New Mexico State Veterinarian Erin Phipps said at the March 7 news conference.",
      "There were two other dogs found alive on the property when deputies arrived, the warrant says.",
      "How did Arakawa get hantavirus?",
      "Hantaviruses are primarily carried by rodents. Humans can become infected after exposure to urine, droppings or saliva from an infected rodent.",
      "It was not immediately clear exactly how or when Arakawa was infected.",
      "Her and Hackman's home had a low risk of exposure, \"similar to other well-maintained houses in New Mexico,\" Phipps said, but added there were signs of rodent entry in other structures on their property.",
      "Hantavirus initially presents with flu-like symptoms and can progress to shortness of breath. \"At that point, a person can die very quickly, within 24 to 48 hours roughly speaking, without medical treatment,\" Jarrell said.",
      "There was no known communication from Arakawa indicating she was feeling ill, Mendoza said.",
      "No signs of a carbon monoxide leak",
      "There were no obvious signs of a gas leak at the home, deputies said.",
      "Santa Fe Fire Department personnel and the New Mexico Gas Company conducted testing at the scene and did not find evidence of a carbon monoxide leak or problems with the pipes, according to the search warrant.",
      "The gas company issued five \"red tags,\" the sheriff's office said in an update on March 4. One was for \"a minuscule leak,\" or 0.33% gas in the air, at a stove burner, which is not a lethal amount, the office said. The other tags were for violations unrelated to gas leaks or carbon monoxide.",
      "Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that kills hundreds of people each year.",
      "No signs of foul play",
      "Deputies found the door to Hackman and Arakawa's home \"unsecured and opened,\" the warrant says. They were initially called to the home after someone who arrived to do maintenance did not receive an answer and became concerned, the sheriff's office said.",
      "There were no signs of forced entry or that the house had been rummaged through, deputies said.",
      "What movies was Gene Hackman in?",
      "Hackman's career spanned multiple decades in which he starred in dozens of films.",
      "Some of his notable roles included Detective \"Popeye\" Doyle in \"The French Connection\" (1971), a surveillance expert who suspects a murder in \"The Conversation\" (1974) and a sheriff in Clint Eastwood's \"Unforgiven\" (1992).",
      "He won Academy Awards for best actor in a leading role in 1972 for his performance in \"The French Connection\" and best actor in a supporting role in 1993 for his role in \"Unforgiven.\"",
      "Hackman retired from the screen in 2004.",

      "Gene Hackman tribute at the Oscars",
      "The\u00a0Oscars\u00a0paid tribute to Hackman at the awards show on March 2.",

      "\"Like everyone who ever shared a scene with him, I learned he was a generous performer and a man whose gifts elevated everyone's work,\" Freeman said.",
      "Who was Betsy Arakawa?",
      "Arakawa, who was raised in Honolulu, was a concert pianist and co-founder of a home furnishing business, according to the Associated Press.",
      "When she was 11, she performed at the Honolulu International Center Concert Hall and later in life, she played with the Honolulu Symphony Orchestra, the AP reported.",

    "story": [
      "The top communications official under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. abruptly resigned last week, just two weeks after being sworn in to be the department's assistant secretary for public affairs.",
      "The resignation of Thomas Corry, a Trump administration appointee, was first reported by Politico. Corry did not respond to multiple requests from CBS News for comment.",
      "Corry's departure came just days after Kennedy faced criticism for how he handled a question about the growing measles outbreak in Texas at a White House Cabinet meeting, calling it \"not unusual\" and misstating the number of deaths reported in the state.",
      "A former HHS official and a person familiar with Corry's thinking said that he had voiced disappointment with how Kennedy handled the question. It was a missed opportunity, making headlines for appearing indifferent to the deadly outbreak.",
      "But Corry's frustrations extended beyond that, as his office triaged a deluge of inquiries on agency actions ranging from canceled vaccines meetings to stalled research funding.",
      "Unlike previous officials in the role, who usually closely work with the secretary, Corry had been cut off from Kennedy, one former HHS official said. Federal officials said they were unsure if Corry had the trust of Kennedy or his inner circle, undermining his authority.",
      "In an interview with Fox News that aired Tuesday, Kennedy claimed he never met Corry and did not know much about his former top spokesperson.",
      "\"I think that individual had personnel problems and was about to be terminated, and so they may have made up a story to explain their termination, and then, you know, quit before he got that news,\" Kennedy said.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon did not comment, when asked about Kennedy's remarks. Instead, Nixon re-sent a previous statement attributed to principal deputy chief of staff Stefanie Spear about Kennedy making measles a \"top priority\" for his team.",
      "Spear is one of a handful of aides now at HHS to have worked for Kennedy during his longshot presidential campaign. Many others were hired from the ranks of Trump supporters and alumni of other federal agencies.",
      "This includes Nixon, who previously handled press for Trump's campaign. Nixon had reported to Corry alongside Michael Brady, a former top Army public affairs official.",
      "Corry previously served as a communications official for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the COVID-19 pandemic, under the first Trump administration.",
      "Multiple current CMS officials praised Corry as highly competent, trusted and well-liked among career federal health officials, as well as by Trump aides.",
      "Spear, who also has the title of a senior counselor to Kennedy, has been tightly controlling communications across the department, multiple officials said.",
      "Before Kennedy's confirmation, Spear ordered the unprecedented department-wide communications \"pause\" that froze the release of information across HHS.",
      "Other factors have contributed to challenges within the communications shop, including a shortfall in staffing, a former HHS official said.",
      "During the Biden administration, when top-ranking civil servants within the communications office retired in recent years, they were replaced by political appointees, not career executives who would stay on after the White House changed hands.",
      "That complicated the transition and left the incoming Trump administration with a deficit of institutional knowledge.",

      "Other factors driving spread that were cited by PAHO include increased movement of people around the Americas and an uptick in dengue, a mosquito-borne viral infection that can mask the spread of measles due to similar symptoms.",
      "What is measles elimination?",
      "The U.S. achieved measles elimination in 2000, after documenting a year of no endemic spread of the virus. WHO officials declared North and South America free of measles in 2016, making the Americas the first region to reach this milestone in the world.",
      "Health officials define \"measles elimination\" as proof of no endemic spread of the highly contagious virus within an area for at least 12 months. A continuous chain of transmission persisting for at least a year would reverse that goal.",
      "While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention usually reports hundreds of measles cases every year around the U.S., many are from short-lived outbreaks linked to unvaccinated young children who were recently outside the U.S.",
      "The last large outbreak of the virus in the U.S. was in Illinois last year. It was largely confined to migrant shelters in Chicago.",

      "Harrison's plasma contained a rare antibody known as anti-D. It's used to make injections that protect unborn babies from hemolytic disease of the newborn, in which a pregnant woman's immune system attacks her fetus' red blood cells. The disease is most common when a woman has an Rh-negative blood type and her baby's is Rh-positive.",
      "Australia has only 200 anti-D donors. They help 45,000 mothers and their babies annually.",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 16:47:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Faced with the need to cut carbon emissions, and an increasing energy demand to power AI, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon are investing in nuclear, from restarting Three Mile Island, to creating \"small modular reactors.\"",
    "story": [
      "It might have seemed like one of the weirder headlines of 2024: Microsoft is paying $1.6 billion to restart Three Mile Island. That's the nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania whose reactor #2 had a partial meltdown in 1979. There were no injuries, and nobody died, but it set the nuclear industry back years. Only two new plants have been started since that accident.",
      "\"This is hallowed ground in the nuclear industry,\" said Joe Dominguez, the CEO of Constellation Energy, which owns about half of America's 54 nuclear plants (including Three Mile Island). \"This is a place where we learned and got better.\"",
      "He says that, as a result of the 1979 accident, there have been thousands of changes in protocols and procedures regarding nuclear power. \"The thing that people forget is that there was another reactor at the site,\" he said. \"That site, that reactor, continued to operate until 2019, when it was closed for economic reasons. Cheap natural gas, low demand, subsidization of different technologies in the business, [and] no policy supporting nuclear caused plants to start retiring.\"",
      "So, what is Microsoft's interest?",
      "All  of the Big Tech companies have ambitious goals to fight the climate  crisis. That includes Google and Microsoft, which have each  pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions. They were making progress, too; each has invested billions in wind and solar energy.",
      "And then, then artificial intelligence came along. AI data centers require huge amounts of electricity. \u00a0Big Tech realized that they wouldn't make their emissions goals without taking power into their own hands.",
      "Dominguez said, \"Microsoft is going to enjoy the benefit of the reliable, clean energy for 20 years.\"",
      "He says reopening the existing Three Mile Island facility would be quicker and less expensive than constructing a brand-new nuclear plant. \"At least 10 times cheaper than building a new plant,\" he said. \"And we think we could get it going in about three years, versus the last plant that was built, [which] took almost 10 years.\"",
      "But if you're a tech company, what do you do if you don't have a recently-retired nuclear plant handy? You develop new ones. Only weeks after Microsoft's announcement, both Amazon and Google announced major investments in nuclear power.",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google is supplementing its already enormous green energy investments with a new kind of nuclear, called small modular reactors. \"These are not the nuclear power plants of yesterday, with the very large cooling towers,\" said Michael Terrell, who heads Google's decarbonization efforts. \"These are much smaller facilities. But because they're modular, you can stack them together to make bigger power plants.",
      "He anticipates the first advanced nuclear reactor will be online by 2030. \"And we're not going to do just one reactor, but we hope to buy from what will be a series of reactors that follow that,\" Terrell said.",
      "Nuclear power still isn't perfect; it still produces waste that has to be safely stored. But unlike solar and wind, nuclear power is always on, which is essential to those AI data centers.",
      "So, Google is funding a company called Kairos Power to design and build this new generation of reactors. Kairos is building three small demonstration plants in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on the very spot where uranium was processed for the first atomic bomb.",
      "CEO Mike Laufer says that his reactors don't use fuel rods; they use fuel pebbles, about the size of golf balls \u2013 mostly graphite, with tiny kernels of uranium. And each pebble has as much power capacity as four tons of coal.",
      "And how much carbon dioxide emissions, compared to coal? \"Zero,\" Laufer said.",
      "The Kairos reactors also run at lower power and lower pressure than traditional reactors, which means lower risk.",
      "Well, this all sounds great! But what's the catch?",
      "\"There's only one problem with small modular reactors: They don't really exist,\" said George Washington University professor Sharon Squassoni, who spent 15 years researching nuclear safety for the government. She thinks Big Tech companies might be in over their heads. \"I think they're going to find out pretty quickly that it takes way too long and it's way too expensive,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see just how strong their commitments are to clean energy futures.\"",
      "\"So, you're saying they may have to turn to burning stuff [for power]?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure they will,\" Squassoni replied.",
      "\"Do you think there's a little bit of tech-bro overconfidence therein?\"",
      "\"Oh, completely, completely!\" she laughed.",
      "Kairos' Mike Laufer admitted, \"Yes, it's really hard. I will totally agree with anyone. But we're doing it at smaller scale to start, and then building on that in the future.\"",
      "Joe Dominguez's team is getting Three Mile Island ready for Microsoft, including renaming the plant the Crane Clean Energy Center. And if AI is igniting a renaissance in American nuclear, he says: full steam ahead.",
      "I asked, \"Why do all new plants take so much longer and cost so much more than projected?\"",
      "\"Honest answer? We don't build enough of them,\" Dominguez said. \"You don't want to build a unique design; you want to do kind of a cookie-cutter, one-after-another design.\"",
      "\"Is it well understood in government and the industry that if you start doing the same design over and over, we can get there faster and cheaper?\"",
      "\"It's probably the best understood idea,\" Dominguez said. \"It's understood by both Republicans and Democrats, which is a hard thing to say about anything! Everybody understands that if you build a common design, you build a bunch of them.\"",
      "\"So, you think we'll get there?\"",
      "\"I do.\"",
      "Google's Michael Terrell agrees, and believes his company will make its zero-carbon goal by 2030. \"It is an incredibly ambitious goal: 24/7 carbon-free energy everywhere we operate every way around the world,\" he said. \"But it's something we're working very hard to achieve, and we hope to get there.\"",

    "summary": "The Social Security Administration said it will restart a policy that had caused financial distress for some beneficiaries.",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration (SSA) said it is reinstating a plan to recover 100% of overpayments to beneficiaries, a policy the agency abandoned last year after an outcry over cases in which the practice led some Americans to receive shock bills amounting to thousands of dollars.",
      "In a statement, SSA said late Friday that it will increase the default overpayment withholding rate for Social Security recipients to 100% of a person's monthly benefit, the same level that it had in place before last year's reform. The agency is required by law to claw back overpaid benefits.",
      "Because of public backlash over the 100% recovery policy, the agency last year had capped\u00a0the withholding rate for someone who had been overpaid at 10% of the person's monthly benefit. On Friday, the SSA said it will start claiming 100% of benefit checks to cover new cases of overpayments, while the withholding rate for people with overpayments before March 27 will remain at 10%, as will the rate for overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income seniors and disabled Americans.",
      "\"People who are overpaid after March 27 will automatically be placed in full recovery at a rate of 100% of the Social Security payment,\" the agency said.",
      "The 100% clawback policy had sparked an outcry after instances in which beneficiaries were hit with surprise bills that demanded repayment within 30 days. In some cases, the bills were for tens of thousands of dollars. If beneficiaries were unable to immediately pay the bill, the agency could dock their entire monthly Social Security payment, leaving some people financially destitute, as reported by \"60 Minutes,\"\u00a0KFF Health News\u00a0and other media outlets,",
      "In many cases, the overpayments were the fault of SSA. A\u00a02022 report\u00a0by the agency's inspector general found that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"",
      "In the agency's new statement, SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek said it is the agency's \"duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding.\"",
      "He added, \"We have the significant responsibility to be good stewards of the trust funds for the American people.\"",
      "Raising the clawback rate to 100% from its current 10% will increase the amount of recovered funds by $7 billion over the next decade, the agency said. SSA pays out about $1.6 trillion in benefits each year.",
      "The revised policy will lead to financial hardships for many people faced with Social Security overpayments, according to the National Committee to Protect Social Security & Medicare. \"This action, ostensibly taken to cut costs at SSA, needlessly punishes beneficiaries who receive overpayment notices \u2014 usually through no fault of their own,\" a spokesperson for the advocacy group said in a statement. \"Many overpayments are the result of errors on SSA's part.\"",

      "The unemployment rate last month was 4.1%, slightly higher than the 4% rate forecast by economists polled by FactSet.",
      "Hiring has eased since December's blowout number of 323,000 new jobs, but the labor market has remained resilient at the start of 2025, experts say.",
      "What it means",
      "The February job figures suggest the labor market \"is showing signs of weakness with hiring across sectors,\" said Joe Gaffoglio, CEO of Mutual Of America Capital Management, in an email.",
      "He added, \"Deteriorating indicators like hiring intentions, new job listings and temporary staffing suggest a potential slowdown in employment growth.\"",
      "Notably, the widespread, ongoing cuts across the government sector also aren't reflected in today's report, according to Andy Stettner, an unemployment insurance expert at The Century Foundation. That's because unemployment claims for federal workers can take several weeks to appear in the official government data, he noted.",
      "Although the full impact of those cuts aren't yet visible in the data, federal employment declined by 10,000 last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday. The U.S. has more than 2 million federal workers.",
      "Layoffs across the U.S.\u00a0spiked last month to their highest levels since 2020, led by firings of federal workers ordered by Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency,\u00a0or DOGE,\u00a0 outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said on Thursday.",
      "Employers cut more than 172,000 jobs last month, a 245% increase from January and double the number announced during the same month a year ago, the company said. That marks the highest monthly number of layoffs since July 2020, when nearly 263,000 cuts were announced, the firm added.",
      "What the experts say",
      "The slightly weaker-than-expected February jobs report could prompt the Federal Reserve to resume cutting its benchmark rate, noted Lindsay Rosner, head of multi sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "The Fed in January hit the brakes on interest rate cuts, citing persistent inflation. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled the central bank is closely watching the labor market for signs of weakness, which could prompt additional rate cuts.",
      "The Fed will receive one more piece of major economic data ahead of its next rate decision meeting, scheduled for March 19, with the Consumer Price Index set to be released on March 12. The CPI likely rose 2.9% last month, slightly easing from January's 3% pace, according to FactSet.",
      "President Trump's tariffs are expected to boost prices for consumers, although they aren't likely to show up in inflation data for several months as Mr. Trump on Thursday paused 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada until early April.",
      "\"Overall, this report is a sigh of relief for the Fed as they can continue to sit on the sidelines for the next couple meetings as they assess the potential inflation impacts resulting from U.S. tariff policy over the coming months,\" said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, in an email.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 17:05:32 -0500",
    "summary": "Powell says the Fed is in no hurry to change course, citing \"uncertainty\" over the impact of the Trump administration economic policies",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that the central bank can remain patient in adjusting its benchmark interest rate, citing uncertainty around the potential impact of President Trump's economic policies.",
      "Powell said the Trump administration is making policy changes in several areas, including trade, taxes, government spending, immigration and regulation, and added that the \"net effect\" of those changes are what will matter for the economy and the Fed's interest rate policies.",
      "\"While there have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high,\" Powell said at a conference in New York. \"As we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\"",
      "Most economists say that Trump's plans to slap tariffs on a wide array of imports, including 25% duties on goods from Canada and Mexico that he partially delayed Thursday, will push up prices and slow growth. But many also expect that tax cuts and deregulation could boost the economy.",
      "Powell's comments pushed some traders to pare back their forecasts for how many interest rate cuts the Fed may deliver this year. They had been banking on at least three following a stream of weaker-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy. But Powell reiterated the Fed is likely on hold for a while. That sent Treasury yields higher in the bond market.",
      "Rate reductions could help bring down borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, and business loans.",
      "President Trump in January pressed the Fed to ease borrowing costs, saying in a speech at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland that he planned to \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\"",
      "Inflation expectations are key",
      "In a question and answer session, Powell acknowledged that typically tariffs would cause a \"one-time\" price increase, rather than persistent inflation, and the Fed could ignore such a temporary effect. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday made a similar argument: \"We could get a one-time price adjustment,\" Bessent said, before adding, \"I'm not worried about inflation.\"",
      "Yet Powell also said there were other considerations the Fed has to take into account when deciding whether to keep its rate unchanged, or even raise rates. For example, Powell suggested tariffs might have more than just a one-time impact \"if it turns into a series\" of tariff hikes, or \"if the increases are larger, that would matter.\"",
      "\"What really does matter is what is happening with long-term inflation expectations,\" Powell added. Powell noted that shorter-term expectations have risen, partly out of concern about tariffs, though longer-term expectations have been stable.",
      "Expectations that prices will rise can worsen inflation if they cause consumers and businesses to change their behavior in anticipation. Some companies might charge more when they expect their own costs to increase.",
      "When Trump imposed tariffs in his last administration, Powell noted, the Fed ended up reducing its key rate, \"because growth weakened so much.\"",
      "Economists with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley this week forecast that inflation is likely to edge up in 2025, citing the potential impact of tariffs and other Trump administration policies.",
      "\"Larger tariffs are also likely to hit GDP harder through their tax-like effect on disposable income and consumer spending and their effect on financial conditions and uncertainty for businesses,\" Goldman analysts wrote in a report.",
      "The cost of food, shelter and other items remains a top economic issue around the U.S., with the\u00a0soaring cost of eggs\u00a0becoming a national talking point. A recent\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0found that 77% of Americans say their incomes aren't keeping up with the pace of inflation.",
      "Powell says economy remains solid",
      "Powell said the economy remains mostly healthy despite \"elevated uncertainty.\" He characterized Friday's jobs report, which showed employers added 151,000 jobs and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1%, as in line with the \"solid\" gains of the past six months.",
      "He also noted that there were signs consumer spending has slowed compared with the healthy gains in the second half of last year, and said surveys of consumers and businesses \"point to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook.\" Further complicating matters, he acknowledged that measures of consumer sentiment \"have not been a good predictor\" of consumer spending in recent years.",
      "The Fed's own beige book, a collection of anecdotes from hundreds of businesses, mentioned uncertainty 47 times in its latest edition released Wednesday, up from just 17 times in January. The Fed publishes the beige book eight times a year.",
      "Powell spoke at a conference organized by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.",
      "President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariff policy and rapid-fire layoffs of government workers has created a spike in uncertainty among businesses and caused a sharp drop in consumer confidence. Many economists have marked down their estimates for the economy's growth to as low as 1% at an annual rate in the first three months of this year, down from 2.3% in last year's final quarter.",
      "Yet as Fed governor Christopher Waller noted Thursday, there are \"good news\" cuts and \"bad news\" cuts. \"Bad news\" cuts occur if the Fed reduces rates out of concern that the economy is slowing, while \"good news\" reductions are those that reflect a sense by the Fed that inflation is returning to its target of 2%.",
      "Waller added that he still believes it will be possible for the Fed to engineer \"good news\" rate cuts later this year, though he dismissed the potential for a cut at the Fed's next meeting this month.",
      "After cutting its key rate three times last year to about 4.3%, Powell indicated in January that the Fed would pause any further cuts amid signs that inflation has remained stuck above its target. The central bank's preferred inflation gauge shows that prices rose 2.5% in January compared with a year ago. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.6%, the smallest increase since June.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 15:52:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Experts say you could save thousands of dollars by buying a car now, versus later in 2025 if tariffs are enacted.",
    "story": [
      "Buying a car can be a fraught financial decision even in the best of times. Now, car shoppers are facing the added pressure of deciphering U.S. tariff policy.",
      "On Wednesday, President Trump issued a one-month delay for U.S. automakers on tariffs placed on imports from Canada and Mexico, trading partners that provide many of the car makers' vehicle parts and components. If the 25% levies are enacted, auto manufacturers will face higher costs and are likely to\u00a0pass on some of those price hikes to consumers, industry players say.",
      "The upshot, according to experts, is that consumers who are thinking of buying a car in the next year may want to consider buying a car sooner in 2025 rather than later. If the tariffs eventually take effect, car prices could rise by between $2,000 and $12,200 for some models, according to a recent estimate from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it, will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them,\" AEG CEO Patrick Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The timing of the tariffs remain uncertain, and it's possible that Mr. Trump could further delay the import duties on Canada and Mexico, while the U.S. could also shelve the trade measures if the sides reach agreement. Even if the tariffs are ultimately deployed in April, it's unclear how long they might remain in place, which adds to the uncertainty surrounding the import duties, according to Morningstar equity strategist David Whiston.",
      "Spreading the costs",
      "While certain car models source a greater share of their components from Canada and Mexico than others, automakers are expected to spread any added costs they incur across their vehicle lineups.",
      "\"If the tariffs are here, and permanent, by the time we get to summer we'd expect to see higher prices everywhere,\" Tyson Jominy, vice president of analytics at J.D. Power, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That means even U.S.-sourced and assembled vehicles with components that aren't subject to tariffs could see moderate price hikes.",
      "\"If we are talking about 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, prices will go up, and we are expecting most automakers to peanut-butter spread the impact across their entire portfolio, even if the vehicle is built in the U.S.,\" Jominy explained. \"The reality is that every automaker, regardless of where they final assemble, is likely to be affected if these parts tariffs go into effect.\"",
      "Automakers are likely to be strategic about how they implement price hikes in order to mitigate the effect on sales, experts say.",
      "\"Automakers will smooth costs out across their vehicle lineups,\" Edmunds head of insights Jessica Caldwell told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They won't increase one model's price by 40%. They'll figure out ways to spread out the costs in a way that doesn't harm profitability as much, and doesn't kill sales at the same time.\"",
      "When could car prices rise?",
      "Although vehicle prices wouldn't skyrocket overnight if the Canada and Mexico tariffs kick in, they could start to rise by summer, industry analysts say. That means car buyers should seriously consider starting their search now.",
      "Manufacturers with more inventory in stock could push off price hikes for some time, whereas those that are running low could be forced to incorporate them into sales prices earlier. Jominy said the range could be a few weeks to \"many months\" from the time tariffs take effect.",
      "\"If you think you'll need a car within the next several months, you should probably get into the market sooner rather than later,\" Jominy said.",
      "That doesn't mean buying on impulse, and experts urge consumers to do their homework before signing on the dotted line for what is, after all, a major financial decision for most people.",
      "\"But if you're planning to be in market the first half of year, it probably makes sense to speed up what you can and make sure you're ready to go,\" he said.",
      "What about used cars?",
      "When new vehicle prices rise, some buyers turn to the used car market, which in turn can drive up costs in that segment.",
      "\"If something comes to pass on tariffs, we'd expected higher prices on both new and used vehicles,\" Jominy said.",
      "Demand for cars \u2014 and other products impacted by tariffs \u2014 may be pulled forward, experts say. \"Because we don't know what's doing to happen, I would be buying everything that I needed that's an appliance that could have content coming from Canada or Mexico,\" Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's a little bit like eating your lunch at recess. You get the same amount of food \u2014 you just get it earlier,\" he added.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs more than once already, it's unclear if and when auto tariffs will hit. But Robert Handfield, professor of supply chain management at North Carolina State University, said for the risk-averse, buying an automobile now versus later in the year is a wise move.",
      "\"He postponed the tariffs for a month to give automakers a little breathing room,\" he said. \"I think it's a good idea to buy now. You'd be able to get in under the wire and save around $4,000 for a regular sedan or up to $10,000 to $12,000 for a truck, which are significant savings.\"",
      "Even if the tariffs never come to fruition, consumers wishing to play it safe can't go wrong by making purchases now, according to Edmunds' Caldwell.",
      "\"Some people don't have the finances to get it wrong. We are stretched thin financially as a country and new vehicle prices aren't cheap, so I can see a lot of people don't want to take the risk,\" she said. \"Sure, it might not happen. But what if it does? Now you're paying how much more that you can't afford.\"",

    "summary": "Union representing TSA workers calls the Department of Homeland Security's decision an \"unprovoked attack.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security said Friday it is ending the collective bargaining agreement with the union representing thousands of frontline workers with the Transportation Security Administration, a decision the TSA union called an \"unprovoked attack.\"",
      "In announcing the decision, DHS criticized the union \u2014 which represents worker responsible for screening airline passengers \u2014 claiming TSA employs more people working full-time on union issues than those \"performing screening functions at 86% of our airports.\"",
      "\"This action will ensure Americans will have more effective and modernized workforces across the nation's transportation networks,\" Homeland Security said in a statement. \"TSA is renewing its commitment to providing a quick and secure travel process for Americans.\"",
      "The decision to end collective bargaining was criticized by the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing flight attendants, and Democratic lawmakers, with both claiming that the action will make flying less safe. DHS's decision comes after the agency last year pushed to boost TSA workers' pay, which has historically lagged that of other government employees.",
      "In May 2024, the TSA administrator at the time, David Pekoske, signed the collective bargaining agreement and credited\u00a0pay increases\u00a0that went into effect in 2023 for helping to improve employee retention and morale, areas where TSA has had challenges.",
      "\"Attempting to negate [TSA workers'] legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2013 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi and ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, in a statement on Friday.",
      "In the announcement, DHS said poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job and that the agreement was hindering the ability of the organization \"to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe\" \u2014 an assessment that faced immediate pushback from Thompson and the union.",
      "The decision is \"terrible for aviation security and everyone who depends on safe travel,\" the Association of Flight Attendants said. The group added, \"This will take us back to the days of security at the lowest price with the highest costs for our country.\"",
      "Impact on 47,000 TSA workers",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the TSA workers, said in a statement that the order would strip collective bargaining rights from roughly 47,000 transportation security officers, or TSOs. Those are people responsible for staffing airports around the country and checking to make sure that hundreds of thousands of passengers a day do not carry any weapons or explosives into the secure areas of airports.",
      "The union said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump's administration were violating the right of staffers to join a union. It also said that the reasons the Republican administration had given for the decision \u2014 specifically the criticisms of union activity \u2014 were \"completely fabricated.\"",
      "Instead, the union said, the decision was retaliation for its wider efforts challenging a range of decisions taken by the Trump administration that have affected federal workers.",
      "AFGE represents roughly 800,000 federal government workers in Washington, D.C., and across the country, and it has been pushing back on many of the administration's actions such as firing probationary employees and cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "\"Our union has been out in front challenging this administration's unlawful actions targeting federal workers, both in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion,\" the union said. \"Now our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action.\"",
      "The decision to end the collective bargaining agreement comes after Trump's administration pushed out Pekoske the day Trump was sworn into office. The TSA does not currently have an administrator or a deputy administrator.",
      "In a note to staff, acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said Noem made the decision to rescind officers' collective bargaining rights to align with the Trump administration's \"vision of maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.\"",
      "\"By removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,\" Stahl wrote. \"This determination is made with the TSO in mind, ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.\"",
      "Stahl said the agency \"will establish alternative procedures\" to address employee concerns and grievances \"in a fair and transparent manner.\"",
      "\"Anti-union talking points\"",
      "Rep. Thompson criticized the Homeland Security press release, saying the department was using \"flat out wrong anti-union talking points.\" He said the real aim was \"diminishing\" the workforce so \"they can transform it in the mold of Project 2025.\"",
      "\"Attempting to negate their legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2014 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" Thompson said. \"Since the Biden Administration provided pay increases and a new collective bargaining contract to the workforce, TSA's attrition rates have plummeted.\"",
      "Project 2025 was the conservative governing blueprint that Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign was not part of his agenda. Project 2025 calls for immediately ending the TSA union and eventually privatizing the entire agency.",
      "The TSA was created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when hijackers smuggled knives and box cutters through security to use as weapons as they commandeered four airplanes and slammed them into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center towers and a Pennsylvania field. The TSA's mandate when it was created in November 2001 was to prevent a similar attack in the future.",
      "Air travel since then has undergone a massive overhaul, with passengers and their luggage going through extensive screening at the airport and passenger information generally uploaded to TSA in advance of travel to facilitate screening. Increasingly, the agency has also been using facial recognition technology to scan passengers at checkpoints, leading to criticism by some members of Congress.",

      "The Department of Education is \"primarily about ensuring who can access the classroom \u2014 it's not so much about what is being talked about in the classroom,\" Peter Granville, a fellow at The Century Foundation and expert on higher education, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "One major misconception held by many Americans is that the Education Department oversees school curriculums and learning, which are instead overseen by states and local school districts. Rather than setting public school curriculums, the Education Department's role is primarily financial, distributing billions in government money to colleges and schools and managing the federal student loan portfolio.",
      "\"Curriculum is handled by states and local governance \u2014 the Department of Education has historically had no role in setting curriculum,\" Granville said. \"The primary role of the Department of Education has been as a grant maker and a loan lender.\"",
      "For instance, the Education Department operates the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which is used by about 17 million students each year to apply for federal loans, grants and scholarships to attend college or vocational programs. The agency also manages $1.5 trillion in student loans, including repayment programs.",
      "Additionally, the Education Department handles Title I funding for low-income schools as well as for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Here's what to know about the agency.",
      "Why does the Trump administration want to close the Education Department?",
      "Mr. Trump is a vocal critic of the Education Department, describing\u00a0it last month as \"a big con job\" and falsely claiming the U.S. is ranked 40th in education internationally but spends the most per pupil. (Spending on K-12 education is largely determined by local school boards and funded by property taxes.)",
      "One of the president's executive orders, signed Jan. 30,\u00a0directed the Education Department to investigate \"school choice programs,\" saying that parents need \"opportunities for students to attend the school that best fits their needs.\" Vouchers that allow families to pay for private K-12 schools are a priority of conservatives, as such programs allow parents to use tax credits to pay for private schools, including Christian-based institutions.",
      "In an email earlier this month to the agency's staff entitled \"Our Department's Final Mission,\" McMahon wrote that her goal is to \"restore the rightful role of state oversight in education and to end the overreach from Washington.\" That echoes language from Project 2025, the blueprint for a conservative administration written by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "\"Federal money is inevitably accompanied by rules and regulations that keep the influx of funds from having much, if any, impact on student outcomes,\" Project 2025's section on the Education Department claims. \"Eventually, policymaking and funding should take place at the state and local level, closest to the affected families.\"",
      "Can Mr. Trump abolish the Education Department?",
      "Complete elimination of the Education Department would need congressional approval and 60 votes in the Senate, which is unlikely given the current makeup.",
      "However, the Trump administration could make changes to the agency, such as by cutting staff, without closing the entire department. The Trump administration is currently making massive employment cuts at several other federal agencies, such as the Social Security Administration and Veterans Affairs Department, describing the efforts as a way to reduce federal waste.",
      "The Trump administration could change some of the department's oversight duties, such as those carried out by its Office for Civil Rights, which issues guidance on how civil rights laws should be applied. Trump has suggested a different interpretation of the office's civil rights role.",
      "Under his administration, the department has instructed the office to prioritize complaints of\u00a0antisemitism, and has opened investigations into colleges and school sports leagues for allowing transgender athletes to\u00a0compete on women's teams, according to the Associated Press.",
      "The Trump administration isn't expected to defend the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness and repayment programs, which have been tied up in court cases, experts say. Last month, the Education Department removed the online application for income-driven repayment plans, according to Business Insider.",
      "What would happen to student loans?",
      "The Education Department manages $1.5 trillion in student loan debt for more than 40 million borrowers. Although the Trump administration hasn't outlined how it might want to reallocate the Education Department's responsibilities, student loans could be moved to the Treasury Department, Granville noted.",
      "\"If this is going to be a smooth handoff, some other agency has to pick up what the Education Department is setting down,\" he said. \"The most logical destination is the Treasury, but I worry about the risk of disruption from any handoff.\"",
      "Project 2025 posits that student loans should be handled by a \"new government corporation with professional governance and management.\" The blueprint calls for federal loans \"to be assigned directly to the Treasury Department, which would manage collections.\"",
      "Project 2025 also favors phasing out income-based repayment plans, which help borrowers lower their monthly loan payments by making them proportional to their wages and salaries, and creating a new repayment plan that would require people earning above poverty wages to pay 10% of their income toward their loans.",
      "\"[T]here should be no loan forgiveness,\" Project 2025 states.",
      "What would happen to the FAFSA if the Education Department is abolished?",
      "The Education Department required by law to release the FAFSA on or close to Oct. 1, allowing students and their families to apply for loans and other student aid during the college application season. Families must complete the FAFSA each year a student is enrolled in a college program if they wish to qualify for loans or other aid.",
      "\"Congress passed a law that created the FAFSA, and unless Congress creates a new law, the FAFSA has to continue,\" Granville said.",
      "Still, it's unclear which agency would handle the FAFSA if the Department of Education is dismantled, he added.",
      "What would happen to federal funding for public K-12 schools?",
      "Much of the Education Department's money for K-12 schools is funneled through large federal programs, such as Title I for low-income schools and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Those programs support services for students with disabilities, smaller class sizes with additional teaching positions, and pay for social workers and other non-teaching roles in schools.",
      "During his campaign, Mr. Trump called for shifting those functions to the states. He has not offered details on how the agency's core functions of sending federal money to local districts and schools would be handled.",
      "Project 2025 suggests sending oversight of programs for kids with disabilities and low-income children first to the Department of Health and Human Services, before eventually phasing out the funding and converting it to no-strings-attached grants to states.",
      "What do educators and Democrats say?",
      "There's concern that making massive changes to the Education Department could impact millions of families and students who rely on the agency for loans, grants and other support, experts say.",
      "Moving some of those tasks to states and local governments could drive up costs for many families, said Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont.",
      "\"That will mean higher local and state taxes to fill the void,\" Sanders said at a Thursday press conference organized by the Senate Democrats about the potential dismantling of the Education Department. \"In other words, shutting down the Department of Education would be a disaster for low income and working class families in every state of our country.\"",
      "The American Federation of Teachers, a union that represents 1.8 million K-12 teachers, said that it planned to fight the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the agency.",
      "\"The directive to 'return decision-making to the states' fails the smell test,\" said AFT President Randi Weingarten in a statement. \"States and districts already govern schools through locally elected school boards, as they should. They put up most of the money and control most of the decisions\u2014from approving curriculum to deciding who graduates.\"",
      "She added, \"The Department of Education, and the laws it is supposed to execute, has one major purpose: to level the playing field and fill opportunity gaps to help every child in America succeed.\"",

      "President Trump on Thursday said he will pause 25% tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada that are covered under a 2020 trade agreement, delaying levies\u00a0imposed on the nations\u00a0earlier this week.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the delay in the Mexico tariffs in a social media post after a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. On Thursday afternoon, he signed two executive orders stating the exemptions would apply to U.S. imports of products from both Mexico and Canada that are covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Goods that are not covered by the agreement remain subject to tariffs.",
      "\"After speaking with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico, I have agreed that Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything that falls under the USMCA Agreement,\" Mr. Trump wrote, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. He characterized the move \"as an accommodation\" for the Mexican leader.",
      "\"Our relationship has been a very good one, and we are working hard, together, on the Border, both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and, likewise, stopping Fentanyl. Thank you to President Sheinbaum for your hard work and cooperation!\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "When asked if any concessions had been offered by Canada or Mexico to lead to the pause, a White House official told CBS News that during leader-to-leader discussions, Mexico brought up progress it had made cracking down on cartels and drugs, including cocaine.",
      "The USMCA agreement covers the vast majority of imports from Mexico. In a press conference Thursday, Sheinbaum said that nearly all of Mexico's trade with the U.S. is covered under the trade pact which is in effect until April 2.",
      "In 2023, the U.S. imported more than $45 billion worth of agricultural products from Mexico. Almost three-quarters of such imports consisted of vegetables, fruit, beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Canadian energy, which is not included in the USMCA, is expected to be tariffed at 10%, which could boost gas prices and heating and electricity costs in the U.S. Potash that U.S. farmers import from Canada would be tariffed at the same rate.",
      "According to a White House official, in 2024, 38% of all imports from Canada were covered by the USMCA and therefore exempt from tariffs, while 49.6% of all imports from Mexico were covered under the agreement.",
      "International trade expert Barry Appleton, a senior fellow at the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch that \"a massive amount of goods\" fall under the brief exemption from tariffs on imports from Canada. They include auto parts, steel and aluminum, beef and other products.",
      "Despite the brief reprieve. uncertainty around the tariffs have \"broken complex supply chains that will never be fixed,\" Appleton said.",
      "Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, underlined the importance of cooperation on trade.",
      "\"Though today's delay mitigates some of economic damage U.S. tariffs will cause, this is not a moment to celebrate. The economy is not a toy to play with. Constant threats and economic uncertainty have taken their toll. We see it in delayed business investments, shaky consumer confidence, stalled capital flows and a volatile stock market. People's livelihoods are at stake,\" he said in a statement provided to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The only outcome that makes sense for both economies is for all tariffs to be taken off the table, without exception,\" Holmes added.",
      "Economists have warned that tariffs are likely to lead to price increases on an array of goods, from vegetables and fruit to automobiles. Levies on materials from Canada and Mexico used in car production won't go into effect immediately after Mr. Trump also issued one-month exemption from tariffs for automakers Wednesday, following conversations with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram.",
      "Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs before, and business leaders say uncertainty around which policies will actually take effect has created confusion for businesses and consumers.",
      "Some of the most prominent retail executives in the U.S. have spoken out about the tariffs, saying they'd almost certainly lead to increased costs, some of which will be passed along to American consumers.",

      "Walgreens said Thursday that Sycamore will pay $11.45 per share, giving the deal an equity value just under $10 billion. Shareholders could eventually receive up to another $3 per share under certain conditions.",
      "A buyout to take the drugstore chain private would give it more flexibility to make changes to improve its business without worrying about Wall Street's reaction. The company has already been making some big changes as it seeks to turn around its business. Walgreens has been a public company since 1927.",
      "Walgreens, founded in 1901, has been dealing with thin prescription reimbursement, rising costs, persistent theft and inflation-sensitive shoppers who are looking for bargains elsewhere. Walgreens is in the early stages of a plan to close 1,200 of its roughly 8,500 U.S. locations.",
      "The Deerfield, Illinois, company had already shed about a thousand U.S. stores since it grew to nearly 9,500 after buying some Rite Aid locations in 2018.",
      "The company also said last August that it was reviewing a U.S. health care operation it had expanded aggressively, and it might sell all or part of its VillageMD clinic business. That announcement came less than two years after the company said it would spend billions to expand it.",
      "Shares of Walgreens shed nearly two thirds of their value last year. Walgreens said the transaction price represents a nearly 30% premium to the share price in December when reports of a deal first surfaced. Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth confirmed in January that a sale process for the business was underway. Including debt, the value of the deal is just under $24 billion, the company said.",
      "Walgreens said earlier this year it was making progress improving prescription reimbursement.",
      "Walgreens has also taken steps to preserve cash. It said in January that it was suspending a quarterly dividend it has offered for more than 90 years, and it's been reducing its stake in the drug distributor Cencora this year to get cash in part to pay down debt.",
      "Ultimately, the company has to improve its cash flow, whether it remains publicly traded or goes private, Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny said in a Feb. 23 research note.",
      "\"Management has not been shy about its push to improve the cash flow generation profile as part of the turnaround plan,\" the analyst wrote. \"Without cash flow, none of the value cases work.\"",
      "Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. also runs nearly 3,700 international stores, with locations in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Thailand and Ireland.",
      "The Walgreens buyout comes after competitor Rite Aid emerged last September as a private company from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.

      "Employers cut 172,017 jobs last month, a 245% increase from January and double the number that was announced during the same month a year ago, the company said. That marks the highest monthly number of layoffs since July 2020, when 262,649 cuts were announced, the firm added.",
      "The job cuts were led by losses in federal jobs, largely directed by DOGE, which says it is dedicated to rooting out government waste and fraud. DOGE-related job losses have cut a wide swath across federal government agencies by targeting newly hired workers, regardless of their job performance or whether their jobs are essential.",
      "In a few cases, some agencies have scrambled to rehire workers who were fired under DOGE's policies, such as the U.S. Agriculture Department bringing back bird flu experts who were mistakenly cut.",
      "Federal agencies announced 62,242 job cuts last month, an increase of 41,311% from a year earlier, Challenger, Gray said. More federal cuts are on the way, with the Veterans Affairs Department planning to cut thousands of jobs in the coming months, while some government workers may opt to leave because of the uncertainty caused by the layoffs, the group said.",
      "\"When mass layoffs occur, it often leaves remaining staff feeling uneasy and uncertain. The likelihood that many more workers leave voluntarily is high,\" Andrew Challenger, workplace expert for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement.",
      "The impact of the DOGE cuts haven't yet shown up in official government data, with the Labor Department saying Thursday that the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits fell by 21,000 to 221,000 for the week ending March 1.",

      "House Republicans adopted a budget proposal last week that serves as a blueprint for implementing President Trump's agenda. The resolution must be adopted by the Senate before the chambers can move forward with the budget reconciliation process, a complicated maneuver that allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But opponents of the resolution have warned that the proposed cuts implicate key programs that Americans rely on, concerns that the CBO analysis backed up.",
      "Republicans want to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending over a 10-year period to pay for trillions in tax cuts, while increasing funding in some areas. The budget resolution directs congressional committees to craft their own proposals to hit spending targets, increasing or decreasing funding by adjusting programs and policies that fall under their purview.",
      "The Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, is tasked with finding at least $880 billion in cuts over the next decade. A pair of House Democrats asked the CBO for the projected mandatory spending on programs under the committee's jurisdiction, excluding Medicare, which offers health coverage for seniors. Medicaid provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans, with costs split between the federal government and the states.",
      "CBO found that Medicaid accounts for 93% of all remaining non-Medicare mandatory spending, with $581 billion going to other programs. That means the committee couldn't meet its $880 billion target without touching the program. GOP leaders have not proposed cutting Medicare, leaving Medicaid as the source of potential cuts.",
      "House Republican leaders have stressed that Medicaid isn't specifically mentioned in the budget resolution and said benefits would not be cut, noting that last week's vote was merely to begin the reconciliation process. But Republicans have said they plan to remove \"fraud, waste and abuse\" within the program, and many members support work requirements that could limit eligibility for benefits. Other GOP lawmakers have expressed concerns about making cuts to the program, since many of their constituents and voters rely on coverage.",

    "story": [
      "Salt Lake City \u2014 Utah on Wednesday became the first state to pass legislation requiring app stores to verify users' ages and get parental consent for minors to download apps to their devices.",
      "The bill headed to the desk of Gov. Spencer Cox has pitted Meta, which operates Facebook and Instagram, against app store giants Apple and Google over who should be responsible for verifying ages. Similar bills have been introduced in at least eight other states in the latest fight over children's online safety. The proposals targeting app stores follow legal fights over laws requiring social media platforms to verify the ages of users.",
      "Meta and other social media companies support putting the onus on app stores to verify ages amid criticism that they don't do enough to make their products safe for children - or verify that no kids under 13 use them.",
      "\"Parents want a one-stop shop to verify their child's age and grant permission for them to download apps in a privacy-preserving way. The app store is the best place for it,\" Meta, X and Snap Inc. said in a joint statement Wednesday. \"We applaud Utah for putting parents in charge with its landmark legislation and urge Congress to follow suit.\"",
      "The app stores say app developers are better equipped to handle age verification and other safety measures. Requiring app stores to confirm ages will make it so all users have to hand over sensitive identifying information, such as a driver's license, passport, credit card or Social Security number, even if they don't want to use an age-restricted app, Apple said.",
      "\"Because many kids in the U.S. don't have government-issued IDs, parents in the U.S. will have to provide even more sensitive documentation just to allow their child to access apps meant for children. That's not in the interest of user safety or privacy,\" the company said in its most recent online safety report.",
      "Apple considers age a matter of privacy and lets users decide whether to disclose it. The company gives parents the option to set age-appropriate parameters for app downloads. The Google Play Store does the same.",
      "Apple and Google are among a litany of tech companies that help support the Chamber of Progress, a tech policy group that lobbied Utah lawmakers to reject the bill. Last year, Apple helped kill a similar bill in Louisiana that would have required app stores to help enforce age restrictions.",
      "Kouri Marshall, a spokesperson for the Chamber of Progress, called the measure \"a tremendous encroachment of individual privacy\" that he said places a heavy burden on app stores to ensure online safety.",
      "Republican Sen. Todd Weiler, the bill's sponsor, argued it's \"a lot easier to target two app stores than it is to target 10,000 (app) developers.\"",
      "Under the bill, app stores would be required to request age information when someone creates an account. If a minor tries to open one, the bill directs the app store to link it to their parent's account and may request a form of ID to confirm their identity. Weiler said a credit card could be used as an age verification tool in most cases.",
      "If a child tries to download an app that allows in-app purchases or requires them to agree to terms and conditions, the parent will first have to approve.",
      "Melissa McKay, a Utah mother, is among those who pushed for the legislation. She said she started asking questions about device safety after her nephew in 2017 was exposed to \"really harmful content on another student's device at school.\" Inaccurate age ratings on apps and faulty parental controls are \"at the root of online harm,\" McKay said.",
      "The eight other states considering proposals would similarly place responsibility on app stores to verify ages and seek parental permissions. A legislative committee advanced Alabama's bill last week.",
      "Lawsuits have delayed implementation of state laws regulating social media apps and websites. A federal judge in 2024 temporarily blocked Utah's first-in-the-nation law requiring social media companies to check the ages of all users and place restrictions on accounts belonging to minors.",
      "If Cox signs the Utah bill into law, most provisions would take effect May 7. The governor's office didn't respond to emails seeking comment Wednesday. Cox, a Republican, supported the state law currently on hold that requires age verification on social media."

      "President Trump is giving a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers from the round of tariffs that took effect on March 4, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday.",
      "The announcement comes after Mr. Trump spoke with leaders of the so-called Big Three automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram \u2014 on Wednesday, Leavitt said.",
      "Mr. Trump's imposition of 25% tariffs on all\u00a0goods imported\u00a0from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional tariff of 10% on Chinese imports, were expected to hit the auto industry hard\u00a0because many vehicle parts and components are imported from those countries to manufacture cars in the U.S.",
      "\"We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers,\" Trump said in a statement read by his spokesperson. \"We are going to give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,\" referencing the North American free trade agreement he renegotiated in his first term.",
      "\"Since President Trump's successful USMCA was signed, Ford has invested billions in the United States and committed to billions more in the future to both invest in American workers and ensure all of our vehicles comply with USMCA,\" Ford said in a statement. \"We will continue to have a healthy and candid dialogue with the administration to help achieve a bright future for our industry and U.S. manufacturing.\"",
      "In its own statement on the tariff delay, GM said the automaker \"has more vehicle assembly plants in the U.S. than any other automaker,\" adding that \"we continue to invest billions of dollars every year in our manufacturing base, supply chain and U.S. jobs.\"",
      "The goal of the tariff pause is to give U.S. automakers time to shift their supply chains to within the U.S., Leavitt said. Mr. Trump \"told them they should get on it, start investing, start moving, shift production here to the U.S. of America, where they will pay no tariffs. That's the ultimate goal,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration has said the tariffs are aimed at curbing the flow of migrants and drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S., as well as redressing trade imbalances with other countries. The taxes quickly triggered retaliatory measures by Canada and China, with Mexico planning to announce its response on Sunday.",
      "The new tariffs Canada and Mexico could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs\u00a0close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers",
      "Shares of U.S. automakers jumped on Wednesday afternoon, with Ford Motor rising 47 cents, or 5.1%, to $9.58. GM shares gained about 7%, while Stellantis climbed 9.2%.",

      "Businesses large and small are bracing for the impact of the Trump administration's new tariffs on U.S. imports from\u00a0Mexico, Canada and China\u00a0\u2014 and preparing to pass on the pain to consumers.",
      "Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said this week that the electronics retailer is particularly exposed to the tariffs, noting that China and Mexico are the two largest suppliers of the company's products.",

      "The new 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, plus a move to tack an additional 10% levy on to an existing 10% tariff on Chinese imports, took effect Tuesday. Those costs are borne largely by U.S. importers, usually leading to price hikes for shoppers.",
      "While Barry said the tariffs will lead to price increases, she didn't specify how big they would be.",
      "\"I think it is fair to say... that tariffs at this level will result in price increases. I think it is very difficult to say given the backdrop that we're in, exactly precisely how big that is,\" Barry added later in the call in response to a question from an analyst.",
      "A Walmart executive told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0in February that it would not be \"immune\" to the impact of such levies.",
      "And Target CEO Brian Cornell this week told CNBC that because the discount retailer relies heavily on produce from Mexico, consumers can expect to see higher prices on fruits and vegetables almost immediately.",
      "\"If there's a 25% tariff, those prices will go up,\" Cornell said.",
      "The\u00a0U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u00a0this week urged the Trump administration to reconsider the sweeping new tariffs, saying they force businesses to choose between hiking prices or risk going out of business.",
      "\"American families and businesses are struggling with high costs. It's one of the top issues that they want policymakers to address,\" Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement.",

      "Franco Salerno, who owns Darianna Bridal and Tuxedo in Warrington, Pennsylvania, told the Chamber of Commerce the company is printing new price tags to reflect the increased costs dress designers expect to incur and pass along to Darianna's, due to the tariffs.",
      "\"Dress designers are already notifying us that they are raising prices to cover any tariffs,\" Salerno told the trade group.",
      "The Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA), a trade organization representing retailers, also called on President Trump to reconsider his tariff policy.",
      "\"The American people are counting on President Trump to bring down costs and grow the U.S. economy,\" Michael Hanson, RILA's senior executive vice president of public affairs, said in a statement. \"Tariffs on Canada and Mexico put those goals in serious jeopardy and risk destabilizing the North American economy.

    "summary": "The stock market has swung wildly since President Trump placed 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Here's what to know about your 401(k).",
    "story": [
      "During his Tuesday night address\u00a0to Congress, President Trump acknowledged his barrage of tariffs might cause \"a little disturbance.\" But with the stock market tumbling this week in reaction to his import duties, workers with 401(k) plans may wonder about how much that disturbance could affect their retirement savings.",
      "The S&P 500 has lost about 3% of its value since Friday, with Wall Street tumbling on Monday and Tuesday after Mr. Trump\u00a0decided to move forward\u00a0with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% on Chinese imports. The stock index regained some ground on Wednesday, rising 21 points, or 0.4%, to 5,799 in afternoon trading.",
      "According to Wall Street analysts, the market reaction reflects investor concerns that a trade war could crimp U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation, putting pressure on U.S. consumers who are already financially strained after grappling with several years of elevated price increases. Some recent economic data also points to\u00a0souring outlooks from consumers and businesses, with both groups now\u00a0expecting higher inflation in the face of Mr. Trump's new tariffs.",
      "With uncertainty on the rise, employees exposed to stocks through their retirement plans should brace for more investment volatility, experts say.",
      "\"There is evidence that a cooling in the economy is underway,\" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst and founder of Vital Knowledge, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"U.S. equities are bearing the brunt of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy right now.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also sometimes sent mixed messages about its tariff plans, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday night saying the administration might \"modify the tariffs somewhat.\"",
      "Those mixed signals add to the challenges facing businesses in deciding their strategy, experts say. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. businesses on goods they import from other nations, some companies are uncertain about the costs they'll face moving forward under the Trump administration, Crisafulli said.",
      "\"I look at tariffs as a corporate tax,\" he said. \"Imagine if corporate tax rates were set in this chaotic of a fashion \u2014 it would create a lot of hesitation among companies. They don't know what the ground rules will be.\"",
      "Walmart executives, noting that the U.S. is entering what they characterized as \"an uncertain time,\" said last month that consumers are paring their spending, while Target on Tuesday said costs from tariffs could put \"meaningful pressure\" on the retailer's profits. Such caution is also fueling market volatility, experts said.",
      "\"Uncertainty around the scope and implementation of tariffs is high,\" investment firm BlackRock said in a March 5\u00a0note\u00a0to investors. \"In markets, we think U.S. equities could come under pressure in the next few months as investors seek additional compensation for these risks.\"",
      "How could this impact your 401(k)?",
      "While investors spooked by the roller-coaster stock swings might be tempted to exit the market, that's generally a losing strategy, Crisafulli said. Timing the market, or attempting to buy and sell stocks to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible to execute and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, Charles Schwab research\u00a0has found.",
      "The strategy is almost always doomed to fail because investors don't know when to get back into the market to capture the rebound, while the stock market has historically always recovered even from major setbacks. For instance, investors who sold during the March 2020 rout that followed the eruption of COVID-19 around the U.S. and failed to re-enter the market that year could have missed out on the rebound, with the S&P 500 gaining 15% by the end of December.",
      "For most investors with a 401(k) plan, sticking tight and avoiding checking your balance each day may be the best strategy for coping with volatile periods, experts say.",
      "\"Your 401(k) should be on autopilot, and you don't look at day-to-day volatility,\" Crisafulli said. \"I don't think people should make dramatic changes with their 401(k)s.\"",
      "Still, investors may want to examine their asset allocation and shift to investments that could provide more protection in the face of a possible global trade war, researchers note. For instance, automobile companies could be hard-hit by the Trump administration's tariffs, BlackRock notes, given that U.S. automakers import many components from Mexico and Canada.",
      "Restaurants and grocery companies could also feel the impact of the new tariffs, as U.S. food costs could increase by 3% due to the higher import duties, BlackRock noted.",
      "\"On the other hand, financials and health care services may be relatively insulated, since these sectors have minimal exposure to imported goods,\" the wealth management firm noted.",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump vowed that his tariffs \"are about making America rich again and making America great again.\" Some of his goals in implementing the tariffs are to bring about a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing by convincing companies to move factories to the U.S.",
      "While that could take months or even years to pan out, investment experts say it's also important to keep a long-term view on the U.S. economy.",
      "\"It may be hard for investors to believe, but there is more to market volatility than reacting to the latest Trump executive action,\" Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street, wrote in a new report.",
      "Despite recent data that suggests the U.S. economy is slowing, \"an economic growth scare is not the same thing as a recession. And the economic environment remains respectable. U.S. real GDP is likely to expand in the first quarter,\" he added.",
      "Given that the economy is continuing to grow, the labor market remains strong and inflation is still cooling, it's important to \"differentiate between signal and noise,\" Arone said.",

The deal will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere.",
      "The consortium, comprised of BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited will acquire 90% interests in Panama Ports Company, which owns and operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama, according to the filing.",
      "\"This agreement is a powerful illustration of BlackRock and GIP's combined platform and our ability to deliver differentiated investments for clients. These world-class ports facilitate global growth,\" BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a joint announcement with TilL of the deal. \"Through our deep connectivity to organizations like Hutchison and MSC/TIL and governments around the world, we are increasingly the first call for partners seeking patient, long-term capital. We are thrilled our clients can participate in this investment.",
      "In January, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the Republican chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, raised concerns that China could exploit or block passage through the canal and that the ports \"give China ready observation posts\" to take action. \"This situation, I believe, posts acute risks for U.S. national security,\" Cruz said.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in early February and told President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino that Panama had to reduce Chinese influence over the canal or face potential retaliation from the United States. Mulino rejected the idea that China had any control over canal operations.",
      "Panama quit China's Belt and Road Initiative following Rubio's visit, drawing condemnation from Beijing.",
      "Mr. Trump touted the move in his address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night, saying that \"to further enhance our national security, our administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it.\"",
      "\"Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal, and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal, and a couple of other canals,\" the president said.",
      "Victory for Trump",
      "With 40 million container ships passing through every year, the Panama Canal \u2014 a 51 mile waterway that cuts through Central America, linking the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans \u2014 is vital to the U.S. economy. Disputes over the canal were first sparked in 2024 when Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, made accusations that Chinese companies have taken control of the ports.",
      "But while much attention was focused on Mr. Trump's threat to retake control of the canal, his administration trained its sights on Hutchison Ports, the Hong Kong-based consortium that manages the canal's key ports, at either end of the canal. As a result of BlackRock's deal with CK Hutchison Holding, those two key ports will be placed under American control.",
      "The United States is the canal's largest user, with about 70% of shipping traffic going through the canal either coming to or from the U.S. Its second largest user is China.",
      "Hutchison Ports had recently been awarded a 25-year no-bid extension to run the ports, but an audit looking at that extension was already underway. Observers believed the audit was a preliminary step toward eventually rebidding the contract, but rumors had swirled in recent weeks that a U.S. firm close to the White House was being lined up to take over.",

      "President Trump's imposition of blanket 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico drew swift vows of retaliation from the United States' immediate neighbors on Tuesday. China, which was hit with a second 10% tariff on U.S. exports since Mr. Trump took office, bringing the total levy to 20%, immediately announced its own reciprocal measures \u2014 deliberately targeting America's agricultural sector.",
      "A Canadian official confirmed to CBS News that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Canadian foreign minister M\u00e9lanie Joly intened to speak on Wednesday.",
      "Below is a look at the measures being imposed or planned by Canada, China and Mexico, and the rhetoric coming from officials in those countries as Mr. Trump ramps up his trade war against one of America's biggest adversaries, and its two closest neighbors.",
      "Canada announces reciprocal tariffs; Trudeau calls Trump's move \"a very dumb thing to do\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced immediate retaliation to the new U.S. tariffs in a statement late Monday evening. He said Canada would impose a $30 billion counter-tariff on goods imported from the U.S. immediately, escalating to $155 billion worth of American products within the next 21 days. Trudeau has said previously that Canada would target American beer, wine, bourbon and home appliances, along with Florida orange juice, with its measures.",
      "\"Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,\" Trudeau said, adding that he was already discussing with Canada's provincial leaders various non-tariff measures that could be imposed if the Trump administration doesn't lift its tariffs.",
      "\"Because of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas, and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs. Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term,\" Trudeau said.",
      "In a news conference Tuesday, Trudeau lashed out at President Trump's decision.",
      "\"We should be working together to ensure even greater prosperity for North Americans in a very uncertain and challenging world,\" he said. \"Now, it's not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal, but Donald, they point out that even though you're a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.\"",
      "\"Today the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they're talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying murderous dictator. Make that make sense,\" said Trudeau. \"We two friends fighting is exactly what our opponents around the world want to see.\"",
      "Trudeau also said Canada will challenge the U.S. action by filing dispute resolution claims at the World Trade Organization and through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trade deal that replaced NAFTA.",
      "Mr. Trump responded with a post on social media threatening to raise tariffs further: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"",
      "Some of Canada's state leaders have pushed for a tougher response.",
      "\"If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything, including cut off their energy with a smile on my face. And I'm encouraging every other province to do the same; Quebec, Manitoba, BC [British Columbia], we all have to act in unison,\" Doug Ford, the Premier of Ontario, Canada's most populous province, said at an industrial convention on Monday. \"They rely on our energy. They need to feel the pain. They want to come at us hard. We're going to come back twice as hard.\"",
      "Ford said retaliatory measures that Canada could consider going forward included halting shipments of critical minerals such as uranium, potash and nickel, in addition to cutting the energy supply, which he said could leave 1.5 million people without power in New York, Michigan and Minnesota, potentially causing significant disruptions to the U.S. economy.",
      "He said he had also asked officials in his province to end billions of dollars in contracts with the U.S. and to stop the import of American alcohol to Ontario.",
      "\"It's going to be an absolute disaster for both countries,\" he acknowledged in a separate interview with NBC News. \"I don't want to respond, but I will respond like they have never seen before.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has framed his tariffs on Canada as a response to what he says is the country's failure to stem the flow of both undocumented immigrants and fentanyl across the northern U.S. border \u2014 though very little of the drug enters that way, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency.",
      "In a message posted to his own Truth social platform early Tuesday, Mr. Trump also took issue with Canadian banking regulations, saying the country \"doesn't allow American Banks to do business in Canada, but their banks flood the American Market,\" but providing no further context.",
      "\"I heard he talked about banking again this morning,\" Trudeau said during his Tuesday news conference, \"which doesn't make any sense, because American banks \u2014 of 16 American banks currently active in Canada \u2014 holding about $113 billion worth of assets in this country. So the American banks are alive and well and prospering in Canada. It's an example of not really being able to see what it is that he [Trump] wants, because even the excuse that he's giving for these tariffs today of fentanyl is completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false. So we actually have to fall back on the one thing he has said repeatedly, that what he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that will make it easier to annex us.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that Canada should become a U.S. \"51st state.\"",
      "Trudeau defended Canada's actions on border control and the illegal flow of fentanyl on Monday, saying that between December 2024 and January 2025, seizures of the drug from Canada by U.S. authorities dropped 97%, to just 0.03 pounds. That drop came, he said, after Canada implemented a $1.3 billion plan to deploy more helicopters and more boots on the ground, and to appoint a \"Fentanyl Czar.\"",
      "China announces tariffs, warns against \"maximum pressure\" tactic",
      "Mr. Trump has long accused China of giving its manufacturers and other businesses an unfair advantage in trade with the U.S. and vowed to balance the extremely lopsided flow of goods. But he has framed his latest round of tariffs on the country as punishment for what he claims is a Chinese refusal to crack down on the flow of fentanyl and the chemicals used to make it to the U.S.",
      "China's government has refused to back down in the face of the escalating trade war with the Trump administration, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian telling reporters in Beijing on Tuesday that the \"Chinese people cannot be swayed by fallacies, deterred by intimidation, and bullying tactics are not the right way to deal with China.\"",
      "\"Attempting to exert maximum pressure on China is targeting the wrong opponent and is a misreading of the situation. If the U.S. truly wants to resolve the fentanyl issue, it should engage in consultation with China built on the principles of equality, respect, and mutual benefit to address each other's concerns,\" he said, according to China's official media.",
      "\"If the U.S. has other intentions and is committed to waging a tariff war, trade war, or any other kind of war, China will respond in kind,\" Lin said, adding a call for the White House \"to abandon its bullying tactics and return to the necessary track of dialogue and cooperation at an early date.\"",
      "China retaliated immediately, announcing its own 10-15% tariff on U.S. agricultural products and foods, from wheat, corn and cotton to soybeans, beef, chicken and dairy. Beijing also placed 25 U.S. firms under export and investment restrictions, citing what it said were national security concerns.",
      "Veteran Chinese analyst Victor Gao told CBS News that while China's counter-tariffs will impact U.S. farmers \u2014 perceived by Beijing to be among Mr. Trump's support base \u2014 he believes Beijing is being measured in its response and that it doesn't want to inflame the situation.",
      "Gao, who has worked with the country's leadership and is now vice president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing, said China is better prepared for a trade war with the U.S. than it was during Mr. Trump's first term, as it has diversified into other, non-U.S. markets.",
      "He said if President Xi Jinping really wanted to step up Beijing's retaliation, it could halt imports of U.S. gas and oil, but he warned against the implications for both nations if the trade war continues to escalate, saying at best, it would end in a \"bloody tie.\"",
      "But Gao said he believed talks were still going on behind the scenes between U.S and Chinese officials, and that both countries likely have little interest in a deteriorating, tit-for-tat tariffs battle.",
      "Mexican president vows retaliation to \"inconceivable\" tariffs",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that her country would respond to the 25% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration with its own retaliatory tariffs and non-tariff measures, but held off announcing exactly what those would be, promising a statement on Sunday in Mexico City's main square. She said she was scheduled to have a call with Mr. Trump this week, probably on Thursday.",
      "She said the reciprocal measures Mexico would take were \"not in any way or with the purpose of starting an economic or commercial confrontation that unfortunately and regrettably is the opposite of what we must be doing.\"",
      "\"It's inconceivable that they don't think about the damage this is going to cause to United States citizens and businesses with the increase in prices for things produced in our country,\" Sheinbaum said. \"Also, the damage it will cause by stopping job creation in both countries. No one wins with this decision.\"",
      "Sheinbaum stressed how Mexico had been working alongside the U.S. to respond to requests by Mr. Trump to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. and to reinforce the U.S.-Mexico border to curb migration.",
      "\"We collaborate to avoid illegal drug trafficking to the United States, but as we have said on multiple occasions, that country's government must take responsibility, too, for the crisis of opioid consumption that has caused so many deaths in the United States,\" the Mexican leader said.",
      "\"There is no motive or reason, nor justification that supports this decision that will affect our people and our nations,\" added Sheinbaum.",
      "The Mexican peso slumped against the U.S. dollar as Sheinbaum delivered her remarks on Tuesday, according to Bloomberg.",

      "The SSA said it is continuing to pay the retroactive benefits to eligible Social Security beneficiaries, whose monthly payments will increase beginning in April, reflecting March's benefit.",

      "What is the average Social Security retroactive payment?",
      "The retroactive payments are due to the law's elimination of two federal\u00a0policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program. Those same policies also\u00a0reduced\u00a0benefits for such workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "Under the new law, the benefits hike is retroactive to December 2023. As a result, eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",

      "About 1.13 million people have received a combined $7.5 billion in retroactive payments through March 4, it added.",

Tammy Bruce, the State Department spokesperson, said in a statement on Friday that Rubio spoke with Ukraine's foreign minister about \"all sides\" taking steps to secure a sustainable peace, which would suggest a request for Ukrainian concessions. It is not clear if Russia has offered any at all. Kellogg said that Trump has talked about the potential of Ukraine getting territory back from the Russians, but acknowledged that the U.S. president did not specify which territory.",
      "It is also unclear what would trigger any U.S. pressure on Russia. Mr. Trump posted on social media that he would consider sanctions on Russian energy and banking, but then later said in the Oval Office that Putin's stepped up attacks on Ukraine during the U.S. pause was something \"anybody would do.\"",
      "\"I don't believe what he said for a second about the sanctions,\" said Fiona Hill on \"Face the Nation.\" \"I believe more what he just said there in the Oval Office, sitting behind, you know, the resolute desk.\"",
      "\"He sees, you know, obviously, the Ukraine- Ukrainians, and he said that in the Oval Office during the meeting with President Zelensky, that he sees them on the back foot, as losing, and he's basically telling them that they have to capitulate. Very clear,\" she continued",
      "Kellogg said Thursday that there was room for further U.S. pressure on Moscow especially when it comes to enforcement of existing sanctions.",
      "\"I think it was between one to 10, we're probably at a seven. The problem is with enforcement, we're probably at a three,\" Kellogg said. \"I think the most important thing is the enforcement sanctions, not to serve the sanctions themselves.\"",

    "summary": "As Trump's trade war looms over Canada, the ruling Liberal Party has chosen veteran economist Mark Carney to replace Justin Trudeau.",
    "story": [
      "Toronto\u00a0\u2014 Canada's Liberal Party has chosen veteran central bank leader Mark Carney as its new leader, meaning he will quickly replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the country's top office. The transition, and Trudeau's political downfall, comes amid the chaotic trade war with Canada's closest ally launched by President Trump.",
      "The exact date that Carney will take office as Canada's prime minister remains uncertain. The timing of the transition will be determined by Carney in conjunction with Trudeau.",
      "Carney won nearly 86% of the more than 151,000 votes cast. The next closest candidate received 11,144 votes.",
      "The new leader will inherit a government led by a party which has seen its support among the Canadian electorate wane significantly over the past few years. With opposition parties eager to trigger an election, the situation is becoming increasingly urgent. Carney's government could be toppled by Parliament to call for a new national election, which can be called any time between the Parliament going back into session on March 24 and October 20, by which time a vote must be held.",
      "Trudeau announced in January that he would step down as party leader and, with the move, from his role as the prime minister, due to increasing pressure from within the Liberal Party as polls showed its support among voters tanking.",
      "Trudeau's resignation announcement paved the way for the Liberal Party to chose a new leader, and Carney won that internal party election on Sunday \u2014  and many Canadians will hope to see him quickly form a new cabinet and then put his decades of financial experience to work as the country confronts Mr. Trump's trade war.",
      "Who is Mark Carney?",
      "Born in Fort Smith, in Canada's Northwest Territories, Carney grew up in Edmonton before heading to the U.S. to pursue a degree in economics at Harvard University. He later moved to the U.K. and earned a master's degree and then, in 1995, a doctorate in economics from the prestigious University of Oxford.",
      "He was appointed as the Governor of the Bank of Canada \u2014   akin to the Federal Reserve in the U.S. \u2014 in 2008, amid the global financial crisis, which he helped to steer Canada through.",
      "Carney's influence has extended well beyond Canada, however, and not only because he led one of its most important central government institutions. In 2010, Time Magazine named him among the world's 25 most influential leaders. In 2011, Reader's Digest Canada named him the \"Most Trusted Canadian,\" and the editors of Euromoney magazine named him Central Bank Governor of the Year in 2012.",
      "During his tenure as Canada's central banker, he also held several high-profile international positions, including as chair of the Committee on the Global Financial System and head of the Financial Stability Board for the G20 group of the world's biggest economies.",
      "Between 2013 and 2020, Carney moved back to Britain after being tapped as the Governor of the Bank of England, heading up the U.K.'s central bank and helping to guide the country through the economic convulsions brought on by its \"Brexit\" from the European Union. He was the first non-U.K. citizen to govern the institution in its 300-year history.",
      "More recently, Carney served as the United Nations' special envoy on climate action and finance and as head of transition investing at the Brookfield Asset Management firm. He stepped down from both of those positions to pursue his Liberal Party leadership bid.",
      "Carney's reaction to Trump",
      "Mr. Trump's trade war and his frequent threats to make Canada a U.S. \"51st state\" were hot topics during the Liberal Party leadership campaign. Carney, along with the other candidates, emphasized the importance of a strong domestic economy in the face of those threats.",
      "Carney said Canada had allowed its economy to become \"weak,\" leaving it susceptible to Mr. Trump's tariff-based pressure tactics. He said Canada was experiencing one of the worst economic crises in its history, and that overcoming it would require major reforms to ensure long-term strength and stability.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a debate for his party's leadership. \"I know how to build strong economies.\"",
      "Carney on Sunday said the retaliatory tariffs Canada has placed on the U.S., which he said will have \"maximum impact in the United States and minimum impact here in Canada,\" would remain \"until the Americans show us respect.\"",
      "Carney said Mr. Trump was \"attacking Canadian families, workers and businesses, and we cannot let him succeed. And we won't. We won't. I am proud. I am proud of the response of Canadians who are making their voices heard and their wallets felt.\"",
      "Earlier in the campaign, he said that as prime minister, he would impose dollar-to-dollar reciprocal tariffs on U.S. imports in a trade war and leverage Canada's role as a vital supplier of energy and uranium to its southern neighbor.",
      "\"It's important to distinguish what you can't control, what we can control. We can't change Donald Trump, but we can control our economic destiny,\" he said during a debate.",
      "Carney on Sunday also addressed Mr. Trump's threats to annex Canada, saying, \"America is not Canada, and Canada never, ever will be part of America in any way.\"",
      "\"We didn't ask for this fight... So the Americans, they should make no mistake, in trade, as in hockey, Canada will win,\" he added.",

    "summary": "Prosecutors said Ryan Routh methodically plotted to kill Trump for weeks, before aiming a rifle through shrubs as Trump played golf last September at his golf club.",
    "story": [
      "While President Trump spoke with reporters about federal job cuts and signed executive orders in the Oval Office last Tuesday, a notable \u2014 and unannounced \u2014 visit was underway at Mr. Trump's golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida. It wasn't publicized. But it could impact one of the highest-profile criminal trials in America this year.",
      "According to court filings reviewed by CBS News, defense attorneys for Ryan Routh were given access to tour the Trump golf course on Feb. 25 to prepare Routh's defense in the alleged assassination attempt against Mr. Trump during a Sept. 15 golf outing. A court filing submitted by Justice Department prosecutors this week said, \"We took the lead in setting up arrangements for this visit even though the prosecution team obviously does not control the course, which is private property.\"",
      "In a March 3 court filing, prosecutors added, \"As we told defense counsel, their request to inspect the firearm in this manner was highly unusual in the experience of the FBI, but nonetheless we made it happen.\"",
      "Prosecutors have also helped provide transport of the rifle allegedly wielded by Routh near Trump's September golf outing.\tAccording to the Justice Department's submissions to a federal judge in Miami, \"To accommodate a defense request, the prosecution team ensured that the firearm, scope, magazine, ammunition, and antiballistic plates were transported from the FBI's lab in Quantico, Virginia, to the FBI Field Office in Miramar, Florida, so the defense could inspect it, with purported consultants in tow, in South Florida after the golf course visit.\"",
      "Prosecutors say Routh methodically plotted to kill Trump for weeks, before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Trump played golf on Sept. 15 at the Trump West Palm Beach country club. Before Trump came into view, Routh was allegedly spotted by a Secret Service agent. Federal authorities accuse Routh of aiming his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot. Prosecutors say he left behind a note describing his intentions.",
      "A White House spokeswoman declined comment when asked about the defense attorney visit to the president's Florida golf property. FBI, Justice Department officials and Routh's federal public defense attorneys also did not comment.",
      "The federal criminal case against Routh, which gathered widespread attention when it was filed in September, has attracted little attention\u00a0 in the months since. His alleged attempt on Mr. Trump's life was partly overshadowed by the dramatic first assassination attempt last July in Butler, Pennsylvania. Routh's trial is scheduled for September 2025.",
      "Routh's son charged in separate felony case",
      "A CBS News review found Routh's legal case has also given rise to another federal investigation. According to charging documents filed in North Carolina, federal investigators searched the apartment of Routh's son six days after the alleged assassination attempt in September. The court filings said an electronic device discovered in Oran Routh's apartment had \"hundreds of child pornography images.\"",
      "Prosecutors said the initial search of Oran Routh's home was unrelated to the child pornography evidence, but the investigation ultimately revealed multiple devices with suspected child exploitative images.",
      "On Jan. 8, Oren Routh signed a plea agreement in which he acknowledged \"that the material which contained an image of child pornography charged in the Second Superseding Indictment herein involved a prepubescent minor and minor who had not attained 12 years of age.\"",
      "He is scheduled to be sentenced May 14 at the federal courthouse in Greensboro, North Carolina.",
      "Both Oran Routh and his father are being held in pretrial detention pending the resolution of their cases.",
      "Though the two criminal cases are separate, court filings reviewed by CBS News show correspondence between Ryan Routh and his son are part of the evidence that has been collected and noted in Ryan Routh's assassination attempt case in Florida.",
      "If convicted, Ryan Routh faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. According to court records, Routh was convicted of felonies in North Carolina in December 2002 and March 2010.",
      "Ryan Routh's trial is scheduled for Sept. 8, nearly a year to the day after the alleged assassination attempt. The presiding judge is Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed to the bench by\u00a0 Mr. Trump in 2020. Last year, Cannon dismissed Trump's classified documents federal criminal case.",

      "Air Force fighter jets intercepted a civilian aircraft flying in the temporarily restricted airspace near President Donald Trump's Florida home Sunday, bringing the number of violations to more than 20 since the president took office on Jan. 20.",
      "North American Aerospace Defense Command said in a statement that Sunday's incident, which took place as Trump finished a round of golf at his West Palm Beach golf course, saw F-16s deploy flares to get the attention of the civilian pilot. Jets also conducted an intercept on Saturday morning shortly after Mr. Trump arrived at the course from his private Mar-a-Lago club and residence.",
      "The airspace intrusions in the heavily congested south Florida airspace have prompted fighter jet intercepts but did not alter Mr. Trump's schedule or impact his security, officials said. NORAD says the flares may have been visible from the ground but that they burn out quickly and don't pose danger.",
      "Federal officials maintain a permanent flight restriction over Mr. Trump's club that expands to a radius of 30 nautical miles when the president is in residence.",
      "Violations, and intercepts, are relatively routine, but NORAD is raising alarm over the frequency of the intrusions since Mr. Trump's inauguration, saying it has responded to more than 20 incidents and blames civilian pilots for not following regulations requiring them to check for airspace restrictions before taking off.",
      "NORAD has urged aircrews to check Notice to Airmen, or NOTAMs, from the FAA before flying, \"especially in the Mar-a-Lago region.\" The FAA uses NOTAMs\u00a0to inform pilots of temporary flight restrictions, which prohibit aircraft from entering certain airspaces for set periods of time. Restrictions are issued \"for safety or security purposes,\" including for natural disasters, some major sporting events and emergency or national security situations, the FAA says.",
      "\"Adherence to TFR procedures is essential to ensure flight safety, national security, and the security of the President,\" Gen. Gregory Guillot, the commander of NORAD and US Northern Command said in a statement. \"The procedures are not optional, and the excessive number of recent TFR violations indicates many civil aviators are not reading Notice to Airmen, or NOTAMS, before each flight as required by the FAA, and has resulted in multiple responses by NORAD fighter aircraft to guide offending aircraft out of the TFR.\"",
      "In 2017, during Mr. Trump's first term as president, two F-15 fighter jets were scrambled to intercept an unresponsive aircraft near Mar-a-Lago and officials said the\u00a0incident created a \"sonic boom\"\u00a0that alarmed nearby residents.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Fiona Hill, former White House Russia expert, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 9, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Russia stepped up its aerial attacks on Ukraine following the Trump administration's suspension of intelligence sharing and military equipment. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Moscow has carried out hundreds of attacks using ballistic missiles and drones. For more now we're joined by Fiona Hill. She is a senior fellow at Brookings, and during the first Trump administration, she was the senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council. Good to have you back.",
      "FIONA HILL: Thanks, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the U.S. pauses of lethal intelligence sharing, including targeting data for U.S. provided weapons like HIMARS, we also know it extends to satellite imagery, which is no longer being shared with Ukraine. What's the practical impact of that and the military freeze?",
      "HILL: Well, I think we can see the impact. It's certainly, on the one hand, emboldened Russia to really step up the attacks. And it's also not just blindsided, but also partially blinded Ukraine. I mean, we heard from the previous segment that there's still some sharing with allies like the United Kingdom, of course, which is part of the Five Eyes sharing with the United States. But frankly, none of the other allies, including the UK, have the same access to satellite imagery as the United States does. So even if there is some sharing, not much restrictions, there certainly has an impact. And frankly, I think it's going to be an impetus to other allies to start stepping up their own capabilities and questioning themselves about the virtues of sharing with the United States. I mean, this is a two way street. We have to remember that other countries also share pretty vital information with the United States, even if the scale is not quite the same.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Canada, the UK, Australia, among those who do so. You think they will essentially punish the U.S. by not sharing intelligence?",
      "HILL: I'm not sure whether it's punishment, but it'll be a lot of questioning about what actually happens with this, because if you're bundling together intelligence, and then effectively, the United States is putting restrictions on that. Was that pre-discussed with our Five Eyes allies, for example, or with other allies? Particularly in the midst of, basically, a conflict that is, as we've heard over and over again, the largest land war in Europe since World War II. I mean, this is really unprecedented in terms of the actions of the United States in this regard, because it's not just affecting Ukraine. Again, it's having knock on effects for all of our other allies who are directly affected, all of our European allies that are directly affected by this conflict.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Trump said on Friday, when he was asked if this uptick in Putin's bombing was directly related to the U.S. halt, here's what he said.",
      "(BEGIN SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "DONALD TRUMP: I actually think he's doing what anybody else would do. I think he's- I think he wants to get it stopped and settled. And I think he's hitting them harder than- than he's been hitting them. And I think probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now.",
      "(END SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yet earlier in the day, the president had posted on social media he was considering possibly putting sanctions on Russia. That's a contradiction. What do you make of what he said?",
      "FIONA HILL: I make of it exactly what he said. I mean, he's actually, obviously, putting himself in the shoes of Vladimir Putin and saying that if I were the aggressor, that's exactly what I would be doing if I wanted to make Ukraine capitulate. So, I mean, yeah, he called it as it is. I don't believe what he said for a second about the sanctions. I believe more what he just said there in the Oval Office, sitting behind, you know, the resolute desk. I mean, I think if that's what you can take away from this. He actively- that's--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Believe the president when he says things.",
      "HILL: I think you should, yeah. I mean, he is the president of the United States. And he made it crystal clear, I think. And he sees, you know, obviously, the Ukraine- Ukrainians, and he said that in the oval office during the meeting with President Zelensky, that he sees them on the back foot, as losing, and he's basically telling them that they have to capitulate. Very clear.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't have the cards, was the line he kept using then.",
      "HILL: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I know you were at the Council on Foreign Relations this week, as was I. I had an interview with Trump's envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, and when we were discussing the president's decision to cut off Ukraine. He said, Ukrainians brought it on themselves, and the decision was like, quote, \"hitting a mule with a two by four across the nose. You got their attention.\" It's quite a statement, comparing our ally to a farm animal here that needed to be beaten. Do you think it was right to say the Ukrainian government, though, was just not getting it?",
      "HILL: Well, what they weren't getting is really what President Trump wanted directly from them, which was obviously to have President Zelenskyy make a personal agreement with him in the Oval Office, in front of all the cameras, to thank him profusely for all the aid that was already provided to Ukraine over, you know, successive administrations now, and basically to sign a deal on rare earths minerals, and then basically leave immediately after that. And clearly, President Zelenskyy didn't really get that message. And I think there's a very important element here. In diplomacy, you really should only be speaking in your native language. And I think that there was- a lot of this was lost in translation. First of all, President Zelenskyy didn't fully understand that this agreement was just purely with President Trump. And you may remember, if we all go back and watch that, I watched it many times just to try to figure out exactly where things had gone wrong, and there were multiple points, but there was one point when President Zelenskyy basically said, look, you know, we had deals with your- your previous presidents, basically with Obama and Biden, and President Trump immediately dismissed all of that. And basically said those deals were not worth the paper they were written on, all the commitments that were made--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's not me.",
      "HILL: --because they were weak and it wasn't me. And President Zelenskyy didn't quite follow all of this, because, like the rest of our allies, he actually thinks that commitments made by the United States are supposed to hold over successive administrations. And what we learned there, and what he learned there, was, that is not the case. You're essentially going to have to make a new commitment with President Trump. It's a personal commitment, and that was what he was being told, and he didn't fully understand. And I think in future, when the Ukrainians are meeting with the Americans, they ought to have translators with them, because as good as President Zelenskyy's English is, there's two things that he's missing there. He doesn't quite understand the way that President Trump operates, although I think he's probably got the message now, but he doesn't always understand the nuances. And I would also think that our side, on the United States' side, could do with some interpretation as well, coming also from President Zelenskyy. So my advice to President Zelenskyy and to the team around President Trump is, use interpreters. That's what they're there for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And your own government's interpreters.",
      "FIONA HILL: That's absolutely right. Your own government's interpreters, not- because you actually asked that question, whose interpreter we used, and General Kellogg couldn't answer the question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, for Steve Witkoff, who met with Putin for three and a half hours.",
      "HILL: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Europe seems to be taking these threats seriously and looking at an alternative to the American nuclear deterrent and umbrella. That's- does that mean the Transatlantic Alliance is gone?",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, it doesn't mean that it's gone, but there's a bit of, a kind of a one sided attempt to rupture it here on the part of the United States. I was also at the Munich Security Conference. I heard Vice President Vance's speech. I was standing next to a couple of very prominent Europeans who were completely in shock. And immediately after that, as you well know, there were many statements coming out of Germany, as well as countries like Sweden, basically asking whether the United States could be trusted on nuclear weapons. And we have to remember that Ukraine had nuclear weapons that it gave up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they gave them up.",
      "HILL: That's correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: With the promise of the security guarantee that was not delivered on.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Tom Suozzi, Democrat of New York, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 9, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We're joined now by the co-chairs of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus. Pennsylvania Republican Brian Fitzpatrick represents a district that was narrowly carried by Kamala Harris, and New York Democrat Tom Suozzi represents a district that went for President Trump. So you all have to find the middle and that brings you together and brings you here today. It's good to see, in a bipartisan fashion, this conversation take place. But I want to start with you, Congressman Fitzpatrick, there is this potential government shutdown looming March 14th. Speaker Johnson says there's going to be a vote on Tuesday. Will Republicans be able to pass this on party lines, or do you need Democratic votes?",
      "REP. BRIAN FITZPATRICK (R-PA): Well, that remains to be seen. You know, the text was just released yesterday, compliant with the 72-hour rule before a vote. We're still digging through it. Like most bills, there's some good in there. There's some not so good in there. And we got to make an aggregated decision. I will say, you know, Tom and I are friends, we came in together. We obviously co-chair this bipartisan group together. And we do lament the fact of any single party bill- the construct in this country is if you get 218 votes, you get everything, and if you get 217 votes you get nothing. And that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. So the reason that we do what we do is we want two party solutions, including on the CR. So, it remains to be seen whether the votes are there or not, but I think we're really going to be learning over the next 24 hours what's in it and what's not in it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you haven't decided your vote?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What about you, Congressman Suozzi? Because Leader Jeffries initially said in a letter, Democrats cannot back it. You have the text. Are you a no?",
      "REP. TOM SUOZZI (D-NY): Right now, I'm a no. I mean, there's been no outreach on a bipartisan basis. What Brian and I are trying to do in this environment, you can imagine, is not too easy. Everything's very fractured, everything's very divisive, and to overcome that requires trust building and requires people to work together. In the case of the CR there's been offers to negotiate, and there's been very little negotiated. It's kind of been a my way or the highway type of thing. And I think that's going to go on for a while. I think that the leadership is going to try and do my way or the highway for a while, and then at some point they're going to need Democratic votes. And then people start negotiating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A while, meaning we could be staring down to shut down March 14?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: Well, we'll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday. I believe the government funding runs out at the end of the week. We're scheduled to end votes on Wednesday. Oftentimes, that does not happen during weeks like this, but it's- it's incumbent upon every legislator to read the text and to make an aggregate decision. Does the good outweigh the bad? We never want to shut the government down. That's why I think we need no budget, no pay. If you cut legislators' funding off, if they don't pass a CR or a budget, I think you'll have a much different outcome. So people need to put their money where their mouth is.",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Right now, the Republicans are counting on all the Republicans in the House to stick together to pass this through the House with no Democratic votes. That's what they're counting on. That's why they've conducted themselves this way. Then it goes to the Senate. In the Senate, you need 60 votes. You don't have 60 votes with the Senate Republicans. So it's going to become a challenge for the Senate Republicans and the Senate Democrats to decide who's going to get blamed for this thing. And wouldn't it be better if we all just work together to try and find common ground the way- this is not normal what we're doing. The idea of a full year continuing resolution is not the normal process. And there's a lot of bad stuff that I see in this bill that I don't like.",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: And I will add Margaret, I've lived through government shutdowns as an FBI agent, and it's horrific. Title Three wire taps get shut down. Surveillance teams get shut down. It has massive implications that most people don't realize. You never, ever want to shut the government down. It should never happen, and it's a symptom of a broken system that we're even talking about this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me follow up with you on that. You are the only FBI agent who- now turned Congressman. On Monday, the top agent at the New York office, James Dennehy, said he was forced out of his job due to clashes with Justice Department officials over a directive. He had been supportive of Bureau leaders who resisted turning over the names of those agents assigned to carry out investigations related to January 6, 2021. Are you concerned about all this political pressure?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: I'm very concerned. I'm a huge defender and supporter of the Bureau. It's the best job I ever had in my life, and the most honorable job I've ever had in my life, keeping America safe. And I care very much about the agent population and the professional support staff that work there. They are tremendous people. They are completely nonpartisan. In 14 years in the FBI, I never heard any political talk whatsoever, which is pretty remarkable, so--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- directly contradicts what the Homeland Security secretary said at the top of this program when she talked- she went at the FBI- the FBI director--",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: -- Well, there are problems at the top. I want to differentiate. So there have been problems on the seventh floor of the J Edgar Hoover Building that they did politicize things, things like- people like Jim Comey, for example, who tweet out, you know, to vote single party during an election. You can't do that as an FBI director. That's terrible. He did it as a former director, but it undermines everything he did leading up to that point. The FBI needs to be completely non-partisan, completely apolitical. Personally, I think that part of the polygraph testing that comes in- so when you're an agent coming through the process, you get tested on drug history, foreign contacts, financial vulnerabilities. They also ought to test political bias as well, just to give the public the assurance that people are coming into the bureau, checking their politics at the door.",
      "REP. TOM SUOZZI: This all comes down to a busting of norms and things that we've been used to for years are all trying to be disrupted. And I think in some ways, very dangerously. We can't see this politicization of the FBI. It's a dangerous thing for our country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to talk to the FBI director about any of this?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: -- Absolutely, absolutely--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- About the firings of the--",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: -- Director Patel he worked on our committee. He was a staffer on the House Intelligence Committee, which I sit. And I look forward to having a conversation with him.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Suozzi, illegal border crossings, as we just discussed, they are at a historic low. President Trump made that point when he was addressing Congress this week. Was he right that- that he didn't need to wait for Congress, that it was really messaging from the White House beyond?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Well, obviously we've seen a reduction in crossings. We saw it under the end of the Biden administration as well, after he did his executive order to say no asylum applications in between the ports of entry. But we need to make a permanent law, and Congress has not done its job for 30 years. So we need to secure the border. We need to fix the broken asylum system, and we need to treat people like human beings by fixing our legal immigration system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have an opening to do any of that, though? The two of you together?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: I was working on this before I became the co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus for about a year with a guy named Morgan Luttrell from Texas. Very conservative, former Navy SEAL guy, talking about the details, trying to build a coalition of business, badges, and the Bible to work together to support an effort like this. Now, Brian and I, as co-chairs of the Problem Solvers Caucus, are taking those efforts and others and trying- and we have a working group as well to say, as soon as that opening arises, we're ready to make a deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know, but you guys are talking about- you can't even agree to keep the lights on, right?--",
      "REP. SUOZZI: -- Okay, but we--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- you're talking about really hard, substantive thing--",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Well what's going to happen is the Homeland Security is going to need money. They're spending money like crazy, and the CR is not going to fix the problem and--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's going to go to reconciliation, a party line vote, right?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: You can't fix everything through reconciliation, and you're going to need- and you can't- certainly can't fix asylum, and you can't- certainly can't fix the Dreamers and a whole bunch of other stuff through reconciliation. There's going to be an opening that's going to come when they need Democratic votes. And my argument to my Democratic colleagues is we should be looking to finally fix this broken immigration system once and for all. Secure the border, fix asylum, Dreamers, farm workers, essential workers and other people that we need to keep our economy open.",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: If I may add, one of the reasons why I'm so excited about Tom being the co-chair is he shares my passion and the passion of so many people about this issue that there is a border security piece and there is an immigration piece. And we're a country of immigrants. All of our families came in to this country through other places, Italy, Ireland--",
      "REP. SUOZZI: -- My father was born in Italy. And for Brennan and Fitzpatrick I got Irish as well.",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK : You know, that's the- that's the huge advantage that we have over our adversaries. It's- we have an endless supply of brilliant people coming into this country. Nobody wants to move to Russia or China or North Korea or Iran, everybody wants to come here. That's a huge economic advantage. It's a huge national security advantage. So we can combine border security and the rule of law with being- bringing the best and brightest people into this country, and also people that are truly fleeing oppression. That's what America is about.",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Margaret, every problem we face in our country is complicated. You know this as well as anybody, everything's complicated. You can't, why don't you just? There's no why don't you just anything. Anybody who says that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --That's an entire political campaign--",
      "REP. SUOZZI: --Right",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why don't you just",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Which doesn't make sense. And so what you need is people who may disagree with each other on certain issues, to sit across from each other say, well, I think this, well, I think that. Well, how about this? Well, how about that? And you try and find a compromise somewhere in the middle. Compromise is not a dirty word, and we have got to figure out how to start moving our country forward, not with this all my way or the highway. You guys are no good because you're one of those. No you're one of those. That's not working for our country. People want us to work together to solve problems.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you, Congressman Fitzpatrick, I know you feel very strongly about supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Ben Hodges, who's a retired general who commanded US Army Europe, said he's having a hard time understanding how withholding intelligence and military support from Ukraine advances strategic interests or helps make America great. Can you explain that?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: Well, I will say this. We're going to get a briefing, a full briefing, on this, this coming week, but I will say this key in on what's not being said here, what kind of intelligence and who can't share it, right? So what I suspect, and I will get confirmation of this next week, is that it's the over-the-horizon intelligence striking into Russian territory.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's also satellite.",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: Possibly, but second--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Maxar technology--",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: We have seamless intelligence sharing with the UK. To give you one example, there's no restriction on the UK sharing that intelligence with Ukraine. So what I suspect is happening here, and I could be proven wrong, is that this is an escalate to de-escalate tactic by the administration, to bring these parties to the table and to come to a conclusion, a just conclusion, which means success and victory for Ukraine. And I want to emphasize that, and I get asked, well, what does that mean? Yep. Vladimir. What victory means for me is Vladimir Putin regrets his decision to invade Ukraine, that he wishes he did not do that, and that's really going to be the test here, right? Because if we reward dictators for invading sovereign, freedom loving democracies, we are sending a message to every other dictator and aspiring dictator across this planet that if you do do that, you will be rewarded. That cannot be the message coming out of this",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Trump has been wrong in the way he's handled this. I want to give Brian credit, as co-chair of the Ukrainian caucus, for standing up and saying, you cannot reward a dictator. Zelensky was elected by 73% of the Ukrainian population in a free and fair election that's dictated by the European Commission that oversees free and fair elections. Putin is the dictator. Putin invaded. Zelensky is democratically elected. We cannot reward the guy responsible for murdering, for kidnapping, for raping, for all the awful things that have happened to the Ukrainian people. We all need to stand up for the Ukrainian people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know that the Secretary of State, the national security adviser and President Trump's envoy are all meeting with Ukrainian officials Tuesday. One of the things that I took note of Congressman Fitzpatrick, you tweeted that you have an outcome determinative number of members of the US Congress who are ready, willing and able to do whatever it takes to prevent Putin from being rewarded. That sounds like you are threatening leverage with votes. How would you use it?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: It's not a threat. What this is is us making very clear that we view this issue to be existential to world peace. These are the lessons of World War II, when we had- when Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and you had leaders, including Neville Chamberlain and many other leaders around the world, saying it's not our problem. We don't want to provoke. We don't want to escalate, and a problem that could have been could have been nipped in the bud early, because it was not, turned out to be the costliest and deadliest war in world history, where we had to send our young, our youth in our country, to fight on Omaha Beach. We should never get to that point. We should learn from the lessons of history. These dictators want to relitigate the outcome of World War II. In World War II freedom won over dictatorships. They want to relitigate that. So we just have to be mindful of history and how we approach this.",
      "REP. SUOZZI: And if Putin gets away with this just because Ukraine is a smaller country, think about Latvia and Lithuania and Estonia and Moldova, and think about Poland, right? They're all next, and we have to stand up against this.",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: And Putin has said that he's telegraphed this punch.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Right, well, President Trump says that it's all different when he's in charge, but Congressman, I need to ask you before you go because of the district and the unique characteristics of it, the one you represent. Earlier this week, we saw guidance from the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee urging members to hold virtual town halls, suggesting that holding them in person was not a good idea. Will you still hold town halls with your constituents?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: Yeah, we, we--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Because some of them have gotten quite heated recently.",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: Oh, I know. No. I think every member needs to find the best way to communicate with our constituents, and there's a number of ways to do that. I think what Chairman Hudson is referring to are the what's turning out to be a circus, a three-ring circus, where you go to a high school gymnasium. The protesters show up. They hold signs up, and you have legitimate concerns from some other people that are never heard because they're getting shouted down by people that are there to make a spectacle, oftentimes that are funded by some of these dark money groups. So there's- it's about communicating to your constituents in a way that you can get your message out, that you can hear their concerns. And every single district does it different, depending on- on where they're at.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You, Congressman Suozzi, during the address to Congress this week, you did see Texas Democrat Congressman Green be disruptive. He was pulled out of the chamber because of that later censured with the votes of nine Democrats, including yourself, and 214 Republicans. Why did you take that vote against a fellow Democrat?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Because if it was a Republican doing the same thing to a Democratic president, I would have voted for that as well. And the bottom line is it was a strategic mistake on the on our behalf as well. Because instead of talking about Social Security cuts and talking about Medicaid cuts and talking about Medicare cuts and talking about the things that the President said in his speech that we disagree with, especially things like Ukraine or firing people in these different departments that make no sense whatsoever. We instead focus too much time on disruptive behavior and the conduct of the Democrats. That was a strategic mistake, as well as something that just is not appropriate for the decorum of the US House of Representatives--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Was the message from Democratic leadership not clear, then?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: --I think that it was pretty clear. I understood a clear message, let's not make the story about us. Let's make the story about what President Trump says and how we disagree with it. And we squandered that opportunity. All right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, gentlemen for doing this in a bipartisan fashion as well.",

      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans unveiled a stopgap measure to keep the government funded through September on Saturday, setting up a vote next week on the measure that would avert a government shutdown. But with less than a week before the deadline, its path to passage remains unclear.",
      "The 99-page\u00a0continuing resolution, or CR,\u00a0would increase defense spending, along with additional funding for veterans' health care, while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels. The bill also includes more funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The House Rules Committee is expected to consider the measure on Monday, with a floor vote expected Tuesday.",
      "President Trump applauded Republicans on social media Saturday saying \"under the circumstances\" the House and Senate have put together a \"very good funding Bill.\" He said all the GOP should stay unified and vote \"yes\" next week.",
      "\"Democrats will do anything they can to shut down our Government, and we can't let that happen,\" he said on Truth Social.",
      "Facing a March 14 deadline to fund the government, House Republicans have been moving forward with a plan to keep spending at current levels for the next six months. But Democrats, who have stepped in to help keep the lights on several times in recent years, aren't eager to come to the GOP's aid this time around. Instead, House Speaker Mike Johnson has been looking to secure the support of a number of consistent Republican holdouts \u2014 a group of hardliners who oppose stopgap measures to fund the government on principle.",
      "Some of the hardliners met with President Trump at the White House on Wednesday. After the meeting, the president wrote on Truth Social that \"Conservatives will love this Bill,\" encouraging his party to get it done.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican who often opposes continuing resolutions, told reporters Thursday that the president believes a continuing resolution is necessary to \"stop Democrats from playing games.\"",
      "\"You're telling me as a conservative, you're going to freeze spending for six months, hold the defense hawks at bay, get everybody in a room and keep getting DOGE transparency and demonstrating all the waste, fraud and abuse that we can then use to go inform FY '26,\" Roy said. \"I'm good with that.\"",
      "Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, a moderate Republican who hails from a swing district, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he hasn't decided how he will vote on the bill, while noting more broadly that \"it remains to be seen whether the votes are there or not.\"",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters Thursday that he expects the resolution will have the votes for passage, outlining that he doesn't anticipate additional no votes among his conference beside Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky.",
      "As for Democrats, Johnson said he's hopeful they will vote in favor of the stopgap measure, saying \"the responsible thing is to keep the government funded.\"",
      "\"If it's a clean CR with minimal anomalies that are necessary, I don't know how they have an argument to vote against it,\" Johnson added.",
      "Meanwhile, House Democratic leaders said Friday that they are opposed to the \"partisan\" stopgap measure, citing concerns about \"funding for healthcare, nutritional assistance and veterans benefits through the end of the current fiscal year.\"",
      "\"That is not acceptable,\" they wrote in a letter to the Democratic caucus on Friday. \"House Democrats would enthusiastically support a bill that protects Social Security, Medicare, veterans health and Medicaid, but Republicans have chosen to put them on the chopping block to pay for billionaire tax cuts. We cannot back a measure that rips away life-sustaining healthcare and retirement benefits from everyday Americans as part of the Republican scheme to pay for massive tax cuts for their wealthy donors like Elon Musk. Medicaid is our redline.\"",
      "The House Democratic leaders\u00a0\u2014\u00a0House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, whip Katherine Clark and caucus chair Pete Aguilar\u00a0\u2014\u00a0said in a statement after the CR's release that the measure exposes the American people \"to further pain throughout this fiscal year.\"",
      "\"We are voting No,\" the leaders said.",
      "Should the stopgap bill make it through the House, it would next head to the Senate for passage. With a 53-seat Republican majority in the upper chamber, support from at least seven Democrats would be needed to approve the measure and send it to the president's desk.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, called the measure in a statement Saturday a \"slush fund continuing resolution that would give Donald Trump and Elon Musk more power over federal spending.\" She urged lawmakers to pass a shorter-term continuing resolution and finish work on new funding bills, instead of \"turning the keys over to the Trump administration with this bill.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to dive right into this trade war.",
      "The justification President Trump invoked these tariffs under had to do with fentanyl. Mexico's president said Thursday that Customs and Border Protection figures show seizures of fentanyl on the southern border have dropped over the past year. She claimed they plummeted 75 percent in the past six months.",
      "Doesn't that show the existing system is working?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We've seen incredible progress as far as what we've been able to stop at the southern border since President Trump has taken office.",
      "And I think that progress can be built on. These partnerships that we have in going after traffickers, cartels, the drug trade, and also human trafficking can be even stronger and built on in the future. That's one of the things we've been asking for, in specific to the Mexican government, is, how can we work better together to make sure we not only have the enforcement mission at the border, but south of the border and make sure we're going after these cartels?",
      "You've seen the president name them as terrorist organizations. And Canada just recently is starting to allow us to access some of their criminal background histories that we need in order to know who's coming across our border and what they're bringing. So, because of his strong stance on tariffs, we're seeing them wanting to be better partners with us to keep our people safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Canada's Prime Minister said it's totally false to claim Canada is unwilling to fight fentanyl. You just indicated they're willing to do more here.",
      "He pointed to CBP data that showed a 97 percent drop in fentanyl seizures from January compared to December, a near zero low, he said.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Yes, we're\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the data accurate?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: The data is getting better. And I would say, in the conversations that I have had this week with Canadian officials, they were hoping to avoid the tariffs, and had a lot of conversations, but not a lot of action.",
      "So this is the hope, is that the fact that President Trump has said something and now has enforced consequences, we really are hoping for even better partnerships. We need access to their criminal background system, so that we know, when someone crosses that northern border, who they are, why they're in our country, and who they may be partnering with.",
      "We also need them to work with us on identifying packages, technology investments. Canada has said they will do that. We just want to see them actually do it. In the past, promises have been made by both Mexico and Canada that they didn't follow through on. Their naming of a fentanyl czar in Canada is important. That's great. Now let's see really what happens.",
      "President Trump has been strong, and I think that's why you've seen the data going our direction. But, boy, every day, people in this country are dying of overdoses. And I don't want any more families to have to deal with that tragedy if we can be \u2013 if it can be avoided and we can have a stronger relationship.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you just gave specific examples of what Canada and Mexico can do presumably to avoid the tariffs that are now being pushed off until April 2.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The commerce secretary said on another network: \"If fentanyl ends, I think these will come off, but if fentanyl does not end, or he's uncertain about it,\" meaning the president, \"they will stay on until he's comfortable.",
      "Is it that general, or are these very specific things that you can kind of go through and check to avoid these tariffs?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Yes, I have had very specific conversations with Canadian officials and Mexican officials on what they can do. So they know what they can do to help avoid tariffs in the future, and what we're expecting of them.",
      "If they do it, we shall see. We all recognize that each one of these leaders has political environments in their home countries as well, but President Trump means business. And he meant it when he ran to be president of the United States again and since he's taken office that he will put America first.",
      "And every day in this country, we have seen over the last several years violence and unsafe streets and cities and people lose their children and grandchildren, and he's taking action to make sure that we're cleaning up the mess that Joe Biden left behind, and that we have a much safer country, and where Americans can look forward to the future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this is not just leverage to get a better free trade deal? This is not just because President Trump truly believes that tariffs are the heart of his economic policy?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying this really is about fentanyl?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: It really is about fentanyl. It really is.",
      "And I think the president obviously wants a strong economy, obviously wants better trade deals as well. But this is about fentanyl and what we can do to stop the cartels from partnering with Chinese officials, laundering money and bringing a poison into our country that is specifically designed to kill the next generation.",
      "I think a lot of people don't understand the strategy\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 of these enemies of the United States and what they're utilizing.",
      "They are bringing this in, not just to make money. They're bringing it in here to kill Americans. And it's time that we stand up for the people that live here and make sure that we're stopping this war against our children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you.Border crossings, they're at a 25-year low.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: They are. It's fantastic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are 6,000 U.S. military personnel working at the border now. That number could go up to 9,000 by the end of the month.",
      "How long do you have to keep them there if the numbers are already dropping like this?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: You know, we'll continue the partnership with the Department of Defense.",
      "But, also, we've got partnerships with Commerce, with the attorney general's office. You know, we're working every day with the secretary of state. We'll keep them there until that border is completely secure. And we see all-time record lows of encounters. Our Border Patrol is doing fantastic work.",
      "But we're going to keep them there until the whole world gets the message that this isn't Joe Biden's world anymore. This is President Donald Trump's country, where we have a border, where we have laws, and it applies equally to everybody. I think that is what is so refreshing, is that we're not picking and choosing winners and losers anymore.",
      "Americans have to live by the law. So do those who come to this country. You have to come here legally, or there will be consequences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what's happening internally when it comes to \u2013 excuse me \u2013 migration.",
      "The administration has revived this policy of detaining migrant families, parents with children, in ICE detention centers. Bush did it. Obama did it. Biden did not. Have you seen these Texas facilities where children are being held with their parents? Are you comfortable with it personally?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We've got detention facilities across the country, and there's specific ones that are built specifically for families if they are detained.",
      "But, remember, everybody has an option. They have an option to be here legally or illegally, and they can self-deport as well. We've set up a system and a Web site where people who are here illegally right now can register, and they can choose to go home on their own and keep their families united.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The kids don't have a choice in this. You know that.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, the kids do have a choice. If they have parents, they make a choice to keep their families together, if they want to or not. They \u2013 if parents make a decision to leave their children behind, then that's a choice that they made as a family.",
      "And we need to remember that when Americans break the law, and they have consequences or face a situation, they're separated from their families too. I don't believe we should prioritize people from other countries above Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when it comes to reviving the policy of separating families from their children at the border\u2026",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: I don't know that we're actually reviving it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what I want to ask you.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: It's that President Biden didn't follow the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You won't\u2026",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: He didn't follow the law, in the fact that it's always been equally applied until his administration, and then he made decisions to ignore federal law in how he handled immigration and enforcement within our borders.",
      "And so, today, we're \u2013 we're expanding our team at ICE, and we're going to have an acting director in Todd Lyons, who has a long history with Tom Homan. They have worked together to build on these enforcement operations. We're also naming a deputy secretary in Madison Sheahan. That was going to be another expansion of this team.",
      "They have done incredible work cleaning up our communities and making them safer. Adding more people to the team, with Todd and with Madison, is going to allow us to partner with local law enforcement officials to make sure that we truly are following through on enforcing the law. And, if you break our law, then there's going to be consequences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: al Qaeda you want the number of deportations to tick up?",

      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We are giving them that opportunity to do that, and we will help facilitate that. And if they don't, and they end up coming into our enforcement opportunities that we have in front of us, you know, they may never get the chance to come back. So people need to remember, if they self-deport, they will have an opportunity to come back to this country legally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you have a capacity issue right now in terms of just beds to put people in when you detain them. Are you going to open up military facilities like Fort Bliss?",

      "But, also, we need to remember to ask \u2013 Congress needs to continue through with funding that this administration has asked for. You know, we clearly have a C.R. discussion in front of us this week. We have a reconciliation discussion. That reconciliation bill needs to happen. We have just weeks before we are out of the funds to continue the operations that \u2013 that we have.",
      "And even \u2013 everywhere I have been in this country out there, looking at what President Trump has done on immigration and border enforcement, the people that I meet are saying, thank you. Thank you for getting these terrorists out of the country. He has deported\u2026",

      "So they will be prosecuted, and they could face up to 10 years in federal prison because they did that. Anyone who is leaking information outside of \u2013 of how something is planned for the safety of those law enforcement officers needs to be held accountable for that.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard the homeland security secretary say there are conversations with your government. She seemed optimistic that there would be follow-through on fentanyl.",
      "Does that make you think the threat of tariffs on April 2 is something that can be managed and avoided?",
      "AMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Well, I hope so.",
      "I mean, it \u2013 I think that we are in a very good place in our discussions with the U.S. administration on fentanyl. We have invested a lot of new resources. We have given our law enforcement new powers. And we have responded to the requests of the Trump administration with respect to cooperative effects in getting at the sources, so the organized crime, the precursors coming from China.",
      "We've had some really, really good discussions. So we're optimistic. And, you know, I just would say, and I think it's important for your viewers to know, fentanyl is a very serious problem in Canada too. On some days, we have more deaths per capita than you have here in the United States.",
      "So we take this very seriously. It is not a big issue between our two countries. Less than 1 percent of the fentanyl that is seized in the United States is coming from Canada, but every ounce can kill families and people. So we're taking it very seriously.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you are indulging the premise that that is the actual motivation for the tariffs, rather than leverage for a free trade deal or just because President Trump believes in them?",

      "There are other tariffs that have been discussed, and the president has raised other issues as motivations for other tariffs, reciprocity and fairness, and, you know, maybe some changes that he'd like to see to our USMCA, our trade agreement. So those conversations are going to have to happen as well.",

But, really, all we can do is focus on the real work at hand, which is to get at these issues, like, for example, lumber. Canada doesn't have a tariff on lumber. It's zero. U.S. lumber can come into Canada duty-free.",
      "On dairy, the U.S. sells three times as much dairy into Canada as we sell into the United States. So, what's more, I think, productive for us is to talk about the facts around the actual trading relationship and try and get at where the concerns are.",

      "AMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: In sugar and dairy, you allow a certain amount of product in, and then, after that level is hit, you put restraints in on imports.

      "So it's a long relationship, and has many \u2013 has had many phases to it. We will have a new prime minister this week. Today, the Liberal Party will elect a new leader. That new leader will be sworn in, in the coming days, and that person will become Canada's prime minister. Those are facts that are not going to change.",

      "What I can say is that Canadians don't really appreciate it. They're getting a little bit frustrated with that kind of rhetoric. But, more importantly, Canadians are frustrated with our neighbors, you know, the country that we feel closest to, the country that is partners, allies, often family that we've gone to war with, that we've died with, that we come to each other's aid, most recently in L.A., but obviously 9/11.",
      "You've come to our aid over the years so many times. And we feel \u2013 Canadians feel under attack, under economic attack. And that is causing some challenges, for sure, across Canadian society.

      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And there's a lot of bad stuff that I see in this bill that I don't like.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And I will add, Margaret, I've lived through government shutdowns as an FBI agent, and it's horrific. Title Three wire taps get shut down, surveillance teams get shut down. It is massive implications that most people don't realize. You never ever want to shut the government down. It should never happen. And it's a symptom of a broken system that we're even talking about this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me follow up with you on that. You are the only FBI agent who - now a congressman. On Monday, the top agent at the New York office, James Dennehy, said he was forced out of his job due to clashes with Justice Department officials over directives. He had been supportive of bureau leaders who resisted turning over the nations of those agents assigned to carry out investigations related to January the 6th, 2021. Are you concerned about all this political pressure?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: I'm very concerned. I'm a huge defender and supporter of the bureau. It was the best job I ever had in my life, and most honorable job I've ever had in my life, keeping America safe. And I care very much about the agent population and the professional support staff that worked there. They're a tremendous people. They are completely nonpartisan. At 14 years in the FBI, I never heard any political talk whatsoever, which is pretty remarkable. So -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That directly contradicts what the Homeland Security secretary said at the top of this program when she talked - she went at the FBI. The FBI director was -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, there have been conflicts at the top. I want - I want to differentiate. So, there have been problems on the seventh floor of the J. Edgar Hoover Building that they did politicize things, things like - people like Jim Comey, for example, who tweet out, you know, to vote single party during an election. You can't do that as an FBI director. That's terrible. He did it as a former director, but it undermines everything he did leading up to that point.",
      "The FBI needs to be completely nonpartisan, completely apolitical. Personally, I think that part of the polygraph testing that comes in, so when you're an agent coming through the process, you get tested on drug history, foreign contacts, financial vulnerabilities. They also ought to test political bias as well, just to give the public the assurance that people are coming into the bureau, checking their politics at the door.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: This all comes down to a busting of norms. And things that we've been used to for years are all trying to be disrupted, and I think, in some ways, very dangerously. We can't see this politization of the FBI. It's a dangerous thing for our country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to talk to the FBI director about any of this?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Absolutely. Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: About the firing for the political (INAUDIBLE)?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: On past - Director - Director Patel worked on our committee.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: He was a staffer on the House Intelligence Committee, which I sit. And I look forward to having a conversation with him.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Suozzi, illegal border crossings, as we just discussed, they are at a historic low. President Trump made that point when he was addressing Congress this week. Was he right that - that he didn't need to wait for Congress, that it was really messaging from the White House beyond?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Well, obviously, we've seen a reduction in crossings. We saw it under the end of the Biden administration as well after he did his executive order to say, no, asylum applications are between the ports of entry. But we need to make it permanent law. And Congress has not done its job for 30 years. So, we need to secure the border, we need to fix the broken asylum system and we need to treat people like human beings by fixing our legal immigration system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have an opening to do any of that, though?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: I -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The two of you together?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: I - I was working on this before I became the co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus for about a year with a guy named Morgan Lutrell (ph) from Texas, very conservative, former Navy SEAL guy, talking about the details, trying to build a coalition of business, badges and the Bible to work together to support an effort like this.",
      "Now Brian and I, as co-chairs of the Problem Solvers Caucus are taking those efforts and others and trying - and we have a working group as well to say, as soon as that opening arises, we're ready to make a deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know, but you guys are talking about, you can't even agree to keep the lights on, right?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: OK, but we -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Like, you're talking about really hard, substantive things.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Well, what's going to happen is the - Homeland Security is going to need money.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: They're - they're spending money like crazy and the CR is not going to fix the problem. And at some -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's going to go to reconciliation, party line vote, right?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: If - you can't fix everything through reconciliation. And you're going to need - and you can't - certainly can't fix asylum and you certainly can't fix the dreamers and a whole bunch of other stuff through reconciliation. There is going to be an opening that's going to come when they need Democratic votes. And my argument to my Democratic colleagues is, we should be looking to finally fix this broken immigration system once and for all. Secure the border, fix asylum, dreamers, farm workers, essential workers and other people that we need to keep our economy open.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And if I may add, one of the reasons why I'm so excited about Tom being the co-chair is he shares my passion and the passion of so many people about this issue that there is a border security piece and there is an immigration piece. And we're a country of immigrants. All of our families came into this country through other places, Italy, Ireland.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: My father was born in Italy.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And for Brian (ph) Fitzpatrick, Irish as well.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And, you know, that's the - that's the huge advantage that we have over our adversaries, is, we have an endless supply of brilliant people coming into this country. Nobody wants to move to Russia or China or North Korea or Iran. Everybody wants to come here. That's a huge economic advantage. It's a huge national security advantage.",
      "So, we can combine border security and the rule of law with being - bringing the best and brightest people into this country and also people that are truly fleeing oppression. And that's what America is about.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Margaret, every problem we face in our country is complicated. You know this as well as anybody. Everything's complicated. You can't, why don't you just?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: There's no, why don't you just anything. Anybody who says that doesn't know what they're talking about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's an entire political campaign, why don't you just.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Right. Right. Which doesn't make sense.",
      "And so what you need is people who may disagree with each other on certain issues -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Just sit across from each other and say, well, I think this, well I think that, well how about this, well how about that, and you try and find a compromise somewhere in the middle.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Compromise is not a dirty word. And we have got to figure out how to start moving our country forward, not with this all my way or the highway, you guys are no good because you're one of those - no, you're on of those.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: It's not working for our country. People want us to work together to solve problems.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you, Congressman Fitzpatrick, I know you feel very strongly about supporting Ukraine and its fight against Russia. Ben Hodges, who's a retired general who commanded U.S. Army Europe, said he's having a hard time understanding how withholding intelligence, and military support from Ukraine, advances strategic interests or helps make America great.",
      "Can you explain that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, I will say this, we're going to get a briefing - a full briefing on this, this coming week. But I will say this, key in on what's not being said here. What kind of intelligence and who can't share it, right? So, what I suspect, and I will get confirmation of this next week, is that it's the over the horizon intelligence striking into Russian territory.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's also satellite.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Possibly. But, second, we -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Maxar technologies cannot (INAUDIBLE).",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We have seamless intelligence sharing with the U.K., to give you one example. There's no restriction on the U.K. sharing that intelligence with Ukraine. So, what I suspect is happening here, and I could be proven wrong, this that this an escalate to de- escalate tactic by the administration to bring these parties to the table and to come to a conclusion, a just conclusion, which means success and victory for Ukraine. And I want to emphasize that. And I get asked, well, what does that mean?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Vladimir - what victory means for me is Vladimir Putin regrets his decision to invade Ukraine. That he wishes he did not do that. And that's really going to be the test here, right, because if we reward dictators from invading sovereign, freedom-loving democracies, we are sending a message to every other dictator and aspiring dictator across this plant that, if you do do that, you will be rewarded. That cannot be the message coming out of this.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Trump has been wrong in the way he's handled this. I want to give Brian credit as co-chair of the Ukrainian Caucus, for standing up and saying, you cannot reward a dictator. Zelenskyy was elected by 73 percent of the Ukrainian population in a free and fair election as dictated by the European Commission that oversees free and fair elections. Putin is the dictator. Putin invaded. Zelenskyy is democratically elected. We cannot reward the guy responsible for murdering, for kidnapping, for raping, for all the awful things that have happened to the Ukrainian people. We all need to stand up for the Ukrainian people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know that the secretary of state, the national security adviser and President Trump's envoy are all meeting with Ukrainian officials Tuesday. One of the things that I took note of, Congressman Fitzpatrick, you tweeted that you have an outcome determinative number of members of the U.S. Congress who ready, willing and able to do whatever it takes to prevent Putin from being rewarded. That sounds like you are threatening leverage with votes. How would you use it?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: It's not - it's not a threat. What this is, is us making very clear that we view this issue to be existential to world peace. These are the lessons of World War II. When we had - when Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and you had leaders, including Neville Chamberlain and many other leaders around the world saying it's not our problem, we don't want to provoke, we don't want to escalate. And a problem that could have been nipped in the bud early, because it was not, turned out to be the costliest and deadliest war in world history where we had to send our young - our youth in our country to fight on Omaha beach. We should never get to that point. We should learn from the lessons of history.",
      "These dictators want to relitigate the outcome of World War II. And World War II, freedom won over dictatorship. They want to relitigate that. So, we just have to be mindful of history and how we approach this.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And if Putin gets away with this, just because Ukraine is a smaller country, think about Latvia and Lithuania and Estonia and Moldova and think about Poland.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: They're all next. And we have to stand up against this.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And Putin has said that. He's telegraphed this punch.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, President Trump says, oh, it's all different when he's in charge.",
      "But, Congressman, I need to ask you, before you go, because of the districts and the unique characteristics of it, the one you represent, earlier this week we saw guidance from the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee urging members to hold virtual town halls, suggesting that holding them in person was not a good idea. Will you still hold town halls with your constituents?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Yes. We - we communicate -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because some have gotten quite heated recently.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Oh, I know. No, I think every member needs to find the best way to communicate with their constituents. And there's a number of ways to do that. I think what Chairman Hudson is referring to are the - what's turning out to be a circus, a three-ring circus, where you go to a high school gymnasium, the protesters shows up, they hold signs up, and you have legitimate concerns from some other people that are never heard because they're getting shouted down by people that are there to make a spectacle, oftentimes that are funded by some of these dark money groups.",
      "So, there's - it's about communicating to your constituents in a way that you can get your message out, that you can hear their concerns. And every single district does it different depending on - on where they're at.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You, Congressman Suozzi, during the address to Congress this week, you did see Texas Democrat Congressman Green be disruptive. He was pulled out of the chamber because of that. Later censured with the votes of nine Democrats, including yourself, and 214 Republicans. Why did you take that vote against a fellow Democrat?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Because if it was a Republican doing the same thing to a Democratic president, I would have voted for that as well. And the bottom line is, it was a strategic mistake on the part - on our behalf as well because instead of talking about Social Security cuts, and talking about Medicaid cuts and talking about Medicare cuts, and talking about the things that the president said in his speech that we disagree with, especially things like Ukraine or firing people in these different departments that makes no sense whatsoever, we, instead, focus too much time on disruptive behavior.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And the conduct of the Democrats. That was a strategic mistake, as well as something that just is not appropriate for the decorum of the U.S. House of Representatives.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was - was that message from Democratic leadership not clear then?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: I think that it was pretty clear. I understood a clear message.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Let's not make the story about us, let's make the story about what President Trump says and how we disagree with it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And we squandered that opportunity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, thank you, gentlemen -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For doing this in a bipartisan fashion as well.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: You bet.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Russia stepped up its aerial attacks on Ukraine following the Trump administration's suspension of intelligence sharing and military equipment. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Moscow has carried out hundreds of attacks using ballistic missiles and drones.",
      "For more now, we're joined by Fiona Hill. She is a senior fellow at Brookings and during the first Trump administration she was the senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council.",
      "Good to have you back.",
      "FIONA HILL (Senior Fellow, Brookings and Fromer National Security Council Senior Director for European and Russian Affairs): Yes, thanks, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the U.S. pauses of lethal intelligence sharing, including targeting data for U.S.-provided weapons like HIMARS. We also know it extends to satellite imagery, which is no longer being shared with Ukraine.",
      "What's the practical impact of that and the military freeze?",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, I think we can see the impact. It's certainly, on the one hand, emboldened Russia to really step up the attacks, and it's also not just blindsided but also partially blinded Ukraine. I mean, we heard from the previous segment that there's still some sharing with allies, like the United Kingdom, of course, which is part of the Five Eyes sharing with the United States. But frankly, none of the other allies, including the U.K., have the same access to satellite imagery as the United States does. So, even if there is, you know, some sharing, not much restrictions, there certainly has an impact.",
      "And, frankly, I think it's going to be an impetus to other allies to start stepping up their own capabilities and questioning themselves about the virtues of sharing with the United States. I mean, this is a two-way street. We have to remember that other countries also share pretty vital information with the United States, even if the scale is not quite the same.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Canada, the U.K., Australia, among those who do so. You think they will essentially punish the U.S. by not sharing intelligence freely?",
      "FIONA HILL: I'm not sure whether it's punishment, but it will be a lot of questioning about what actually happens with this. Because if you're bundling together intelligence, then effectively the United States is putting restrictions on that. Was that pre-discussed with our five eyes allies, for example, or with other allies, particularly in the midst of basically a conflict that is, as we've heard, you know, over and over again, the largest land war in Europe since World War II. I mean, this is really unprecedented in terms of the actions of the United States in this regard because he's not just affecting Ukraine, again, it's having knock-on effects for all of our other allies who are directly affected, all of our European allies that are directly affected by this conflict.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Trump said on Friday when he was asked if this uptick in Putin's bombing was directly related to the U.S. halt. Here's what he said.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I actually think he's doing what anybody else would do. I think he's - I think he wants to get it stopped and settled, and I think he's hitting them harder than - than he's been hitting them. And I think probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yet earlier in the day, the president had posted on social media he was considering possibly putting sanctions on Russia. That's a contradiction. What do you make of what he said?",
      "FIONA HILL: I make of it exactly what he said. I mean, he's actually, obviously, putting himself in the shoes of Vladimir Putin and saying that if I were the aggressor, that's exactly what I would be doing if I wanted to make Ukraine capitulate. So, I mean, yes, he called it as it is. I don't believe what he said for a second about the sanctions. I believe more what he just said there in the Oval Office, sitting behind, you know, the Resolute Desk. I mean,n I think that's what you can take away from this. He accurately -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Believe the president and when he says things?",
      "FIONA HILL: That's - I think you should. Yes. I mean, he's the president of the United States. And he made it crystal clear, I think. And he sees, you know, obviously, the Ukraine - the Ukrainians, and he said that in the Oval Office during the meeting with President Zelenskyy, that he sees them on the back foot as losing, and he's basically telling them that they have to capitulate. Very clear.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't have the cards was the line. He kept using that.",
      "FIONA HILL: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know you were at the Council on Foreign Relations this week, as was I. I had an interview with Trump's envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg. And when we were discussing the president's decision to cut off Ukraine, he said, Ukrainians brought it on themselves, and the decision was, like, quote, \"hitting a mule with a two by four across the nose, you got their attention.\"",
      "It's quite a statement, comparing our ally to a farm animal here that needed to be beaten. Do you think it was right to say the Ukrainian government, though, was just not getting it?",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, what they weren't getting is really what President Trump wanted directly from them, which was obviously to have President Zelenskyy make a personal agreement with him in the Oval Office in front of all the cameras to thank him profusely for all the aid that was already provided to Ukraine over, you know, successive administrations now, and basically to sign a deal on rare earths minerals and then basically leave immediately after that. And clearly, President Zelenskyy didn't really get that message.",
      "And I think there's a very important element here. In diplomacy, you really should not only be speaking in your native language. And I think that a lot of this was lost in translation. First of all, President Zelenskyy didn't fully understand that this agreement was just purely with President Trump. And you may remember, if we all go back and watch that - I watched it many times just to try to figure out exactly where things had gone wrong, and there were multiple points. But there's one point when President Zelenskyy basically said, look, you know, we had deals with your - your previous presidents, basically with Obama and Biden. And President Trump immediately dismissed all of that and basically said those deals were not worth the paper they were written on, or the commitments that were made because they were weak and it wasn't me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it was not me.",
      "FIONA HILL: And President Zelenskyy didn't quite follow all of this because, like the rest of our allies, he actually thinks that commitments made by the United States are supposed to hold over successive administrations. And what we learned there, what he learned there, was that is not the case. You're essentially going to have to make a new commitment with President Trump. It's a personal commitment. And that was what he was being told, and he didn't fully understand.",
      "And I think in the future, when the Ukrainians are meeting with the Americans, they ought to have translators with them because as good as President Zelenskyy's English is, there's two things that he's missing there. He doesn't quite understand the way that President Trump operates -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FIONA HILL: Although I think he's probably got the message now, but he doesn't always understand the nuances. And I would also think that our side on the United States side could do with some interpretation as well, coming also from President Zelenskyy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FIONA HILL: So, my advice to President Zelenskyy and to the team around President Trump is, use interpreters, that's what they're there for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And your own government's interpreters?",
      "FIONA HILL: That's absolutely right, your own government's interpreters, no (ph), because you actually asked that question, who's interpreters were used and General Kellogg couldn't answer the question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, for Steve Witkoff, who met with Putin for three and a half hours.",
      "FIONA HILL: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Europe seems to be taking these threats seriously and looking at an alternative to the American nuclear deterrent. An umbrella. That's - does that mean the transatlantic alliance is gone?",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, it doesn't mean that it's gone, but there's a bit of a kind of a one-sided attempt to rupture it here on the part of the United States.",
      "I was also at the Munich Security Conference. I heard Vice President Vance's speech. I was standing next to a couple of very prominent Europeans who were completely in shock.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FIONA HILL: And immediately after that, as you well know, there were many statements coming out of Germany, as well as countries like Sweden, basically asking whether the United States could be trusted on nuclear weapons.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.",
      "FIONA HILL: But we have to remember that Ukraine had nuclear weapons that it gave.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they gave them up.",
      "FIONA HILL: That's correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: With the promise of a security guarantee that was not delivered on.",
      "FIONA HILL: Correct.",

      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is preparing to lose an additional 1,029 employees, according to sources that spoke to CBS News. As part of the Office of Management and Budget and Office of Personnel Management's mandate for agencies to submit reduction in force plans, which are due by March 13, NOAA will be presenting its plan to the Department of Commerce by Tuesday evening with the proposed cuts.",
      "The Department of Commerce will get a chance to review the proposal and either accept NOAA's suggestions, or it could ask the agency to make additional changes that would increase or decrease this next round of terminations. Alongside the loss of staff will also be the elimination of programs that currently operate under NOAA's purview. It's not known which programs will be impacted.",
      "As one of several scientific agencies within the federal government, NOAA is responsible for everything from weather forecasts, to coastal restoration, managing fisheries, and supporting marine commerce. NOAA's work supports and affects more than one-third of America's gross domestic product, according to the agency.",

In addition to employees who accepted the \"fork in the road\" buyouts that were offered by the Office of Personnel Management in February, NOAA could potentially see a combined loss of 20% of its staff with this next round of cuts. Before January 2025, NOAA's workforce exceeded 12,000 people worldwide with more than 50% being scientists and engineers.",
      "A key department within NOAA is the National Weather Service, which is responsible for forecasts, issuing severe weather warnings, and providing other key weather-related services that are vital to protecting public safety. That department already lost hundreds of employees due to scheduled retirements, buyouts, and fired probationary workers. Because of some errors in those probationary firings, a select few at three regional offices have been asked to return to work, but it's unclear how many employees at the National Weather Service have been reinstated.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Kirsten Hillman, U.S. ambassador to Canada, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 9, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was our Ed O'Keefe in Ottawa. We're joined now by Canada's Ambassador to the United States, Kirsten Hillman. Ambassador, it's good to have you here.",
      "CANADIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Thanks for having me, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard the Homeland Security Secretary say there are conversations with your government. She seemed optimistic that there would be follow through on fentanyl. Does that make you think the threat of tariffs on April 2 is something that can be managed and avoided?",
      "HILLMAN: Well, I hope so. I mean, I think that we are in a very good place in our discussions with the U.S. administration on fentanyl. We have invested a lot of new resources, we have given our law enforcement new powers and we have responded to the requests of the Trump Administration with respect to cooperative effects in getting at the sources, so the organized crime, the precursors coming from China. We've had some really, really good discussions, so we're optimistic. And, you know, I just would say, and I think it's important for your viewers to know fentanyl is a very serious problem in Canada too. On some days we have more deaths per capita than you have here in the United States. So we take this very seriously. It is not a big issue between our two countries. Less than 1 percent of the fentanyl that is seized in the United States is coming from Canada, but every ounce can kill families and people. So we're taking it very seriously,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, you are indulging the premise that that is the actual motivation for the tariffs, rather than leverage for a free trade deal, or just because President Trump believes in them?",
      "HILLMAN: Well, I think that this set of tariffs, the 25 and 10 percent set of tariffs, are- we have been told repeatedly that it is about fentanyl and security at the border. There are other tariffs that have been discussed and the President has raised other issues as motivations for other tariffs, reciprocity and fairness, and you know, maybe some changes that he'd like to see to our USMCA, our trade agreement. So those conversations are going to have to happen as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Trump said Friday he may put tariffs on Canadian lumber and dairy Monday or Tuesday. Here's what he said. Take a listen:",
      "SOT DONALD TRUMP: Canada has been ripping us off for years on tariffs for lumber and for dairy products. 250 percent, nobody ever talks about that. 250 percent tariff, which is taking advantage of our farmers. So that's not going to happen anymore. We're going to be- they'll be met with the exact same tariff unless they drop it. And that's what reciprocal means.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On another network, the Commerce Secretary said, no, that's actually on hold till April 2. It's confusing for us to follow this along. Is the clarity with the two governments any better?",
      "HILLMAN: You know we are in active discussions with Secretary Lutnick, and those discussions are heading towards April 2, and that, I think, is we are putting our energy in the substantive discussions that we are having with the secretary, with USTR, with the White House. And you know, that is, I guess, how I can answer that question. The President- the President does have a variety of concerns, and I think also sees tariffs as a tool for a variety of policy objectives, but really, all we can do is focus on the real work at hand, which is to get at these issues. Like, for example, lumber, Canada doesn't have a tariff on lumber. It's zero. U.S. lumber can come into Canada duty-free. On dairy, the U.S. sells three times as much dairy into Canada as we sell into the United States. So what's more, I think productive for us is to talk about the facts around the actual trading relationship and try and get at where the concerns are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, Canada does put a tariff as high as 241 percent on dairy imports, but it's a sliding scale that only kicks in at a certain level, and that's under the free trade deal.",
      "HILLMAN: That's right, and it's like the United States. In agriculture, the United States is the same in sugar and dairy. You allow a certain amount of product in, and then after that level is hit, you put restraints in on imports. And we do the same to protect our farmers and families and you know, small family farms that- that need to be sure that they can have a bit of the market.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there was this 50-minute phone call Wednesday with the Vice President, the Commerce Secretary and President Trump, with your Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau. Afterwards, the president posted that Trudeau was unable to tell him when the election was taking place, which made him curious. Like, quote, \"what's going on here? I then realized he's trying to use this issue to stay in power.\" Do you think this is like a personal issue here? Do you think it'll change when your leadership changes?",
      "HILLMAN: It's hard for me to- hard for me to say. I think that the prime minister and the president- Prime Minister Trudeau and the president, they've done big things together, right? They did renegotiate NAFTA together\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They have a history together.",
      "HILLMAN: Right. They have a long history. They did good things together. They managed our 6,000- practically 6,000 mile border during COVID very successfully, in my opinion. So it's a long relationship, and has many- has had many phases to it. We will have a new prime minister this week. Today, the Liberal Party will elect a new leader. That new leader will be sworn in in the coming days, and that person will become Canada's Prime Minister. Those are facts that are not going to change.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think it will stop the vows from the president to talk about threatening to annex Canada?",
      "HILLMAN: You know, I guess\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What is that?",
      "HILLMAN: I- I'm not sure what that is. What I can say is that Canadians don't really appreciate it. They're getting a little bit frustrated with that kind of rhetoric. But more importantly, Canadians are frustrated with our neighbors. You know, the country that we feel closest to, the country that is partners, allies, often family that we've gone to war with, that we've died with, that we come to each other's aid, most recently in LA, but obviously 9/11. You've come to our aid over the years so many times, and we feel- Canadians feel under attack, under economic attack, and that is causing some challenges, for sure, across Canadian society. I think our new prime minister, when that person comes in, will prioritize trying to have a good and- and healthy and productive relationship with the present. I am sure that that's going to be possible. Relationships go both ways, but I know that on our side, that's going to be a priority.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, thank you for joining us, and we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 9, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 We begin this morning with the Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem. Madam Secretary, good to have you in person. Thank you for joining us.",
      "SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY KRISTI NOEM: Good morning. Thank you for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I want to dive right into this trade war. The justification President Trump invoked these tariffs under had to do with fentanyl. Mexico's president said Thursday that Customs and Border Protection figures show seizures of fentanyl on the southern border have dropped over the past year. She claimed they plummeted 75% in the past six months. Doesn't that show the existing system is working?",
      "10:32:23",
      "SECRETARY NOEM:\u00a0 We've seen incredible progress as far as what we've been able to stop at the southern border since President Trump has taken office. And I think that progress can be built on. These partnerships that we have in going after traffickers, cartels, the drug trade, and also human trafficking, can be even stronger and built on in the future. That's one of the things we've been asking for, in specific to the Mexican government, is how can we work better together to make sure we not only have the enforcement mission at the border, but south of the border and make sure we're going after these cartels. You've seen the President name them as terrorist organizations. And Canada, just recently, is starting to allow us to access some of their criminal background histories that we need in order to know who's coming across our border and what they're bringing. So, because of his strong stance on tariffs, we're seeing them wanting to be better partners with us to keep our people safe.",
      "10:33:16",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So Canada's Prime Minister said it's totally false to claim Canada is unwilling to fight fentanyl. You just indicated they're willing to do more here. He pointed to CBP data that showed a 97% drop in fentanyl seizures from January compared to December, a near zero low, he said.",
      "SECRETARY NOEM:\u00a0 Yeah we're--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --is the data accurate?",
      "10:33:36",
      "SECRETARY NOEM:\u00a0 The data is getting better. And I would say in the conversations that I've had this week with Canadian officials, they were hoping to avoid the tariffs, and had a lot of conversations, but not a lot of action. So this is the hope, is that the fact that President Trump has said something and now has enforced consequences, we really are hoping for even better partnerships. We need access to their criminal background system so that we know when someone crosses that northern border who they are, why they're in our country, and who they may be partnering with. We also need them to work with us on identifying packages, technology investments. Canada has said they will do that. We just want to see them actually do it. In the past, promises have been made by both Mexico and Canada that they didn't follow through on. Their naming of a fentanyl czar in Canada is important. That's great. Now let's see really what happens. President Trump has been strong, and I think that's why you've seen the data going our direction, but boy, every day people in this country are dying of overdoses, and I don't want any more families to have to deal with that tragedy if we can be- if it can be avoided and we can have a stronger relationship.",
      "10:34:43",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So you just gave specific examples of what Canada and Mexico can do, presumably, to avoid the tariffs that are now being pushed off until April 2. The Commerce Secretary said on another network, if fentanyl ends, I think these will come off, but if fentanyl does not end, or he's uncertain about it, meaning the president, they will stay on until he's comfortable. Is it that general, or are these very specific things that you can kind of go through and check to avoid these tariffs.",
      "10:35:11",
      "SECRETARY NOEM:\u00a0 I've had very specific conversations with Canadian officials and Mexican officials on what they can do so they know what they can do to help avoid tariffs in the future, and what we're expecting of them. If they do it, we shall see. We all recognize that each one of these leaders has political environments in their home countries as well, but President Trump means business, and he meant it when he ran to be President of the United States again, and since he's taken office, that he will put America first. And every day in this country, we have seen over the last several years, violence and unsafe streets and cities and people lose their children and grandchildren, and he's taking action to make sure that we're cleaning up the mess that Joe Biden left behind, and that we have a much safer country and where Americans can look forward to the future.",
      "10:36:01",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So this is not just leverage to get a better free trade deal. This is not just because President Trump truly believes that tariffs are the heart of his economic policy?",
      "SECRETARY NOEM:\u00a0 Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 You're saying this really is about fentanyl?",
      "10:36:12",
      "SECRETARY NOEM:\u00a0 It really is about fentanyl. It really is. And I think the President obviously wants a strong economy, obviously wants better trade deals as well. But this is about fentanyl and what we can do to stop the cartels from partnering with Chinese officials, laundering money and bringing a poison into our country that is specifically designed to kill the next generation. I think a lot of people don't understand the strategy of these enemies of the United States and what they're utilizing. They are bringing this in, not just to make money, they're bringing it in here to kill Americans. And it's time that we stand up for the people that live here and make sure that we're stopping this war against our children.",
      "10:36:47",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I want to ask you, border crossings, they're at a 25 year low.",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: They are. It's fantastic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are 6,000 US military personnel working at the border now, that number could go up to 9,000 by the end of the month. How long do you have to keep them there if the numbers are already dropping like this?",
      "10:37:02",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: You know, we'll continue the partnership with the Department of Defense, but also we've got partnerships with Commerce, with the Attorney General's office, you know, we're working every day with the Secretary of State. We'll keep them there until that border is completely secure, and we see all time record lows of encounters. Our border patrol is doing fantastic work, but we're going to keep them there until the whole world gets the message that this isn't Joe Biden's world anymore. This is President Donald Trump's country where we have a border, where we have laws and it applies equally to everybody. I think that is what is so refreshing, is that we're not picking and choosing winners and losers anymore. Americans have to live by the law, so do those who come to this country. You have to come here legally, or there will be consequences.",
      "10:37:49",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what's happening internally when it comes to, excuse me, migration. The administration has revived this policy of detaining migrant families, parents with children in ICE detention centers. Bush did it, Obama did it, Biden did not. Have you seen these Texas facilities where children are being held with their parents? Are you comfortable with it personally?",
      "10:38:10",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: We've got detention facilities across the country, and there's specific ones that are built specifically for families if they are detained. But remember, everybody has an option. They have an option to be here legally or illegally, and they can self-deport as well. We've set up a system and a website where people who are here illegally right now can register, and they can choose to go home on their own and keep their families united.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The kids don't really have a choice in this--",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: Well, the kids do have a choice. If they have parents, they make a choice to keep their families together, if they want to or not. They- if parents make a decision to leave their children behind, then that's a choice that they made as a family. And we need to remember that when Americans break the law and they have consequences or face a situation, they're separated from their families, too. I don't believe we should prioritize people from other countries above Americans.",
      "10:38:59",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 But when it comes to reviving the policy of separating families from their children at the border--",
      "10:39:04",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: I don't know that we're actually reviving it--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what I want to ask you--",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: --President Biden didn't follow the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You won't?",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: He didn't follow the law in the fact that it's always been equally applied until his administration, and then he made decisions to ignore federal law in how he handled immigration and enforcement within our borders. And so today, we're- we're expanding our team at ICE, and we're going to have an acting director in Todd Lyons, who has a long history with Tom Homan, they have worked together to build on these enforcement operations. We're also naming a deputy secretary in Madison Sheahan, that was going to be another expansion of this team. They have done incredible work cleaning up our communities and making them safer. Adding more people to the team, with Todd and with Madison, is going to allow us to partner with local law enforcement officials to make sure that we truly are following through on enforcing the law, and if you break our law, then there's going to be consequences.",
      "10:39:58",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want the number of deportations to tick up?",
      "10:40:01",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: I do. Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So--",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: People- remember, they have an option to go home on their own. We are giving them that opportunity to do that, and we will help facilitate that. And if they don't, and they end up coming into our enforcement opportunities that we have in front of us, you know, they may never get the chance to come back. So people need to remember, if they self-deport, they will have an opportunity to come back to this country legally.",
      "10:40:25",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 But you have a capacity issue right now in terms of just beds to put people in when you detain them. Are you going to open up military facilities like Fort Bliss?",
      "10:40:33",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: \u00a0There is, yes, a plan to use the facilities at Fort Bliss for detention facilities. But also we need to remember to ask- Congress needs to continue through with funding that this administration has asked for. You know, we clearly have a CR discussion in front of us this week. We have a reconciliation discussion. That reconciliation bill needs to happen. We have just weeks before we are out of the funds to continue the operations that- that we have. And even- everywhere I've been in this country, out there, looking at what President Trump has done on immigration and border enforcement, the people that I meet are saying thank you. Thank you for getting these terrorists out of the country. He has deported",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Terrorists?",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: in just one month.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you deported terrorists?",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: 22 known and terrorists on the terrorist watch list are out of this country now we have almost 700 gang members that have been deported out of the country in just a month, and--",
      "10:41:23",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which have been redefined as foreign terrorist organizations by the Trump administration.",
      "10:41:27",
      "SECRETARY NOEM:\u00a0 Well, 281 specific TDA members, which we know are the worst of the worst, have been taken out of this country. So everyone that has a story like Laken Riley's family or Jocelyn's family, they're extremely grateful that that won't be perpetuated amongst other families in other states.",
      "10:41:43",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I want to ask you, you said that you have found leakers within DHS and you're going to prosecute them. Back on February 9, you tweeted, the FBI is so corrupt, we will work with any and every agency to stop leaks. Were you wrong then to blame the FBI if the leaks were from within DHS?",
      "10:41:59",
      "SECRETARY NOEM:\u00a0 No, I think there's leakers all over- throughout this government. I think that everybody needs to be--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What did they leak?",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: --I think these, in DHS, specifically, these two were leaking our enforcement operations that we had planned and were going to conduct in several cities and expose law enforcement to vulnerabilities, to those ops being jeopardized, to where their lives would be in danger. So they will be prosecuted, and they could face up to 10 years in federal prison because they did that. Anyone who is leaking information outside of- of how something is planned for the safety of those law enforcement officers needs to be held accountable for that.",
      "10:42:38",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 and you're going to continue these polygraphing",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: Absolutely",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: of employees.",
      "10:42:42",
      "SECRETARY NOEM: The authorities that I have under the Department of Homeland Security are broad and extensive, and I plan to use every single one of them to make sure that we're following the law, that we are following the procedures in place to keep people safe, and that we're making sure we're following through on what President Trump has promised, that he's going to make America safe again,",

      "State Department staff were taken aback this week by a department directive instructing embassies and consulates to stop publishing air quality monitoring data.",
      "CBS News has reviewed the message that was sent to staff on March 4, which says \"currently there is no anticipated date for real-time data to be available.\" Embassy staff and their families relied on the reports to alert them to poor air quality days.",
      "\"I was shocked by the announcement,\" said a current staffer, who asked to remain anonymous due to concerns about their job, and who said the decision doesn't make much sense as the existing infrastructure to monitor air quality is already in place and operational. \"I don't see any purpose in turning off this data, it doesn't make any sense,\" said another department employee.",
      "A State Department spokesman told CBS News in a statement that the air quality monitors are running, but the effort to transmit air pollution data from embassies and consulates is no longer happening \"due to funding constraints that have caused the Department to turn off the underlying network.\" When asked what it costs to operate the program, the State Department did not provide an answer.",
      "\"The cost to maintain these systems is trivial,\" said Rick Duke, who served as the deputy special envoy for climate at the State Department until January and believes this isn't about saving money as much as it's driven by misplaced anti-climate ideology in the Trump administration. \"These monitors aren't even about climate,\" said Duke, \"Why take away health information from embassy staff and the public?\"",
      "Air monitoring at U.S. embassies began informally in 2008 when a single monitor was placed at the embassy in Beijing, China. The results were posted hourly on Twitter, informing the public about levels of air pollution in the city. The account called\u00a0AirBeijing became internet-famous in 2010 when it tweeted that the air on Nov. 11 was \"Crazy Bad\" when the machine registered dangerously high levels of air pollution.",
      "The purpose behind the monitoring was to inform U.S. citizens living in the region about the state of the city's air, but the Chinese public quickly picked up the information and began demanding their government address the toxic pollution that local officials often downplayed.",
      "The State Department expanded air monitoring at other embassies around the world, installing 78 monitors elsewhere, and made the data available on AirNow.gov. A 2022 scientific study found that the embassy program was highly successful in reducing air pollutants, \"resulting in substantial decreases in the premature mortality risk faced by the over 300 million people living in cities home to a US embassy monitor.\"",
      "But now that the program is terminated, the webpage for embassy data only produces an error message. The last available reading in Beijing was posted on March 4, the day the agency stopped transmitting data.",
      "Current State Department staff told CBS News that access to air quality data is key when weighing overseas assignments, especially for those who must move their entire family and children to places with unhealthy air, or in locations where air monitoring by local governments is unreliable or non-existent.",
      "\"Robbing employees of the information they need for the health decisions of their children is immoral,\" said a current staffer, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.",
      "A State Department spokesperson told CBS News in a statement that the air data continues to be collected and \"will be made available when there is a secure and reliable way to transmit it.\" They said the department is \"evaluating other transmission options.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security said Friday it is ending the collective bargaining agreement with the union representing thousands of frontline workers with the Transportation Security Administration, a decision the TSA union called an \"unprovoked attack.\"",
      "In announcing the decision, DHS criticized the union \u2014 which represents worker responsible for screening airline passengers \u2014 claiming TSA employs more people working full-time on union issues than those \"performing screening functions at 86% of our airports.\"",
      "\"This action will ensure Americans will have more effective and modernized workforces across the nation's transportation networks,\" Homeland Security said in a statement. \"TSA is renewing its commitment to providing a quick and secure travel process for Americans.\"",
      "The decision to end collective bargaining was criticized by the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing flight attendants, and Democratic lawmakers, with both claiming that the action will make flying less safe. DHS's decision comes after the agency last year pushed to boost TSA workers' pay, which has historically lagged that of other government employees.",
      "In May 2024, the TSA administrator at the time, David Pekoske, signed the collective bargaining agreement and credited\u00a0pay increases\u00a0that went into effect in 2023 for helping to improve employee retention and morale, areas where TSA has had challenges.",
      "\"Attempting to negate [TSA workers'] legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2013 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi and ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, in a statement on Friday.",
      "In the announcement, DHS said poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job and that the agreement was hindering the ability of the organization \"to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe\" \u2014 an assessment that faced immediate pushback from Thompson and the union.",
      "The decision is \"terrible for aviation security and everyone who depends on safe travel,\" the Association of Flight Attendants said. The group added, \"This will take us back to the days of security at the lowest price with the highest costs for our country.\"",
      "Impact on 47,000 TSA workers",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the TSA workers, said in a statement that the order would strip collective bargaining rights from roughly 47,000 transportation security officers, or TSOs. Those are people responsible for staffing airports around the country and checking to make sure that hundreds of thousands of passengers a day do not carry any weapons or explosives into the secure areas of airports.",
      "The union said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump's administration were violating the right of staffers to join a union. It also said that the reasons the Republican administration had given for the decision \u2014 specifically the criticisms of union activity \u2014 were \"completely fabricated.\"",
      "Instead, the union said, the decision was retaliation for its wider efforts challenging a range of decisions taken by the Trump administration that have affected federal workers.",
      "AFGE represents roughly 800,000 federal government workers in Washington, D.C., and across the country, and it has been pushing back on many of the administration's actions such as firing probationary employees and cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "\"Our union has been out in front challenging this administration's unlawful actions targeting federal workers, both in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion,\" the union said. \"Now our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action.\"",
      "The decision to end the collective bargaining agreement comes after Trump's administration pushed out Pekoske the day Trump was sworn into office. The TSA does not currently have an administrator or a deputy administrator.",
      "In a note to staff, acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said Noem made the decision to rescind officers' collective bargaining rights to align with the Trump administration's \"vision of maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.\"",
      "\"By removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,\" Stahl wrote. \"This determination is made with the TSO in mind, ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.\"",
      "Stahl said the agency \"will establish alternative procedures\" to address employee concerns and grievances \"in a fair and transparent manner.\"",
      "\"Anti-union talking points\"",
      "Rep. Thompson criticized the Homeland Security press release, saying the department was using \"flat out wrong anti-union talking points.\" He said the real aim was \"diminishing\" the workforce so \"they can transform it in the mold of Project 2025.\"",
      "\"Attempting to negate their legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2014 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" Thompson said. \"Since the Biden Administration provided pay increases and a new collective bargaining contract to the workforce, TSA's attrition rates have plummeted.\"",
      "Project 2025 was the conservative governing blueprint that Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign was not part of his agenda. Project 2025 calls for immediately ending the TSA union and eventually privatizing the entire agency.",
      "The TSA was created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when hijackers smuggled knives and box cutters through security to use as weapons as they commandeered four airplanes and slammed them into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center towers and a Pennsylvania field. The TSA's mandate when it was created in November 2001 was to prevent a similar attack in the future.",
      "Air travel since then has undergone a massive overhaul, with passengers and their luggage going through extensive screening at the airport and passenger information generally uploaded to TSA in advance of travel to facilitate screening. Increasingly, the agency has also been using facial recognition technology to scan passengers at checkpoints, leading to criticism by some members of Congress.",

    "summary": "Asked about NATO Article 5 commitment, Trump says U.S. \"not going to defend\" allies that fail to meet his spending requirements.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump suggested Thursday that members of the U.S.-led NATO transatlantic military alliance would not come to the aid of the U.S., should America come under attack. NATO members are bound to back each other militarily in the face of any aggression under the collective defense clause in the alliance's founding treaty.",
      "\"Do you think they're going to come and protect us? Hmm. They're supposed to. I'm not so sure,\" Mr. Trump said as he addressed reporters at the Oval Office.",
      "He said in the same conversation that he would breach that treaty and only send the U.S. military to defend NATO allies that contribute what he deems to be a fair share of their national GDPs to their defense budgets.",
      "A core foundation upon which the nearly 80-year-old alliance is built is Article 5 of the NATO founding treaty. Under that article, should any NATO nation become the victim of an armed attack, the other members will consider it as an attack against all members and will \"take the actions it deems necessary\" to assist.",
      "Article 5 has only been invoked once in NATO's history, and that was on Sept. 12, 2001, one day after Al-Qaeda killed almost 3,000 people in its unprecedented terrorist attack on Washington and New York.",
      "In the U.S.-led invasions that followed in Iraq and Afghanistan, America's NATO allies cumulatively lost well over 1,000 troops in combat over a 20 year period. Britain alone lost 642 members of its armed forces.",
      "More than 7,000 members of the U.S. armed forces were killed during that same period, according to the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University.",
      "President Trump was speaking in response to a question about whether the U.S. would defend NATO partners if they were not paying what he deems to be their fair share toward their own defense.",
      "The president has long argued that the U.S. carries an undue burden, spending more to help ensure Europe's defense than the NATO members on the continent, and he's pushing now for those members to boost their domestic defense spending to at least 5% of their respective GDPs.",
      "\"I said if you're not going to pay, we're not going to defend\u2026 if you're not going to pay your bills, we're not going to defend you,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The 5% defense spending Mr. Trump has demanded of America's NATO allies is a significantly higher proportion than what the U.S. pays. The U.S. currently allocates about 3% of its GDP to defense annually, one of the higher amounts relative to other NATO nations, but not the highest.",
      "According to data compiled by the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, the highest spender, relative to its GDP, is Poland, which shares a long border with Ukraine. Then, after the U.S., come Greece and a number of NATO nations right on the eastern edge of democratic Europe, closest to Ukraine and, beyond it, Russia, along with the Nordic states.",
      "Over the past decade, European NATO members and Canada have steadily increased their collective spending on defense from 1.43% of their combined GDP in 2014, to 2.02% in 2024, according to figures posted on NATO's website \u2014 but many individual member states are still falling well short of the 5% mark that Mr. Trump has called for. Some have yet to even meet the 2% of GDP spending threshold currently set as a target by the alliance.",
      "Poland's President Andrzej Duda on Thursday said he had proposed a spending minimum of 3% of GDP for all NATO members in a post on social media.",
      "Friedrich Merz, the likely next leader of Germany, also announced a plan this week to raise hundreds of billions of dollars in extra spending on defense and infrastructure should he take office.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks came at the end of a week in which his administration ruffled European feathers by appearing to question the contributions of America's NATO allies.",
      "In pointed comments on Thursday, President Emmanuel Macron said France and the U.S. were \"loyal and faithful allies,\" and that France had \"respect and friendship\" for the United States.",

    "summary": "Intuitive Machines says its Athena lunar lander was unable to recharge its batteries while resting on its side, bringing the moon mission to an early end.",
    "story": [
      "A dramatic photograph from Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander shows it touched down Thursday in a crater near the lunar south pole and tipped over on its side. Given a low sun angle and the orientation of the lander's solar cells, the spacecraft's battery quickly drained, bringing the mission to an early end, company officials said Friday",
      "\"Images downlinked from Athena on the lunar surface confirmed that Athena was on her side,\" the company said on its website.",
      "\"After landing, mission controllers were able to accelerate several program and payload milestones, including NASA's PRIME-1 (drill) suite, before the lander's batteries depleted,\" the statement continued. \"With the direction of the sun, the orientation of the solar panels, and extreme cold temperatures in the crater, Intuitive Machines does not expect Athena to recharge. The mission has concluded and teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission.\"",
      "Launched Feb. 26 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the Athena lander carried 10 science instruments and technology demonstrations funded by a NASA program that pays commercial spacecraft operators to deliver the agency's payloads to the moon. The goal is to collect data needed before astronauts return to the moon in the 2027-28 timeframe.",
      "In this case, NASA agreed to pay Intuitive Machines $62.5 million to deliver a drill and a mass spectrometer, known as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia cellular communications equipment and another $41 million to help finance an innovative rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to jump into and out of a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice.",
      "Athena performed flawlessly from launch to lunar orbit and most of the way to the lunar surface. But shortly before touchdown, the lander's autonomous guidance and navigation system began steering to one side, presumably to avoid boulders or some other hazard on the surface, and ended up coming down in a crater some 820 feet from the intended target.",
      "The spacecraft may have tipped over after hitting the ground at an angle or due to some residual sideways motion. Intuitive didn't address the final seconds of the landing, but said that even resting on its side, Athena remained functional, acknowledging commands from the ground, downlinking data and attempting to recharge its batteries. But it was not enough.",
      "\"This southern pole region is lit by harsh sun angles and limited direct communication with the Earth,\" Intuitive Machines said on its web page. \"This area has been avoided due to its rugged terrain and Intuitive Machines believes the insights and achievements from IM-2 will open this region for further space exploration.\"",
      "The landing mishap was the second such disappointment for Intuitive Machines. The company's first moon lander, named Odysseus, touched down on the moon last year, but it hit the surface harder than expected and a landing leg failed. The vehicle ended up on its side and unable to complete its mission.",
      "Athena's arrival was preceded by the successful touchdown of a commercial lander built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace that also carried NASA-sponsored payloads to the surface. That spacecraft, known as Blue Ghost, landed Sunday in a different region of the moon with much more forgiving terrain.",
      "A third privately-built lander, this one from Tokyo-based ispace, was launched atop the same Falcon 9 that boosted Blue Ghost into space. The Japanese Resilience lander is taking a longer, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to land in June.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Mar 2025 20:35:21 -0500",
    "summary": "A study, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that 22% of butterflies in the United States disappeared between 2000 and 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Butterflies, known for their beauty and vital role in pollination, are vanishing from U.S. landscapes at an alarming rate. A comprehensive study, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that 22% of butterflies in the United States disappeared between 2000 and 2020.",
      "The new research offers a stark warning about the potential future of these cherished insects.",
      "\"Losing one out of every five butterflies over 20 years should be a big wake-up call to people,\" said Dr. Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University and co-author of the study. \"These declines are not stopping.\"",
      "While butterflies are the most extensively monitored insect group in the U.S., most past studies have been limited by geography or focused on specific species, a news release on the study said. The researchers behind the Science study used data from more than 12.6 million butterflies spanning 342 individual species, drawing from 76,000 surveys across 35 nationwide monitoring programs.",
      "Funded by the U.S. Geological Survey, the study was the first to integrate such a vast dataset, its authors said. The findings revealed that 33% of butterfly species have experienced significant population declines over the past two decades, with 107 out of the 342 species examined losing more than half of their population \u2014 including 22 species that declined by more than 90%. Meanwhile, only 3% of species showed population increases.",
      "One of the most striking examples is the monarch butterfly. In December 2024, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the monarch under the Endangered Species Act, saying the species' eastern population has declined by about 80% and the western population has dropped by more than 95% since the 1980s.",
      "The species was already designated an endangered species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature in 2022.",
      "Ultimately, the butterfly decline is part of a larger global trend of insect population loss, with insects declining by about 1-2% annually, the study's authors said.",
      "Butterflies play an essential role in ecosystems, pollinating flowers, crops, and other plants. Their decline could have far-reaching impacts on plant reproduction and the health of ecosystems.",
      "According to the Science study, habitat loss, climate change, and pesticide use are driving their declines. Rising temperatures and changing climates threaten butterfly populations by disrupting breeding cycles, reducing food sources, and increasing habitat stress. Insecticides have been identified as leading causes of butterfly decline, which can be tackled with policy intervention such as restricting harmful insecticides, promoting integrated pest management and encouraging diversified cropping, according to the study.",
      "Despite the declines, individuals can take steps to help butterfly populations recover, Grames said.",
      "\"One of the really positive messages about insect conservation is that the things we do in our own backyards actually make a difference,\" she said.",
      "She recommends allowing a portion of yards to grow wild with native plants, reducing pesticide use, and creating habitat spaces like small brush piles for insects. \"Even simple actions \u2014 like leaving a strip of wildflowers or planting species that support pollinators \u2014 can provide crucial resources for butterflies and other insects.\"",
      "On a larger scale, experts say conservation efforts, including habitat preservation and climate adaptation strategies, are also essential to protecting vulnerable species and ensuring butterfly populations remain resilient in the face of ongoing environmental changes.",

      "\"We don't believe we're in the correct attitude (orientation) on the surface of the moon yet again,\" Altemus disclosed. \"I don't have all the data yet to say exactly what the attitude of the vehicle is. We're collecting photos now and downlinking those, and we're going to get a picture from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera from above, from orbit, and we'll confirm that over the coming days as we get that data down.\"",
      "The touchdown came one year after Intuitive's first moon lander, named Odysseus, landed on the moon while still moving sideways. A landing leg broke and the spacecraft tipped over on its side, limiting the mission's scientific return. Intuitive's stock fell 20% in the wake of the latest landing problem.",
      "Known as Athena, the IM-2 spacecraft from Intuitive Machines\u00a0was launched eight days ago by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Sharing the ride to space were three other spacecraft: a moon-bound NASA orbiter known as the Lunar Trailblazer, a commercial deep space asteroid prospecting probe named Odin, and a privately-built space tug designed to work in Earth orbit.",
      "NASA lost contact with its Lunar Trailblazer satellite shortly after launch, and AstroForge ran into problems commanding its Odin prospector probe. Both payloads are likely lost, officials say.",
      "Athena carried a set of sophisticated instruments, two small rovers, experimental cellular communications gear and a rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to bounce from site to site near the lander. The lander apparently touched down 100 miles or so from the moon's south pole around 12:30 p.m. EST.",
      "The exact timing and the lander's exact location were not immediately known as company flight controllers worked to evaluate confusing telemetry from the spacecraft.",
      "But they eventually confirmed the spacecraft's main engine had shut down, its solar cells were generating power and the lander's flight computer was in contact with company flight controllers, acknowledging commands as they were received.",
      "Altemus, a former NASA shuttle engineer and senior manager at the Johnson Space Center, said the most reliable information came from the lander's inertial measurement unit, or IMU, which indicated Athena was resting on its side.",
      "\"We think that's the case,\" he said. \"I would like to get a picture, though, to know the orientation of exactly where the antennas are pointed, where the engine bell is pointed, where are the solar panels so that we can figure out a power profile.\"",
      "\"With the payloads, we can talk to them and command them on and off. So if we can figure out the orientation correctly with imagery, we can then develop a power profile (that will) result in a series of priorities in the science and technology list that would allow us to capture some mission objectives.\"",
      "But time is short. The solar-powered Athena will only be able to operate for about 10 days before the sun sets and darkness sweeps over the landing site at the end of the lunar day.",
      "\"When we get that full assessment, we will then work closely with NASA science and technology groups to identify science objectives that are the highest priority,\" Altemus said. \"And then we'll figure out what the mission profile will look. It will be off-nominal because we're not getting everything that we had asked for in terms of power generation, communications, et cetera.\"",
      "The lander braked into orbit Monday, five days after launch from the Kennedy Space Center. Thursday morning, while flying over the far side of the moon, Athena's main engine fired, starting a process to lower the far side of its orbit from about 62 miles to a little more than 6 miles.",
      "During the coast down to lower altitude, the lander presumably used its cameras and lasers in a terrain relative navigation system to constantly monitor altitude and velocity, keeping the spacecraft on course toward the landing site.",
      "As it neared the target, the main engine fired again in a maneuver called powered descent initiation, designed to sharply reduce its initial 4,000-mph velocity. Once the braking maneuver was complete, Athena was programmed to flip upright into a vertical, tail-down orientation for the final phase of the descent, scanning the surface ahead for hazards.",
      "The lander was expected to descend at a sedate 2.2 mph for the final drop to the surface in lunar highlands known as the Mons Mouton region. But the spacecraft autonomously maneuvered to find a safer landing area after evaluating the surface ahead. The details of the final phases of the descent are not yet known.",
      "NASA is targeting the south polar region for astronaut landings, in large part because data from orbiting satellites indicate ice may be present in permanently shadowed craters that never see the light of the sun and are among the coldest spots in the solar system.",
      "The water molecules presumably were delivered over billions of years by comet impacts and interactions between moon dust and the electrically charged solar wind.",
      "The innovative \"Grace\" hopper was designed to jump into one of those dark craters about a quarter of a mile from Athena for in situ measurements, radioing its observations back to the lander using 4G/LTE cellular network equipment provided by Nokia.",
      "Other instruments on the lander were expected to look for the chemical traces of water and other compounds, along with taking measurements of soil temperature and composition. Two small rovers were on board to explore the landing site and to test innovative mobility systems.",
      "Altemus said it may still be possible to deploy the hopper and the rovers, but that will depend on the lander's orientation.",

      "Woolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.",
      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Just last year, the company said they made a breakthrough in efforts to bring back the extinct Tasmanian tiger.",
      "Colossal has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \"engineer them into living animals,\" said CEO Ben Lamm.",
      "In a 2023 interview, CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti told Lamm, \"I hear mammoth and dodo in the same sentence and, you know, it's science fiction to me.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it is,\" said Lamm, \"until it's not.\"",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",
      "\"You're not actually resurrecting anything \u2014 you're not bringing back the ancient past,\" said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \"Colossal woolly mouse.\"",
      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",

      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \"present already in some living mice,\" said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \"we put them all together in a single mouse.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Mar 2025 15:47:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Churchill, Manitoba, a small village on the Hudson Bay, is known as the polar bear capital of the world.",
    "story": [
      "Just on the edge of the western Hudson Bay lies the small town of Churchill, Manitoba.",
      "Here, the sea meets the boreal forest under the rippling northern lights. Farther to the north, the trees stop growing. Snow coats a harsh landscape of Canadian shield, and the ceaseless wind cuts through the willows.",
      "No roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.",
      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",
      "The town",
      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",
      "Churchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah \u2013 now 3 years old \u2013 who has an affinity for the dogs, too.",
      "\"I remember being a little kid and standing on the back ski with my dad and doing tours,\" he says. \"That's what I'm looking forward to most right now . . . I think about [Noah] coming out and doing tours with me.\"",
      "But this legacy is threatened by the warming arctic, and it's a weight the Daleys feel as they fight to protect their way of life in the north.",
      "\"It's a scary thought to think the polar bears may not be here one day,\" Dave Daley says. \"The planet earth is a living being, and we're the ones treading on it and changing everything. I think we really need to get a handle on it and start taking this seriously.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 11:29:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Intuitive Machines says its Athena lunar lander was unable to recharge its batteries while resting on its side, bringing the moon mission to an early end.",
    "story": [
      "A dramatic photograph from Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander shows it touched down Thursday in a crater near the lunar south pole and tipped over on its side. Given a low sun angle and the orientation of the lander's solar cells, the spacecraft's battery quickly drained, bringing the mission to an early end, company officials said Friday",
      "\"Images downlinked from Athena on the lunar surface confirmed that Athena was on her side,\" the company said on its website.",
      "\"After landing, mission controllers were able to accelerate several program and payload milestones, including NASA's PRIME-1 (drill) suite, before the lander's batteries depleted,\" the statement continued. \"With the direction of the sun, the orientation of the solar panels, and extreme cold temperatures in the crater, Intuitive Machines does not expect Athena to recharge. The mission has concluded and teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission.\"",
      "Launched Feb. 26 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the Athena lander carried 10 science instruments and technology demonstrations funded by a NASA program that pays commercial spacecraft operators to deliver the agency's payloads to the moon. The goal is to collect data needed before astronauts return to the moon in the 2027-28 timeframe.",
      "In this case, NASA agreed to pay Intuitive Machines $62.5 million to deliver a drill and a mass spectrometer, known as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia cellular communications equipment and another $41 million to help finance an innovative rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to jump into and out of a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice.",
      "Athena performed flawlessly from launch to lunar orbit and most of the way to the lunar surface. But shortly before touchdown, the lander's autonomous guidance and navigation system began steering to one side, presumably to avoid boulders or some other hazard on the surface, and ended up coming down in a crater some 820 feet from the intended target.",
      "The spacecraft may have tipped over after hitting the ground at an angle or due to some residual sideways motion. Intuitive didn't address the final seconds of the landing, but said that even resting on its side, Athena remained functional, acknowledging commands from the ground, downlinking data and attempting to recharge its batteries. But it was not enough.",
      "\"This southern pole region is lit by harsh sun angles and limited direct communication with the Earth,\" Intuitive Machines said on its web page. \"This area has been avoided due to its rugged terrain and Intuitive Machines believes the insights and achievements from IM-2 will open this region for further space exploration.\"",
      "The landing mishap was the second such disappointment for Intuitive Machines. The company's first moon lander, named Odysseus, touched down on the moon last year, but it hit the surface harder than expected and a landing leg failed. The vehicle ended up on its side and unable to complete its mission.",
      "Athena's arrival was preceded by the successful touchdown of a commercial lander built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace that also carried NASA-sponsored payloads to the surface. That spacecraft, known as Blue Ghost, landed Sunday in a different region of the moon with much more forgiving terrain.",
      "A third privately-built lander, this one from Tokyo-based ispace, was launched atop the same Falcon 9 that boosted Blue Ghost into space. The Japanese Resilience lander is taking a longer, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to land in June.",

      "NASA lost contact with its Lunar Trailblazer satellite shortly after launch, and AstroForge ran into problems commanding its Odin prospector probe. Both payloads are likely lost, officials say.",
      "Athena carried a set of sophisticated instruments, two small rovers, experimental cellular communications gear and a rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to bounce from site to site near the lander. The lander apparently touched down 100 miles or so from the moon's south pole around 12:30 p.m. EST.",
      "The exact timing and the lander's exact location were not immediately known as company flight controllers worked to evaluate confusing telemetry from the spacecraft.",
      "But they eventually confirmed the spacecraft's main engine had shut down, its solar cells were generating power and the lander's flight computer was in contact with company flight controllers, acknowledging commands as they were received.",
      "Altemus, a former NASA shuttle engineer and senior manager at the Johnson Space Center, said the most reliable information came from the lander's inertial measurement unit, or IMU, which indicated Athena was resting on its side.",
      "\"We think that's the case,\" he said. \"I would like to get a picture, though, to know the orientation of exactly where the antennas are pointed, where the engine bell is pointed, where are the solar panels so that we can figure out a power profile.\"",
      "\"With the payloads, we can talk to them and command them on and off. So if we can figure out the orientation correctly with imagery, we can then develop a power profile (that will) result in a series of priorities in the science and technology list that would allow us to capture some mission objectives.\"",
      "But time is short. The solar-powered Athena will only be able to operate for about 10 days before the sun sets and darkness sweeps over the landing site at the end of the lunar day.",
      "\"When we get that full assessment, we will then work closely with NASA science and technology groups to identify science objectives that are the highest priority,\" Altemus said. \"And then we'll figure out what the mission profile will look. It will be off-nominal because we're not getting everything that we had asked for in terms of power generation, communications, et cetera.\"",
      "The lander braked into orbit Monday, five days after launch from the Kennedy Space Center. Thursday morning, while flying over the far side of the moon, Athena's main engine fired, starting a process to lower the far side of its orbit from about 62 miles to a little more than 6 miles.",
      "During the coast down to lower altitude, the lander presumably used its cameras and lasers in a terrain relative navigation system to constantly monitor altitude and velocity, keeping the spacecraft on course toward the landing site.",
      "As it neared the target, the main engine fired again in a maneuver called powered descent initiation, designed to sharply reduce its initial 4,000-mph velocity. Once the braking maneuver was complete, Athena was programmed to flip upright into a vertical, tail-down orientation for the final phase of the descent, scanning the surface ahead for hazards.",
      "The lander was expected to descend at a sedate 2.2 mph for the final drop to the surface in lunar highlands known as the Mons Mouton region. But the spacecraft autonomously maneuvered to find a safer landing area after evaluating the surface ahead. The details of the final phases of the descent are not yet known.",
      "NASA is targeting the south polar region for astronaut landings, in large part because data from orbiting satellites indicate ice may be present in permanently shadowed craters that never see the light of the sun and are among the coldest spots in the solar system.",
      "The water molecules presumably were delivered over billions of years by comet impacts and interactions between moon dust and the electrically charged solar wind.",
      "The innovative \"Grace\" hopper was designed to jump into one of those dark craters about a quarter of a mile from Athena for in situ measurements, radioing its observations back to the lander using 4G/LTE cellular network equipment provided by Nokia.",
      "Other instruments on the lander were expected to look for the chemical traces of water and other compounds, along with taking measurements of soil temperature and composition. Two small rovers were on board to explore the landing site and to test innovative mobility systems.",
      "Altemus said it may still be possible to deploy the hopper and the rovers, but that will depend on the lander's orientation.",
      "Second lunar lander to reach moon this year",
      "Athena's arrival is the second of three to reach the moon this year.",
      "A lander built by Austin-based\u00a0Firefly Aerospace successfully touched down on the moon early Sunday, March 2. The commercially-developed Blue Ghost lander is equipped with 10 NASA-sponsored instruments designed to collect data needed for the Artemis program.",
      "NASA agreed to pay Firefly Aerospace $101 million for delivery of the agency-sponsored science instruments and technology demonstrations to the moon's surface. The instruments cost NASA another $44 million.",
      "Athena's instruments and technology demonstrations also were funded by NASA. The agency paid the company $62.5 million to deliver a powerful drill and mass spectrometer, known collectively as Prime-1, to the moon's surface.",
      "NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia's cellular communications integration and another $41 million went to Intuitive Machines to help finance the \"Grace\" hopper.",
      "Another $89 million paid for a lunar satellite built by Lockheed Martin that was launched on the same Falcon 9 rocket as Athena. But the Lunar Trailblazer satellite dropped out of contact with Earth shortly after launch and has not been heard from since.",
      "Blue Ghost and Athena were both funded in large part by NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. The CLPS initiative is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface later this decade.",
      "In the meantime, a Japanese lander known as Resilience was launched in January atop the same Falcon 9 rocket that boosted the Blue Ghost into space. Built by Tokyo-based ispace, Resilience took a longer, low-energy route to the moon and will not arrive until early June.",

    "summary": "Starliner commander Barry Wilmore offered an even-handed response to questions about the intrusion of politics into his ISS mission.",
    "story": [
      "Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore said Tuesday he did not think politics played any role in the crew's extended mission, but he did not directly address earlier comments by President Trump and Elon Musk that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "\"Obviously, we've heard some of these different things that have been said,\" Wilmore said during an orbital news conference. \"I can tell you at the outset, all of us have the utmost respect for Mr. Musk and obviously, respect and admiration for our president of the United States, Donald Trump.\"",
      "\"The words they've said, politics, I mean, that's part of life. We understand that. And there's an important reason why we have a political system and the political system that we do have, and we're behind it 100%.\"",
      "Wilmore and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams said in earlier comments that they didn't feel stranded or abandoned. But again on Tuesday, the crew took multiple questions about what some see as the intrusion of politics on their mission.",
      "\"From my standpoint, politics is not playing into this at all,\" Wilmore said. \"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight program is all about, planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.\"",
      "Wilmore and Williams, both former military test pilots, launched to the International Space Station\u00a0on June 5 last year aboard a Boeing Starliner crew ferry ship for a mission that was expected to last about eight days.",
      "The Starliner docked at the outpost the day after launch, but the ship ran into multiple problems with its propulsion system during its approach to the lab.",
      "In mid August, after a detailed engineering analysis, Boeing managers argued the problems were well understood and could be safely managed during the crew's return to Earth. But NASA managers disagreed and eventually decided to bring the Starliner back to Earth by remote control, without its crew, in early September.",
      "To minimize the disruption to the station's crew rotation schedule and on-going research, NASA opted to bump two astronauts from the next SpaceX Crew Dragon flight and to launch that mission, known as Crew 9, in late September with just two crew members on board. That left two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Crew 9 mission was initially expected to end this month, but the flight was extended to late March because of issues preparing a new Crew Dragon for launch, sources said. NASA later decided to use a different Crew Dragon, clearing the way for Crew 9 to undock and head for Earth around March 19.",
      "On Jan. 28, President Trump blamed the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's extended stay in space, saying he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\"",
      "\"They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Hours before the president's post, Musk said on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding, \"We will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Musk later said he offered to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but he said his offer was turned down because \"they did not want positive press for someone who supported Trump. That's it. End of story.\"",
      "Wilmore described the SpaceX CEO as \"absolutely factual.\" But he added that the crew had no knowledge of such an offer.",
      "\"We have no information on that, though ... what was offered, what was not offered, who it was offered to, how that processes went,\" Wilmore told a reporter Tuesday. \"That's information that we simply don't have.\"",
      "\"So I believe him. I don't know all those details, and I don't think any of us really can give you the answer that maybe you would be hoping for.\"",
      "NASA plans to operate the ISS through 2030. In another recent post on X, Musk said the station should be brought down earlier: \"It is time to begin preparations for deorbiting the @Space_Station. It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let's go to Mars.\"",
      "When asked by tech and science news outlet Ars Technica to clarify, Musk responded on X by saying \"the decision is up to the president, but my recommendation is as soon as possible. I recommend 2 years from now.\"",
      "Williams said he disagreed.",
      "\"This place is ticking, it's just really amazing,\" she said of the station. \"So I would say we're actually in our prime right now. We've got all the power, all of the facilities up and operating. So I would think that right now is probably not the right time to call it quits.\"",
      "Given that the ISS is operated by NASA and multiple partner nations, the Starliner pilot said they should make the most out of it for taxpayers and international partners and \"hold our obligations and do that world-class science that this laboratory is capable of.\"",
      "If all goes well, Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov will blast off and head for the space station on March 12.",

    "summary": "Faced with the need to cut carbon emissions, and an increasing energy demand to power AI, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon are investing in nuclear, from restarting Three Mile Island, to creating \"small modular reactors.\"",
    "story": [
      "It might have seemed like one of the weirder headlines of 2024: Microsoft is paying $1.6 billion to restart Three Mile Island. That's the nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania whose reactor #2 had a partial meltdown in 1979. There were no injuries, and nobody died, but it set the nuclear industry back years. Only two new plants have been started since that accident.",
      "\"This is hallowed ground in the nuclear industry,\" said Joe Dominguez, the CEO of Constellation Energy, which owns about half of America's 54 nuclear plants (including Three Mile Island). \"This is a place where we learned and got better.\"",
      "He says that, as a result of the 1979 accident, there have been thousands of changes in protocols and procedures regarding nuclear power. \"The thing that people forget is that there was another reactor at the site,\" he said. \"That site, that reactor, continued to operate until 2019, when it was closed for economic reasons. Cheap natural gas, low demand, subsidization of different technologies in the business, [and] no policy supporting nuclear caused plants to start retiring.\"",
      "So, what is Microsoft's interest?",
      "All  of the Big Tech companies have ambitious goals to fight the climate  crisis. That includes Google and Microsoft, which have each  pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions. They were making progress, too; each has invested billions in wind and solar energy.",
      "And then, then artificial intelligence came along. AI data centers require huge amounts of electricity. \u00a0Big Tech realized that they wouldn't make their emissions goals without taking power into their own hands.",
      "Dominguez said, \"Microsoft is going to enjoy the benefit of the reliable, clean energy for 20 years.\"",
      "He says reopening the existing Three Mile Island facility would be quicker and less expensive than constructing a brand-new nuclear plant. \"At least 10 times cheaper than building a new plant,\" he said. \"And we think we could get it going in about three years, versus the last plant that was built, [which] took almost 10 years.\"",
      "But if you're a tech company, what do you do if you don't have a recently-retired nuclear plant handy? You develop new ones. Only weeks after Microsoft's announcement, both Amazon and Google announced major investments in nuclear power.",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google is supplementing its already enormous green energy investments with a new kind of nuclear, called small modular reactors. \"These are not the nuclear power plants of yesterday, with the very large cooling towers,\" said Michael Terrell, who heads Google's decarbonization efforts. \"These are much smaller facilities. But because they're modular, you can stack them together to make bigger power plants.",
      "He anticipates the first advanced nuclear reactor will be online by 2030. \"And we're not going to do just one reactor, but we hope to buy from what will be a series of reactors that follow that,\" Terrell said.",
      "Nuclear power still isn't perfect; it still produces waste that has to be safely stored. But unlike solar and wind, nuclear power is always on, which is essential to those AI data centers.",
      "So, Google is funding a company called Kairos Power to design and build this new generation of reactors. Kairos is building three small demonstration plants in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on the very spot where uranium was processed for the first atomic bomb.",
      "CEO Mike Laufer says that his reactors don't use fuel rods; they use fuel pebbles, about the size of golf balls \u2013 mostly graphite, with tiny kernels of uranium. And each pebble has as much power capacity as four tons of coal.",
      "And how much carbon dioxide emissions, compared to coal? \"Zero,\" Laufer said.",
      "The Kairos reactors also run at lower power and lower pressure than traditional reactors, which means lower risk.",
      "Well, this all sounds great! But what's the catch?",
      "\"There's only one problem with small modular reactors: They don't really exist,\" said George Washington University professor Sharon Squassoni, who spent 15 years researching nuclear safety for the government. She thinks Big Tech companies might be in over their heads. \"I think they're going to find out pretty quickly that it takes way too long and it's way too expensive,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see just how strong their commitments are to clean energy futures.\"",
      "\"So, you're saying they may have to turn to burning stuff [for power]?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure they will,\" Squassoni replied.",
      "\"Do you think there's a little bit of tech-bro overconfidence therein?\"",
      "\"Oh, completely, completely!\" she laughed.",
      "Kairos' Mike Laufer admitted, \"Yes, it's really hard. I will totally agree with anyone. But we're doing it at smaller scale to start, and then building on that in the future.\"",
      "Joe Dominguez's team is getting Three Mile Island ready for Microsoft, including renaming the plant the Crane Clean Energy Center. And if AI is igniting a renaissance in American nuclear, he says: full steam ahead.",
      "I asked, \"Why do all new plants take so much longer and cost so much more than projected?\"",
      "\"Honest answer? We don't build enough of them,\" Dominguez said. \"You don't want to build a unique design; you want to do kind of a cookie-cutter, one-after-another design.\"",
      "\"Is it well understood in government and the industry that if you start doing the same design over and over, we can get there faster and cheaper?\"",
      "\"It's probably the best understood idea,\" Dominguez said. \"It's understood by both Republicans and Democrats, which is a hard thing to say about anything! Everybody understands that if you build a common design, you build a bunch of them.\"",
      "\"So, you think we'll get there?\"",
      "\"I do.\"",
      "Google's Michael Terrell agrees, and believes his company will make its zero-carbon goal by 2030. \"It is an incredibly ambitious goal: 24/7 carbon-free energy everywhere we operate every way around the world,\" he said. \"But it's something we're working very hard to achieve, and we hope to get there.\"",

    "summary": "Prosecutors said Ryan Routh methodically plotted to kill Trump for weeks, before aiming a rifle through shrubs as Trump played golf last September at his golf club.",
    "story": [
      "While President Trump spoke with reporters about federal job cuts and signed executive orders in the Oval Office last Tuesday, a notable \u2014 and unannounced \u2014 visit was underway at Mr. Trump's golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida. It wasn't publicized. But it could impact one of the highest-profile criminal trials in America this year.",
      "According to court filings reviewed by CBS News, defense attorneys for Ryan Routh were given access to tour the Trump golf course on Feb. 25 to prepare Routh's defense in the alleged assassination attempt against Mr. Trump during a Sept. 15 golf outing. A court filing submitted by Justice Department prosecutors this week said, \"We took the lead in setting up arrangements for this visit even though the prosecution team obviously does not control the course, which is private property.\"",
      "In a March 3 court filing, prosecutors added, \"As we told defense counsel, their request to inspect the firearm in this manner was highly unusual in the experience of the FBI, but nonetheless we made it happen.\"",
      "Prosecutors have also helped provide transport of the rifle allegedly wielded by Routh near Trump's September golf outing.\tAccording to the Justice Department's submissions to a federal judge in Miami, \"To accommodate a defense request, the prosecution team ensured that the firearm, scope, magazine, ammunition, and antiballistic plates were transported from the FBI's lab in Quantico, Virginia, to the FBI Field Office in Miramar, Florida, so the defense could inspect it, with purported consultants in tow, in South Florida after the golf course visit.\"",
      "Prosecutors say Routh methodically plotted to kill Trump for weeks, before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Trump played golf on Sept. 15 at the Trump West Palm Beach country club. Before Trump came into view, Routh was allegedly spotted by a Secret Service agent. Federal authorities accuse Routh of aiming his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot. Prosecutors say he left behind a note describing his intentions.",
      "A White House spokeswoman declined comment when asked about the defense attorney visit to the president's Florida golf property. FBI, Justice Department officials and Routh's federal public defense attorneys also did not comment.",
      "The federal criminal case against Routh, which gathered widespread attention when it was filed in September, has attracted little attention\u00a0 in the months since. His alleged attempt on Mr. Trump's life was partly overshadowed by the dramatic first assassination attempt last July in Butler, Pennsylvania. Routh's trial is scheduled for September 2025.",
      "Routh's son charged in separate felony case",
      "A CBS News review found Routh's legal case has also given rise to another federal investigation. According to charging documents filed in North Carolina, federal investigators searched the apartment of Routh's son six days after the alleged assassination attempt in September. The court filings said an electronic device discovered in Oran Routh's apartment had \"hundreds of child pornography images.\"",
      "Prosecutors said the initial search of Oran Routh's home was unrelated to the child pornography evidence, but the investigation ultimately revealed multiple devices with suspected child exploitative images.",
      "On Jan. 8, Oren Routh signed a plea agreement in which he acknowledged \"that the material which contained an image of child pornography charged in the Second Superseding Indictment herein involved a prepubescent minor and minor who had not attained 12 years of age.\"",
      "He is scheduled to be sentenced May 14 at the federal courthouse in Greensboro, North Carolina.",
      "Both Oran Routh and his father are being held in pretrial detention pending the resolution of their cases.",
      "Though the two criminal cases are separate, court filings reviewed by CBS News show correspondence between Ryan Routh and his son are part of the evidence that has been collected and noted in Ryan Routh's assassination attempt case in Florida.",
      "If convicted, Ryan Routh faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. According to court records, Routh was convicted of felonies in North Carolina in December 2002 and March 2010.",
      "Ryan Routh's trial is scheduled for Sept. 8, nearly a year to the day after the alleged assassination attempt. The presiding judge is Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed to the bench by\u00a0 Mr. Trump in 2020. Last year, Cannon dismissed Trump's classified documents federal criminal case.",

    "summary": "Air Force fighter jets intercepted aircraft flying near Donald Trump's Florida home twice over the weekend.",
    "story": [
      "Air Force fighter jets intercepted a civilian aircraft flying in the temporarily restricted airspace near President Donald Trump's Florida home Sunday, bringing the number of violations to more than 20 since the president took office on Jan. 20.",
      "North American Aerospace Defense Command said in a statement that Sunday's incident, which took place as Trump finished a round of golf at his West Palm Beach golf course, saw F-16s deploy flares to get the attention of the civilian pilot. Jets also conducted an intercept on Saturday morning shortly after Mr. Trump arrived at the course from his private Mar-a-Lago club and residence.",
      "The airspace intrusions in the heavily congested south Florida airspace have prompted fighter jet intercepts but did not alter Mr. Trump's schedule or impact his security, officials said. NORAD says the flares may have been visible from the ground but that they burn out quickly and don't pose danger.",
      "Federal officials maintain a permanent flight restriction over Mr. Trump's club that expands to a radius of 30 nautical miles when the president is in residence.",
      "Violations, and intercepts, are relatively routine, but NORAD is raising alarm over the frequency of the intrusions since Mr. Trump's inauguration, saying it has responded to more than 20 incidents and blames civilian pilots for not following regulations requiring them to check for airspace restrictions before taking off.",
      "NORAD has urged aircrews to check Notice to Airmen, or NOTAMs, from the FAA before flying, \"especially in the Mar-a-Lago region.\" The FAA uses NOTAMs\u00a0to inform pilots of temporary flight restrictions, which prohibit aircraft from entering certain airspaces for set periods of time. Restrictions are issued \"for safety or security purposes,\" including for natural disasters, some major sporting events and emergency or national security situations, the FAA says.",
      "\"Adherence to TFR procedures is essential to ensure flight safety, national security, and the security of the President,\" Gen. Gregory Guillot, the commander of NORAD and US Northern Command said in a statement. \"The procedures are not optional, and the excessive number of recent TFR violations indicates many civil aviators are not reading Notice to Airmen, or NOTAMS, before each flight as required by the FAA, and has resulted in multiple responses by NORAD fighter aircraft to guide offending aircraft out of the TFR.\"",
      "In 2017, during Mr. Trump's first term as president, two F-15 fighter jets were scrambled to intercept an unresponsive aircraft near Mar-a-Lago and officials said the\u00a0incident created a \"sonic boom\"\u00a0that alarmed nearby residents.",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 16:47:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Faced with the need to cut carbon emissions, and an increasing energy demand to power AI, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon are investing in nuclear, from restarting Three Mile Island, to creating \"small modular reactors.\"",
    "story": [
      "It might have seemed like one of the weirder headlines of 2024: Microsoft is paying $1.6 billion to restart Three Mile Island. That's the nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania whose reactor #2 had a partial meltdown in 1979. There were no injuries, and nobody died, but it set the nuclear industry back years. Only two new plants have been started since that accident.",
      "\"This is hallowed ground in the nuclear industry,\" said Joe Dominguez, the CEO of Constellation Energy, which owns about half of America's 54 nuclear plants (including Three Mile Island). \"This is a place where we learned and got better.\"",
      "He says that, as a result of the 1979 accident, there have been thousands of changes in protocols and procedures regarding nuclear power. \"The thing that people forget is that there was another reactor at the site,\" he said. \"That site, that reactor, continued to operate until 2019, when it was closed for economic reasons. Cheap natural gas, low demand, subsidization of different technologies in the business, [and] no policy supporting nuclear caused plants to start retiring.\"",
      "So, what is Microsoft's interest?",
      "All  of the Big Tech companies have ambitious goals to fight the climate  crisis. That includes Google and Microsoft, which have each  pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions. They were making progress, too; each has invested billions in wind and solar energy.",
      "And then, then artificial intelligence came along. AI data centers require huge amounts of electricity. \u00a0Big Tech realized that they wouldn't make their emissions goals without taking power into their own hands.",
      "Dominguez said, \"Microsoft is going to enjoy the benefit of the reliable, clean energy for 20 years.\"",
      "He says reopening the existing Three Mile Island facility would be quicker and less expensive than constructing a brand-new nuclear plant. \"At least 10 times cheaper than building a new plant,\" he said. \"And we think we could get it going in about three years, versus the last plant that was built, [which] took almost 10 years.\"",
      "But if you're a tech company, what do you do if you don't have a recently-retired nuclear plant handy? You develop new ones. Only weeks after Microsoft's announcement, both Amazon and Google announced major investments in nuclear power.",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google is supplementing its already enormous green energy investments with a new kind of nuclear, called small modular reactors. \"These are not the nuclear power plants of yesterday, with the very large cooling towers,\" said Michael Terrell, who heads Google's decarbonization efforts. \"These are much smaller facilities. But because they're modular, you can stack them together to make bigger power plants.",
      "He anticipates the first advanced nuclear reactor will be online by 2030. \"And we're not going to do just one reactor, but we hope to buy from what will be a series of reactors that follow that,\" Terrell said.",
      "Nuclear power still isn't perfect; it still produces waste that has to be safely stored. But unlike solar and wind, nuclear power is always on, which is essential to those AI data centers.",
      "So, Google is funding a company called Kairos Power to design and build this new generation of reactors. Kairos is building three small demonstration plants in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on the very spot where uranium was processed for the first atomic bomb.",
      "CEO Mike Laufer says that his reactors don't use fuel rods; they use fuel pebbles, about the size of golf balls \u2013 mostly graphite, with tiny kernels of uranium. And each pebble has as much power capacity as four tons of coal.",
      "And how much carbon dioxide emissions, compared to coal? \"Zero,\" Laufer said.",
      "The Kairos reactors also run at lower power and lower pressure than traditional reactors, which means lower risk.",
      "Well, this all sounds great! But what's the catch?",
      "\"There's only one problem with small modular reactors: They don't really exist,\" said George Washington University professor Sharon Squassoni, who spent 15 years researching nuclear safety for the government. She thinks Big Tech companies might be in over their heads. \"I think they're going to find out pretty quickly that it takes way too long and it's way too expensive,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see just how strong their commitments are to clean energy futures.\"",
      "\"So, you're saying they may have to turn to burning stuff [for power]?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure they will,\" Squassoni replied.",
      "\"Do you think there's a little bit of tech-bro overconfidence therein?\"",
      "\"Oh, completely, completely!\" she laughed.",
      "Kairos' Mike Laufer admitted, \"Yes, it's really hard. I will totally agree with anyone. But we're doing it at smaller scale to start, and then building on that in the future.\"",
      "Joe Dominguez's team is getting Three Mile Island ready for Microsoft, including renaming the plant the Crane Clean Energy Center. And if AI is igniting a renaissance in American nuclear, he says: full steam ahead.",
      "I asked, \"Why do all new plants take so much longer and cost so much more than projected?\"",
      "\"Honest answer? We don't build enough of them,\" Dominguez said. \"You don't want to build a unique design; you want to do kind of a cookie-cutter, one-after-another design.\"",
      "\"Is it well understood in government and the industry that if you start doing the same design over and over, we can get there faster and cheaper?\"",
      "\"It's probably the best understood idea,\" Dominguez said. \"It's understood by both Republicans and Democrats, which is a hard thing to say about anything! Everybody understands that if you build a common design, you build a bunch of them.\"",
      "\"So, you think we'll get there?\"",
      "\"I do.\"",
      "Google's Michael Terrell agrees, and believes his company will make its zero-carbon goal by 2030. \"It is an incredibly ambitious goal: 24/7 carbon-free energy everywhere we operate every way around the world,\" he said. \"But it's something we're working very hard to achieve, and we hope to get there.\"",

      "KRISTI NOEM (U.S. Homeland Security Secretary): Yes, good morning. Thank you for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to dive right into this trade war.",
      "The justification President Trump invoked these tariffs under had to do with fentanyl. Mexico's president said Thursday that Customs and Border Protection figures show seizures of fentanyl on the southern border have dropped over the past year. She claimed they plummeted 75 percent in the past six months.",
      "Doesn't that show the existing system is working?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We've seen incredible progress as far as what we've been able to stop at the southern border since President Trump has taken office.",
      "And I think that progress can be built on. These partnerships that we have in going after traffickers, cartels, the drug trade, and also human trafficking can be even stronger and built on in the future. That's one of the things we've been asking for, in specific to the Mexican government, is, how can we work better together to make sure we not only have the enforcement mission at the border, but south of the border and make sure we're going after these cartels?",
      "You've seen the president name them as terrorist organizations. And Canada just recently is starting to allow us to access some of their criminal background histories that we need in order to know who's coming across our border and what they're bringing. So, because of his strong stance on tariffs, we're seeing them wanting to be better partners with us to keep our people safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Canada's Prime Minister said it's totally false to claim Canada is unwilling to fight fentanyl. You just indicated they're willing to do more here.",
      "He pointed to CBP data that showed a 97 percent drop in fentanyl seizures from January compared to December, a near zero low, he said.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Yes, we're\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the data accurate?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: The data is getting better. And I would say, in the conversations that I have had this week with Canadian officials, they were hoping to avoid the tariffs, and had a lot of conversations, but not a lot of action.",
      "So this is the hope, is that the fact that President Trump has said something and now has enforced consequences, we really are hoping for even better partnerships. We need access to their criminal background system, so that we know, when someone crosses that northern border, who they are, why they're in our country, and who they may be partnering with.",
      "We also need them to work with us on identifying packages, technology investments. Canada has said they will do that. We just want to see them actually do it. In the past, promises have been made by both Mexico and Canada that they didn't follow through on. Their naming of a fentanyl czar in Canada is important. That's great. Now let's see really what happens.",
      "President Trump has been strong, and I think that's why you've seen the data going our direction. But, boy, every day, people in this country are dying of overdoses. And I don't want any more families to have to deal with that tragedy if we can be \u2013 if it can be avoided and we can have a stronger relationship.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you just gave specific examples of what Canada and Mexico can do presumably to avoid the tariffs that are now being pushed off until April 2.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The commerce secretary said on another network: \"If fentanyl ends, I think these will come off, but if fentanyl does not end, or he's uncertain about it,\" meaning the president, \"they will stay on until he's comfortable.",
      "Is it that general, or are these very specific things that you can kind of go through and check to avoid these tariffs?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Yes, I have had very specific conversations with Canadian officials and Mexican officials on what they can do. So they know what they can do to help avoid tariffs in the future, and what we're expecting of them.",
      "If they do it, we shall see. We all recognize that each one of these leaders has political environments in their home countries as well, but President Trump means business. And he meant it when he ran to be president of the United States again and since he's taken office that he will put America first.",
      "And every day in this country, we have seen over the last several years violence and unsafe streets and cities and people lose their children and grandchildren, and he's taking action to make sure that we're cleaning up the mess that Joe Biden left behind, and that we have a much safer country, and where Americans can look forward to the future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this is not just leverage to get a better free trade deal? This is not just because President Trump truly believes that tariffs are the heart of his economic policy?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying this really is about fentanyl?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: It really is about fentanyl. It really is.",
      "And I think the president obviously wants a strong economy, obviously wants better trade deals as well. But this is about fentanyl and what we can do to stop the cartels from partnering with Chinese officials, laundering money and bringing a poison into our country that is specifically designed to kill the next generation.",
      "I think a lot of people don't understand the strategy\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 of these enemies of the United States and what they're utilizing.",
      "They are bringing this in, not just to make money. They're bringing it in here to kill Americans. And it's time that we stand up for the people that live here and make sure that we're stopping this war against our children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you.Border crossings, they're at a 25-year low.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: They are. It's fantastic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are 6,000 U.S. military personnel working at the border now. That number could go up to 9,000 by the end of the month.",
      "How long do you have to keep them there if the numbers are already dropping like this?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: You know, we'll continue the partnership with the Department of Defense.",
      "But, also, we've got partnerships with Commerce, with the attorney general's office. You know, we're working every day with the secretary of state. We'll keep them there until that border is completely secure. And we see all-time record lows of encounters. Our Border Patrol is doing fantastic work.",
      "But we're going to keep them there until the whole world gets the message that this isn't Joe Biden's world anymore. This is President Donald Trump's country, where we have a border, where we have laws, and it applies equally to everybody. I think that is what is so refreshing, is that we're not picking and choosing winners and losers anymore.",
      "Americans have to live by the law. So do those who come to this country. You have to come here legally, or there will be consequences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what's happening internally when it comes to \u2013 excuse me \u2013 migration.",
      "The administration has revived this policy of detaining migrant families, parents with children, in ICE detention centers. Bush did it. Obama did it. Biden did not. Have you seen these Texas facilities where children are being held with their parents? Are you comfortable with it personally?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We've got detention facilities across the country, and there's specific ones that are built specifically for families if they are detained.",
      "But, remember, everybody has an option. They have an option to be here legally or illegally, and they can self-deport as well. We've set up a system and a Web site where people who are here illegally right now can register, and they can choose to go home on their own and keep their families united.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The kids don't have a choice in this. You know that.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, the kids do have a choice. If they have parents, they make a choice to keep their families together, if they want to or not. They \u2013 if parents make a decision to leave their children behind, then that's a choice that they made as a family.",
      "And we need to remember that when Americans break the law, and they have consequences or face a situation, they're separated from their families too. I don't believe we should prioritize people from other countries above Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when it comes to reviving the policy of separating families from their children at the border\u2026",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: I don't know that we're actually reviving it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what I want to ask you.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: It's that President Biden didn't follow the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You won't\u2026",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: He didn't follow the law, in the fact that it's always been equally applied until his administration, and then he made decisions to ignore federal law in how he handled immigration and enforcement within our borders.",
      "And so, today, we're \u2013 we're expanding our team at ICE, and we're going to have an acting director in Todd Lyons, who has a long history with Tom Homan. They have worked together to build on these enforcement operations. We're also naming a deputy secretary in Madison Sheahan. That was going to be another expansion of this team.",
      "They have done incredible work cleaning up our communities and making them safer. Adding more people to the team, with Todd and with Madison, is going to allow us to partner with local law enforcement officials to make sure that we truly are following through on enforcing the law.

So people need to remember, if they self-deport, they will have an opportunity to come back to this country legally.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard the homeland security secretary say there are conversations with your government. She seemed optimistic that there would be follow-through on fentanyl.",

      "AMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Well, I hope so.",
      "I mean, it \u2013 I think that we are in a very good place in our discussions with the U.S. administration on fentanyl. We have invested a lot of new resources. We have given our law enforcement new powers. And we have responded to the requests of the Trump administration with respect to cooperative effects in getting at the sources, so the organized crime, the precursors coming from China.",
      "We've had some really, really good discussions. So we're optimistic. And, you know, I just would say, and I think it's important for your viewers to know, fentanyl is a very serious problem in Canada too. On some days, we have more deaths per capita than you have here in the United States.",
      "So we take this very seriously. It is not a big issue between our two countries. Less than 1 percent of the fentanyl that is seized in the United States is coming from Canada, but every ounce can kill families and people. So we're taking it very seriously.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you are indulging the premise that that is the actual motivation for the tariffs, rather than leverage for a free trade deal or just because President Trump believes in them?",
      "AMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Well, I think that this set of tariffs, the 25 and 10 percent set of tariffs, are \u2013 we have been told repeatedly that it is about fentanyl and security at the border.",
      "There are other tariffs that have been discussed, and the president has raised other issues as motivations for other tariffs, reciprocity and fairness, and, you know, maybe some changes that he'd like to see to our USMCA, our trade agreement. So those conversations are going to have to happen as well.",

      "And that, I think, is \u2013 we are putting our energy in the substantive discussions that we are having with the secretary, with USTR, with the White House. And, you know, that is, I guess, how I can answer that question.",
      "The president \u2013 the president does have a variety of concerns and I think also sees tariffs as a tool for a variety of policy objectives. But, really, all we can do is focus on the real work at hand, which is to get at these issues, like, for example, lumber. Canada doesn't have a tariff on lumber. It's zero. U.S. lumber can come into Canada duty-free.",
      "On dairy, the U.S. sells three times as much dairy into Canada as we sell into the United States. So, what's more, I think, productive for us is to talk about the facts around the actual trading relationship and try and get at where the concerns are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Canada does put a tariff as high as 241 percent on dairy imports, but it's a sliding scale that only kicks in at a certain level, and that's under the free trade deal.",

      "AMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: In sugar and dairy, you allow a certain amount of product in, and then, after that level is hit, you put restraints in on imports.

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They have a history together.",

      "So it's a long relationship, and has many \u2013 has had many phases to it. We will have a new prime minister this week. Today, the Liberal Party will elect a new leader. That new leader will be sworn in, in the coming days, and that person will become Canada's prime minister. Those are facts that are not going to change.",

      "What I can say is that Canadians don't really appreciate it. They're getting a little bit frustrated with that kind of rhetoric. But, more importantly, Canadians are frustrated with our neighbors, you know, the country that we feel closest to, the country that is partners, allies, often family that we've gone to war with, that we've died with, that we come to each other's aid, most recently in L.A., but obviously 9/11.",
      "You've come to our aid over the years so many times. And we feel \u2013 Canadians feel under attack, under economic attack. And that is causing some challenges, for sure, across Canadian society. I think our new prime minister, when that person comes in, will prioritize trying to have a good and \u2013 and healthy and productive relationship with the president.",

We're still digging through it, like most bills. There's some good in there. There's some not so good in there. And we've got to make an accurate decision.",

Title Three wire taps get shut down, surveillance teams get shut down. It is massive implications that most people don't realize. You never ever want to shut the government down. It should never happen. And it's a symptom of a broken system that we're even talking about this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me follow up with you on that. You are the only FBI agent who - now a congressman. On Monday, the top agent at the New York office, James Dennehy, said he was forced out of his job due to clashes with Justice Department officials over directives. He had been supportive of bureau leaders who resisted turning over the nations of those agents assigned to carry out investigations related to January the 6th, 2021. Are you concerned about all this political pressure?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: I'm very concerned. I'm a huge defender and supporter of the bureau. It was the best job I ever had in my life, and most honorable job I've ever had in my life, keeping America safe. And I care very much about the agent population and the professional support staff that worked there. They're a tremendous people. They are completely nonpartisan. At 14 years in the FBI, I never heard any political talk whatsoever, which is pretty remarkable. So -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That directly contradicts what the Homeland Security secretary said at the top of this program when she talked - she went at the FBI. The FBI director was -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, there have been conflicts at the top. I want - I want to differentiate. So, there have been problems on the seventh floor of the J. Edgar Hoover Building that they did politicize things, things like - people like Jim Comey, for example, who tweet out, you know, to vote single party during an election. You can't do that as an FBI director. That's terrible. He did it as a former director, but it undermines everything he did leading up to that point.",
      "The FBI needs to be completely nonpartisan, completely apolitical. Personally, I think that part of the polygraph testing that comes in, so when you're an agent coming through the process, you get tested on drug history, foreign contacts, financial vulnerabilities. They also ought to test political bias as well, just to give the public the assurance that people are coming into the bureau, checking their politics at the door.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: This all comes down to a busting of norms. And things that we've been used to for years are all trying to be disrupted, and I think, in some ways, very dangerously. We can't see this politization of the FBI. It's a dangerous thing for our country.",

Was he right that - that he didn't need to wait for Congress, that it was really messaging from the White House beyond?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Well, obviously, we've seen a reduction in crossings. We saw it under the end of the Biden administration as well after he did his executive order to say, no, asylum applications are between the ports of entry. But we need to make it permanent law. And Congress has not done its job for 30 years. So, we need to secure the border, we need to fix the broken asylum system and we need to treat people like human beings by fixing our legal immigration system.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: If - you can't fix everything through reconciliation. And you're going to need - and you can't - certainly can't fix asylum and you certainly can't fix the dreamers and a whole bunch of other stuff through reconciliation. There is going to be an opening that's going to come when they need Democratic votes. And my argument to my Democratic colleagues is, we should be looking to finally fix this broken immigration system once and for all. Secure the border, fix asylum, dreamers, farm workers, essential workers and other people that we need to keep our economy open.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And if I may add, one of the reasons why I'm so excited about Tom being the co-chair is he shares my passion and the passion of so many people about this issue that there is a border security piece and there is an immigration piece. And we're a country of immigrants. All of our families came into this country through other places, Italy, Ireland.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: My father was born in Italy.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And for Brian (ph) Fitzpatrick, Irish as well.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And, you know, that's the - that's the huge advantage that we have over our adversaries, is, we have an endless supply of brilliant people coming into this country. Nobody wants to move to Russia or China or North Korea or Iran. Everybody wants to come here. That's a huge economic advantage. It's a huge national security advantage.",
      "So, we can combine border security and the rule of law with being - bringing the best and brightest people into this country and also people that are truly fleeing oppression. And that's what America is about.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Margaret, every problem we face in our country is complicated. You know this as well as anybody. Everything's complicated. You can't, why don't you just?",

      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Compromise is not a dirty word. And we have got to figure out how to start moving our country forward, not with this all my way or the highway, you guys are no good because you're one of those - no, you're on of those.",

Ben Hodges, who's a retired general who commanded U.S. Army Europe, said he's having a hard time understanding how withholding intelligence, and military support from Ukraine, advances strategic interests or helps make America great.",
      "Can you explain that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, I will say this, we're going to get a briefing - a full briefing on this, this coming week. But I will say this, key in on what's not being said here. What kind of intelligence and who can't share it, right? So, what I suspect, and I will get confirmation of this next week, is that it's the over the horizon intelligence striking into Russian territory.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's also satellite.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Maxar technologies cannot (INAUDIBLE).",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We have seamless intelligence sharing with the U.K., to give you one example. There's no restriction on the U.K. sharing that intelligence with Ukraine. So, what I suspect is happening here, and I could be proven wrong, this that this an escalate to de- escalate tactic by the administration to bring these parties to the table and to come to a conclusion, a just conclusion, which means success and victory for Ukraine. And I want to emphasize that. And I get asked, well, what does that mean?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Vladimir - what victory means for me is Vladimir Putin regrets his decision to invade Ukraine. That he wishes he did not do that. And that's really going to be the test here, right, because if we reward dictators from invading sovereign, freedom-loving democracies, we are sending a message to every other dictator and aspiring dictator across this plant that, if you do do that, you will be rewarded. That cannot be the message coming out of this.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Trump has been wrong in the way he's handled this. I want to give Brian credit as co-chair of the Ukrainian Caucus, for standing up and saying, you cannot reward a dictator. Zelenskyy was elected by 73 percent of the Ukrainian population in a free and fair election as dictated by the European Commission that oversees free and fair elections. Putin is the dictator. Putin invaded. Zelenskyy is democratically elected. We cannot reward the guy responsible for murdering, for kidnapping, for raping, for all the awful things that have happened to the Ukrainian people. We all need to stand up for the Ukrainian people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know that the secretary of state, the national security adviser and President Trump's envoy are all meeting with Ukrainian officials Tuesday. One of the things that I took note of, Congressman Fitzpatrick, you tweeted that you have an outcome determinative number of members of the U.S. Congress who ready, willing and able to do whatever it takes to prevent Putin from being rewarded. That sounds like you are threatening leverage with votes. How would you use it?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: It's not - it's not a threat. What this is, is us making very clear that we view this issue to be existential to world peace. These are the lessons of World War II. When we had - when Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and you had leaders, including Neville Chamberlain and many other leaders around the world saying it's not our problem, we don't want to provoke, we don't want to escalate. And a problem that could have been nipped in the bud early, because it was not, turned out to be the costliest and deadliest war in world history where we had to send our young - our youth in our country to fight on Omaha beach. We should never get to that point. We should learn from the lessons of history.",
      "These dictators want to relitigate the outcome of World War II. And World War II, freedom won over dictatorship. They want to relitigate that. So, we just have to be mindful of history and how we approach this.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And if Putin gets away with this, just because Ukraine is a smaller country, think about Latvia and Lithuania and Estonia and Moldova and think about Poland.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: They're all next. And we have to stand up against this.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And Putin has said that. He's telegraphed this punch.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, President Trump says, oh, it's all different when he's in charge.",
      "But, Congressman, I need to ask you, before you go, because of the districts and the unique characteristics of it, the one you represent, earlier this week we saw guidance from the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee urging members to hold virtual town halls, suggesting that holding them in person was not a good idea. Will you still hold town halls with your constituents?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Yes. We - we communicate -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because some have gotten quite heated recently.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Oh, I know. No, I think every member needs to find the best way to communicate with their constituents. And there's a number of ways to do that. I think what Chairman Hudson is referring to are the - what's turning out to be a circus, a three-ring circus, where you go to a high school gymnasium, the protesters shows up, they hold signs up, and you have legitimate concerns from some other people that are never heard because they're getting shouted down by people that are there to make a spectacle, oftentimes that are funded by some of these dark money groups.",
      "So, there's - it's about communicating to your constituents in a way that you can get your message out, that you can hear their concerns. And every single district does it different depending on - on where they're at.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You, Congressman Suozzi, during the address to Congress this week, you did see Texas Democrat Congressman Green be disruptive. He was pulled out of the chamber because of that. Later censured with the votes of nine Democrats, including yourself, and 214 Republicans. Why did you take that vote against a fellow Democrat?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Because if it was a Republican doing the same thing to a Democratic president, I would have voted for that as well. And the bottom line is, it was a strategic mistake on the part - on our behalf as well because instead of talking about Social Security cuts, and talking about Medicaid cuts and talking about Medicare cuts, and talking about the things that the president said in his speech that we disagree with, especially things like Ukraine or firing people in these different departments that makes no sense whatsoever, we, instead, focus too much time on disruptive behavior.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And the conduct of the Democrats. That was a strategic mistake, as well as something that just is not appropriate for the decorum of the U.S. House of Representatives.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was - was that message from Democratic leadership not clear then?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: I think that it was pretty clear. I understood a clear message.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Let's not make the story about us, let's make the story about what President Trump says and how we disagree with it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, thank you, gentlemen -",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For doing this in a bipartisan fashion as well.",

      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Russia stepped up its aerial attacks on Ukraine following the Trump administration's suspension of intelligence sharing and military equipment. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Moscow has carried out hundreds of attacks using ballistic missiles and drones.",
      "For more now, we're joined by Fiona Hill. She is a senior fellow at Brookings and during the first Trump administration she was the senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council.",
      "Good to have you back.",
      "FIONA HILL (Senior Fellow, Brookings and Fromer National Security Council Senior Director for European and Russian Affairs): Yes, thanks, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the U.S. pauses of lethal intelligence sharing, including targeting data for U.S.-provided weapons like HIMARS. We also know it extends to satellite imagery, which is no longer being shared with Ukraine.",
      "What's the practical impact of that and the military freeze?",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, I think we can see the impact. It's certainly, on the one hand, emboldened Russia to really step up the attacks, and it's also not just blindsided but also partially blinded Ukraine. I mean, we heard from the previous segment that there's still some sharing with allies, like the United Kingdom, of course, which is part of the Five Eyes sharing with the United States. But frankly, none of the other allies, including the U.K., have the same access to satellite imagery as the United States does. So, even if there is, you know, some sharing, not much restrictions, there certainly has an impact.",
      "And, frankly, I think it's going to be an impetus to other allies to start stepping up their own capabilities and questioning themselves about the virtues of sharing with the United States. I mean, this is a two-way street. We have to remember that other countries also share pretty vital information with the United States, even if the scale is not quite the same.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Canada, the U.K., Australia, among those who do so. You think they will essentially punish the U.S. by not sharing intelligence freely?",
      "FIONA HILL: I'm not sure whether it's punishment, but it will be a lot of questioning about what actually happens with this. Because if you're bundling together intelligence, then effectively the United States is putting restrictions on that. Was that pre-discussed with our five eyes allies, for example, or with other allies, particularly in the midst of basically a conflict that is, as we've heard, you know, over and over again, the largest land war in Europe since World War II. I mean, this is really unprecedented in terms of the actions of the United States in this regard because he's not just affecting Ukraine, again, it's having knock-on effects for all of our other allies who are directly affected, all of our European allies that are directly affected by this conflict.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Trump said on Friday when he was asked if this uptick in Putin's bombing was directly related to the U.S. halt. Here's what he said.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I actually think he's doing what anybody else would do. I think he's - I think he wants to get it stopped and settled, and I think he's hitting them harder than - than he's been hitting them. And I think probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yet earlier in the day, the president had posted on social media he was considering possibly putting sanctions on Russia. That's a contradiction. What do you make of what he said?",
      "FIONA HILL: I make of it exactly what he said. I mean, he's actually, obviously, putting himself in the shoes of Vladimir Putin and saying that if I were the aggressor, that's exactly what I would be doing if I wanted to make Ukraine capitulate. So, I mean, yes, he called it as it is. I don't believe what he said for a second about the sanctions. I believe more what he just said there in the Oval Office, sitting behind, you know, the Resolute Desk. I mean,n I think that's what you can take away from this. He accurately -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Believe the president and when he says things?",
      "FIONA HILL: That's - I think you should. Yes. I mean, he's the president of the United States. And he made it crystal clear, I think. And he sees, you know, obviously, the Ukraine - the Ukrainians, and he said that in the Oval Office during the meeting with President Zelenskyy, that he sees them on the back foot as losing, and he's basically telling them that they have to capitulate. Very clear.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't have the cards was the line. He kept using that.",
      "FIONA HILL: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know you were at the Council on Foreign Relations this week, as was I. I had an interview with Trump's envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg. And when we were discussing the president's decision to cut off Ukraine, he said, Ukrainians brought it on themselves, and the decision was, like, quote, \"hitting a mule with a two by four across the nose, you got their attention.\"",
      "It's quite a statement, comparing our ally to a farm animal here that needed to be beaten. Do you think it was right to say the Ukrainian government, though, was just not getting it?",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, what they weren't getting is really what President Trump wanted directly from them, which was obviously to have President Zelenskyy make a personal agreement with him in the Oval Office in front of all the cameras to thank him profusely for all the aid that was already provided to Ukraine over, you know, successive administrations now, and basically to sign a deal on rare earths minerals and then basically leave immediately after that. And clearly, President Zelenskyy didn't really get that message.",
      "And I think there's a very important element here. In diplomacy, you really should not only be speaking in your native language. And I think that a lot of this was lost in translation. First of all, President Zelenskyy didn't fully understand that this agreement was just purely with President Trump. And you may remember, if we all go back and watch that - I watched it many times just to try to figure out exactly where things had gone wrong, and there were multiple points. But there's one point when President Zelenskyy basically said, look, you know, we had deals with your - your previous presidents, basically with Obama and Biden. And President Trump immediately dismissed all of that and basically said those deals were not worth the paper they were written on, or the commitments that were made because they were weak and it wasn't me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it was not me.",
      "FIONA HILL: And President Zelenskyy didn't quite follow all of this because, like the rest of our allies, he actually thinks that commitments made by the United States are supposed to hold over successive administrations. And what we learned there, what he learned there, was that is not the case. You're essentially going to have to make a new commitment with President Trump. It's a personal commitment. And that was what he was being told, and he didn't fully understand.",
      "And I think in the future, when the Ukrainians are meeting with the Americans, they ought to have translators with them because as good as President Zelenskyy's English is, there's two things that he's missing there. He doesn't quite understand the way that President Trump operates -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FIONA HILL: Although I think he's probably got the message now, but he doesn't always understand the nuances. And I would also think that our side on the United States side could do with some interpretation as well, coming also from President Zelenskyy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FIONA HILL: So, my advice to President Zelenskyy and to the team around President Trump is, use interpreters, that's what they're there for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And your own government's interpreters?",
      "FIONA HILL: That's absolutely right, your own government's interpreters, no (ph), because you actually asked that question, who's interpreters were used and General Kellogg couldn't answer the question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, for Steve Witkoff, who met with Putin for three and a half hours.",
      "FIONA HILL: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Europe seems to be taking these threats seriously and looking at an alternative to the American nuclear deterrent. An umbrella. That's - does that mean the transatlantic alliance is gone?",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, it doesn't mean that it's gone, but there's a bit of a kind of a one-sided attempt to rupture it here on the part of the United States.",
      "I was also at the Munich Security Conference. I heard Vice President Vance's speech. I was standing next to a couple of very prominent Europeans who were completely in shock.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FIONA HILL: And immediately after that, as you well know, there were many statements coming out of Germany, as well as countries like Sweden, basically asking whether the United States could be trusted on nuclear weapons.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.",
      "FIONA HILL: But we have to remember that Ukraine had nuclear weapons that it gave.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they gave them up.",
      "FIONA HILL: That's correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: With the promise of a security guarantee that was not delivered on.",

      "She said their conversations ended in 2019.",
      "Authorities believe Thompson had matured, with time and distance away from Blauvelt. She told them she realized what she had done was wrong, and gradually offered more leads. Blauvelt might still be in Oregon. And she added Blauvelt told her he had been living with another woman for years.",
      "CAPT. SCHOFIELD (June 2022 interrogation): 'Cause honestly, she's in danger, too.",

      "Las Vegas Review-Journal investigative reporter Jeff German was a man who lived for his job. And as it turns out, may have died for it. In September 2022, he was stabbed to death by an assailant outside his home.",
      "German was a local legend\u00a0\u2013\u00a0renowned for his reporting on infamous mobsters, crooked politicians and murderers.",
      "\"How big a list of people might have wanted Jeff dead?\" \"48 Hours\" correspondent Peter Van Sant asked Glenn Cook, the Review-Journal's executive editor. \"That's a line of people that runs from here to Los Angeles,\" Cook replied. \"This guy's written about terrible people, who've done awful things for over 40 years. The worst kinds of people.\"",
      "They came up with a short list of people who may have threatened him. One of those was Clark County public administrator Robert Telles. German had written four articles about Telles' alleged hostile behavior at the office.",
      "German first learned about the accusations of a toxic workplace from four female Clark County employees. \"[Telles] was a horrible, a horrible human being,\" one of the women, Rita Reid, told Van Sant. \"Monster is the right word.\"",
      "\"Jeff German was guided by an innate sense of right and wrong,\" said Cook. \"If he knew someone was engaging in criminal activity, unethical activity, inappropriate behavior \u2026 he wanted to do that story, he wanted to bring it to light.\"",
      "After German spoke with the four women, they were relieved to find out that German would take on their story. \"He did something, and he fought for us,\" Goodwin said. \"And he is 100 percent our hero.\"",
      "They could have never imagined that just five months after meeting him, their hero would be dead.",
      "THE ASSASSINATION OF JEFF GERMAN",
      "Briana Erickson: On September 2nd, 2022, it was a boiling hot late summer day in Las Vegas. And people were getting ready for the Labor Day weekend. \u2026 It was late morning when in broad daylight, something terrible happened.",
      "As investigative journalists for the Las Vegas Review-Journal Briana Erickson and Rhonda Prast had seen a lot of bad people do a lot of bad things. But nothing came close to the Machiavellian plot to murder their friend and colleague, Jeff German.",
      "Rhonda Prast: Jeff German was at his house, on vacation. He'd gone out to get something to eat. He came back, shut his garage door.",
      "Rhonda Prast: You could see in the surveillance video from across the street that \u2026 Someone, an assailant, came into his yard, went to the left side of his house, went inside the gate, shut the gate.",
      "Briana Erickson: And then we see Jeff, moments later, opening his garage door and he was instantly ambushed when he turned the corner to where that person was lying in wait. \u2026 In the video, you can kind of see a struggle, but German ultimately falls to the ground, and he never gets up.",
      "Peter Van Sant: What happened to him in that attack?",
      "Rhonda Prast: Jeff was stabbed \u2026 He was stabbed seven times, four times in the neck, three in the torso.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Seven stab wounds \u2026 did that suggest what kind of a killing this was?",
      "Rhonda Prast: To me, this was a very personal attack. To stab someone in such a short time viciously seven times, with no warning.",
      "A concerned neighbor found German's body hidden behind some bushes 24 hours later.",

      "NEIGHBOR: I have a neighbor across the street from me. He's laying in the side yard, um, I believe he's dead. He's got blood over him.",
      "Rhonda Prast: It was just a terrible thing to know that he was lying there, and we wondered whether he could have been saved. But medical experts told us later \u2026 that he likely died within a minute or two.",
      "It was a small mercy for a man who had spent his life fighting for the underdog.",
      "Rhonda Prast: At the base, he just wanted to help people and protect people you know \u2026 and expose wrongdoing.",
      "From the start, German was shooting for big game. And when he came from Wisconsin in the 1970s las Vegas was the Serengeti. Mark Fierro, a TV reporter at the time, became a lifelong friend and trusted source.",
      "Mark Fierro: Jeff German at the outset was a, a \u2026 reporter who caught the most important beat in Las Vegas of his day that was organized crime.",
      "Then a reporter for the Las Vegas Sun, German took on one of the biggest, meanest mobsters on the strip \u2014 Tony Spilotro, a power player for the Chicago Mob, who was played by Joe Pesci in Martin Scorsese's film, \"Casino.\"",

      "JEFF GERMAN | \"Mobbed Up\" podcast: In my stories, I got used to calling Spilotro by his street name \u2013 Tony the Ant. He hated that and it sometimes left me at the receiving end of Spilotro's nasty stares and his menacing fits of anger.",
      "Mark Fierro: The irony of all of this is \u2014 is that Jeff \u2026 was not a tall man, was not a strong man, but he toughed it out and he went toe to toe with these guys year in and year out. And some of these guys were dangerous guys.",
      "Try as they did, they couldn't scare him, says Erickson.",
      "Briana Erickson: After his tires had been slashed and some spooky things were happening to him, he told a mob affiliate in a bar to call off his dogs. Then he got punched in the face. He later described that as a badge of honor.",
      "JEFF GERMAN | \"Mobbed Up\" podcast: A couple of hours later with four stitches under my lip, I had a war story to tell.",
      "As the mob slowly lost its grip on Vegas, German built a career exposing dirty business, government corruption and crime. Prast, the former assistant managing editor for investigations at the Review-Journal, worked with him for three years.",
      "Rhonda Prast: He kept digging and digging and digging, and he was like the dog, the little dog \u2014 that would take a bite of your pants and wouldn't let go. You know, he was just so laser focused on continuing to go deeper and deeper and deeper into a story.",
      "That tenacity helped him expose the truth in stories that could have remained in the shadows. He was one of the few journalists, along with his colleague David Ferrara, to report on the Susan Winters case \u2014 a woman whose parents doubted the suicide ruling in their daughter's death.",
      "Mark Fierro: And Jeff started putting pieces together. \u2026 working with the attorney for the family \u2026 that the way that she killed herself was so unseemly that it just didn't add up. \u2026 And once he started \u2026 he started pulling on that thread, and then he started pulling on a rope and then it turned into a chain.",
      "That chain turned into a series of stories that targeted the husband. Turns out Winters died from ingesting a lethal combination of painkillers and antifreeze. The husband, who was charged with murder, ultimately pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sent to prison.",
      "As hard-charging and public as German was in his work life, the lifelong bachelor was notoriously private about his personal life.",
      "Mark Fierro: He was always back to business, back to business. This man was born to be a reporter.",
      "The entire newsroom rallied together. His colleagues had no idea who did this or why, but they were determined to do what German would have done: find out.",
      "WHO WANTED JEFF GERMAN DEAD?",
      "The Review-Journal staff was in mourning. Their sorrow \u2014 cards and flowers\u2014 in full display on German's desk.",
      "Briana Erickson: It's a reminder that \u2026 this team is not gonna be the same without him \u2026 But we can carry on the way he would want us to.",
      "And that meant doing what he would have done. The staff started tugging on threads and searching for clues, working nonstop on one of the most important stories of their careers: who killed Jeff German?",
      "Rhonda Prast: Immediately, I started thinking in my head, all right, who had threatened Jeff in any way in the last five months? Who could have possibly done this?",
      "Executive editor Glenn Cook asked Prast to come up with a short list of people to consider.",
      "Rhonda Prast: One of the names I gave him was Robert Telles.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And who is Robert Telles?",
      "Rhonda Prast: He was a Clark County elected official, in charge of the Public Administrator's Office, which handles estates of people who were deceased.",
      "One of the estate coordinators in Telles' office, Aleisha Goodwin, had reached out to German in March 2022. She had filed a formal complaint with the County Office of Diversity on behalf of herself and some colleagues claiming Telles harassed, bullied, and discriminated against them.",
      "Rita Reid: He was a horrible, a horrible human being \u2026 Monster is the right word.",
      "But Goodwin says, the county did nothing.",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: It was always, \"he's an elected official. There's nothing we can do.\"",
      "German agreed to hear what Goodwin and her colleagues, Noraine Pagdanganan, Rita Reid and Jessica Coleman, had to say.",
      "Jessica Coleman: And when he finally talked to us and he let us tell what had happened to us and he said, \"No, I'm going to look into this.\" \u2026 I think that's the only thing that gave us enough energy to keep going.",
      "According to the women, the trouble began almost immediately after Telles took office in January 2019. Reid, a supervisor, was his second in command and a 12-year veteran of the office.",
      "Rita Reid: He came in very abruptly into the office and he slammed his palms down on my desk (slams hands on table) with a \u2014 with a real loud bang.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Like a (slaps hands on table).",
      "Rita Reid: Oh, yes, absolutely. And he leaned forward, and he said, \"we're ripping off the bandage. You no longer supervise anyone, no one reports to you. \u2026 They all report to me.\" And he turned around and he walked out. And I just sat there stunned.",
      "The women say they were ordered not to speak to each other in the office.",
      "Jessica Coleman It felt dangerous to even have a hello, good morning, conversation with coworkers in passing.",
      "If caught, the consequences could be severe, says Goodwin. She remembers getting called into Telles' office after he saw her and two other women talking",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: We walked into his office, and he said, \"sit down and shut up. You're not gonna talk. \u2026 I'm gonna talk.\" \u2026 And he just got this look on his face, he sits back, and he pointed at Noraine and said, \"f*** you.\"",
      "Peter Van Sant: What was it like to be in that room ... receiving that?",
      "Noraine Pagdanganan: It was scary \u2026 because \u2026 I \u2026 Did not want to upset him because I knew how he could be.",
      "Despite years of service, all the women say they feared for their jobs. And Coleman,\u00a0 who safeguarded the property of the deceased in a caged room, says she feared for her physical safety. She says Telles would sometimes come in and threaten her.",
      "Jessica Coleman: There was an instance where he got in my face and, you know, he's yelling and I'm sort of backed up against, um, the cage door.",
      "Peter Van Sant: He was trying to physically intimidate you?",
      "Jessica Coleman: Yes, yes. \u2026 He would bring his chairs up really close and \u2014 and demand that you really pay attention and look him in the eye while he told you horrible things.",
      "One of those horrible things, says Coleman, almost did her in. Alone in the cage together, she says, Telles started by saying that he noticed she never talked to anyone in the office, a bizarre comment considering his no-talking rule.",
      "Jessica Coleman: \"If you keep going down this road, you're going to be like our cases and you're just going to die alone, and nobody is going to find you.\" \u2026 and I sat there and cried. Um, and then after that \u2026 it's hard to admit. (Crying) Then I started, um, thinking the best thing I could do would be to sacrifice myself for the girls.",
      "Jessica Coleman: (Crying) And I had actually picked out a place, um, that I was going to hang myself in the hall in view of the door, because he would always come by and \u2014 and make sure I was working. And I thought this will be good. If they have to find me this way, then the county will have to do something.",
      "Mercifully, Coleman realized that was not the solution to the problem.",
      "But they came up with another plan. The women believed Telles was having an inappropriate relationship with a subordinate in the office named Roberta. Roberta, they claimed, used that relationship to assume power and privilege beyond her job title.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Is there any doubt in your mind that the two of them were having a romantic affair?",
      "Rita Reid: No.",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: No.",
      "Jessica Coleman: Absolutely not.",
      "Peter Van Sant: None whatsoever",
      "Jessica Coleman: No because we --",

      "Rita Reid: Very carefully.",

      "Glenn Cook: And at that moment we send reporters and photographers straight to the house. And the message I give our Metro editor is, do not engage, do not approach, do not be seen. This man is very likely a suspect in the murder of your colleague, and we can't predict how he's gonna react to anyone being near him.",

      "Peter Van Sant: This must have been a moment where, I don't know if there's any cheering going on in your newsroom, but what a development. What does this mean?",
      "Art Kane: Well, it means that possibly Jeff was killed by the last story he wrote about. I mean, this was his last investigation and \u2014 and the suspect appears to be the guy he wrote about and basically took him out of office.",
      "Without corroboration from police documents, The Review-Journal couldn't go with the story. But Cook was betting it wouldn't be long. His reporters had seen unmarked police cars outside Robert Telles' home.",

While he was in custody, detectives collected a DNA sample from Telles. They also took the jeans he was wearing into evidence and gave him a white paper suit to change into before he was taken back to his house and swarmed by reporters eagerly awaiting his arrival.",
      "Inside Telles' home, investigators say they found gym shoes and a duffel bag similar to what was seen in the surveillance video. And when they looked in the garage, detectives say they discovered even more \u2013 a straw sun hat \u2014 or what was left of it.",

      "Peter Van Sant: Where do you go?",
      "Kevin Cannon: So I made a B-line to the front door of a neighbor who I befriended earlier when I arrived. And they, without saying a word, opened the door and welcomed me in and walk me to their backyard where I could have a view of Telles' house.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And you could still see the house from your vantage point?",
      "Kevin Cannon: From the backyard, yeah.",
      "Back in the Review-Journal newsroom, some of the staff anxiously kept up with what was happening at the scene through the office's police radio and heard that Telles refused to come out of his home.",

      "Cannon was the only photographer that day to capture Telles' dramatic arrest. His image of Telles on the stretcher made the front page of the Review-Journal the following morning.",
      "Kevin Cannon: The next day, I, uh, opened the paper and there was a photo on the front page with a banner headline, \"Stunning Arrest.\" And \u2014 It was stunning.",

      "Art Kane: And now you'll see him walk over and, um, make sure that Jeff is dead.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And you're theorizing he is checking to see \u2026 if he's dead because obviously Jeff saw this person.",

      "Peter Van Sant : If you did not commit this murder, who did?",
      "Robert Telles: I will \u2026 reserve that for trial.",
      "Peter Van Sant: You have said \u2026 that you were framed, do you stand by that in this conversation?",
      "Robert Telles: I do. I absolutely do.",
      "Telles says he can explain the evidence against him: the torn up sun hat, the Yukon Denali and his DNA under German's fingernails.",
      "Robert Telles: I say that that evidence or so-called evidence was planted along with the other items that were allegedly found in my home as well. And we will go ahead and prove that at trial.",
      "Peter Van Sant: How could someone who is trying to frame you plant your DNA under his fingernails? How would that have \u2014 have happened? They \u2014 first, they would have had to have gotten your DNA. \u2026 And then when would they have planted it under his fingernails? It seems far-fetched.",
      "Robert Telles: Well, you know, crazier things have happened, and I'll tell you that I didn't kill Mr. German.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Come on, man. That's overwhelming. \u2026 DNA ends up under his fingernails, your DNA. This is an overwhelming case against you, Robert, that you committed this murder.",
      "Robert Telles: Again, sir, you know, you have the facts wrong, and I will demonstrate it at trial.",
      "He also says he will show he didn't do those things German wrote about in his articles.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Robert, you're saying that what these women have said to me, what they told Jeff German and he printed, those are all lies?",
      "Robert Telles: If you look at what Mr. German printed, none of it was \u2014 none of it had any facts within it, right? \u2026 It was all alleged opinion about \u2026 you know what how they felt that \u2013 that I \u2013 I acted.",
      "But it's hard to argue with the footage the women shot of their boss and his alleged lover in the parking garage.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Let me ask you straight \u2026 were you \u2026 and Roberta having an affair?",
      "Robert Telles: Uh, no. \u2026 she was a \u2026 a confidant, um, but I'll \u2014 I'll leave it at that.",
      "But German was not willing to leave it at that. He was planning on writing another piece.",
      "According to police documents, Telles and Roberta got word the day before the murder that there was a planned release of emails and messages between her and Telles to the Review-Journal.",
      "Peter Van Sant: There was a Freedom of Information [Act] requests that Jeff had put out and you were told \u2026 that new messages and emails were gonna come out, describing the relationship between you and Roberta, communications between the two of you. And it's suggested that you made a decision to murder him to try to silence that, to prevent that from being published. What do you say about that?",
      "Robert Telles: I'm sure that's a mischaracterization of \u2014 of things. \u2026 I'll tell you that what was going to be released and I saw was going be released, um, had no inklings of \u2014 of any type of, you know, confidential relationship, any type of supposed affair. \u2026 It was all business related \u2026 So, that would not have been a motivation because there was nothing that was going to be produced that \u2014 that would look bad.",
      "Glenn Cook: Prosecutors have mentioned this as a contributing motive to the murder. In Robert Telles' mind \u2026 Jeff German ruined his marriage, ruined his political career, embarrassed him and was continuing to report on him rather than leave him alone.",
      "If the intention of the alleged killing was to stop German's reporting, it didn't work. After his murder, the Review-Journal journalists hunted through German's notes.",
      "Briana Erickson: Picking up where Jeff left off.",
      "And completed the stories German had been working on at the time of his death, including another on Telles' toxic past -- a story that investigates claims of sexual harassment, all of which he has denied.",
      "Briana Erickson: The main thing here is you cannot kill a reporter and kill the story. You just can't do that.",
      "In life, German was known to protect his sources at all costs.",
      "In death, German was still protecting them. After the murder, the police took all his devices \u2014 which harbored the names of countless sources.",
      "The Review-Journal went to court, and in a hard-fought court case that went all the way to the Nevada Supreme Court, the paper won protection for his sources.",
      "Mark Fierro: That'll be the German rule that you will not be able to go into a reporter's files. You will not be able to go through their phone. You will not be able to look at their sources even after death.",
      "The four Jeff German sources are not about to let the world forget the reporter who fought to protect them. They have attended almost every hearing trying to come to terms with their feelings of guilt.",
      "Aleisha Goodwin: Because no matter what logic is in your head, it's not your fault that Jeff made his choices and that he was a professional. Your heart tells you if we wouldn't have made that call, he wouldn't have died in that violent way that day. And if I was to talk to him today, I think the first thing I would say is, \"I'm sorry.\" \u2026 But not for him, for me, because he wouldn't have accepted my apology (crying), but I need to give it.",
      "Jeff German was a reporter's reporter. One of the good guys. A man who spent a lifetime speaking truth to power, truths that are now baked into the history of this place \u2013 a neon strip of gritty stories laid bare beneath the desert sky.",
      "Glenn Cook: He told anyone who asked that he was never going to retire, that he was going to report until his last breath. And that's exactly what he did \u2026 And he gave his life to this job. He literally gave his life to this job. I think that's his legacy.",

    "summary": "North Korea fired several ballistic missiles into the sea after South Korean and U.S. troops began their large annual combined drills, Seoul said.",
    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea \u2014 North Korea fired several ballistic missiles into the sea on Monday, South Korea's military said, hours after South Korean and U.S. troops kicked off their large annual combined drills, which the North views as an invasion rehearsal.",
      "South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile firings, North Korea's fifth missile launch event this year, were detected as coming from the North's Hwanghae province but gave no further details such as how far they flew. It said South Korea bolstered its surveillance posture and is closely coordinating with the United States.",
      "Earlier Monday, the South Korean and U.S. militaries began their annual joint military exercises, which are scheduled to last 11 days. The Freedom Shield command post exercise began after the South Korean and U.S. militaries paused live-fire training while Seoul investigates how two of its fighter jets mistakenly bombed a civilian area during a warm-up drill last week.",
      "The drills' start drew the condemnation of nuclear-armed North Korea, which issued a government statement calling the exercises a \"dangerous provocative act\" that increases the risks of military conflict \"by means of an accidental single shot.\"",
      "About 30 people were injured, two of them seriously, when two South Korean KF-16 fighter jets mistakenly fired eight MK-82 bombs on a civilian area in Pocheon, a town near the North Korean border, on Thursday. The bombing occurred while South Korean and U.S. forces were engaging in a live-fire drill ahead of the larger Freedom Shield exercise.",
      "In a background briefing to domestic reporters on Monday, the South Korean air force repeated its initial assessment from last week that one of the KF-16 pilots had entered the wrong coordinates for a bombing site.",
      "The unidentified pilot didn't recognize the error during a pre-takeoff check and, rushing to meet scheduled timing, failed to visually verify the target before proceeding with the bombing. The second pilot had the correct coordinates but focused only on maintaining formation with the other aircraft and dropped the bombs following the first pilot's instructions, failing to recognize they deviated from the right target, according to the content of the briefing provided to The Associated Press.",
      "Gen. Lee Youngsu, chief of staff of the South Korean air force, bowed and apologized Monday over the injuries and property damage caused by the incident, which he said \"should have never happened and must never happen again.\"",
      "Both the South Korean and U.S. militaries have halted all live-fire exercises in South Korea following the mishap. South Korean military officials say live-fire training will resume after they complete the ongoing investigation on the bombing and formulate preventative steps.",
      "The Freedom Shield exercise marks the first large-scale joint exercise since President Trump began his second term. It comes amid growing tensions with North Korea over its nuclear ambitions and its alignment with Russia in President Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Trump, who met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un three times during his first term, has expressed his willingness to reach out to Kim again to revive diplomacy, which collapsed due to disagreements over exchanging U.S.-led sanctions against the North and the North's denuclearization steps. But Pyongyang has yet to respond to his overture and has continued its fiery rhetoric against Washington and Seoul over their joint military exercises, which Kim portrays as rehearsals for invasion.",
      "In a statement issued through state media Monday, the North Korean Foreign Ministry called the Freedom Shield exercise an \"aggressive and confrontational war rehearsal\" that risks triggering \"physical conflict\" on the Korean Peninsula.",
      "The ministry reiterated Kim's state goals for a \"radical growth\" of his nuclear force to counter what he claims as growing threats posed by the U.S. and its Asian allies.",

      "Russian strikes on Ukraine killed at least 20 people, officials said Saturday, as heavy aerial attacks continued after the U.S. stopped sharing satellite images with Ukraine.",
      "The decision to withhold intelligence and military aid came on the heels of a tempestuous White House visit last week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Without U.S. satellite imagery, Ukraine's ability to strike inside Russia and defend itself from bombardment is significantly diminished.",
      "At least 11 people were killed in multiple strikes on a town in Ukraine's Donetsk region late Friday. The attack also damaged eight apartment blocks in the town of Dobropillya, which is close to the front where Russian troops have been making steady advances.",
      "Zelenskyy said at least five children were among the injured in Dobropillya.",
      "\"Last night, the Russian army fired two ballistic missiles at the center of Dobropillya,\" he said. \"After emergency services arrived at the scene, they launched another strike, deliberately targeting rescuers. It is a vile and inhumane intimidation tactic to which the Russians often resort.\"",
      "Another six people were killed in the front-line towns of Pokrovsk, Kostyantynivka, Myrnograd and Ivanopillya, officials said, while emergency services reported that three others died when a Russian drone hit a civilian workshop in the northeastern Kharkiv region.",
      "The barrage came after the U.S. suspended military aid and intelligence to Ukraine to pressure it into accepting a peace deal being pushed by the Trump administration.",
      "When asked Friday by a reporter during an Oval Office exchange if Russian President Vladimir Putin was taking advantage of the U.S. pause on intelligence-sharing to attack Ukraine, President Trump responded: \"I think he's doing what anybody else would.\"",
      "Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Mr. Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, told CBS News that Ukrainians brought the pause in U.S. intelligence sharing \"on themselves.\"",
      "It's \"sort of like hitting a mule with a two-by-four across the nose,\" Kellogg said of the impact of the intelligence pause on the battlefield. \"Got their attention.\"",

      "Zelenskyy welcomed the prospect of additional sanctions on Moscow, saying, \"Everything that helps Putin finance the war must be broken.\"",
      "Ukraine's air force reported Saturday that Russian troops launched three Iskander missiles and 145 drones over the country overnight. The bombardment contained a mix of attack and decoy drones intended to confuse air defenses. One missile and 79 drones were shot down, while 54 more drones were lost without causing damage, the Ukrainian air force said.",
      "Meanwhile, Russian troops shot down 31 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 26 over the country's Krasnodar region, Russia's Defense Ministry said Saturday.",
      "Falling debris from one drone sparked a blaze at the KINEF oil refinery in Russia's northern Leningrad region, local Gov. Aleksandr Drozdenko said in a statement. No casualties were reported.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mark-carney-canada-prime-minister-justin-trudeaus-resignation/",
    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 20:26:15 -0400",
    "summary": "As Trump's trade war looms over Canada, the ruling Liberal Party has chosen veteran economist Mark Carney to replace Justin Trudeau.",
    "story": [
      "Toronto\u00a0\u2014 Canada's Liberal Party has chosen veteran central bank leader Mark Carney as its new leader, meaning he will quickly replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the country's top office. The transition, and Trudeau's political downfall, comes amid the chaotic trade war with Canada's closest ally launched by President Trump.",
      "The exact date that Carney will take office as Canada's prime minister remains uncertain. The timing of the transition will be determined by Carney in conjunction with Trudeau.",
      "Carney won nearly 86% of the more than 151,000 votes cast. The next closest candidate received 11,144 votes.",
      "The new leader will inherit a government led by a party which has seen its support among the Canadian electorate wane significantly over the past few years. With opposition parties eager to trigger an election, the situation is becoming increasingly urgent. Carney's government could be toppled by Parliament to call for a new national election, which can be called any time between the Parliament going back into session on March 24 and October 20, by which time a vote must be held.",
      "Trudeau announced in January that he would step down as party leader and, with the move, from his role as the prime minister, due to increasing pressure from within the Liberal Party as polls showed its support among voters tanking.",
      "Trudeau's resignation announcement paved the way for the Liberal Party to chose a new leader, and Carney won that internal party election on Sunday \u2014  and many Canadians will hope to see him quickly form a new cabinet and then put his decades of financial experience to work as the country confronts Mr. Trump's trade war.",
      "Who is Mark Carney?",
      "Born in Fort Smith, in Canada's Northwest Territories, Carney grew up in Edmonton before heading to the U.S. to pursue a degree in economics at Harvard University. He later moved to the U.K. and earned a master's degree and then, in 1995, a doctorate in economics from the prestigious University of Oxford.",
      "He was appointed as the Governor of the Bank of Canada \u2014   akin to the Federal Reserve in the U.S. \u2014 in 2008, amid the global financial crisis, which he helped to steer Canada through.",
      "Carney's influence has extended well beyond Canada, however, and not only because he led one of its most important central government institutions. In 2010, Time Magazine named him among the world's 25 most influential leaders. In 2011, Reader's Digest Canada named him the \"Most Trusted Canadian,\" and the editors of Euromoney magazine named him Central Bank Governor of the Year in 2012.",
      "During his tenure as Canada's central banker, he also held several high-profile international positions, including as chair of the Committee on the Global Financial System and head of the Financial Stability Board for the G20 group of the world's biggest economies.",
      "Between 2013 and 2020, Carney moved back to Britain after being tapped as the Governor of the Bank of England, heading up the U.K.'s central bank and helping to guide the country through the economic convulsions brought on by its \"Brexit\" from the European Union. He was the first non-U.K. citizen to govern the institution in its 300-year history.",
      "More recently, Carney served as the United Nations' special envoy on climate action and finance and as head of transition investing at the Brookfield Asset Management firm. He stepped down from both of those positions to pursue his Liberal Party leadership bid.",
      "Carney's reaction to Trump",
      "Mr. Trump's trade war and his frequent threats to make Canada a U.S. \"51st state\" were hot topics during the Liberal Party leadership campaign. Carney, along with the other candidates, emphasized the importance of a strong domestic economy in the face of those threats.",
      "Carney said Canada had allowed its economy to become \"weak,\" leaving it susceptible to Mr. Trump's tariff-based pressure tactics. He said Canada was experiencing one of the worst economic crises in its history, and that overcoming it would require major reforms to ensure long-term strength and stability.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a debate for his party's leadership. \"I know how to build strong economies.\"",
      "Carney on Sunday said the retaliatory tariffs Canada has placed on the U.S., which he said will have \"maximum impact in the United States and minimum impact here in Canada,\" would remain \"until the Americans show us respect.\"",
      "Carney said Mr. Trump was \"attacking Canadian families, workers and businesses, and we cannot let him succeed. And we won't. We won't. I am proud. I am proud of the response of Canadians who are making their voices heard and their wallets felt.\"",
      "Earlier in the campaign, he said that as prime minister, he would impose dollar-to-dollar reciprocal tariffs on U.S. imports in a trade war and leverage Canada's role as a vital supplier of energy and uranium to its southern neighbor.",
      "\"It's important to distinguish what you can't control, what we can control. We can't change Donald Trump, but we can control our economic destiny,\" he said during a debate.",
      "Carney on Sunday also addressed Mr. Trump's threats to annex Canada, saying, \"America is not Canada, and Canada never, ever will be part of America in any way.\"",
      "\"We didn't ask for this fight... So the Americans, they should make no mistake, in trade, as in hockey, Canada will win,\" he added.",

Prince Frederik founded the organization in 2021 to help raise awareness about the condition.",
      "Prince Robert; his wife, Princess Julie of Nassau; and Prince Frederik's siblings, Alexander and Charlotte, were all able to say goodbye to him on his last day, the patriarch said. One of the last things Frederik asked him was, \"Papa, are you proud of me?\" according to Prince Robert.",
      "\"He had barely been able to speak for several days, so the clarity of these words was as surprising as the weight of the moment was profound,\" Prince Robert wrote. \"The answer was very easy, and he had heard it oh so many times\u2026. but at this time, he needed reassurance that he had contributed all that he possibly could in his short and beautiful existence and that he could now finally move on.\"",
      "The young prince was remembered as a joyful person with \"indomitable lust for life.\" He was learning Italian and was a big fan of the U.S. adaptation of \"The Office,\" which he has seen over 10 times in its entirety, Prince Robert said.",

      "Frederik was born with POLG disease, but he wasn't diagnosed until he was 14 years old, his father said.",
      "According to the POLG Foundation, the mitochondrial disorder Frederik had \"robs the body's cells of energy,\" and can cause a variety of symptoms, including progressive dysfunction and failure of multiple organs.",
      "\"One might compare it to having a faulty battery that never fully recharges, is in a constant state of depletion and eventually loses power,\" the PoLG Foundation said on its website.",
      "Experts estimate that about 2% of the population carry POLG mutations. However, the total number of people with POLG-related diseases is unclear. One study of adults in Australia with POLG mutations found that 10% of them had POLG-related diseases."

    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 10:23:48 -0400",
    "summary": "New guidelines agreed to last year by 21 nations (including the U.S.), and a recent French law, may make it easier for Jewish families to claim ownership of artworks that they believe were sold under duress as the Nazis took over Europe.",
    "story": [
      "Few who see Picasso's \"The Actor \"at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art know its complicated history. Paul Leffmann, a German Jewish businessman, sold it in 1938. \"It used to hang in the home of my great-granduncle,\" said Laura Zuckerman. \"He needed money to escape the Nazis.\"",
      "\"Did they get out?\" I asked.",
      "\"They did get out. And they did survive. But not all of the family did.\"",
      "Zuckerman represents Leffmann's heirs, who have fought for the painting \u2013 worth as much as $100 million \u2013 claiming it was sold under duress, meaning, \"If there had not been Nazi persecution against them, they never would have sold it,\" she said.",
      "Yet, two American courts disagreed.",
      "But for other cases, the tide may be turning. An Amsterdam museum returned \"Odalisque\" by Henri Matisse, to the heirs of Albert and Marie Stern, saying it was sold under duress. The Sterns had tried to escape, but most of the family died in concentration camps.",
      "And in an historic policy shift, the French Parliament recently unanimously approved a law fast-tracking the return of art to families who claim it is rightfully theirs.",
      "David Zivie, of France's culture ministry, heads the mission for research and return of Nazi-era looted property. He says the motive of such work is \"to recognize what happened, and to help families to get their works.",
      "\"We have to know the history, because they should be in the rightful owner's hands, because they are the last witnesses of what happened during the war,\" Zivie said. \"These works are like the witnesses of the persecutions.\"",
      "University of Denver professor of history Elizabeth Campbell said, \"I think there finally is political will to recognize that this is part of belated justice.\"",
      "She wrote about the complicity of the French and other European governments in keeping what the Nazis stole in her book,\u00a0\"Museum Worthy: Nazi Art Plunder in Postwar Western Europe.\"\u00a0Campbell says there could be even more change with new guidelines agreed to by France and other countries, including the United States. \"These new guidelines say that any persecuted person who sold a work of art during the Nazi era should be assumed to have done so under duress,\" she said. \"So, it's now giving a blanket acknowledgement of coercion in any sale. It's really a dramatic change.\"",
      "When the Germans retreated, allied art experts found stacks of stolen paintings everywhere, from caves to castles. More than 60,000 pieces of art were returned to France. But some 2,000 pieces ended up in limbo, held by the French government with no clear rightful owner.",
      "Ines Rotermund-Reynard is the newly-hired provenance researcher at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris. Her job is to find the truth about a piece of art's Nazi-era past. \"There's really a huge wish now by the French to clarify the situation,\" she said. \"It's somehow as if you take a detective and you say, 'Look at all the cold cases which happened 80 years ago and solve it.' Each story is important. And it is worth, for each family, to do this effort.\"",
      "But the case of Armand Dorville has pitted the French government against his heirs, among them Francine Kahn, who said, \"Discovering those pictures is a way to know him.\"",
      "Another heir, Rapha\u00ebl Falk, said, \"I feel anger when we have so much difficulties to retrieve them.\"",
      "When Dorville died of natural causes in 1941, his art collection was sold at auction. But due to anti-semitic laws, the French authorities confiscated the proceeds, and family members \u2013 without money to escape \u2013 were later murdered at Auschwitz.",
      "Eighty years later, a North Carolina museum returned one of Dorville's paintings to the family, and a German museum returned one by impressionist Camille Pissarro. But the French government is refusing to give back more than half a dozen paintings held in public museums, saying the auction was not done under duress.",
      "Falk said, \"It must be hard for them to give them back. So, I can understand that. But [to give them back], it's just right, you know? It's just right.\"",
      "The family hired Paris lawyer Corinne Herschkovitch, who has spent 30 years recovering art for Jewish families. \"All these people in charge of the cultural heritage, they were more concerned by keeping alive or preserve all these paintings and works of art than to preserve the Jews,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Do you think some of these museum directors are still ashamed of how they got these paintings?\"",
      "\"I think so, I think so. They are embarrassed, that's for sure,\" said Herschkovitch.",
      "The Dorville heirs believe they are fighting for their history.",
      "I asked, \"When you get them back into the family, do you feel somehow that bad history has been corrected? Erased?\"",
      "\"Not erased, never erased,\" Falk replied. \"Members of our family died because of it. In my mind, it's a way to repair the damage that was done.\"",
      "Kahn said, \"It is the memory of the family. Because it was totally forgotten. And it is on our shoulders to awake this story ... to tell the story.\"",

    "story": [
      "Pope Francis issued a message Sunday thanking volunteers for the \"miracle of tenderness\" they offer the sick, as the Vatican celebrated the Holy Year Mass for volunteers around the world in his absence.",
      "After more than three weeks in the hospital recovering from double pneumonia, the 88-year-old pope's doctors reported positive news about his health over the weekend, saying Francis was responding well to treatment and has shown a \"gradual, slight improvement\" in recent days.",
      "For the fourth Sunday in a row, the 88-year-old Francis didn't appear for his weekly noon blessing, but he met with his top deputies and the Holy See distributed the text he would have delivered if he were well enough. In it, the Argentine pope thanked all those who were caring for him and others who are sick and experiencing a \"night of pain.\"",
      "\"Brothers and sisters, during my prolonged hospitalization here, I too experience the thoughtfulness of service and the tenderness of care, in particular from the doctors and health care workers, whom I thank from the bottom of my heart,\" read the message from Gemelli hospital.",
      "\"And while I am here, I think of the many people who in various ways are close to the sick, and who are for them a sign of the Lord's presence. We need this, the 'miracle of tenderness' which accompanies those who are in adversity, bringing a little light into the night of pain,\" he wrote.",
      "Francis, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, has remained in stable condition at Gemelli, with no fever and good oxygen levels in his blood for several days, doctors reported in a Vatican statement Saturday.",
      "The doctors said that such stability \"as a consequence testifies to a good response to therapy.\" It was the first time the doctors had reported that Francis was responding positively to the treatment for the complex lung infection that was diagnosed after he was hospitalized on Feb. 14. The positive update for Francis followed a few bouts of respiratory crises last week.",
      "Doctors characterized the pope's prognosis as \"guarded,\" meaning he's not out of danger.",
      "\"In order to record these initial improvements in the coming days as well, his doctors have prudently maintained the prognosis as guarded,\" the Vatican said in a statement.",
      "On Sunday morning, the Vatican reported Francis was resting after a quiet night.",
      "In his absence, the Vatican's day-to-day operations continued alongside celebrations of its Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century Jubilee that brings millions of pilgrims to Rome. On Sunday, Canadian Cardinal Michael Czerny, who is close to Francis, celebrated the Holy Year Mass for volunteers that Francis was supposed to have celebrated.",
      "During the Mass in St. Peter's Square, the giant banner bearing Francis' papal coat of arms fluttered from the loggia of the basilica above. Even while in the hospital, Francis is very much still the pope and in charge of the Catholic Church.",
      "That was evident too by the fact that the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and chief of staff, Archbishop Edgar Pena Parra, visited the pope on Sunday, for the third time since he has been in the hospital. The Vatican has noted that such meetings are the routine way the pope governs while at the Vatican, making clear that he was getting essential work done from Gemelli.",
      "Francis has been using high flows of supplemental oxygen to help him breathe during the day and a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask at night.",
      "Francis was hospitalized Feb. 14 for what was then just a bad case of bronchitis. The infection progressed into a complex respiratory tract infection and double pneumonia that has sidelined Francis for the longest period of his 12-year papacy and raised questions about the future.",

    "story": [
      "Panama on Saturday released dozens of migrants who were held for weeks in a remote camp after they were deported from the U.S. They were given 30 days to leave the Central American nation.",
      "The deportees, largely from Asian countries, were part of a deal struck between the Trump administration and Panama and Costa Rica last month as the U.S. government attempts to speed up deportations. The deal represented a significant diplomatic win for President Trump and his government-wise crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "The Trump administration sent hundreds of people, many families with children, to the two Central American countries as a stopover while authorities organize a way to send them back to their countries of origin.",
      "The arrival of the deportees was met with weeks of lawsuits and human rights criticism for poor conditions by the Panamanian government, which has said it wants to work with the Trump administration \"to send a signal of deterrence\" to people hoping to migrate.",
      "Critics described it as a way for the U.S. to export its deportation process.",
      "The agreement fueled human rights concerns when hundreds of deportees detained in a hotel in Panama City held up notes to their windows pleading for help and saying they were scared to return to their own countries. Those that refused to return home were later sent to a remote camp near Panama's border with Colombia, where they spent weeks in poor conditions, were stripped of their phones, unable to access legal counsel and were not told where they were going next.",
      "Under international refugee law, people have the right to apply for asylum when they are fleeing conflict or persecution.",
      "It thrust many like Hayatullah Omagh, a 29-year-old who fled Afghanistan in 2022 after the Taliban took control, into a legal limbo, scrambling to find a path forward.",
      "\"We are refugees. We do not have money. We cannot pay for a hotel in Panama City, we do not have relatives,\" Omagh told the Associated Press in an interview. \"I can't go back to Afghanistan under any circumstances ... It is under the control of the Taliban, and they want to kill me. How can I go back?\"",
      "Authorities have said deportees will have the option of extending their stay by 60 days if they need it, but after that, many like Omagh don't know what they will do.",
      "Omagh climbed off a bus in Panama City alongside 65 migrants from China, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Nepal and other nations after spending weeks detained in poor conditions by the Panamanian government, which has said it wants to work with the Trump administration \"to send a signal of deterrence\" to people hoping to migrate.",
      "Human rights groups and lawyers advocating for the migrants were waiting at the bus terminal, and scrambled to find the released migrants shelter and other resources. Dozens of other people remained in the camp.",
      "Among those getting off buses were migrants fleeing violence and repression in Pakistan and Iran, and 27-year-old Nikita Gaponov, who fled Russia due to repression for being part of the LGBTQ+ community and who said he was detained at the U.S. border, but not allowed to make an asylum claim.",
      "\"Once I get off the bus, I'll be sleeping on the ground tonight,\" Gaponov said.",
      "Others turned their eyes north once again, saying that even though they had already been deported, they had no other option than to continue after crossing the world to reach the U.S.",
      "Lawyers and human rights defenders warned that Panama and Costa Rica were turning into \"black holes\" for deportees, and said their release was a way for Panamanian authorities to wash their hands of the deportees amid mounting human rights criticism.",
      "Those who were released Saturday night, like Omagh, said they could not return home.",
      "As an atheist and member of an ethnic minority group in Afghanistan known as the Hazara, he said returning home under the rule of the Taliban \u2014 which swept back into power after the Biden administration pulled out of the country \u2014 would mean he would be killed. He only went to the U.S. after trying for years to live in Pakistan, Iran and other countries but being denied visas.",
      "Omagh was deported after presenting himself to American authorities and asking to seek asylum in the U.S., which he was denied.",
      "\"My hope was freedom. Just freedom,\" he said. \"They didn't give me the chance. I asked many times to speak to an asylum officer and they told me 'No, no, no, no, no.'\"",
      "Panamanian authorities denied accusations about camp conditions, but blocked journalists from accessing the camp and cancelled a planned press visit last week.",
      "While international aid organizations said they would organize travel to a third country for people who didn't want to return home, Panamanian authorities said the people released had already refused help.",
      "Omagh said he was told in the camp he could be sent to a third country if it gives people from Afghanistan visas. He said that would be incredibly difficult because few nations open their doors to people with an Afghan passport.",
      "He said he asked authorities in the camp multiple times if he could seek asylum in Panama, and said he was told that \"we do not accept asylum.\"",
      "\"None of them wants to stay in Panama. They want to go to the U.S.,\" said Carlos Ruiz-Hernandez, Panama's deputy foreign minister, in an interview with the AP last month.",
      "That was the case for some, like one Chinese woman who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity, fearing repercussions from Panamanian authorities.",
      "Upon getting off the bus, the first thing she wanted to do was find a Coca-Cola. Then, she'd find a way back to the U.S.",
      "\"I still want to continue to go to the United States and fulfill my American dream,\" she said.",
      "Panama's willingness to accept the deportees also came as Mr. Trump has expressed an interest in retaking control of the strategically important Panama Canal, which the U.S. ceded to Panama in 1999. Panama's leaders have rejected the idea outright, and disputed claims by Mr. Trump and U.S. officials about China's influence on the canal's operations.",

Some celebrate the economic, social and political achievements of women, while others urge governments to guarantee equal pay, access to health care, justice for victims of gender-based violence and education for girls.",
      "It is an official holiday in more than 20 countries, including Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Ukraine, Russia and Cuba, the only one in the Americas.",
      "As in other aspects of life, social media plays an important role during International Women's Day, particularly by amplifying attention to demonstrations held in countries with repressive governments toward women and dissent in general.",
      "While the idea behind a women's day originated in the U.S. with the American Socialist Party in 1909, it was a German feminist who pushed for a global commemoration during an international conference of socialist women held in 1910 in Copenhagen. The following year, events across Europe marked the day, and during World War I, women used it to protest the armed conflict, which lasted from 1914 to 1918.",
      "International Women's Day is observed on March 8 after a massive protest in Russia on Feb. 23, 1917, that led to the country's eventual withdrawal from the war. At the time, Russia had not adopted the Gregorian calendar and still used the Julian calendar.",
      "\"On Feb. 23 in Russia, which was March 8 in Western Europe, women went out on the streets and protested for bread and peace,\" said Kristen Ghodsee, professor and chair of Russian and East European studies at the University of Pennsylvania. \"The authorities weren't able to stop them, and then, once the men saw that the women were out on the streets, all of the workers started coming and joining the women.\"",
      "The U.N. began commemorating the holiday in 1975, which was International Women's Year, and its General Assembly officially recognized the day two years later.",
      "Women in Eastern Europe have long received flowers on March 8 - and sometimes even gotten the day off from work. But chocolates and candy can come across as belittling gestures, showing a lack of understanding of the struggles driving women to protest, particularly in regions where protests have been combative.",
      "In Turkey, women in 2023 braved an official ban on an International Women's Day march in Istanbul, and protested for about two hours before police used tear gas to disperse the crowd and detain dozens of people.",
      "In Mexico, which hosts one of the region's biggest marches, celebrations this year are marked by sharp contrasts. While the country celebrates its first female president, many also mourn victims of stark violence against women - including femicide. In Mexico and Latin America, soaring rates of violence against women and persistent machismo often leave tension simmering on March 8 as protesters demand justice.",
      "Globally, a woman or girl is killed every 10 minutes by a family member or partner, according to U.N. figures, and women being exposed to conflict has significantly jumped over the past decade.",
      "Ghodsee said commemorating International Women's Day is now more important than ever, as women have lost gains made in the last century, chief among them the 2022 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a nationwide right to abortion, which ended constitutional protections that had been in place nearly 50 years."

    "story": [
      "Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said he rejects a U.S. push for talks between the two countries because they would be aimed at imposing restrictions on Iranian missile range and its influence in the region.",
      "Speaking to a group of officials on Saturday, Khamenei did not identify the United States by name but said a \"bullying government\" was being persistent in its push for talks.",
      "\"Their talks are not aimed at solving problems, it is for ... let's talk to impose what we want on the other party that is sitting on the opposite side of the table,\" he said.",
      "Khamenei's remarks came a day after President Donald Trump acknowledged sending a letter to Khamenei\u00a0seeking a new deal with Tehran to restrain its rapidly advancing nuclear program and replace the nuclear deal he withdrew America from during his first term in office.",
      "Iran on Saturday said it had not yet received a letter, the AFP reported.",
      "\"We have heard of it (the letter) but we haven't received anything,\" Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on state television.",
      "Khamenei said U.S. demands would be both military and related to the regional influence of Iran.",
      "\"They will be about defense capabilities, about international capabilities of the country. (They will urge Iran) not to do (certain) things, not to meet some certain people, not to go to a certain place, not to produce some items, your missile range should not be more than a certain distance. Is it possible for anybody to accept these?\"",
      "Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, said such talks would not address solving problems between Iran and the West. Though Khamenei did not name any person or country, he said the push for talks creates pressure on Iran in public opinion. \"It is not negotiation. It is commanding and imposition,\" he said.",
      "Trump in comments to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday did not mention the letter directly. But he made a veiled reference to possible military action, saying: \"We have a situation with Iran that, something's going to happen very soon. Very, very soon.\"",
      "His overture comes as both Israel and the United States have warned they will never let\u00a0Iran acquire a nuclear weapon, leading to fears of a military confrontation as Tehran enriches uranium at near weapons-grade levels \u2014 something only done by atomic-armed nations.",
      "Tehran has long maintained its program is for peaceful purposes, even as its officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb as tensions are high with the U.S. over its sanctions and with Israel as a shaky ceasefire holds in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Iran's accelerated production of near weapons-grade uranium puts more pressure on Trump. He's repeatedly said he's open to negotiations with the Islamic Republic while also increasingly targeting Iran's oil sales with sanctions as part of his reimposed \"maximum pressure\" policy.",
      "Late in August, Khamenei in a speech opened the door to possible talks with the U.S., saying there is \"no harm\" in engaging with the \"enemy.\" However, more recently the supreme leader tempered that, saying that negotiations with America \"are not intelligent, wise or honorable,\" after Trump floated nuclear talks with Tehran.",

That's an average of about 90 rapes per day, CBS News previously reported, and the real figure is believed to be far higher due to the stigma surrounding sexual violence and victims' lack of faith in police.",
      "Rape and sexual violence have been under the spotlight since the brutal 2012 gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus. The attack galvanized massive protests and inspired lawmakers to order the creation of fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases and stiffen penalties.",

In 2022, a British tourist was raped in front of her partner in Goa.",

      "\"She appears totally self-consumed and tone deaf,\" Schofield added. \"You're standing next to Mindy Kaling, and you're not asking her how she built her girl boss empire? Why?\"",
      "After rising to fame when she starred in the hit NBC sitcom \"The Office,\" Kaling, 45, founded her production company, Kaling International, in 2012. Through Kaling International, Kaling has created and produced a number of successful television series, including \"The Mindy Project,\" \"Never Have I Ever\" and \"The Sex Lives of College Girls.\"",
      "Kaling is the creator and showrunner of her company's most recent project, Netflix's TV show \"Running Point,\" which stars Kate Hudson. The sports comedy premiered on the streaming platform Feb. 27 and debuted at No. 3 on Netflix's Top 10 Shows in the U.S.",
      "The six-time Emmy Award winner joined Markle in the second episode of \"With Love, Meghan\" during which they teamed up to host a children's garden tea party. According to Markle, the two have been \"email pen pals\" since Kaling appeared on her \"Archetypes\" podcast in 2022.",

      "Schofield noted how the viral exchange highlighted points that other reviewers made in their criticism of \"With Love, Meghan.\" The show, which Markle chose to film at a rented estate in Montecito, California, instead of her own home nearby, has been critiqued for lacking authenticity.",
      "\"Meghan lacks humility or an ounce of authenticity.\" Schofield said. \"It\u2019s a blatantly obvious PR exercise that does not give us a glimpse of Meghan\u2019s real world. She\u2019s doing random arts and crafts in someone else's house with people she claims are her very best friends but doesn\u2019t know that they\u2019re left-handed or allergic to peanut butter? Your \u2018girl\u2019 Mindy doesn\u2019t know your last name is Sussex?",
      "\"It\u2019s such a painful farce,\" Schofield added. \"Her 'hacks' are common knowledge, and her definition of 'elevating' equals wasting 60 pounds of fruit and tracing lines on your paper menu with a pencil so you can erase them later.\"",
      "Markle and Kaling had an awkward exchange on the show that later went viral. (Netflix)",
      "Royal photographer Helena Chard agreed that Markle's show would have had more resonance with audiences if she had used the opportunity to authentically connect with her guests and showcase her real personality.",
      "\"As far as I see, Meghan lacks charisma and connection with her guests and audience,\" Chard told Fox News Digital. \"Her guests, however, glorify Meghan, putting her on a pedestal.

      "The royal expert described Markle's cooking and hosting tips and tricks as \"unoriginal and basic.\"",
      "\"The production sadly feels bland, staged and stilted,\" Chard added. \"Netflix [has] shot a glossy production focusing on Meghan. The hope is the series will show Meghan in a new light, rehabilitate her image and change public perception.",
      "\"The truth is people want to see more raw fun moments, not staged aspirational content,\" she explained. \"A fun, authentic personality full of heart resonates far more with the public and would give Meghan far more kudos.\"",
      "\"With Love, Meghan\" has been criticized for lacking authenticity. (Netflix)",
      "\"With Love, Meghan\" was originally scheduled to be released in January, but its debut was delayed due to the Los Angeles fires.

Harry and Meghan made brief appearances in the docuseries when the duke competed in a charity polo match.",
      "\"Polo\" was also met with mostly negative reviews after its release. Royal expert Hilary Fordwich drew comparisons between \"Polo\" and \"With Love, Meghan,\" telling Fox News Digital the shows were poorly received for similar reasons.",

      "\"Most unfortunately, just like Harry\u2019s Netflix flop \u2018Polo\u2019, amongst the plethora of reasons why ratings are so low and critics have savaged [Markle]\u2019s is due to lack of authenticity, being a tone-deaf portrayal of privileged self-important people,\" Fordwich said.",
      "\"Neither Netflix show has resonated with audiences. Both have been universally derided,\" she added.",
      "Fordwich cited the shows' low ranking scores from users on IMDb, where \"Polo\" holds an audience score of three out of 10 and \"With Love, Meghan\" notched a score of 2.7 out of 10.",
      "\"Both sets of low ratings are devastating as Netflix doesn\u2019t invest to reap such lackluster ratings,\" Fordwich said.",
      "Fordwich referred to an Instagram post Markle shared to promote \"With Love, Meghan\" ahead of its release. On Tuesday, Markle uploaded a carousel of images taken during the show's production, writing \"Today is the day! A few BTS snaps + food pictures I took on set for \u2018With Love, Meghan.\u2019 Come join the party on @netflix!\"",

      "\"I couldn't take a shower for more than 30 seconds without being on oxygen,\" he told Fox News Digital in an interview.",

      "After spending seven months on the wait list, Thomas opted to settle for one lung since that would be faster than waiting for two. His surgery was performed on Feb. 28, 2023.",
      "\"The flu and any other illness would be exacerbated because of the underlying scarring of the lung.\"",

      "What is post-COVID fibrosis?",
      "A healthy lung allows for the normal exchange of gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, when one breathes air,\u00a0Scheinin told Fox News Digital.",
      "The inflammatory response sparked by early mutations of the novel coronavirus led to scarring of lungs in many individuals.",
      "Testing for this condition is relatively non-invasive, typically including a cat scan or X-ray to check for structural lung damage, as well as blood tests and a pulmonary function test. (iStock)",
      "In certain cases, the doctor said, the lungs no longer function as well as they did before the infection.",
      "\"The normal gas exchange is impeded because now you have areas of the lung tissue that are scarred, and therefore they're not functioning normally,\" he said.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"If it's a small area, it may be insignificant and unnoticeable, but as more of the lung tissue becomes scarred, more of the normal lung function is destroyed, [and] the patient becomes short of breath.\"",
      "This could lead to future issues, especially if the patient is exposed to other respiratory ailments.",
      "\"The flu and any other illness would be exacerbated because of the underlying scarring of the lung,\" Scheinin said. \"I think it just makes the lungs more susceptible to injury.\"",
      "Symptoms, diagnosis and treatment",

This urgency is designed to bypass rational thinking and prevent you from verifying the legitimacy of the request.",

      "Specific yet unfamiliar details: The mention of \"Bryana White\" and the precise amount of $950.44 is a clever tactic.

This approach aims to instill doubt and urgency, increasing the chances that the victim will act hastily.",

This deceptive strategy is designed to manipulate you into believing you are interacting with a trusted institution, thereby increasing the likelihood of falling for their scam.",
      "Unsolicited contact: Be wary of unexpected texts claiming to be from your bank, especially if you haven't signed up for text alerts.",
      "Spelling and grammatical errors: Look for mistakes in spelling, grammar or punctuation. Legitimate messages from banks are usually written by professionals and are free of errors.",

      "4. Report the text to your bank and forward it to 7726 (SPAM): By reporting this text, Jane can help Kinecta and her mobile carrier protect other customers from similar scams.",
      "5. Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) on your accounts: This extra layer of security could prevent scammers from accessing Jane's account even if they obtained her password.",
      "6. Use SMS filtering tools provided by your mobile carrier: These tools might have caught and flagged the suspicious \"Kinect\" text before it reached Jane's inbox.",

Invest in personal data removal services: This can help reduce the amount of personal information available online, making it harder for scammers to target Jane and you with personalized attacks in the future.

      "Cybercriminals are constantly finding new ways to exploit trusted apps and browser extensions.",
      "Since people tend to trust tools that seem legitimate, attackers use them to spread malware or steal sensitive data. A new report reveals that over 3.2 million users have been affected by a security breach involving malicious browser extensions.",

      "How were the extensions compromised?",
      "GitLab Security has uncovered a major security breach affecting over 3.2 million users through a network of compromised browser extensions, including some linked to GitLab. The attack stemmed from a supply chain breach, where threat actors infiltrated legitimate extensions and pushed malicious updates. These updates embedded hidden scripts that allowed unauthorized data collection, altered HTTP requests and injected ads into web pages, all without users noticing.",
      "Originally built for tasks like ad blocking, emoji input and screen recording, these extensions were repurposed through covert updates that exploited the extensive permissions users had granted, enabling real-time manipulation of web activity.",
      "Typically, malicious extensions or apps are created solely to steal data, with their advertised functionality being an afterthought or simply a way to get listed in an official store. That was not the case here. These were legitimate extensions that became harmful only after attackers injected malicious updates into them.",
      "An illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Which extensions are affected?",
      "Several of the compromised extensions are commonly utilized and may be present in your browser. For instance, ad blockers such as AdBlock are valued for eliminating disruptive advertisements and enhancing browsing privacy. However, in this breach, these tools were manipulated to deliver malicious payloads. The following extensions have been identified as affected:",

      "VPN Extension",
      "If any of these extensions are installed on your browser, it is recommended that you assess their permissions and consider their removal until official security updates are verified.",
      "The malicious extensions bypassed Content Security Policy protections, which are designed to prevent cross-site scripting attacks, allowing attackers to modify web content without detection. They also communicated with command-and-control servers to receive further instructions, showing a high level of coordination. The attackers exploited the trust users place in the Chrome Web Store and its automatic update system. Investigations suggest this activity has been ongoing since at least July 2024.",
      "Some of the compromised extensions listed above have generic names that may resemble well-known and legitimate tools, but they are not the same. For example, \"Password Manager\" in our list refers to a malicious extension identified in the breach,\u00a0not to reputable password manager services we mention here.\u00a0Similarly, extensions named \"AdBlock Plus\" or \"VPN Extension\" in this context are not necessarily the widely trusted versions but rather imitations or malicious variants.",
      "To ensure you're using a legitimate extension, follow these steps.",
      "Verify the developer \u2013 Always check the extension's publisher in the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons. Official brands like Norton, Google or Microsoft will be clearly listed.",
      "Check the reviews and downloads \u2013 Malicious extensions often have lower ratings, generic reviews or a small number of downloads compared to their legitimate counterparts.",
      "Avoid third-party sites \u2013 Only install browser extensions directly from trusted sources like the\u00a0Chrome Web Store,\u00a0Mozilla Add-ons or the official website of the developer.",

      "1.\u00a0Keep your browser and extensions up to date: Outdated software is a goldmine for cybercriminals. Bugs or security gaps in old versions of your browser or extensions can be exploited to inject malicious code, steal data or take control of your system. Updates patch these vulnerabilities, making them a critical line of defense. Turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2. Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons have rules and scans to catch bad actors, but they\u2019re not perfect. Extensions from random websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware. Stick to the official store for your browser. Don\u2019t download extensions from sketchy links.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Be skeptical of extensions requesting unnecessary access: Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag.",
      "Before installing, ask, \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer is no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension has been sold or hacked.",
      "5. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the incident, and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a password manager. This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this security incident, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "7. Don\u2019t respond to texts/calls from unknown sources: Whatever you do, don\u2019t respond to texts/calls from unknown sources whatsoever.",

      "What is vishing?",
      "Vishing, short for \"voice phishing,\" is a type of cybercrime that uses phone calls to deceive individuals into revealing personal or financial information. Unlike\u00a0traditional phishing, which relies on emails or text messages, vishing leverages the power of human voice and social engineering to manipulate victims. Scammers often impersonate legitimate organizations, such as banks, tech companies, or government agencies, to gain trust and create a sense of urgency. They may ask for passwords, credit card numbers, or other sensitive details, which they then use for fraudulent purposes.",
      "Because vishing relies heavily on social engineering tactics, it can be difficult to detect, making it a particularly dangerous form of cybercrime.",

      "Scammers start by identifying potential victims through social media, public transaction records, leaked databases, and more. Once they select a target, they gather personal details (email, phone number, financial holdings) to build credibility. And you could easily be a target. That\u2019s because\u00a0data brokers \u2013 companies that buy and sell your personal information \u2013 are goldmines for scammers.

I strongly suggest you remove your personal info from people search sites online. If you give someone your email or phone number, they might be able to find your home address through a reverse search.\u00a0While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "7. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Install and regularly update strong antivirus software to protect your devices from malware, viruses and other cyber threats. Antivirus software provides real-time protection, scans for malicious files and helps prevent infections by blocking access to harmful websites and downloads.

These vishing schemes, carefully orchestrated like a theatrical play, exploit our trust and leverage real security alerts to gain access to our accounts. Protecting ourselves requires constant awareness, skepticism towards unsolicited communications, and proactive measures to safeguard our personal information. While the tactics may evolve, the underlying principle remains the same: scammers rely on deception to exploit our vulnerabilities.

      "1) Monitor your financial accounts: Regularly check your bank statements, credit card transactions and credit reports for suspicious activity. The breach exposed financial details, making unauthorized transactions a real risk. Consider setting up alerts for any unusual activity.",
      "2) Enroll in credit monitoring: DISA is offering affected individuals 12 months of free credit monitoring and identity restoration services through Experian. Take advantage of this by enrolling before the June 30 deadline to keep tabs on your credit and detect potential misuse early.",
      "3) Place a fraud alert or credit freeze: Contact one of the major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) to place a fraud alert on your file, which makes it harder for thieves to open accounts in your name. For stronger protection, consider a credit freeze, which restricts access to your credit report entirely.",
      "4) Be wary of phishing attempts and install strong antivirus: With personal details in the hands of cybercriminals, expect an uptick in targeted scams. Avoid clicking links or sharing information in unsolicited emails, texts or calls claiming to be from DISA or related entities.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Invest in data removal services:\u00a0In light of these recurring data breaches, taking proactive steps to protect your personal information is crucial. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The DISA Global Solutions data breach isn\u2019t just an apparent mistake. It seems to be a complete failure. A company that handles sensitive data for millions, including Fortune 500 clients, let hackers lurk in its systems for more than two months. Worse, it took 10 months to tell the public. Now, 3.3 million people are left dealing with the fallout while DISA offers a token year of credit monitoring. The real cost is years of potential identity theft and financial damage.",

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/doges-amy-gleason-ex-nurse-data-cruncher-straight-shooter-rcna195114",
    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 11:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Amy Gleason, a nurse turned health care technology consultant, was recently named the acting administrator for DOGE. How much control she has at DOGE is unclear.",
    "story": [
      "Amy Gleason, a former emergency room nurse-turned-health care technologist, was scared. It was 2010 and no doctor could figure out what was behind her daughter Morgan\u2019s strange constellation of symptoms, including rashes and muscle weakness so severe that she could no longer walk upstairs.",
      "When Morgan was finally diagnosed with a rare and potentially life-threatening autoimmune disorder after more than a year, Gleason became determined to empower other patients so they didn\u2019t face similar delays in diagnosis.",
      "\u201cIf a doctor had seen all of these visits and activity on one single screen put together, they probably would have wondered why this 10- or 11-year-old is going to the doctor all the time,\u201d Gleason said in a 2020 TEDx talk. \u201cAnd maybe that would have sparked a faster diagnosis.\u201d",
      "Until recently, Gleason, 53, had been a relatively low-profile health care data cruncher with a passion for simplifying access to electronic medical records.",
      "Then, at the end of February, the White House announced Gleason had been named the acting administrator for the Department of Government Efficiency, elevating her to a prominent position in the Trump administration.",
      "Gleason previously worked on projects related to health data at the U.S. Digital Service, DOGE\u2019s predecessor, overlapping with Trump\u2019s first term and the Biden administration.",
      "However, the White House has not provided details about why, exactly, it selected Gleason to lead DOGE \u2014 a task force unit at the center of the administration\u2019s efforts to streamline the federal government.",
      "The move has led many to question whether Gleason is truly in charge or whether the power resides with Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man and a special government employee who has been the face of DOGE.",
      "For weeks, the administration evaded questions about who was actually at the helm; the White House said Gleason was the acting administrator only after administration lawyers were unable to answer who was in charge of the agency when questioned in court. Gleason does not appear to have made any public comments since the White House announced that she was DOGE's top official.",
      "The administration has also revealed very little about who else works for DOGE and what they do, despite Musk\u2019s claims of transparency.",
      "Even with Gleason\u2019s title, Musk still seems to hold sway. As recently as Tuesday, Trump referred to DOGE as \u201cheaded by Elon Musk,\u201d setting off fresh legal questions about the group\u2019s operations. The working relationship between Musk and Gleason is unclear, and a DOGE spokesperson did not respond Friday to questions about Gleason\u2019s job responsibilities.",
      "Gleason also did not respond to a request for comment for this articles. In interviews, former colleagues described her as highly intelligent and the most valuable asset wherever she works.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s exactly the kind of person you need in a role like this,\u201d said Dr. Gregg Alexander, a pediatrician in London, Ohio, who has known her for about 20 years. \u201cShe\u2019s always tried to do the right thing.\u201d",
      "Still, some former colleagues worry that in her DOGE role, Gleason will be inadvertently complicit in cuts to programs that have personal significance to her \u2014 including research for rare disease funding. DOGE has threatened dramatic budget cuts to federal health agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health.",
      "The condition that Gleason\u2019s daughter, who is now in her mid-20s, was diagnosed with is called juvenile dermatomyositis. The extremely rare disease is a form of juvenile myositis, in which a child\u2019s immune system attacks its own cells and tissues.",
      "Therapies discovered over the years thanks to partnerships with NIH have improved the prognosis for juvenile myositis, said James Minow, executive director at the advocacy organization Cure JM Foundation, where Gleason served as a board member and vice president for research from 2014 to 2018, according to her LinkedIn profile.",
      "But with the Trump administration trying to cut NIH grant funding, Minow said he worried that DOGE could hamper the rare disease research that Gleason\u2019s family and so many others depend on.",
      "\u201cAmy is a very thorough thinker, and I think that she\u2019ll be one who will make very solid, reasoned recommendations to the president as he looks at fulfilling what he sees as his mission to reduce the size of government,\u201d Minow said. \u201cObviously, Cure JM is wanting to do everything we can to protect NIH\u2019s investment.\u201d",
      "Gleason\u2019s friends and former colleagues describe her as apolitical. From 2018 to 2021, she worked for the U.S. Digital Service, an agency created by the Obama administration after its chaotic rollout of HealthCare.gov. Much of her stint was dedicated to partnering with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to improve patient access to health care records, she said in her 2020 TEDx Talk.",
      "During the latter part of her time there, she worked on the data team for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, creating databases from hospitals and labs that governors and the public relied on to track the virus. Her LinkedIn profile says she rejoined the U.S. Digital Service in January of this year as a senior adviser, though The New York Times reported she was reintroduced at the agency in late December, ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
      "A long history in the private sector",
      "Gleason has also worked in the private sector at various health care management companies and startups. She held vice president positions at Allscripts, which provided software for electronic medical records, and worked from 2011 to 2018 at CareSync, a Florida-based medical technology startup that she co-founded, according to LinkedIn.",
      "Her LinkedIn profile adds that from 2021 to 2024, she was vice president of product at Main Street Health, which provides care for people in rural areas, and at Russell Street Ventures, a firm dedicated to launching innovative health care.",
      "Both Main Street Health and Russell Street Ventures were founded by entrepreneur Brad Smith, an early senior DOGE member who was previously named as head of the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation in 2020 during Trump\u2019s first administration.",
      "Smith did not respond to a request for comment; according to anonymous sources who spoke to The New York Times, Smith began advising on Musk\u2019s cost-cutting moves late last year and brought Gleason in on the talks. NBC News has not confirmed the report.",
      "Tom Cooke, a retired health care executive who worked closely with Gleason more than 15 years ago, said her position at DOGE was \u201ckind of a curveball.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll put my politics on my sleeve: I don\u2019t trust Elon Musk at all in this role. I trust her completely,\u201d he said. \u201cI am confident that she will use her voice strongly and that she\u2019s a straight shooter, whether it\u2019s news that people above her want to hear or not.\u201d",
      "Cooke described Gleason as having an effervescent personality and an unflappable work mentality.",
      "\u201cProfessionally, I put a lot on her plate to get done in a very short period of time, and was amazed by her ability to achieve that,\u201d he said.",
      "And on a personal level, \u201cI\u2019ve seen her be really thoughtful with folks that she may have had just a little bit of interaction with,\u201d he said. \u201cShe just has a way with people.\u201d",
      "Others were also surprised by her DOGE title. One former health care IT colleague said via a LinkedIn message that \u201cit did seem to come out of nowhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was shocked to hear of her appointment to DOGE, having been a fierce and committed patient advocate,\u201d wrote the former colleague, who has known Gleason for 15 years and spoke on condition of anonymity because she was concerned speaking out against the Trump administration could have career repercussions. \u201cTo go from such a position of kindness to a position that eliminates jobs for thousands of working parents seems like such a dichotomy in values.\u201d",
      "A graduate of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Gleason is an avid football fan who likes to needle friends who root for anyone other than the Tennessee Volunteers, said Alexander, the pediatrician. He added that she has a \u201ctremendous sense of humor\u201d and loves to travel.",
      "Gleason\u2019s interest in streamlined medical records and other improvements for patients dates back decades. In 2021, she told the \u201cTell Me Where IT Hurts\u201d podcast, which examines the intersection between health care and technology, that she started out as an emergency room nurse and \u201cquickly realized how powerful health care technology could be.\u201d",
      "Gleason has said the best career advice she has received was from her parents. She told another health care podcast in 2023 that her dad taught her mistakes are a learning opportunity, and her mom encouraged her to follow her dreams.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had a pretty great career trying a lot of new things and following my passions as I develop new ones as well,\u201d she told the podcast."

      "NEW YORK \u2014 Amid newly imposed tariffs on China, one spiritual wares store selling feng shui products fears the closure of longtime neighborhood establishments. A pack of noodles could increase by at least a dollar. The cost of takeout containers could hike up delivery prices. Overall, businesses in Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown neighborhood, which are particularly import-heavy, are looking at a potential 8% increase in prices.",
      "But tariff fears are not just about financial concerns. In Chinatowns across the country, people worry about the loss of cultural traditions and the already high rates of poverty in these largely immigrant communities. In New York City, for example, 28% of Chinatown residents live below the poverty line.",
      "Chinatowns contends with a unique crisis because many of the items sold there aren\u2019t often available on mainstream platforms like Amazon. And there\u2019s simply not enough demand for them for companies to build factories in the U.S.",
      "Trump added a 10% tariff on all imports from China this week on top of a previous 10% tariff he had imposed on Chinese goods last month. These are in addition to tariffs of up to 25% Trump imposed during his first term. He said the import taxes, which he also imposed on Canada and Mexico before temporarily pausing them, will be in place until China takes action to reduce the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "China has retaliated by imposing tariffs of its own on the U.S., adding up to 15% on some U.S. goods.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese people have never believed in coercion or intimidation, nor do we succumb to bullying and hegemonic tactics,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said during a Tuesday briefing.",

Lining the shelves are porcelain and ceramic wares, from ornate patterned serving trays to incense holders shaped like bok choy leaves. Fifth-generation store owner Mei Lum said much about the store\u2019s business strategy, particularly during its busy season around Lunar New Year and Christmas, is now uncertain."

      "Sky-high egg prices have drawn renewed attention to the bird flu outbreak, which has caused more than 166 million wild and domestic birds in the U.S. to die since it began in 2022.",
      "While the health risk to most people remains low, the outbreak has continued to surprise researchers and the federal government has been unable to wrangle it under control.",
      "\u201cIt seems like another battle keeps popping up day after day,\u201d said Andrew Bowman, an influenza expert at Ohio State University\u2019s College of Veterinary Medicine. \u201cI really hate saying \u2018unprecedented,\u2019 but it sure feels different than anything before.\u201d",
      "NBC News asked its readers on social media what they wanted to know about the outbreak, mitigation measures and eggs. Here are the answers to your (lightly edited) questions.",
      "Is it safe to buy and eat chicken? What about eggs? And milk?",
      "Yes, it\u2019s safe to buy and eat poultry products, which are tightly regulated and frequently tested. Moreover, the virus is eliminated through cooking.",
      "\u201cBetween testing and safe food handling, any poultry being consumed from a grocery store would be safe in my mind,\u201d Bowman said, adding that flu viruses are \u201cvery easy to inactivate via heat.\u201d",
      "The Food and Drug Administration continues to recommend cooking eggs until both the yolk and white harden.",
      "Eggs from backyard flocks that have direct contact with migrating waterfowl might be more concerning, but avian influenza generally hampers egg production and causes most birds to die.",
      "\u201cBirds that have avian influenza die and they\u2019re sick and they don\u2019t lay eggs,\u201d said Amber Itle, the state veterinarian of Washington state.",
      "In milk, meanwhile, pasteurization inactivates the virus, making commercially produced milk safe for consumption. However, raw milk is extremely risky because the virus replicates in cows\u2019 mammary glands.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s where the virus is in the dairy cows,\u201d said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco who studies infectious diseases.",
      "How does bird flu spread on farms?",
      "Avian influenza, or H5N1, is an extremely contagious and deadly respiratory virus for birds. Once infected, the animals rapidly replicate the virus and spread it through airborne particles, feces, droplets of saliva and nasal excretions.",
      "Some recent, early studies suggest that the virus can even travel from farm to farm in dropping particles carried by the wind.",
      "On dairy farms, infected cows shed the virus through their mammary glands, so they are most likely infected through milk and during milking.",
      "Studies suggest that farm cats have gotten the virus from drinking raw milk.",
      "Is the only way to stop bird flu to kill off all diseased birds?",
      "When a bird flu outbreak is identified, federal policy requires that the virus be stamped out, meaning all the birds must be culled, or \u201cdepopulated.\u201d",
      "There are few other options once the virus begins to infect a farm or backyard coop, given that any surviving birds could spread the virus further. Most would die either way.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say, we\u2019d expect over 80% mortality,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cIf you let it continue to smolder, will you have some birds that survive? Yes, you will. But at what cost? Because you have to view each one as replicating and making more virus.\u201d",
      "The U.S. is also investing in enhanced biosecurity measures to stop bird flu from reaching farms. Strict programs require workers to shower in and out at work sites, regularly disinfect barns, prevent wildlife from getting in and wash vehicles, among other measures.",
      "Bowman said those strategies help, but it\u2019s still tough.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of easy to have a lapse in biosecurity someplace. Think about telling your kids to pick up their room every day. Do we ever get a day where someone doesn\u2019t do it \u2014 well, that\u2019s the day the virus gets in,\u201d Bowman said.",
      "Unlike birds, cows can recover after a bird flu infection, so they do not have to be culled.",
      "How many egg-laying hens have been culled versus chickens raised for meat?",
      "Egg farms have taken the harder hit.",
      "In January, about 23 million birds were culled on American farms, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Of those, about 18.8 million were \u201clayers\u201d bred to produce eggs while just 2.2 million were \u201cbroilers\u201d raised for meat.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing drastic reductions in the broiler flock compared to the laying flock,\u201d said John Cranfield, a professor and agricultural economist at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada.",
      "Layers and broilers are different birds with different genetics. The lengths of their lives also differ, making egg production more exposed to the virus.",
      "\u201cIt takes about a month and a half, maybe seven weeks to get a broiler chicken to its market weight,\u201d said John Cranfield, a professor and agricultural economist at the University of Guelph in Ontario. \u201cWhereas an egg-laying hen is going to be about five months to get to the point of laying eggs and then it\u2019s probably going to be laying eggs for a year.\u201d",
      "Since January 2020, the price of a carton of eggs has risen from about $1.46 on average to $4.95, according to Federal Reserve data. Meanwhile, a pound of chicken breast has risen from $3.06 to $3.97.",
      "Eggs are also more difficult to replace in people\u2019s diets.",
      "\u201cEven with big changes in prices, there\u2019s very little change in demand,\u201d Cranfield said.",
      "What happens to the carcasses?",
      "How affected birds are killed depends on how a farm is set up, the species and the number of birds. To mass-cull birds, options include spraying foam throughout a barn to suffocate the birds quickly, and gassing them by rapidly increasing the C02 concentration or by shutting down ventilation (the most controversial method).",
      "Itle said Washington state views the CO2 method as most humane. Overall, she said, culling birds takes a toll.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the worst part of my job and it\u2019s been really, really hard on myself, on responders who are on these cases and for farm workers, because we\u2019re all in this business to protect animal health,\u201d Itle said.",
      "At smaller operations, birds\u2019 carcasses are often incinerated. When large commercial flocks are infected, carcasses are composted in a specialized process that involves heat, added nitrogen, water and microorganisms.",
      "Itle said compost piles can stretch for miles at a big farm. Workers will turn the piles and check their temperature and ensure it reaches 131 degrees Fahrenheit for three days in a row to inactivate the virus.",
      "\u201cComposting is lovely. It\u2019s such a good, sustainable way of dealing with this virus,\u201d Itle said. \u201cAt the end of the day, you get this great nutrient rich product where the viruses have all been inactivated.\u201d",
      "Are ducks, crows, pigeons and other birds dying, too?",
      "Avian influenza is circulating widely among wild birds. The USDA has confirmed infections in more than 12,000 wild birds across more than 170 species.",
      "Bird flu outbreaks on farms have been tied to seasonal migrations of wild birds, which can contaminate equipment and feed, and infect poultry through droppings or direct interactions.",
      "Can bird flu spread from animals to crops?",
      "Experts are not very concerned about crop contamination.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a good reason to wash vegetables \u2014 shigella, E.coli, listeria,\u201d Chin-Hong said. \u201cYour risk of getting those other foodborne disease are higher than getting bird flu.\u201d",
      "Can bird flu spread among people?",
      "Scientists don\u2019t think there have been cases of human-to-human transmission yet, but research suggests that it could be possible if the virus mutates.",
      "Of the 70 human cases confirmed in the U.S. so far, most have been in farmworkers.",
      "But the more times the virus jumps from animals to people, the greater the risk that it will undergo random genetic changes that would enable it to spread person to person.",
      "\u201cThe fewer transmission events you have, you lower the risk of random mutations to figure out the combination to get into our bodies,\u201d Chin-Hong said.",
      "Will bird flu become the next human pandemic?",
      "Scientists have worried for decades about this version of bird flu because human immune systems have not dealt with it before. The sheer amount of virus in wild birds and farm animals does increase the risk of it spreading to people.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t promise this particular bird flu will be the next big one, but there have been four influenza pandemics since the beginning of the 20th century and they all have had their origins in avian flu,\u201d Chin-Hong said.",
      "Are there bird flu vaccines for people?",
      "The federal government has two bird flu vaccines stockpiled, but they would need FDA authorization.",
      "Scientists are also developing new vaccines using mRNA technology, which was first used against Covid. But Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration was weighing whether to pull funding for an mRNA bird flu vaccine being developed by Moderna.",
      "Is there a vaccine strategy for chickens?",
      "Chickens can be vaccinated against bird flu, and countries like France are already doing so. But the USDA has not approved such a vaccine.",
      "So far, the U.S. has been resistant to a chicken vaccination strategy because exporters of poultry participate in a program that requires testing for avian influenza antibodies in flocks. The antibodies are evidence of an immune response to a viral infection, but vaccines would lead chickens to produce the same antibodies, which would confuse the results.",
      "\u201cWe do have vaccines that have been proven efficacious,\u201d Bowman said, but added that \u201cto put a vaccine on the market, we\u2019d also have to change the entire testing assurance strategy and we\u2019d have to negotiate that with all our trade partners.\u201d",
      "Any vaccination strategy would also have to account for the fact that vaccines wouldn\u2019t eliminate infections or illnesses entirely, and that wild birds that spread the virus wouldn\u2019t receive vaccines.",
      "Nonetheless, the Trump administration is putting $100 million toward research on vaccines and therapeutics for poultry.",
      "In a news conference last month, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins described vaccination as a potential solution, but said more testing is needed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just not ready. We don\u2019t have enough information,\u201d Rollins said. \u201cBefore we start sticking our chickens, we need to ensure \u2014 before putting that in the food supply \u2014 we know exactly what we\u2019re doing.\u201d",
      "Researchers are in the process of testing vaccines for cows, too.",
      "Has President Trump announced any plans to support farmers? Can they expect aid?",
      "The USDA already provides payments to poultry farmers who have suffered bird flu outbreaks, in part to incentivize early reporting.",
      "\u201cWhen birds are euthanized, we pay them for every live bird that\u2019s left that we have to depopulate,\u201d Itle said.",
      "Through November 2024, the government had paid about $1.25 billion in indemnity and compensation, according to the USDA. Indemnity payments vary, with different prices for \u201cbroiler\u201d versus \u201clayer\u201d chickens.",
      "Some additional funds are available for the costs of culling animals, disposing of their bodies and disinfecting farms afterward.",
      "The USDA announced an additional $1 billion plan to address bird flu last month, of which $400 million is meant to help speed the process for farmers to clean and repopulate their farms, which usually takes about six months.",
      "How long until egg prices fall?",
      "No one knows, since it depends on how quickly officials can get the outbreak under control. And even once that happens, \u201cit\u2019s probably a couple of months at a minimum before they start to see some relief,\u201d Cranfield said.",
      "In the meantime, the USDA\u2019s efforts to help egg producers get back on their feet more quickly after a flock is infected may help a bit.",
      "Bowman said that if he was forced to shake his Magic 8 Ball, he\u2019d say the outbreak may start to slow over the summer.",
      "\u201cA lot of this is tied to the spillover \u2014 the virus moving with migratory waterfowl,\u201d he said, explaining that migratory birds hatch in the spring, then travel and mix together during the fall. \u201cThey amplify virus, new virus strains emerge and spill over, we have that cycle for a while.\u201d",
      "Will tariffs affect egg prices?",
      "It\u2019s not clear yet, though it\u2019s possible.",
      "Any added costs for farmers \u2014 due to more expensive fertilizer, fuel or equipment \u2014 would factor into the price of eggs. The U.S. imports Canadian potash for fertilizer that\u2019s used to grow grains in chicken feed, Cranfield said. However, the Trump administration has announced some exceptions to the sweeping tariffs it issued, including potash, through April 2.",
      "The USDA last month predicted egg prices will be more than 40% higher in 2025 than in 2024.",
      "Why haven\u2019t milk prices gone up the same way eggs have?",
      "Cows can recover after a bird flu infection, and the outbreak in dairy cows has not been as overwhelming as in poultry.",
      "\u201cWe just haven\u2019t seen the same scale of outbreak as we have with birds,\u201d Cranfield said, adding that federal milk pricing policies also provide some stabilization.",
      "If I have birds of my own, how can I protect them?",
      "Pay attention to your animals\u2019 health, limit their exposure to wild birds, keep their enclosures clean and report sick animals.",
      "Are my pets at risk of bird flu?",
      "Cats may be.",
      "The California Department of Public Health documented cases in which cats were sickened after drinking raw milk, and other cats have been sickened after eating rawcat food. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also documented a case in which people passed the virus to cats.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t feed them raw milk; don\u2019t feed them raw meat,\u201d Chin-Hong said, adding that outdoor cats will be at greater risk. \u201cTry to not have the cat drink water from a bird feeder.\u201d",
      "Dogs don\u2019t seem to be particularly susceptible, Itle said.",
      "Is it risky if me or my child comes in contact with wild birds or bird poop?",
      "The risk of contracting the virus from the environment remains low, as long as you\u2019re not at a farm. The CDC has only reported a few cases in which there was no known source of exposure.",
      "\u201cBecause the virus isn\u2019t adapted yet to humans, it\u2019s like forcing an ill-fitting key into a lock,\u201d said Chin-Hong. \u201cThe people who have gotten it are in constant contact with high viral loads. That\u2019s why dairy workers are at risk. They\u2019re getting constantly bombarded.",
      "To be safe, though, don\u2019t handle dead birds and make children wash their hands \u2014\u00a0best practices regardless of bird flu."

      "Before entering politics, Weidel was a consultant for Goldman Sachs and Allianz Global Investors, a slice of her background that appeals to those in the AfD who seek to appear both more moderate than its most anti-immigrant flank and more practical, though she has championed the AfD\u2019s populist economic platform of big tax cuts and steep increases in public spending."

    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 10:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "But six states have passed right-to-repair laws, protecting consumers\u2019 abilities to repair or modify their products.",
    "story": [
      "Peter Mui, founder of Fixit Clinic, describes his repair work as a hobby that\u2019s gotten out of control. What started as a tool share in Berkeley, California, has turned into a volunteer-run group that has organized more than 1,300 repair events around the country. At Fixit Clinics, people can bring any broken household item \u2014 from worn socks to broken toasters \u2014 and learn how to make them functional again.",
      "\u201cDuring the last few years, interest in repair has exploded,\u201d Mui said.",
      "He attributes this cultural shift to a growing awareness about the environmental impact of e-waste, as well as a raft of \u201cright-to-repair\u201d laws passing across the U.S. Historically, manufacturers of computers, cars and tractors have\u00a0cited copyright law to claim exclusive repair rights, allowing them to sue independent repair companies while preventing consumers from finding lower-cost alternatives.",
      "But in six states \u2014 California, Colorado, Minnesota, Maine, New York and Oregon \u2014 right-to-repair laws have been passed to protect consumers\u2019 ability to repair or modify their products instead of having to go through the manufacturer. Oregon\u2019s law is the most recent, passing in 2024 and going into effect in January.",
      "As of March, right-to-repair bills had been introduced in all 50 states, and 20 state legislatures are currently debating such bills.",
      "The laws take different forms. Some narrowly target automobile manufacturers while others are broad enough to cover all consumer electronics. Though bipartisan federal legislation for automobile repair stalled last year, it was reintroduced last month. Legal experts say it\u2019s hard to predict the Trump administration\u2019s stance toward right-to-repair laws considering President Donald Trump\u2019s varied relationships with tech executives and the wide array of positions he\u2019s taken on tech issues. But advocates remain hopeful about support among state legislators and constituents for such bills, which have been backed by both Democrats and Republicans.",
      "\u201cEvery time there\u2019s been a popular referendum, it\u2019s passed by 70% or more in that state,\u201d Mui said. \u201cSo that creates a lot of mainstream awareness around the idea that stuff should be repairable.\u201d",
      "Legislative wins for right to repair",
      "The modern right-to-repair movement began with challenges to copyright law in 2012, when Massachusetts mandated automakers allow independent mechanics to access the diagnostic tools in cars, which were previously restricted to franchised dealerships. In 2014, Congress legalized phone \u201cunlocking,\u201d allowing phone owners to \u201cunlock\u201d their phones from exclusive use on a specific network and take them to a different carrier. The Library of Congress announced exemptions to copyright law for consumers to modify their tablets and smart TVs a year later.",
      "But it wasn\u2019t until 2022 that the right-to-repair battle reached wide public consciousness when consumers questioned why McFlurry machines were always broken at their local McDonald\u2019s. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) made it illegal to bypass certain proprietary systems like the one that Taylor Company, the McFlurry manufacturer, used to fix the equipment.",
      "After a repair startup filed a lawsuit challenging Taylor\u2019s restrictive repair policies, which only allowed its repair people to fix machines, the U.S. Copyright Office announced new exceptions to the copyright law to allow third-party McFlurry repairs. Kit Walsh, a director at the nonprofit rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation, welcomed the change.",
      "\u201cManufacturers will always try to figure out another means of restricting independent repair because it\u2019s a very lucrative market for them,\u201d Walsh said.",
      "The EFF was part of a coalition that challenged tractor manufacturer John Deere in 2015 over independent repairs and won temporary exemptions to the DMCA. But Walsh wants the federal government to go further.",
      "She said the biggest obstacle to consumer rights is Section 1201 of the DMCA. Enacted in 1998, the section prohibits consumers from accessing protected software in copyrighted products. So far, litigation challenging Section 1201 has been rejected by the courts. What Walsh is betting on are smaller copyright exemptions like those for electric wheelchairs or the state-level push to pass repair bills.",
      "Gay Gordon-Byrne, the executive director of the Right to Repair Coalition, said the group has faced massive lobbying by industrial conglomerates for much of its 15 years of campaigning. At one point, she said, companies like Apple and General Motors that were fighting against right-to-repair legislation represented over $10 trillion in market capitalization.",
      "Since then, some manufacturers including Motorola and Microsoft have started working with repair advocates. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a choice, because consumers are starting to ask questions,\u201d Gordon-Byrne said. \u201cEvery bill that gets passed adds more positive incentive for manufacturers to go back to what they used to do, which is support their customers.\u201d",
      "To empower consumers, the coalition runs a know-your-rights program where people can check what laws are enforced in their state. If the manufacturer of a product is not in compliance with the law, consumers can fill out a form that sends a direct complaint to the state attorney general\u2019s office.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s frustration with not being able to fix their stuff has grown,\u201d Gordon-Byrne said. \u201cEven when I sit down with legislators, they hold up their cellphone and ask if right-to-repair will make it cheaper to repair their screen. And they say, \u2018Sign me up.\u2019\u201d",
      "Building a repair skill-sharing economy",
      "Repair Cafe, another extensive repair network, has over 2,500 communities worldwide. Its oldest U.S. chapter, founded in 2012, is Repair Cafe Pasadena, where around 40 volunteers show up every month with sewing machines and toolboxes to fix any item that community members bring in. Its January event was supposed to take place at the usual location, the Altadena Public Library, but the Eaton Fire postponed their meetup.",
      "With many members having lost their homes to the fires, the network has taken on new meaning. \u201cThe idea behind Repair Cafe is to build local resiliency,\u201d\u00a0volunteer Ginko Lee said. \u201cSo we\u2019re trying to figure out how to help people during this catastrophe, like repairing their generators.\u201d",
      "The Pasadena arm of the global repair network, which draws attendees from all economic backgrounds, keeps its budget at zero through breakfast donations from a local bakery and a volunteer-run coffee station. Volunteers range from expert knitters to former electrical engineers. During the events, community members ask for the repair of treasured belongings or can shop from the \u201cfree market\u201d table. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of conversations going on because people open their hearts to one another during the repairs,\u201d Lee said.",
      "Lee emphasized that the group\u2019s ethos is mutual help, not charity. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique place where for three hours people help one another without charging money or asking for anything in return,\u201d Lee said.",
      "That\u2019s also the kind of environment that Mui fosters at Fixit Clinics. Because everyone has a unique skill set, his clinics turn into a skill-sharing and cross-training event. \u201cOur events are set up so that really the role of Fixit coach and participant blurs, and everyone\u2019s just helping everybody else out,\u201d Mui said."

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea fired several ballistic missiles into the sea on Monday, South Korea\u2019s military said, hours after South Korean and U.S. troops kicked off their large annual combined drills, which the North views as an invasion rehearsal.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile firings, North Korea\u2019s fifth missile launch event this year, were detected from the North\u2019s Hwanghae province but gave no further details such as how far they flew. It said South Korea bolstered its surveillance posture and is closely coordinating with the United States.",
      "Earlier Monday, the South Korean and U.S. militaries began their annual joint military exercises, which are scheduled to last 11 days. The Freedom Shield command post exercise began after the South Korean and U.S. militaries paused live-fire training while Seoul investigates how two of its fighter jets mistakenly bombed a civilian area during a warm-up drill last week.",
      "The drills\u2019 start drew the condemnation of nuclear-armed North Korea, which issued a government statement calling the exercises a \u201cdangerous provocative act\u201d that increases the risks of military conflict.",
      "About 30 people were injured, two of them seriously, when two South Korean KF-16 fighter jets mistakenly fired eight MK-82 bombs on a civilian area in Pocheon, a town near the North Korean border, on Thursday. The bombing occurred while South Korean and U.S. forces were engaging in a live-fire drill ahead of the larger Freedom Shield exercise.",
      "In a background briefing to domestic reporters on Monday, the South Korean air force repeated its initial assessment last week that one of the KF-16 pilots had entered the wrong coordinates for a bombing site.",
      "The unidentified pilot didn\u2019t recognize the error during a pre-takeoff check and, rushing to meet scheduled timing, failed to visually verify the target before proceeding with the bombing. The second pilot had the correct coordinates but focused only on maintaining formation with the other aircraft and dropped the bombs following the first pilot\u2019s instructions, failing to recognize they deviated from the right target, according to the content of the briefing provided to The Associated Press.",
      "Gen. Lee Youngsu, chief of staff of the South Korean air force, bowed and apologized Monday over the injuries and property damage caused by the incident, which he said \u201cshould have never happened and must never happen again.\u201d",
      "Both the South Korean and U.S. militaries have halted all live-fire exercises in South Korea following the mishap. South Korean military officials say live-fire training will resume after they complete the ongoing investigation on the bombing and formulate preventative steps.",
      "The Freedom Shield exercise marks the first large-scale joint exercise since President Donald Trump began his second term. It comes amid growing tensions with North Korea over its nuclear ambitions and its alignment with Russia in President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine.",
      "Trump, who met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un three times during his first term, has expressed his willingness to reach out to Kim again to revive diplomacy, which collapsed due to disagreements over exchanging U.S.-led sanctions against the North and the North\u2019s denuclearization steps. But Pyongyang has yet to respond to his overture and has continued its fiery rhetoric against Washington and Seoul over their joint military exercises, which Kim portrays as rehearsals for invasion.",
      "In a statement issued through state media Monday, the North Korean Foreign Ministry called the Freedom Shield exercise an \u201caggressive and confrontational war rehearsal\u201d that risks triggering \u201cphysical conflict\u201d on the Korean Peninsula.",
      "The ministry reiterated Kim\u2019s state goals for a \u201cradical growth\u201d of his nuclear force to counter what he claims are growing threats posed by the U.S. and its Asian allies."

      "The\u00a0Pittsburgh Steelers\u00a0finally have their established big-play wide receiver.",
      "The Seattle Seahawks are sending two-time Pro Bowler D.K. Metcalf to Pittsburgh for at least a second-round pick, sources with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press on Sunday night. The sources spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the deal was not official.",
      "Metcalf had\u00a0requested a trade\u00a0from the Seahawks last week. His exodus comes during a tumultuous stretch for Seattle,\u00a0which released Tyler Lockett\u00a0\u2014 the franchise\u2019s second all-time leading receiver \u2014 last Wednesday and then\u00a0dealt quarterback Geno Smith\u00a0to the Las Vegas Raiders late Friday.",
      "The 27-year-old Metcalf will also receive a new five-year deal worth $150 million, giving Pittsburgh the kind of high-profile big-play wide receiver the club hasn\u2019t had since Antonio Brown was traded to the Raiders in March 2019.",
      "Metcalf has had at least 900 yards receiving in each of his six seasons, though he did finish with a career-low five touchdown receptions in 2024. He has the size (6-foot-4) to leap over defenders and the speed to run by them.",
      "The next question for the Steelers to answer is who will throw Metcalf the ball. General manager Omar Khan said at the NFL combine that all options are on the table.",
      "Still Russell Wilson or Justin Fields \u2014 who combined to lead Pittsburgh to a 10-7 record last season \u2014 would appear to make the most sense in the short term.",

      "LeBron James leaves late with groin injury as Lakers lose 111-101 to Celtics",
      "The household item turning runners into world record holders",
      "Team president Art Rooney II and coach Mike Tomlin have both said either player could be an option in 2025, though given Fields\u2019 youth, mobility and possibly lower asking price, he may make a better fit. Still, the Steelers have had six-plus weeks to re-sign either player and still had not with less than 72 hours to go before the new league year begins.",
      "Adding one of the most physically imposing pass catchers in the league in Metcalf, however, could make Pittsburgh more attractive to some of the other quarterbacks about to enter the market.",
      "Metcalf could also become a mentor to talented but mercurial wide receiver George Pickens. The 23-year-old Pickens is about to enter the final year of his rookie deal and while he has shown flashes of brilliance, he has often mixed it with bouts of petulance. The Steelers have remained bullish on Pickens despite his missteps, though it\u2019s uncertain how Pickens might react to no longer receiving top billing.",
      "Either way it goes with Pickens, Metcalf\u2019s arrival marks a bold step for Khan, who pursued San Francisco\u2019s Brandon Aiyuk last summer only to have Aiyuk re-sign with the 49ers. The Steelers never did find another established target to put opposite Pickens, and the offense sputtered down the stretch. Pittsburgh dropped its last five games, including a\u00a0blowout loss to Baltimore\u00a0in the opening round of the playoffs."

    "story": [
      "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. \u2014 NFL MVP Josh Allen was rewarded Sunday with a contract extension worth $330 million, including an NFL record $250 million of it guaranteed, which makes him among the league\u2019s highest-paid players.",
      "The Buffalo Bills announced the agreement, while two people with knowledge of the deal revealed the contract\u2019s value to The Associated Press. The people spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because the Bills did not release that figure, which was first reported by ESPN.com.",
      "The new deal adds two years to Allen\u2019s contract and locks the 28-year-old in through the 2030 season.",
      "Cleveland quarterback DeShaun Watson\u2019s five-year contract signed in 2022 set the previous record in featuring $230 million in guarantees,\u00a0per Spotrac.com. The total value of Allen\u2019s new contract ranks second behind Kansas City\u2019s Patrick Mahomes, who signed a 10-year, $450 million in 2020.",
      "Meanwhile, Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott tops the NFL list in averaging $60 million per season after signing a four-year, $240 million contract extension last summer.",
      "Allen\u2019s new contract follows his seventh NFL season in which he became the Bills third player to earn\u00a0NFL MVP, and first since running back Thurman Thomas did so in 1991. The new deal eclipses Allen\u2019s previous contract, a six-year $258 million deal he signed with Buffalo in August 2021.",
      "Allen has established himself as one of the league\u2019s elite quarterbacks and rewritten nearly every franchise single-season passing and scoring record at his position. In doing so, he\u2019s overcome\u00a0the many questions and criticisms\u00a0he faced for being considered a raw and inaccurate player when Buffalo selected him with the No. 7 pick in the 2018 draft out of Wyoming.",
      "Just as important, Allen has solidified what had been an unsettled position in Buffalo since Hall of Famer Jim Kelly retired following the 1996 season. The Bills under Allen have won five consecutive AFC East titles and are on a six-year playoff run.",
      "Allen\u2019s MVP honor came during a season in which he essentially did more with what was considered less receiving talent around him.\u00a0Adopting an \u201cEverybody Eats\u201d motto, Buffalo ran away with the AFC East by clinching the division with five games still left in a 13-win season and after the team traded top receiving option Stefon Diggs to Houston and lost No. 2 receiver Gabe Davis in free agency.",
      "Though Allen failed to top 4,000 yards for the first time since 2019, the quarterback enjoyed his most efficient season with a career-low six interceptions, a year after throwing a career-worst 18. Allen finished with 28 touchdowns passing, scored another 12 rushing and was credited with a touchdown receiving after completing a pass to Amari Cooper, who then lateralled the ball back to the quarterback.",
      "The only thing missing for Allen is a Super Bowl appearance. The Bills have reached the AFC championship game in 2020 and\u00a0this past season\u00a0only to lose both times to Kansas City.",
      "The new deal also follows a significant development in Allen\u2019s personal life. The quarterback proposed to actress and singer Hailee Steinfeld during the team\u2019s bye week in mid-November. Their relationship began in the spring of 2023, when pictures emerged of the two having dinner in New York City.",
      "Allen credited Steinfeld for playing a major supporting role in his career development.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s been a huge part. The morale, the support. When I get home, she\u2019s my biggest fan, my biggest supporter. She\u2019s just the best,\u201d Allen told the AP in December.",
      "The new contract is also expected to provide Buffalo much-needed savings under the salary cap entering the league\u2019s new business year, which opens Wednesday. The team was projected to be close to the cap limit after\u00a0releasing veteran edge rusher Von Miller\u00a0earlier in the day.",
      "And the deal follows GM Brandon Beane spending the past weeks locking in the young core of the team by signing fourth-year edge rusher Greg Rousseau and third-year players linebacker Terrel Bernard and receiver Khalil Shakir to four-year contract extensions.",
      "A two-time All-Pro, Allen\u2019s 76 wins, 262 total touchdowns and 30,595 total yards are the most by any NFL player through their first seven seasons in the league.",
      "From a team perspective, Allen holds the top two single-season passing yards records topped by his 4,544 in 2020 and last season he passed Kelly for most total touchdowns with 262. Among the single-season team records he holds are most TD passes (37 in 2020), most completions (646 in 2021), best completion rate (69.2 percent in 2020)."

    "story": [
      "Federal immigration authorities arrested a Palestinian graduate student who played a prominent role in\u00a0protests against Israel at Columbia University, according to his attorney.",
      "Mahmoud Khalil was inside a university-owned residence Saturday night near Columbia\u2019s Manhattan campus when several Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents entered his apartment and took him into custody, his attorney, Amy Greer, told The Associated Press.",
      "Greer said she spoke by phone with one of the ICE agents during the arrest, who said they were acting on State Department orders to revoke Khalil\u2019s student visa. Informed by the attorney that Khalil was in the United States as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that too, according to the lawyer.",
      "The arrest appears to be among the first known actions under President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to deport international students who joined the protests against the war in Gaza that swept college campuses last spring. His administration has claimed participants forfeited their rights to remain in the country by supporting Hamas, a terror organization.",
      "When ICE agents arrived at the campus building Saturday, they also threatened to arrest Khalil\u2019s wife, an American citizen who is eight months pregnant, Greer said. The authorities declined to say why Khalil was being arrested, according to the attorney.",
      "They were initially told he was transferred to an immigration detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey. But when Khalil\u2019s wife tried to visit Sunday, she learned he was not there \u2014 and may have been transferred as far away as Louisiana, Greer said.",
      "\u201cWe have not been able to get any more details about why he is being detained,\u201d Greer told the AP. \u201cThis is a clear escalation. The administration is following through on its threats.\u201d",
      "In a statement to NBC News on Sunday, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Khalil was arrested in coordination with ICE and the State Department \u201cin support of President Trump\u2019s executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism.\u201d",
      "\u201cKhalil led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization,\u201d McLaughlin said.",
      "A Columbia spokesperson said law enforcement agents must produce a warrant before entering university property, but declined to say if the school had received one ahead of Khalil\u2019s arrest. The spokesperson also declined to comment on Khalil\u2019s detention.",
      "Messages seeking comment were left Sunday with the State Department and ICE.",
      "In a\u00a0message\u00a0shared on X Sunday evening, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the administration \u201cwill be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\u201d",
      "DHS can initiate deportation proceedings against green card holders for a broad range alleged criminal activity, including supporting a terror group. It would ultimately be up to an immigration judge to revoke someone\u2019s permanent resident status, according to Camille Mackler, founder of Immigrant ARC, a coalition of legal service providers in New York.",
      "\u201cThis has the appearance of a retaliatory action against someone who expressed an opinion the Trump administration didn\u2019t like,\u201d Mackler said.",
      "Khalil served as a negotiator for students as they bargained with university officials over an end to the tent encampment erected on campus last spring, a role that made him one of the most visible activists in support of the movement.",
      "He was also among those\u00a0under investigation by a new Columbia University office\u00a0that has brought disciplinary charges against dozens of students for their pro-Palestinian activism, according to records shared with the AP.",
      "The investigations come as the Trump administration has\u00a0followed through on its threat\u00a0to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to Columbia because of what the government describes as the Ivy League school\u2019s failure to squelch antisemitism on campus.",
      "The university\u2019s allegations against Khalil focused on his involvement in the Columbia University Apartheid Divest group. He faced sanctions for potentially helping to organize an \u201cunauthorized marching event\u201d in which participants glorified Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack and playing a \u201csubstantial role\u201d in the circulation of social media posts criticizing Zionism, among other acts of alleged discrimination.",
      "\u201cI have around 13 allegations against me, most of them are social media posts that I had nothing to do with,\u201d Khalil told the AP last week.",
      "\u201cThey just want to show Congress and right-wing politicians that they\u2019re doing something, regardless of the stakes for students,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly an office to chill pro-Palestine speech.\u201d"

      "Carney, 59, replaces\u00a0Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January but remains prime minister until his successor is sworn in in the coming days. Carney won in a landslide, winning 85.9% of the vote.",
      "Carney navigated crises when he was the head of the Bank of Canada and when in 2013 he became the first noncitizen to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. His appointment won bipartisan praise in the U.K. after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries.",
      "The opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged.",
      "Trump\u2019s trade war and his talk of making Canada the\u00a051st U.S. state have\u00a0infuriated Canadians, who are booing the American anthem at NHL and NBA games. Some are canceling trips south of the border, and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can.",
      "The surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered the Liberal Party\u2019s chances in a parliamentary election expected within days or weeks, and Liberal showings have been improving steadily in opinion polls.\u201cWe have made this the greatest country in the world and now our neighbors want to take us. No way,\u201d Carney said.",
      "After decades of bilateral stability, the vote on Canada\u2019s next leader now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with the United States.",
      "Carney has picked up one endorsement after another from Cabinet ministers and members of Parliament since declaring his candidacy in January. He is a highly educated economist with Wall Street experience who has long been interested in entering politics and becoming prime minister, but he lacks political experience.",
      "The other top Liberal leadership candidate was former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland. Trudeau told Freeland in December that he no longer wanted her as finance minister, but that she could remain deputy prime minister and the point person for U.S.-Canada relations. Freeland resigned shortly after, releasing a scathing letter about the government that proved to be the last straw for Trudeau.",
      "Carney is expected to trigger an election shortly afterward. Either the new Liberal party leader will call one, or the opposition parties in Parliament could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month."

      "\u201cUntil we have a ceasefire, I would give Ukraine what they need in terms of intelligence and weapons to defend themselves,\u201d Graham added. \u201cIn terms of Russia, I\u2019ll be introducing sanctions on their banking sector and their energy sector next week, urging them to get to the table. If they don\u2019t engage in ceasefire and peace talks with the administration, we should sanction the hell out of them.\u201d",

      "The U.S. help for Ukraine came to an abrupt pause last week after tensions between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy boiled over during an Oval Office meeting on Feb. 28 that devolved into a shouting match. In the fallout from that meeting, Russia has launched an increasing barrage of attacks on Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy had been visiting the White House to sign a deal that would have granted the U.S. ownership over certain minerals in Ukraine. But Zelenskyy left the White House without a deal after the Ukrainian president insisted on security guarantees and Trump and Vance accused him of not being grateful enough for the United States\u2019 continued support.",

      "Trump on Sunday asserted that Ukraine is now prepared to sign the mineral agreement. He said, however, that Kyiv has still not adequately displayed a desire for peace, though he believes that will change in the coming days.",
      "\"I want them to want peace right now. Well, right now they haven't shown it to the extent that they should,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One. \"But I think they will be, and I think it's going to become evident over the next two or three days.\"",
      "U.S. and Ukrainian officials are preparing to meet in Saudi Arabia this week to work toward a potential minerals deal and a ceasefire agreement with Russia. But Trump has signaled to his domestic allies that he wants more than just the minerals deal from Ukraine in exchange for restarting aid and intelligence sharing.",
      "Asked about the minerals deal in Ukraine during a separate interview on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures,\u201d Trump told Maria Bartiromo, \u201cI think so. I think it\u2019ll happen.\u201d",

      "\u201cUkraine has been seeking peace from the very first second of this war. Realistic proposals are on the table. The key is to move quickly and effectively,\u201d Zelenskyy wrote.",
      "In the weeks leading up to the Oval Office meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump and the Ukrainian president traded barbs from a distance, with the U.S. president at one point calling Zelenskyy a \u201cdictator\u201d and implying that Ukraine was responsible for starting the war, not Russia."

      "Konanki was traveling with a group of five other female University of Pittsburgh students, Julia said. The five others were scheduled to return to the United States on Friday but opted to stay behind to aid in the search, Julia said.",
      "The morning of her disappearance, Konanki went to the beach with friends. They returned, but she did not, Chapman said. He said it appears Dominican authorities have obtained video of when the group was last seen on the beach.",
      "Chapman said his office is working with Dominican authorities and state and federal agencies, including the State Department.",
      "In a statement, the FBI said Dominican authorities are leading the investigation but that the bureau \"stands ready to assist our international partners with any requests for assistance.\"",
      "As Konanki is also a citizen of India, Chapman said, the Indian Embassy in the Dominican Republic is also helping in the investigation.",
      "Authorities are examining every possibility that could explain Konanki's disappearance, Julia said.",
      "\u201cRight now it runs the gamut from something accidental to foul play,\" Julia said. \"It is all at this point under consideration. Nothing\u2019s been ruled out.\u201d",
      "Obtaining video, looking through cellphone evidence and talking to people who were with Konanki remains a high priority, Julia said.",

      "The Dominican Republic is classified as level 2 in the State Department's four-tier travel advisory rubric, meaning travelers are advised to exercise \"increased caution\" traveling there. It warns that violent crime is a concern throughout the country.",
      "Chapman, the Loudoun County sheriff, said authorities are still holding out hope for a positive outcome.",
      "\"Obviously, we're hoping for the best outcome here, but we really don't know where it's going to go just yet,\" he said."

    "story": [
      "SELMA, Ala. \u2014 Charles Mauldin was near the front of a line of voting rights marchers walking in pairs across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama on March 7, 1965.",
      "The marchers were protesting white officials\u2019 refusal to allow Black Alabamians to register to vote, as well as the killing days earlier of Jimmie Lee Jackson, a minister and voting rights organizer who was shot by a state trooper in nearby Marion.",
      "At the apex of the span over the Alabama River, they saw what awaited them: a line of state troopers, deputies and men on horseback. After they approached, law enforcement gave a warning to disperse and then unleashed violence.",
      "\u201cWithin about a minute or a half, they took their billy clubs, holding it on both ends, began to push us back to back us in, and then they began to beat men, women and children, and tear gas men, women and children, and cattle prod men, women and children viciously,\u201d said Mauldin, who was 17 at the time.",
      "Selma on Sunday marked the 60th anniversary of the clash that became known as Bloody Sunday. The attack shocked the nation and galvanized support for the U.S. Voting Rights Act of 1965. The annual commemoration paid homage to those who fought to secure voting rights for Black Americans and brought calls to recommit to the fight for equality.",
      "For foot soldiers of the movement, the celebration comes amid concerns about new voting restrictions and the Trump administration\u2019s effort to remake federal agencies they said helped make America a democracy for all.",
      "\u201cThis country was not a democracy for Black folks until that happened,\u201d Mauldin said of voting rights. \u201cAnd we\u2019re still constantly fighting to make that a more concrete reality for ourselves.\u201d",
      "Speaking at the pulpit of the city\u2019s historic Tabernacle Baptist Church, the site of the first mass meeting of the voting rights movement, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said what happened in Selma changed the nation. But he said the 60th anniversary comes at a time when there is \u201ctrouble all around\u201d and some \u201cwant to whitewash our history.\u201d But he said like the marchers of Bloody Sunday, they must keep going.",
      "\u201cAt this moment, faced with trouble on every side, we\u2019ve got to press on,\u201d Jeffries said to the crowd that included the Rev. Jesse Jackson, multiple members of Congress and others gathered for the commemoration.",
      "U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Ala., said they are gathering in Selma for the 60th anniversary \u201cat a time when the vote is in peril.\u201d",
      "Sewell noted the number of voting restrictions introduced since the U.S. Supreme Court effectively abolished a key part of the Voting Rights Act that required jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination to pre-clear new voting laws with the Justice Department",
      "Sewell this week reintroduced legislation to restore the requirement. The proposal has repeatedly stalled in Congress. The legislation is named for John Lewis, the late Georgia congressman who was at the lead of the Bloody Sunday march.",
      "The annual celebration will conclude with a ceremony and march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. At the time, the Bloody Sunday marchers walked in pairs across the Selma bridge. Mauldin was in the third pair of the line led by Lewis and Hosea Williams.",
      "\u201cWe had steeled our nerves to a point where we were so determined that we were willing to confront. It was past being courageous. We were determined, and we were indignant,\u201d Mauldin recalled in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Mauldin, who took a blow to the head, said he believes law enforcement officers were trying to incite a riot as they attacked marchers.",
      "Kirk Carrington was just 13 on Bloody Sunday. As the violence erupted, a white man on a horse wielding a stick a chased him all the way back to the public housing projects where his family lived.",
      "Carrington said he started marching after witnessing his father get belittled by his white employers when his father returned from service in World War II. Standing in Tabernacle Baptist Church where he was trained in non-violent protest tactics 60 years earlier, he was brought to tears thinking about what the people of his city achieved.",
      "\u201cWhen we started marching, we did not know the impact we would have in America. We knew after we got older and got grown that the impact it not only had in Selma, but the impact it had in the entire world,\u201d Carrington said.",
      "Dr. Verdell Lett Dawson, who grew up in Selma, remembers a time when she was expected to lower her gaze if she passed a white person on the street to avoid making eye contact.",
      "Dawson and Mauldin said they are concerned about the potential dismantling of the Department of Education and other changes to federal agencies. Trump has pushed to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the federal government.",
      "Support from the federal government \u201cis how Black Americans have been able to get justice, to get some semblance of equality, because left to states\u2019 rights, it is going to be the white majority that\u2019s going to rule,\u201d Dawson said.",
      "\u201cThat that\u2019s a tragedy of 60 years later: what we are looking at now is a return to the 1950s,\u201d Dawson said."

    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 Israel cut off the electricity supply to\u00a0Gaza, officials said Sunday, affecting a desalination plant producing drinking water for part of the arid territory. Hamas called it part of Israel\u2019s \u201cstarvation policy.\u201d",
      "Israel last week suspended supplies of goods\u00a0to the territory of more than 2 million Palestinians, an echo of the siege it imposed in the earliest days of the war.",
      "Israel is pressing the militant group to accept an\u00a0extension of the first phase\u00a0of their ceasefire. That phase ended last weekend. Israel wants Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce.",
      "Hamas instead wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire\u2019s more difficult second phase, which would see the release of remaining hostages from Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a lasting peace. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others.",
      "The militant group \u2014 which has warned that discontinuing supplies would affect the hostages \u2014 said Sunday that it wrapped up the latest round of ceasefire talks with Egyptian mediators without changes to its position.",
      "Israel has said it would send a delegation to Qatar on Monday in an effort to \u201cadvance\u201d the negotiations.",
      "Israel had warned when it stopped all supplies that water and electricity could be next. The letter from Israel\u2019s energy minister to the Israel Electric Corporation tells it to stop selling power to Gaza.",
      "The territory and its infrastructure have been largely devastated, and most facilities, including hospitals, now use generators. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassam said that Israel has \"practically\" cut off electricity since the war began and called the latest decision part of Israel\u2019s \"starvation policy, in clear disregard for all international laws and norms.\"",
      "The desalination plant was providing 18,000 cubic meters of water per day for central Gaza\u2019s Deir al-Balah area, according to Gisha, an Israeli organization dedicated to protecting Palestinians\u2019 right to freedom of movement. Executive director Tania Hary said that it\u2019s expected to run on generators and produce around 2,500 cubic meters per day, about the amount in an Olympic swimming pool.",
      "Israel\u2019s restrictions on fuel entering Gaza have a larger impact, Hary said, and water shortages are a looming issue, because fuel is needed for distribution trucks.",
      "Israel has faced sharp criticism over suspending supplies.",
      "\u201cAny denial of the entry of the necessities of life for civilians may amount to collective punishment,\u201d the U.N. human rights office said Friday.",
      "The International Criminal Court said there was reason to believe Israel had used \u201cstarvation as a method of warfare\u201d when it\u00a0issued an arrest warrant\u00a0for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year. The allegation is central to South Africa\u2019s case at the International Court of Justice\u00a0accusing Israel of genocide.",
      "Israel has denied the accusations, saying it has allowed in enough aid and blaming shortages on what it called the United Nations\u2019 inability to distribute it. It also accused Hamas of siphoning off aid.",
      "The leader of the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, warned Friday that\u00a0attacks against Israel-linked vessels\u00a0off Yemen would resume within four days if aid doesn\u2019t resume to Gaza. The Houthis described their earlier attacks as solidarity with Palestinians there.",
      "The ceasefire has paused the deadliest and most destructive fighting ever between Israel and Hamas, sparked by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The first phase allowed the return of 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Israeli forces have withdrawn to buffer zones inside Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza and hundreds of trucks of aid entered per day until Israel suspended supplies.",
      "U.S. envoy describes talks with Hamas",
      "The White House on Wednesday\u00a0made the surprise confirmation\u00a0of direct U.S. talks with Hamas.",
      "On Sunday, envoy Adam Boehler told Israeli broadcaster Kan that Hamas has suggested a truce of five to 10 years while it would disarm. The militant group has previously called disarming unacceptable.",
      "A senior Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss contacts with the U.S., said that the group had expressed its longstanding position that it would lay down its arms in return for a \u201cfair and just solution\u201d that includes an independent Palestinian state.",
      "Boehler also told CNN that \u201cI think you could see something like a long-term truce, where we forgive prisoners, where Hamas lays down their arms, where they agree they\u2019re not part of the political party going forward. I think that\u2019s a reality. It\u2019s real close.\u201d",
      "When asked if he would speak with the militant group again, Boehler replied, \u201cYou never know.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cI think something could come together within weeks,\u201d and expressed hope for a deal that would see all hostages released, not only American ones. Boehler has said four of the five American hostages in Gaza are dead, with Edan Alexander alive.",
      "Hamas on Sunday didn\u2019t mention the talks, but reiterated its support for a proposal for the establishment of an independent committee of technocrats to run Gaza until Palestinians hold presidential and legislative elections.",
      "Hamas\u2019 attack in October 2023 killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, inside Israel and took 251 people hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements.",
      "Many Israelis are pressing for a deal to bring everyone home. \u201cWe are here to send a clear message to the Israeli government: stop stalling,\u201d Zahiro Shahar Mor, nephew of slain hostage Avraham Munder, said in front of tents set up outside Israel\u2019s defense ministry in one demonstration.",
      "Israel\u2019s military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t say how many of the dead were militants.",
      "With the cutoff of supplies to Gaza, Palestinians are reporting sharp price increases for dwindling items during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.",

      "In a separate interview on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" host Maria Bartiromo asked Trump whether he expects a recession this year.",
      "\"I hate to predict things like that,\" he said.",
      "\"There is a period of transition, because what we\u2019re doing is very big. We\u2019re bringing wealth back to America. That\u2019s a big thing. And there are always periods of it takes a little time, it takes a little time,\" he added.",
      "Lutnick also promised Americans that grocery prices would start coming down in early April but warned that there would be price increases on foreign goods as a result of the Trump administration\u2019s anticipated reciprocal tariffs.",
      "\u201cYes, some products that are made foreign might be more expensive, but American products will get cheaper, and that\u2019s the point,\u201d Lutnick told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker, speaking about the effects of the reciprocal tariffs on foreign goods that Trump has said he will impose on April 2.",
      "\u201cThe president is going to negotiate country by country. He\u2019s going to drive down other countries\u2019 barriers, unleashing our farmers, our ranchers and our fishermen. They\u2019re going to explode in value and the prices of American produce, grow crops, produce and fish are going to come down,\u201d Lutnick predicted.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump is behind them, protecting them,\u201d Lutnick added, referring to American farmers. \u201cHe\u2019s got their back, and he\u2019s going to make them winners. And then all of America is going to be winners, because these prices are coming down. And the process starts April 2.\u201d",
      "In the Fox interview, Trump described his reasoning for the tariffs as protecting Americans from getting \"ripped off.\"",
      "\"Look, our country has been ripped off for many decades, for many, many decades, and we\u2019re not going to be ripped off anymore on the tariffs,\" he told Bartiromo.",
      "Consumers and major retailers felt whiplash last week as Trump issued exemptions to tariffs on Canada and Mexico just two days after he introduced them.",
      "But the exceptions to the tariffs issued last week expire on April 2 \u2014 the date Trump expects to impose reciprocal tariffs on other nations.",
      "On Fox, Trump told Bartiromo that those tariffs will take effect on April 2 and that he doesn't plan to grant Canada and Mexico further extensions.",
      "\"It\u2019s a transition into April, and after that, I\u2019m not doing this. I mean, I told them, I said, 'Look, I\u2019m going to do it this one time. But after that, I\u2019m not doing it,'\" he said.",
      "He also said the rate of tariffs on foreign nations could rise over time, telling Bartiromo, \"We may go up with some tariffs. It depends. We may go up. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll go down, but we may go up.\"",
      "Welker also asked Lutnick about tariffs on dairy, lumber, steel and aluminum that Trump said he would impose on Canada.",
      "Lutnick said tariffs on steel and aluminum would still take effect on Wednesday, March 12, and that tariffs on lumber and dairy products would be delayed until April 2 as well, citing Canadian tariffs on U.S. goods and the need for tariffs to curb the fentanyl crisis.",
      "\u201cSo on April 2, we are going to revisit again the fentanyl issues. And we are going to revisit again the trade, the general trade issues of reciprocality,\u201d Lutnick said.",
      "Earlier, Lutnick told Welker that the tariffs on Canada and Mexico would end \u201cif fentanyl ends,\u201d blaming both nations for allowing fentanyl to flow over the United States\u2019 northern and southern borders.",
      "\u201cIf fentanyl ends, I think these will come off. But if fentanyl does not end, or [Trump is] uncertain about it, they will stay this way until he is comfortable,\u201d Lutnick said.",
      "Trump\u2019s tariff plans could adversely affect grocery prices in particular. In 2021, the percentage of fresh fruit in the United States supplied by imports was 60% and 38% for fresh vegetables excluding certain crops, according to the Agriculture Department.",
      "Lutnick also spoke about tensions that may have emerged last week between members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet and Trump adviser Elon Musk.",
      "On Thursday, Trump convened his Cabinet to tell members that staffing decisions at their respective departments and agencies are up to them, not Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency, which had previously laid off thousands of federal workers across the U.S. government.",
      "Lutnick on Sunday said Trump has made clear that he\u2019s in charge and that Musk is a \u201cpartner\u201d to each Cabinet secretary.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump made clear that Elon is your partner, and that is what we like,\u201d the commerce secretary said. \u201cYou have the greatest businessman and greatest technologist in the world as my partner.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no one watching this TV right now who, if Elon Musk said he was going to come over to their house and help them, wouldn\u2019t, like, cheer,\u201d Lutnick added. \u201cYou have the best technologist and the richest guy in the world saying, \u2018I\u2019ll help you.\u2019 Come on. We want his help.\u201d"

      "Sara appeared to hold firm. \u201cBen is such... like, we are so aligned in so many ways,\" she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose Ben because I felt we were the same person. I chose Ben because he made me feel so special, and I felt energized and loved and important.\u201d",
      "But by the finale, her tune had changed. Sara decided not to marry Ben \u2014 who seemed shocked and, in his words, \"devastated\" by her decision. Sara cited their differing values and political beliefs as one of her reasons.",

Dave, a 33-year-old medical device salesman, couldn\u2019t determine if he had stronger feelings for Lauren or Molly Mulaney. When Lauren, a 31-year-old education saleswoman, realized Dave was undecided, she revealed to him that she didn\u2019t have any other connections.",
      "Meanwhile, Molly anxiously waited for Dave to call it quits with Lauren and solely pursue her. But in Episode 5, Dave cried as he told Molly that he wanted to \u201csee things through\u201d with Lauren instead. Molly was hurt but said she knew if he didn\u2019t want her then it wasn\u2019t meant to be.",
      "Dave then met with Lauren. She said although they had some tough conversations she appreciated that they were open with each other and were able to move past everything.",
      "He agreed and said, \u201cYou easily could have bailed. I just can\u2019t thank you enough for your patience because it helped me come to terms with a lot of other things. And not being afraid to go after the girl that I really want to be with. I\u2019m so in love with you.\u201d",
      "He proposed and she quickly accepted. \u201cI love you so much, too. I\u2019m excited to just start a future with you,\u201d she said.",
      "In the pods, Dave repeatedly mentioned that his sister\u2019s opinions of his partners played a big role in his past relationships. Although fans still haven\u2019t met her, the weight of her apparent disapproval and the mistrust of Dave\u2019s friends negatively impacted his romance with Lauren in the second group of episodes.",
      "As soon as Dave and Lauren returned to Minneapolis, he complained that friends and family members learned about his engagement before he told them. Then, Dave revealed that an acquaintance claimed he had been dating Lauren up until she left to go on \u201cLove Is Blind.\u201d Lauren denied his timeline of events and said that she had ended their casual fling. She said that the acquaintance wanted to create drama.",
      "Despite Lauren\u2019s friends also supporting her, Dave could not fully trust Lauren, creating a strain in their relationship as they approached wedding day.",
      "The couple broke up in Episode 11 of the series in a long conversation that covered her past fling \u2014 which they still didn't share an understanding of \u2014 and Dave's talk with her father.",
      "Speaking to the camera after the breakup, Dave said he felt like he \u201clet her down\u201d because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t get over my own ego.\u201d",
      "\u201cLove is blind but I don\u2019t think marriage is,\u201d he said.",
      "Lauren, meanwhile, was \"really sad\" it didn't work out \u2014 and \"pissed,\" too. The former couple met after a group hangout but did not reconcile.",
      "Alex and Madison",
      "Alex Brown and Madison Errichiello opened up in the pods about their difficult childhoods. Alex, a 29-year-old commercial real estate broker, and Madison, a 28-year-old artist, were both bullied in school and felt like outcasts.",
      "The two seemed headed for an engagement until Madison revealed she had an avoidant attachment style. Alex suddenly became less talkative and their conversation ended abruptly.",
      "When they met again, Alex voiced his concerns that Madison would run if they faced an obstacle. She told him that her still being in the experiment was proof that she was ready to go through challenging times with him. Meanwhile, Madison was also building a connection with Mason Horacen.",
      "Mason told Madison he was \u201ccommitted\u201d to her. But when Madison decided to pursue her relationship with Alex instead, Mason regretted what he said. In Episode 6, Madison explained the situation to Alex.",
      "Alex said he sympathized with Mason and wished him well. Madison didn\u2019t appreciate that Alex wasn\u2019t more comforting toward her.\u00a0 After their tense conversation, Alex said he could see a future with her but he was worried they would struggle with communication and disagreements. \u201cI think at this point, it\u2019s a pretty big jump. We\u2019re not at a point to get engaged,\u201d he said.",
      "Madison tearfully departed the pods and left the experiment.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Alex said he had no regrets over ending the relationship.",
      "\"I was confident in the decision. If we could go back and do things again, I think it would have unfolded the same way. I\u2019m glad that we got all of the issues out on the table the way we did so we could make that decision early on instead of moving forward and proposing and then going on the trip and then living together. I think it would have been a lot messier if that were to happen,\" he said.",
      "His decision came down to attachment style and conflict resolution, as it appeared in the pods. \"I think she has different ways of dealing with conflict than I do, and again, that\u2019s totally fine. There\u2019s nothing right or wrong with either way, but I think we just realized that we are both on very different pages and that communication wasn\u2019t going to be easy,\" he said.",
      "Read the rest of our interview with Alex here.",
      "Mason and Meg",
      "Mason, a 33-year-old cinematographer, gravitated toward Meg Fink, a 31-year-old oncology nurse, in the pods. She shared her conspiracy theories with him and expressed her strong feelings. But she knew that Mason also had a connection with Madison.",
      "After Madison ended things with Mason, she told Meg what happened. Meg confronted Mason in the pods at the end of Episode 5. She questioned if she was only there by \u201cdefault\u201d because Madison rejected him.",
      "He said he validated the \u201cwrong person\u201d because he was \u201cconfused\u201d at the time.",
      "When he said she was always his first choice, Meg replied, \u201cI wasn\u2019t yesterday, just to be fair.\u201d She said he never affirmed his feelings for her until it was too late.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll never know if what you\u2019re saying is true because we don\u2019t get the opportunity for you to pick,\u201d she told him in Episode 6. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to get past that.\u201d",
      "He said he understood her perspective and they said goodbye.",
      "They tried to date after the pods. At the reunion, Mason said he and Meg are \"best friends.\"",

      "\u201cLove Is Blind\u201d Season 8 stars Ben Mezzenga and Sara Carton have had an unusual journey during their time on the Netflix dating show.",
      "Back in the pods, the couple bonded before realizing a glaring difference between them. Sara, a 29-year-old oncology nurse, explained to Ben that she grew up in a conservative household but was no longer religious and she shared that her sister, Lisa, was gay. Sara also expressed her opinions on the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, noting that she felt more engaged in social issues during that time given that George Floyd was murdered in Minneapolis, Minnesota.",
      "Ben, a 28-year-old developer, said that he went to church often and that faith played a big role in his life. But he said he had \u201cno discomfort around that community at all,\u201d when referring to the LGBTQ+ community and that he was \u201cignorant\u201d toward politics and the BLM movement.",
      "Despite not being on the same page, both thought that their values aligned and they decided to get engaged. When they left the pods, they continued to have lengthy conversations where they discussed conflicting views about religion. In Episode 10, Sara also learned that Ben\u2019s ex released a TikTok video in which she labeled some of the Season 8 cast as \u201cs----- men,\u201d appearing to refer to him.",
      "Again, they moved past their problems and proceeded with the experiment, seemingly developing stronger feelings along the way. Episode 12 ended on a cliffhanger as fans waited to see if the couple would say \u201cI do.\u201d",

      "Did Sara and Ben get married?",
      "Episode 13, the season finale, began with the conclusion of Sara and Ben\u2019s wedding. Although both gushed about their connection in the scenes leading up to their decision at the altar, Sara announced she did not want to get married.",
      "\u201cBen, I love you so much,\u201d she told him. \u201cBut I\u2019ve always wanted a partner to be on the same wavelength. So today, I can\u2019t.\u201d",
      "She continued, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t want that to be misunderstood. I still love you and everything about you is amazing. I care about you so much.\u201d",
      "Ben tried to remain optimistic. He told Sara he still loved her and would like to date \u201cif you\u2019ll let me.\u201d",
      "She politely shut him down. \u201cWe\u2019ll see!\u201d she replied. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about that.\u201d",
      "Sara then walked out of the ceremony and sat in a car to process the situation with her mom, Kathy, and sister, Lisa.",
      "She assured her family she was fine and mentioned her pod conversation with Ben about BLM as one of the reasons she couldn\u2019t marry him. She said she often wondered if their relationship was just \u201csurface, fun, carefree love\u201d and worried that there was \u201cno curiosity coming from his side.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Ben remained at the ceremony with his friends. Together, they prayed for him and Sara. Ben said he wanted to unpack everything with Sara, but the couple did not communicate the rest of the episode.",
      "Instead, Sara further explained her decision to the cameras. She said the two were \u201cnot a good fit\u201d and that she could not continue the \u201ccycle\u201d of them trying to sort through their different values.",
      "At the end of the episode, Ben said that he was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Sara\u2019s choice while she offered more insight into their relationship",
      "She said that she had to \u201cconstantly give him the benefit of the doubt\u201d when they disagreed.",
      "Sara added, \u201cBut you can\u2019t date someone for their potential because they may never reach the potential.\u201d Even though they didn\u2019t get married, she said she still believed love is blind and that she was proud of herself.",
      "What happened at the reunion?",
      "At the reunion, Sara and Ben spoke about the main topic that broke them up: Values and politics.",
      "Sara also brought up what happened after the wedding from her perspective. While in Nashville for a travel nursing job, she expected Ben to join her.

      "The connection was instantaneous once the duo met and soon realized they attended the same high school. Despite finding themselves in a bit of a love triangle with fellow show contestant Brittany Dodson, Buckley and Miller got engaged sight unseen in the pods.",
      "The newly engaged couple quickly put their relationship to the test in the real world and sought to answer the question: Is love really blind?",
      "As the couple heads to the altar during the final installment of shows from this season, let's take a look back at their \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d journey \u2014 plus, what they shared at the reunion.",
      "What happened between Virginia and Devin in the pods?",
      "Devin, a 29-year-old youth director and coach, had chemistry with Virginia, a 34-year-old health care recruiter, early on in the dating experiment. The pair quickly discovered that they\u2019d attended the same high school, albeit a few years apart. Luckily, the age difference didn't seem to phase the pair.",
      "Simultaneously, Devin was talking with Brittany Dodson, a 35-year-old partnership executive, and they started to form a connection. Soon enough, Devin and Brittany realized they weren't the best fit for each other and went their separate ways on amicable terms. This left Devin free to pursue his connection with Virginia.",
      "At the same time, Devin was a bit worried that Virginia was too \u201cclosed off\u201d and slow to open up. She began to express herself more freely and noted that she's at first very \u201cshy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't want to keep choosing the wrong guy,\u201d she said, adding that she hasn't had many good examples of healthy relationships in her life.",
      "Virginia called Devin \u201cquite refreshing\u201d and said she'd never dated a \u201cnice guy\u201d before. In a confessional interview, Devin called Virginia a \u201ckind, loving, genuine person.\u201d",
      "In Episode 6, Devin wrote a letter for Virginia to declare his love. At the end, he asked if she would marry him, and the two got engaged.",
      "What happened in Honduras?",

      "The topic of a prenup came up yet again when Virginia met Devin\u2019s family. They seemed taken aback by the idea and worried that Virginia might already have one foot out the door. Still, Virginia politely stuck to her belief that a prenup is simply \u201cthe modern way of doing things.\u201d",
      "Eventually, Devin agreed to sign the prenup, noting that it was pretty straightforward.",
      "The couple differed on their political views",
      "Politics were somewhat of a point of contention for Devin and Virginia. In Episode 10, they had a serious conversation about their political views after Virginia encouraged Devin to open up about serious topics that could impact their marriage.",
      "Devin said he wasn't \u201csuper big into politics\u201d and didn't have a \u201cstrong stance on it.\u201d He then explained that his family typically has conservative views.",
      "Virginia was open to differing political opinions, but noted that it would be \u201ckind of alarming\u201d if Devin was \u201cway on the other side of the spectrum\u201d on political issues that matter to her.",

      "\u201cThere were just depths of our relationship that we didn't get to. We just didn't get there. And even our sexual relationship, we just didn't get to it. So I just think that we should be all the way there before we decide to spend the rest of our lives together,\u201d she said.",
      "Additionally, Virginia revealed that Devin got a check for a wedding present, but failed to tell her about the gift. Instead, found out from his mother.",

      "The highly-anticipated footage for the upcoming season, which is set five years after the events of Season 1, was revealed during a South by Southwest film festival panel on March 8. The clip was subsequently uploaded to YouTube and gained more than 6 million views in less than 24 hours.",
      "In the preview, Joel and Ellie are living safely on a base with other survivors, seemingly protected from the monsters that lurk beyond the walls. Meanwhile, other survivors on the outside of the base are trying to fend off rabid creatures and fight for survival.",

I got you.\" In that moment, it becomes apparent that Joel accepted being a father figure to Ellie, despite his pain over the loss of his own daughter on the first day of the pandemic.",

      "As for the rest of Season 3, Episode 1's teaser shows more events.",
      "Greg asks the staff questions about Belinda, causing her to want to call the police. Piper tells her parents she's a Buddhist, which elicits a huge reaction from Victoria. Rick goes to Bangkok, as he has promised, and brings a gun. Gaitok is taken to a shooting range to practice.",
      "A quick montage shows Jaclyn dancing in a club with Valentin's friends, Belinda getting a kiss, Piper and Lochlan staring into each other's eyes, a blurry figure holding a gun up to their head and Piper shrieking in terror.",
      "More to come!"

      "\u201cI have no idea how that 21-year-old Carrie was able to muster up enough guts to walk into a room and audition in front of Simon, Paul and Randy and the world,\u201d the country music singer says in a recent video shared to her YouTube Channel.",
      "The country singer's video shows the now 41-year-old watching a younger, pre-fame version of herself performing \u201cI Can\u2019t Make You Love Me\u201d by Bonnie Raitt.",
      "When Underwood auditioned for the fourth season of the reality singing competition series, she sang before Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson, who were judges at the time.",
      "The clip shared from the fourth season of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d shows a younger Underwood introducing herself as a girl who \u201cgrew up on a farm\u201d and didn\u2019t get to experience \u201ca lot of things that a lot of other people have,\u201d including being on an airplane.",
      "The singer's reflection on where it all began shows Underwood beginning to perform her song, but being cut off by Cowell almost as soon as she begins.",
      "\u201cI was like, I did a bad job,\u201d the singer says in the video while looking back at Cowell\u2019s interruption. \u201cHe immediately gave me a compliment, and then said, \u2018I\u2019m surprised we haven\u2019t found any good country singers,\u2019 which surprised me. And then told me to keep being me. I feel like he deserves a lot of credit.\u201d",
      "Even after all of these years, Underwood says she still remembers the nerves she felt before being officially made part of the show.",
      "\u201cIn my audition, I think I was just trying to hold in all my emotions, literally. Like, hold them into my body or else, I don\u2019t know what I thought was gonna happen,\u201d she explains while looking back. \u201cAnd I had performed on stage a lot...and I knew how to work a stage. But in a situation like that, you\u2019re not on stage. It\u2019s just you singing without a band, without anything. There\u2019s not an audience in front of you. You know, you have these judges and they\u2019re gonna decide your fate.\u201d",
      "Underwood would go on to win \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d in 2005. Since then she has released nine studio albums and won eight Grammy Awards. Now, she is returning to the competition series as a judge for its 23rd season that premieres March 9. She\u2019ll join seasoned judges Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan.",

      "\u201cI was a baby. I was 21 years old, and now on the other side of things as a judge, you see people walk in like that,\u201d she explains, adding how she now tells others to \u201cemote more. I can relate to holding in the emotions.\u201d",
      "She then gets emotional as she reads from her 2005 \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d journal.",
      "\u201cI just have to keep in mind that it will all be worth it and the life I started will be great,\u201d she reads. \u201cMost importantly, I have to remember that this has all been my choice and it\u2019s something I\u2019ve wanted ever since I was a little girl.\u201d",
      "Continuing, \u201cI know I have some great things ahead of me. Right now, I\u2019m just trying to live in the moment and appreciate it all. I never dreamed that all of this would happen to me. I love it.\u201d",
      "Underwood begins to get teary-eyed as she says she wouldn\u2019t know how to tell her younger self what she was about to experience.",
      "\u201cSeeing myself, 21 years old, the world ahead of you,\u201d she says, her voice breaking. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s overwhelming. But you\u2019re gonna do fine kid. You\u2019re gonna be OK. Just hold on.\u201d"

      "More than 1,300 people have been killed in 72 hours, according to the organization, including security force members and militants.",
      "It is unclear which groups are involved in the killing of civilians, with reports of different militias converging in the area, and much remains unknown about what is unfolding in Syria. Interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa called for peace Sunday, amid reports of executions, firing squads and bodies piled in the streets.",
      "Clashes between Syrian government forces and fighters loyal to the deposed dictator, Bashar al-Assad, have also led to hundreds more deaths on both sides.",
      "The violence has been concentrated in the coastal areas of Tartus and Latakia, the home of the Alawite community, a small Islamic sect to which the Assad family belongs. According to the SOHR, the vast majority of the civilian dead appear to be Alawites, which NBC News has not independently confirmed.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio blamed \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d for the killings and urged Syria\u2019s leadership to hold them accountable.",

      "Syria\u2019s rugged Mediterranean shore was a stronghold of the Assad family\u2019s brutal regime, which lasted 53 years before a rebel alliance led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) ousted Assad three months ago in a lightning-fast offensive that swept across the nation and led HTS leader Sharaa to become the new government\u2019s interim president.",
      "However, Syria\u2019s northwest coast remains a fractured battleground, with armed Assad loyalists holding on to villages and remote pockets of territory.",
      "Sharaa\u2019s government has deployed armed forces to the region in a bid to assert control, but fierce clashes erupted last week that have left hundreds dead.",
      "Video posted on social media and verified by NBC News showed dozens of bodies piled on a blood-soaked street in Latakia. Women gathered around the bloodied corpses. One can be heard sobbing, \u201cMy dad, my brother, oh, God.\u201d",
      "Other verified videos showed military vehicles moving through the countryside amid explosions and gunfire, while another showed soldiers indiscriminately dropping bombs from a helicopter over Latakia\u2019s rural areas.",
      "The SOHR\u00a0is a prominent information office dedicated to documenting human rights abuses in Syria.",
      "The group said that the vast majority of people killed in the current clashes were from the Alawite sect and that women and children were executed by firing squad in the countryside near Tartus.",
      "NBC News has not independently verified the death toll or methods of execution.",
      "The Associated Press reported that Sunni gunmen, perhaps loyal to the government, initiated revenge killings Friday, with residents saying that Alawites were being killed in the streets or at the gates of their homes and that their houses were looted and set on fire.",
      "SOHR also reported that 125 government security forces and 148 militants from Assad-affiliated armed groups were among the dead.",
      "Federico Jachetti,\u00a0Syria country office director for the Norwegian Refugee Council, said in a statement Sunday that\u00a0the escalation is \u201ca grim reminder that the situation in the country remains fragile\u201d and cited reports of \u201csummary killings, widespread displacement and thousands more left trapped in their homes.\u201d",
      "\u201cSyrian families across the country are yearning for a respite after long years of uncertainty and fear,\u201d he said, calling on all parties to protect civilians.",
      "Who are the Alawites?",
      "The once-ruling minority is a tight-knit Islamic sect to which the Assad family belongs. Under Assad, Alawites were appointed to key positions in the military and security forces, positioning them as the elite within Syria\u2019s state bureaucracy and security apparatus.",
      "The rise of HTS, a former Al Qaeda affiliate with an extremist past, raised deep concerns among the Alawite community as it took power.",
      "Sunni dominance has inflicted deep scars on the region, and minorities like the Alawites, as well as Christians, Druze and Yazidis, all have reasons to fear the rise of extremist governance.",
      "Sharaa had tried to quell such fears, telling CNN in December, \u201cNo one has the right to erase another group.\u201d",
      "But the recent surge in violence suggests a different story, challenging Sharaa\u2019s claim that his interim government would protect all groups and foster stability.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T\u00fcrk, urged\u00a0Syria's leadership to take \u201cswift actions to protect\u00a0Syrians, including by taking all necessary measures to prevent\u00a0any violations and abuses.\u201d",
      "What does this mean for Syria?",
      "Unifying Syria\u2019s diverse ethnic and religious groups has been one of the major challenges of a post-Assad Syria. A significant escalation of violence could threaten the country\u2019s fragile stability and at worst threaten to tip the country back into civil war should the interim government lose control of some areas.",
      "Sharaa has actively sought to rebrand himself as a unifier willing to put down his previous extremist affiliations. For a time, this strategy appeared successful, generating a surge of goodwill and optimism.",
      "In February, a video surfaced showing Sharaa waving from the sunroof of a black vehicle, surrounded by a jubilant crowd during his first visit to Latakia, where he appeared receive a hero\u2019s welcome.",
      "Internationally, the explosion of violence may derail the progress Sharaa has made in reassuring Western leaders that he can ferry in a Syria free of threats."

Informed by the attorney that Khalil was in the United States as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that too, according to the lawyer.",
      "The arrest appears to be among the first known actions under President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to deport international students who joined the protests against the war in Gaza that swept college campuses last spring. His administration has claimed participants forfeited their rights to remain in the country by supporting Hamas, a terror organization.",
      "When ICE agents arrived at the campus building Saturday, they also threatened to arrest Khalil\u2019s wife, an American citizen who is eight months pregnant, Greer said. The authorities declined to say why Khalil was being arrested, according to the attorney.",
      "They were initially told he was transferred to an immigration detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey. But when Khalil\u2019s wife tried to visit Sunday, she learned he was not there \u2014 and may have been transferred as far away as Louisiana, Greer said.",

      "In a\u00a0message\u00a0shared on X Sunday evening, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the administration \u201cwill be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\u201d",
      "DHS can initiate deportation proceedings against green card holders for a broad range alleged criminal activity, including supporting a terror group. It would ultimately be up to an immigration judge to revoke someone\u2019s permanent resident status, according to Camille Mackler, founder of Immigrant ARC, a coalition of legal service providers in New York.",
      "\u201cThis has the appearance of a retaliatory action against someone who expressed an opinion the Trump administration didn\u2019t like,\u201d Mackler said.",
      "Khalil served as a negotiator for students as they bargained with university officials over an end to the tent encampment erected on campus last spring, a role that made him one of the most visible activists in support of the movement.",
      "He was also among those\u00a0under investigation by a new Columbia University office\u00a0that has brought disciplinary charges against dozens of students for their pro-Palestinian activism, according to records shared with the AP.",

      "The university\u2019s allegations against Khalil focused on his involvement in the Columbia University Apartheid Divest group. He faced sanctions for potentially helping to organize an \u201cunauthorized marching event\u201d in which participants glorified Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack and playing a \u201csubstantial role\u201d in the circulation of social media posts criticizing Zionism, among other acts of alleged discrimination.",

      "NBC News has not independently verified the death toll or methods of execution, and it is currently unclear which groups are involved in the killing of civilians.",
      "In addition, SOHR said that some 50 government troops and 45 Assad loyalists have been killed in the fighting.",
      "Video posted on social media and verified by NBC News showed the bodies of dozens of men piled on a blood-soaked street in the small town of Latakia, another Assad stronghold on Syria\u2019s Mediterranean coast.",
      "Women gathered around the bloodied corpses, wailing and clutching the dead. One can be heard sobbing, \u201cMy dad, my brother, oh, God.\u201d",
      "The victims are reportedly from the Alawite community, the small Islamic sect to which the Assad family belongs. Under Assad, Alawites were appointed to key positions in the military and security forces.",
      "NBC News was unable to confirm that the bodies in the video were members of the Alawite community. The SOHR said the vast majority of people killed in the current clashes were from the minority Islamic sect.",
      "The clashes erupted last week near the coastal city of Jableh when government forces attempted to detain a wanted person but were ambushed by Assad loyalists, triggering a wave of retaliatory attacks and two days of intense fighting.",
      "The coastal stronghold of Assad\u2019s Alawite sect has become a major security flashpoint for interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa as he struggles to assert control three months after his Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group led the overthrow of Assad.",
      "Tensions are especially high in the mountainous coastal region, where government forces are heavily deployed.",
      "In a video statement, Sharaa urged armed groups still loyal to the former government to surrender their weapons. He also called on pro-government forces to avoid harming civilians or mistreating prisoners.",
      "Despite this appeal, the Syrian Observatory reported Friday that Jableh, the coastal town of Baniyas and several nearby Alawite villages \u2014 including Assad\u2019s hometown of Qardaha in the mountains overlooking Latakia \u2014 remain under the control of Assad loyalists.",
      "The clashes raise concerns about Syria\u2019s stability and Sharaa\u2019s ability to reunify Syria after 13 years of civil war.",
      "In February, Sharaa appeared to receive a hero\u2019s welcome during his first visit to Latakia and Tartus. Video showed him waving from a balcony as crowds cheered below.",
      "But the recent violence has raised fears that underlying divisions remain unresolved.",
      "Western nations continue to watch Sharaa\u2019s rise cautiously, weighing his past ties to jihadist groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda against his efforts to present himself as a reformed leader advocating for an inclusive Syria that represents its diverse religious and ethnic communities."

    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea fired several ballistic missiles into the sea on Monday, South Korea\u2019s military said, hours after South Korean and U.S. troops kicked off their large annual combined drills, which the North views as an invasion rehearsal.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile firings, North Korea\u2019s fifth missile launch event this year, were detected from the North\u2019s Hwanghae province but gave no further details such as how far they flew. It said South Korea bolstered its surveillance posture and is closely coordinating with the United States.",
      "Earlier Monday, the South Korean and U.S. militaries began their annual joint military exercises, which are scheduled to last 11 days. The Freedom Shield command post exercise began after the South Korean and U.S. militaries paused live-fire training while Seoul investigates how two of its fighter jets mistakenly bombed a civilian area during a warm-up drill last week.",
      "The drills\u2019 start drew the condemnation of nuclear-armed North Korea, which issued a government statement calling the exercises a \u201cdangerous provocative act\u201d that increases the risks of military conflict.",
      "About 30 people were injured, two of them seriously, when two South Korean KF-16 fighter jets mistakenly fired eight MK-82 bombs on a civilian area in Pocheon, a town near the North Korean border, on Thursday. The bombing occurred while South Korean and U.S. forces were engaging in a live-fire drill ahead of the larger Freedom Shield exercise.",
      "In a background briefing to domestic reporters on Monday, the South Korean air force repeated its initial assessment last week that one of the KF-16 pilots had entered the wrong coordinates for a bombing site.",
      "The unidentified pilot didn\u2019t recognize the error during a pre-takeoff check and, rushing to meet scheduled timing, failed to visually verify the target before proceeding with the bombing. The second pilot had the correct coordinates but focused only on maintaining formation with the other aircraft and dropped the bombs following the first pilot\u2019s instructions, failing to recognize they deviated from the right target, according to the content of the briefing provided to The Associated Press.",
      "Gen. Lee Youngsu, chief of staff of the South Korean air force, bowed and apologized Monday over the injuries and property damage caused by the incident, which he said \u201cshould have never happened and must never happen again.\u201d",
      "Both the South Korean and U.S. militaries have halted all live-fire exercises in South Korea following the mishap. South Korean military officials say live-fire training will resume after they complete the ongoing investigation on the bombing and formulate preventative steps.",
      "The Freedom Shield exercise marks the first large-scale joint exercise since President Donald Trump began his second term. It comes amid growing tensions with North Korea over its nuclear ambitions and its alignment with Russia in President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine.",
      "Trump, who met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un three times during his first term, has expressed his willingness to reach out to Kim again to revive diplomacy, which collapsed due to disagreements over exchanging U.S.-led sanctions against the North and the North\u2019s denuclearization steps. But Pyongyang has yet to respond to his overture and has continued its fiery rhetoric against Washington and Seoul over their joint military exercises, which Kim portrays as rehearsals for invasion.",
      "In a statement issued through state media Monday, the North Korean Foreign Ministry called the Freedom Shield exercise an \u201caggressive and confrontational war rehearsal\u201d that risks triggering \u201cphysical conflict\u201d on the Korean Peninsula.",
      "The ministry reiterated Kim\u2019s state goals for a \u201cradical growth\u201d of his nuclear force to counter what he claims are growing threats posed by the U.S. and its Asian allies."

      "Carney, 59, replaces\u00a0Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January but remains prime minister until his successor is sworn in in the coming days. Carney won in a landslide, winning 85.9% of the vote.",
      "Carney navigated crises when he was the head of the Bank of Canada and when in 2013 he became the first noncitizen to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. His appointment won bipartisan praise in the U.K. after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries.",
      "The opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged.",
      "Trump\u2019s trade war and his talk of making Canada the\u00a051st U.S. state have\u00a0infuriated Canadians, who are booing the American anthem at NHL and NBA games. Some are canceling trips south of the border, and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can.",
      "The surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered the Liberal Party\u2019s chances in a parliamentary election expected within days or weeks, and Liberal showings have been improving steadily in opinion polls.\u201cWe have made this the greatest country in the world and now our neighbors want to take us. No way,\u201d Carney said.",
      "After decades of bilateral stability, the vote on Canada\u2019s next leader now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with the United States.",
      "Carney has picked up one endorsement after another from Cabinet ministers and members of Parliament since declaring his candidacy in January. He is a highly educated economist with Wall Street experience who has long been interested in entering politics and becoming prime minister, but he lacks political experience.",
      "The other top Liberal leadership candidate was former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland. Trudeau told Freeland in December that he no longer wanted her as finance minister, but that she could remain deputy prime minister and the point person for U.S.-Canada relations. Freeland resigned shortly after, releasing a scathing letter about the government that proved to be the last straw for Trudeau.",
      "Carney is expected to trigger an election shortly afterward. Either the new Liberal party leader will call one, or the opposition parties in Parliament could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month."

    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 Israel cut off the electricity supply to\u00a0Gaza, officials said Sunday, affecting a desalination plant producing drinking water for part of the arid territory. Hamas called it part of Israel\u2019s \u201cstarvation policy.\u201d",
      "Israel last week suspended supplies of goods\u00a0to the territory of more than 2 million Palestinians, an echo of the siege it imposed in the earliest days of the war.",
      "Israel is pressing the militant group to accept an\u00a0extension of the first phase\u00a0of their ceasefire. That phase ended last weekend. Israel wants Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce.",
      "Hamas instead wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire\u2019s more difficult second phase, which would see the release of remaining hostages from Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a lasting peace. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others.",
      "The militant group \u2014 which has warned that discontinuing supplies would affect the hostages \u2014 said Sunday that it wrapped up the latest round of ceasefire talks with Egyptian mediators without changes to its position.",
      "Israel has said it would send a delegation to Qatar on Monday in an effort to \u201cadvance\u201d the negotiations.",
      "Israel had warned when it stopped all supplies that water and electricity could be next. The letter from Israel\u2019s energy minister to the Israel Electric Corporation tells it to stop selling power to Gaza.",
      "The territory and its infrastructure have been largely devastated, and most facilities, including hospitals, now use generators. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassam said that Israel has \"practically\" cut off electricity since the war began and called the latest decision part of Israel\u2019s \"starvation policy, in clear disregard for all international laws and norms.\"",
      "The desalination plant was providing 18,000 cubic meters of water per day for central Gaza\u2019s Deir al-Balah area, according to Gisha, an Israeli organization dedicated to protecting Palestinians\u2019 right to freedom of movement. Executive director Tania Hary said that it\u2019s expected to run on generators and produce around 2,500 cubic meters per day, about the amount in an Olympic swimming pool.",
      "Israel\u2019s restrictions on fuel entering Gaza have a larger impact, Hary said, and water shortages are a looming issue, because fuel is needed for distribution trucks.",
      "Israel has faced sharp criticism over suspending supplies.",
      "\u201cAny denial of the entry of the necessities of life for civilians may amount to collective punishment,\u201d the U.N. human rights office said Friday.",
      "The International Criminal Court said there was reason to believe Israel had used \u201cstarvation as a method of warfare\u201d when it\u00a0issued an arrest warrant\u00a0for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year. The allegation is central to South Africa\u2019s case at the International Court of Justice\u00a0accusing Israel of genocide.",
      "Israel has denied the accusations, saying it has allowed in enough aid and blaming shortages on what it called the United Nations\u2019 inability to distribute it. It also accused Hamas of siphoning off aid.",
      "The leader of the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, warned Friday that\u00a0attacks against Israel-linked vessels\u00a0off Yemen would resume within four days if aid doesn\u2019t resume to Gaza. The Houthis described their earlier attacks as solidarity with Palestinians there.",
      "The ceasefire has paused the deadliest and most destructive fighting ever between Israel and Hamas, sparked by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The first phase allowed the return of 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Israeli forces have withdrawn to buffer zones inside Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza and hundreds of trucks of aid entered per day until Israel suspended supplies.",
      "U.S. envoy describes talks with Hamas",
      "The White House on Wednesday\u00a0made the surprise confirmation\u00a0of direct U.S. talks with Hamas.",
      "On Sunday, envoy Adam Boehler told Israeli broadcaster Kan that Hamas has suggested a truce of five to 10 years while it would disarm. The militant group has previously called disarming unacceptable.",
      "A senior Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss contacts with the U.S., said that the group had expressed its longstanding position that it would lay down its arms in return for a \u201cfair and just solution\u201d that includes an independent Palestinian state.",
      "Boehler also told CNN that \u201cI think you could see something like a long-term truce, where we forgive prisoners, where Hamas lays down their arms, where they agree they\u2019re not part of the political party going forward. I think that\u2019s a reality. It\u2019s real close.\u201d",
      "When asked if he would speak with the militant group again, Boehler replied, \u201cYou never know.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cI think something could come together within weeks,\u201d and expressed hope for a deal that would see all hostages released, not only American ones. Boehler has said four of the five American hostages in Gaza are dead, with Edan Alexander alive.",
      "Hamas on Sunday didn\u2019t mention the talks, but reiterated its support for a proposal for the establishment of an independent committee of technocrats to run Gaza until Palestinians hold presidential and legislative elections.",
      "Hamas\u2019 attack in October 2023 killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, inside Israel and took 251 people hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements.",

After more than three weeks in the hospital, the 88-year-old pope is responding well to treatment and has shown a \u201cgradual, slight improvement\u201d in recent days.",
      "For the fourth Sunday in a row, the 88-year-old Francis didn\u2019t appear for his weekly noon blessing, but he met with his top deputies and the Holy See distributed the text he would have delivered if he were well enough.

      "\u201cBrothers and sisters, during my prolonged hospitalization here, I too experience the thoughtfulness of service and the tenderness of care, in particular from the doctors and health care workers, whom I thank from the bottom of my heart,\u201d read the message from Gemelli hospital.",

    "story": [
      "Health authorities are calling attention to a looming consequence of the Trump administration\u2019s gutting of the U.S. Agency for International Development: the risk of a global surge in tuberculosis cases and deaths.",
      "The World Health Organization warned this week that the sweeping funding cuts could endanger millions of lives, since many countries depend on foreign aid for TB prevention, testing and treatment.",
      "\u201cWithout immediate action, hard-won progress in the fight against TB is at risk,\u201d Dr. Tereza Kasaeva, director of the WHO\u2019s Global Programme on TB and Lung Health, said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Globally, tuberculosis is responsible for the most deaths of any infectious disease. Around 1.25 million people died from the bacterial infection in 2023, the latest data available, and new cases hit an all-time high that year, with around 8.2 million people diagnosed, according to the WHO.",
      "Until recently, USAID provided about a quarter of the international donor funding for tuberculosis services in other countries \u2014 up to $250 million annually, according to the WHO. The agency operated tuberculosis programs in 24 countries.",
      "The WHO said that because of the U.S. funding cuts, drug supply chains in other countries are \u201cbreaking down,\u201d laboratory services are \u201cseverely disrupted\u201d and surveillance systems are \u201ccollapsing,\u201d making it difficult to identify, monitor and treat tuberculosis cases. Some research trials have been halted, as well.",
      "That has incapacitated some national tuberculosis programs, with the WHO warning of devastating impacts in 18 countries with the highest burden of disease, many of which are in Africa.",
      "In Uganda, the rollback of USAID funding has made it hard to pay community health workers, leading to understaffing, said Dr. Luke Davis, a clinical epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health. Such workers play a critical role in notifying people who test positive for tuberculosis, getting them treatment and screening their close contacts for infection.",
      "\u201cPatients may get a diagnosis of TB after they\u2019ve left the clinic because they\u2019re waiting for the results, and they may be at home with TB and not know they have TB. There\u2019s literally not the resources to go out and reach those people,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are dying because they have disease that hasn\u2019t been diagnosed, hasn\u2019t been treated, hasn\u2019t been prevented.\u201d",
      "Since Jan. 24, the discontinuation of USAID funding may have led to an estimated 3,400 additional tuberculosis deaths and 6,000 additional infections, according to a project modeling the impact of the cuts. The model is coordinated by the Stop TB Partnership, a United Nations organization that aims to eliminate tuberculosis as a public health problem.",
      "Any increase in the disease\u2019s spread could affect the U.S., since it would allow more people who live or travel abroad to bring the disease in. Already, tuberculosis cases in the U.S. have risen: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded more than 9,600 cases in 2023, a nearly 16% increase from the year prior and a 9% increase over prepandemic levels in 2019.",
      "A persistent outbreak in Kansas has led to 68 active cases since January 2024.",
      "\u201cWhat happens when we travel overseas? I\u2019ve known servicemen and -women who come back with multidrug-resistant TB after a tour of duty. I\u2019ve known of bankers, people from Silicon Valley who work overseas, come back with the disease,\u201d said Dr. Kenneth Castro, a professor of global health at Emory University\u2019s Rollins School of Public Health.",
      "\u201cThe problem with all these infectious diseases is that they know no borders, and neither should our efforts stop at the border,\u201d he said.",
      "A resurgence of tuberculosis in the U.S. from 1985 to 1992 was attributed, in part, to a decline in tuberculosis control programs and rising global cases.",
      "The White House did not provide a comment in time for publication.",
      "People with active TB usually develop a bad cough and chest pain. They may cough up blood and mucus and have difficulty breathing. Left untreated, the bacterial infection can damage the lungs and spread to other parts of their body such as the brain, kidneys and spine. It can be fatal for up to two-thirds of people with active cases who aren\u2019t properly treated, according to the WHO.",
      "But treatment is no quick matter: Tuberculosis patients must usually take antibiotics for six months, and stopping in the middle can lead a person to become resistant to the antibiotics, then spread that drug-resistant TB strain to others.",
      "Until the recent cuts, USAID had been instrumental in conducting surveillance to identify new tuberculosis cases, improving supply chains to get medicine to sick patients, and investing in clinical trials for new therapies and diagnostic tests. In communities that lacked radiologists to read X-rays, USAID also funded portable X-ray systems that use artificial intelligence to make diagnoses.",
      "Additionally, the agency helped countries procure drugs at lower costs, in part by funding the Global Drug Facility, a group that negotiates drug prices with suppliers.",
      "Many of those efforts came to a halt when the Trump administration stripped the agency down to bare bones. After firing or furloughing contractors in January, the administration laid off 1,600 staffers, then placed thousands more on administrative leave last month. The State Department slashed nearly 5,800 of USAID\u2019s foreign aid awards \u2014 more than 90% of the total \u2014 according to a lawsuit filed by nonprofits and businesses that receive USAID funding. The awards totaled $54 billion, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a waiver in January allowing USAID\u2019s lifesaving humanitarian programs \u2014 including tuberculosis prevention and treatment \u2014 to continue, despite a 90-day freeze on foreign aid. But in a memo to staffers last month, a USAID official said that nearly all of the funding needed to keep those programs going had been terminated.",
      "The official warned of \u201cpreventable death, destabilization, and threats to national security on a massive scale,\u201d then was placed on administrative leave after sending the memo.",
      "The downsizing of USAID has been part of the broader effort to reduce federal spending led by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk said on X last month that he was \u201cfeeding USAID into the wood chipper,\u201d and that he and Trump agreed the agency should be shut down.",
      "So far, federal judges have denied requests from USAID staffers and contractors to continue their work while lawsuits challenging their terminations play out. The Supreme Court on Wednesday, however, said the Trump administration had to pay USAID contractors $2 billion for work already completed.",
      "The WHO has a goal to reduce tuberculosis cases by 80% and deaths by 90% by 2030. That was already aspirational but is even further out of sight now, said Dr. Priya Shete, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco.",
      "USAID played a significant role in getting diagnostic tools and treatments over the \u201clast mile\u201d to patients, Shete said. That included finding ways to transport drugs when road conditions were poor and funding mobile clinics that offered X-rays and bacterial testing.",
      "\u201cThe loss of resources to get across the finish line is what\u2019s really disturbing to some people, and will end up costing millions of lives potentially,\u201d she said.",
      "Experts worry the disruption to clinical trials will also hinder the development of treatments for drug-resistant infections and of new ways to detect cases in children, who are often hard to diagnose.",
      "\u201cThe innovations do come back and benefit the U.S., as well,\u201d Davis said."

      "At least 11 people were killed in multiple strikes on a town in Ukraine\u2019s embattled eastern Donetsk region late Friday, and another seven people were killed in four towns close to the front where Russian troops have been making steady advances, said regional Gov.

      "\u201cIt is a vile and inhumane intimidation tactic to which the Russians often resort,\u201d he said.",

      "Yet neither the courts nor a corps of foreign leaders are deterred. Federal judges have lifetime tenures, after all, and overseas officials answer to their own citizenry. For now, they\u2019re acting as the emergency brake as Trump pushes ahead with plans to remake the world.",
      "In slapping down the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to fire a member of the National Labor Relations Board, a federal judge saw fit to issue a stark reminder of the limits of presidential power.",
      "\u201cA President who touts an image of himself as a \u2018king\u2019 or a \u2018dictator,\u2019 perhaps as his vision of effective leadership, fundamentally misapprehends the role under Article II of the U.S. Constitution,\u201d U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell wrote last week. (Trump said during the campaign he\u2019d be a \u201cdictator\u201d on the first day of his presidency. After scuttling New York City\u2019s congestion pricing system last month, he proclaimed in capital letters on his social media site, \u201cLong live the king!\u201d)",
      "Another judge, William Alsup, in the Northern District of California, ruled in a case involving the Trump administration\u2019s firing of probationary federal workers: \u201cThe ongoing, en masse termination of probationary employees across the federal government\u2019s agencies has sown significant chaos.\u201d",
      "Foreign leaders push back",
      "At least four U.S. allies have publicly rebuked Trump in recent weeks over statements they\u2019ve deemed untruthful or unwise.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gave a speech last week addressing Trump by his first name, \u201cDonald,\u201d and telling him that imposing tariffs on Canada was \u201ca very dumb thing to do.\u201d",
      "Aides to Trudeau had given him a draft of the speech beforehand. Deciding he wanted to say something stronger, Trudeau rewrote it, a Western government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk freely.",
      "\u201cFrankly he has had enough,\u201d the official said of Trudeau.",
      "\u201cThe Prime Minister spoke quite honestly and was saying the very least that he needed to say in order to deal directly with the level of contempt that has been shown by the president toward him as a person\u201d and toward Canada, the official added.",
      "Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, said in an interview: \u201cWe know Americans love Canadians and Canadians love Americans. This is one person. President Trump has created a total mess. He\u2019s created uncertainty.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t the way you trade with your closest ally and your closest friend in the entire world.\u201d",
      "Both President Emmanuel Macron of France and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer stepped in to correct Trump after he claimed Europeans were being paid back for the aid they\u2019ve sent to Ukraine and that U.S. taxpayers had gotten stiffed.",
      "Putting his hand on Trump\u2019s arm in the Oval Office, Macron said without hesitation on Feb. 24, \u201cNo, in fact, to be frank, we pay. We paid 60% of the total effort.\u201d",
      "After Trump said in his Oval Office meeting with Starmer three days later, \u201cWe don\u2019t get the money back,\u201d Starmer told him: \u201cWe\u2019re not getting all of ours. Quite a bit of ours was gifted.\u201d",
      "Both leaders were guests sitting with Trump in the Oval Office as reporters asked questions and the cameras rolled. That they felt compelled to interject and correct Trump is a rarity in such settings, where decorum and deference are the norm.",
      "\u201cForeign leaders don\u2019t normally criticize or correct each other on camera,\u201d said Peter Westmacott, who has served as British ambassador to the U.S., France and Turkey. \u201cBut we aren\u2019t living in normal times. Sometimes the president\u2019s lies don\u2019t matter. But sometimes, because of the office he holds, they do.\u201d",
      "Asked about those moments with Starmer and Macron, a White House official said Trump wasn\u2019t bothered by either. Trump has a long relationship with Macron, and when the cameras were off, the president and Starmer seemed to forge a real connection, the official said.",
      "What\u2019s more, neither man interrupted in quite the same way as Zelenskyy, the official added. (Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, lost their temper with Zelenskyy after he recounted how Russian President Vladimir Putin had broken agreements made with his country over the past decade.)",
      "How world leaders prep to meet with Trump",
      "When world leaders come to the Oval Office, they\u2019re not in the habit of winging it. They arrive with points they want to make and rebuttals they\u2019ve prepared in response to arguments they expect to hear, diplomats say.",
      "As an example, prior to his first-ever meeting with Trump last month at the White House, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba huddled with advisers in Tokyo for more than 20 hours of preparatory meetings, a person familiar with the planning said.",
      "All that homework paid off. Ishiba arrived for his Oval Office meeting bearing charts that clearly and colorfully illustrated Japan\u2019s investments in the United States, the source said, the sorts of visual aids that Trump prefers.",
      "Ishiba also brought a golden samurai helmet as a gift, two people familiar with the present told NBC News. In Japan, this often signifies prayers for prosperity and longevity.",
      "So, when leaders like Macron and Starmer interject to tell Trump he\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s not something they do lightly; they feel they can\u2019t let his statements stand unchallenged, diplomats said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable and certainly to my knowledge, at least, unprecedented. We have some of the most seasoned diplomatic leaders, Starmer and Macron, who know Trump and who know precisely how thin-skinned he is,\u201d said Ned Price, a former State Department spokesman in the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cThe fact that they did this in this setting, in front of reporters and cameras, only underscores the concerns they have about how these false assertions really get at the fabric of the alliance,\u201d Price added.",
      "Democrats struggle to find their footing",
      "The most natural impediment to Trump\u2019s aspirations would be the opposition party. But Democrats have looked hapless following their defeat in the 2024 presidential race.",
      "At Trump\u2019s speech last week to a joint session of Congress, Democratic lawmakers sat in the House chamber holding up paddles reading \u201cFalse.\u201d Late night talk show hosts mocked that bit of theater.",
      "But Jones sees a way for his party to emerge from exile. Eight years ago, he did the unthinkable in bright-red Alabama, winning a Senate seat. Now, he says, Democrats can recover if they choose their targets more selectively rather than object to the dizzying number of policy pronouncements and walk-backs coming from the West Wing.",
      "\u201cDemocrats have struggled a little bit in part because there was so much hitting quickly,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt was like playing whack-a-mole. You go down one path and Trump reverses course. That may be by design to keep Democrats off their game, and it worked.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut Democrats are beginning to home in on key important points. Medicaid is a really big deal. Health care is a really big deal that\u2019s important to a lot of the swing districts and a lot of red districts.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is Democrats are begging to fine-tune a message. They won\u2019t go down every rabbit hole the administration throws at them.\u201d"
