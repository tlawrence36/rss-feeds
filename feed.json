      "They have cup holders at the multiplex. But as yet, they have not installed Kleenex holders.",
      "That might have been a good idea once it was clear that director Josh Boone was going to helm another adaptation of a popular YA novel, this time \u201cRegretting You\u201d by Colleen Hoover. As fans may recall, Boone\u2019s \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars\u201d sent millions of overactive tear ducts and sniffly noses into overdrive. It would have been good to have a whole box of tissues at hand.",
      "Of course, that story was about not only about teen love but teen cancer. It was hard not to cry just thinking about it, let alone seeing it. \u201cRegretting You,\u201d a tragicomic intergenerational romance adapted by Susan McMartin, has its share of grief. But the strange way the tears give way to smiles, quips and then full-on rom-com corniness feels a little awkward \u2014 and then just weird and annoying. It\u2019s a two-Kleenex ride, at most \u2014 definitely not the whole box.",
      "Allison Williams and Dave Franco play Morgan and Jonah, and when we first meet them in high school, they have definite chemistry (they also look like they\u2019re around 30, despite some de-aging). But Jonah\u2019s dating Morgan\u2019s sister Jenny, and Morgan is with Jonah\u2019s buddy Chris. This prelude, at a teen gathering on the beach, introduces us to the quartet but also informs us of Morgan\u2019s unexpected pregnancy, which she's just discovered in a convenience store restroom.",
      "\u201cHow did we end up with our exact opposites?\u201d Jonah asks on the beach, as hunky Chris parties and gets drunk, along with Morgan\u2019s fun-loving sister.",
      "And then 17 years later, we meet the foursome again. We\u2019re more than a little disappointed to know that the couples remained intact \u2014 sort of. Did Morgan REALLY marry the boyfriend who told her on the beach that she was more fun when drunk? Yes, Morgan married Chris. And sister Jenny is with Jonah (bespectacled and dark and twisty, as Meredith Grey might say) \u2014 but only because a one-night stand has led to a baby, which they're co-parenting.",
      "Then there\u2019s the other baby \u2014 Morgan\u2019s daughter Clara (Mckenna Grace), about to turn 17, lovely, smart and aiming for drama school. There\u2019s some conflict with her mother about this ambition, though like so much here, it really doesn't ring true that Morgan, as portrayed by the always-appealing Williams, would oppose such a thing. But whatever. Who are we to question the stuff between teen daughters and their moms, right?",
      "Then Miller turns up. Known as the coolest guy in school (believable) but also a slightly sketchy sort (not believable), Miller, played sweetly by Mason Thames, enters Clara\u2019s life when he hitches a ride with her. She knows he has a girlfriend, but is smitten. Theirs is a rocky road to love. Kidding! Only a few pesky pebbles stand in the way, seemingly meant to take up pages in a meandering script. (He breaks up with the girlfriend. He reunites with the girlfriend! He breaks up with the girlfriend again. He\u2019s a little angry! He\u2019s fine again.)",

      "Yorgos Lanthimos' movies are farces, fables and experiments that reside in surreal worlds of their own",
      "The twisted filmography of Yorgos Lanthimos has by now trained us to expect darkly comic visions of contemporary life, both savage and mundane. His movies have perhaps inspired the most \u201cWhat?!\u201d reactions of the last decade, partly because they\u2019ve tried so hard to do so.",
      "His movies \u2014 farces, fables, experiments \u2014 reside in surreal worlds of their own. But his latest, \u201cBugonia,\u201d is thrillingly, if tragically, tied to our reality. It might even be his best film. Though I\u2019ve been apprehensive about the flamboyant severity of Lanthimos\u2019 movies, I found \u201cBugonia,\u201d a chamber-piece gut punch, hard to shake. For starters, it\u2019s difficult to resist any movie with a line in it like: \u201cThere\u2019s Andromedan code all over your Instagram.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s one of the things that Teddy (Jesse Plemons), an incel eco-terrorist, says to Michelle (Emma Stone) after kidnapping her with his neurodivergent cousin Donny (newcomer Aidan Delbis) and tying her up in their basement. Teddy and Donny live together in fairly remote, rundown old house. There, Teddy tends to both his bees and to unhinged conspiracy theories.",
      "But as Plemons so deftly plays him, Teddy doesn\u2019t seem like a lunatic. He might reach wildly insane conclusions, such as that Michelle, a pharmaceutical company chief executive, is an alien. But he\u2019s thoughtful in nature and sweetly cares for his cousin. It\u2019s a feat of Plemons\u2019 innate good nature that we kind of like Teddy, even as he shaves Michelle\u2019s head, to prevent \u201cit,\u201d as he calls her, from contacting the mothership.",
      "The opening moments of the script by Will Tracy (\u201cThe Menu,\u201d episodes of \u201cSuccession\u201d) cast these demented shenanigans in an apocalyptic light. The fate of bees is much on Teddy\u2019s mind; colony collapse disorder, often caused by pesticides, is one of his talking points. It\u2019s a phenomenon that, in \u201cBugonia\u201d \u2014 a movie reckoning with, or maybe just lamenting, humanity\u2019s fate \u2014 isn\u2019t just for the bees.",
      "While Stone\u2019s abilities alone might legitimize extraterrestrial suspicions, there\u2019s more to why Teddy has pinpointed Michelle. She\u2019s a lauded corporate leader; her office includes a framed Time magazine with her on the cover and a photograph with Michelle Obama. Her company, Auxolith, operates out of a sleek office building where Michelle presides over her workforce like a queen bee. She has the corporate lingo of \u201ctransparency\u201d and \u201cdiversity\u201d down pat, but whether she actually adheres to any of those ideals is dubious, at best. Before Teddy and Donny jump her, she announces a \u201cnew era\u201d at Auxolith where employees leave at 5:30 p.m. But not if they haven\u2019t met their quota, she adds. And not if they\u2019re, you know, busy.",
      "In that way, Michelle is a camera-ready cover for whatever Auxolith is up to, which, as the movie goes along, teases out a poisonous history, including opioid manufacturing that affected Teddy\u2019s mother (Alicia Silverstone).",

It\u2019s a conversation, laced with contemporary divides, that is comical for its impossibility. One is addled by paranoia and extremism, the other knows only heartless corporate speak. Understanding each other is futile. Watching Stone, as Michelle, attempt to reason with Teddy is part of the movie\u2019s dark fun, just as is seeing Plemons\u2019 Teddy resolutely stick to his certainty that Michelle is part of an alien infiltration of Earth that he wants gone by the next lunar eclipse.",
      "The source of such a wild narrative can only come, of course, from South Korea. \u201cBugonia\u201d is loosely based on the 2003 Korean film \u201cSave the Green Planet!\u201d All of Lanthimos\u2019 most notable films before have been written with either Efthimis Filippou (\u201cDogtooth,\u201d \u201cThe Lobster\u201d) or Tony McNamara (\u201cPoor Things,\u201d \u201cThe Favourite\u201d).

      "Yet what could easily be mistaken for a tossed-off, in-between movie \u2014 there are only a handful of characters and a few scene locations \u2014 ends up feeling like a culmination-slash-nadir for Lanthimos. Having made a dozen films darkly satirizing the sad, primal folly of humankind, it\u2019s comeuppance time in \u201cBugonia.\u201d",
      "The movie drags in the middle, when it\u2019s locked in a prisoner drama that grows a little tiresome and predictable. But the payoff is immense. Teddy calls his torture chamber \u201cthe headquarters of the human resistance.\u201d By the time \u201cBugonia\u201d reaches its unforgettable finale, it's made chillingly clear just how feeble any such movement might be, and the movie's apocalyptic air of resignation, of fait accompli, sounds a chastening death knell.",
      "\u201cBugonia,\u201d a Focus Features release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for bloody violent content including a suicide, grisly images and language. Running time: 118 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.",

      "Copeland will be feted in grand style as American Ballet Theatre devotes a gala evening to her retirement after 25 years with the company. Copeland joined ABT as a teenager and became, a decade ago, the first Black female principal dancer in its 75-year history.",
      "In a way, the gala will be both a return and a departure for Copeland. She'll be dancing with the company for the first time in five years. During that time, Copeland has been raising a young son with her husband.",
      "She's also been continuing her career as an author \u2014 the second volume of her \u201cBunheads\u201d series appeared in September \u2014 and working to increase diversity in the dance world with her namesake foundation, including \u201cBe Bold,\u201d an afterschool program designed for young children of color.",
      "But Copeland decided to dust off the pointe shoes so she could have one last spin on the ABT stage \u2014 including a duet as Juliet, one of the most passionate roles in ballet. Though she has not closed the door on dancing altogether, it\u2019s clear an era is ending.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been 25 years at ABT, and I think it\u2019s time,\u201d Copeland, 43, told The Associated Press in an interview in June, when she announced her retirement. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to move to the next stage.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely concerning,\u201d Copeland said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve just gotten to a place in my career where there\u2019s only so much I can do on a stage.

      "The Scharf Collection has its roots in a collection started more than a century ago by Otto Gerstenberg, who led a Berlin life insurance company. It's now in the hands of Gerstenberg's great-grandson, Ren\u00e9 Scharf, and his wife, Christiane, who have expanded it further into contemporary art.",
      "The roughly 150 works going on show this week at Berlin's Alte Nationalgalerie range in time from the early 19th century, with plates from Spanish master Francisco de Goya's series \u201cThe Disasters of War\u201d and \u201cLa Tauromaquia,\u201d to modern abstract works by German artists Katharina Grosse and Anselm Reyle. Compositions by Sam Francis and Jasper Johns bring an American element to the collection.",
      "\u201cWe go from Goya to Grosse,\u201d Ren\u00e9 Scharf said as the exhibition was presented Wednesday. He said that he has a particular passion for impressionism, cubism and contemporary art, and hopes visitors who see Grosse's shimmering pink and blue \u201cNo title\u201d at the end of the show will see a connection to Claude Monet's impressionist \u201cWaterloo Bridge\u201d from nearly a century earlier.",
      "At the heart of the collection are works by many of the biggest names in French art of the past two centuries. Visitors progress from the romantic paintings of Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix to the realist work of Gustave Courbet and the caricatures of Honor\u00e9 Daumier, including a series of busts of French lawmakers by the latter.",
      "One of Claude Monet's earlier, realist works, \u201cFarmyard in Chailly,\" is displayed alongside later impressionist paintings such as \u201cSteep Cliffs near Dieppe\u201d and one of his \u201cWaterloo Bridge\u201d series. There are works on paper and canvas by Auguste Renoir and Paul C\u00e9zanne, complemented by nudes and dancers by Edgar Degas.",

They're shown close to pieces by his close friend Henri Matisse as the exhibition heads toward the cubism and the modern day with work from Pablo Picasso, Fernand L\u00e9ger and others.",

      "Scharf said that, after the Alte Nationalgalerie approached him about showing the collection, \u201cwe asked ourselves what happens if we do nothing? Then maybe 30, 40 or 50 people per year will see the collection and only a very small part of it, because we can't hang everything at home.\u201d",

      "Universal Pictures says Sunday that \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d has topped the North American box office with an estimated $26.5 million in ticket sales",
      "The horror sequel \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d topped the North American box office charts this weekend with $26.5 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. Not only did it surpass the original's $23.6 million debut, it's a much-needed win for Blumhouse after a string of disappointments this year like \u201cM3GAN 2.0.\u201d",
      "Though \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d opened in line with expectations, moviegoing in October continues to be slow \u2014 down about 11% from last year, according to Comscore. The overall box office is still up about 4% compared with last year, but a big blockbuster hit that could spark more momentum might not arrive until late November or December.",
      "Universal Pictures released \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d in 3,411 theaters in North America on a wave of good reviews. Coming four years after the original, the sequel sees the return of filmmaker Scott Derrickson, as well as stars Ethan Hawke and Mason Thames. Opening weekend audiences were 63% between the ages of 18 and 34, according to exit polls, and the biggest demographic was Hispanics, making up 39% of ticket buyers while Caucasians accounted for 35%.",
      "With an additional $15.5 million from 71 international territories, \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d had a $42 million worldwide launch against a reported $30 million production budget.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic opening,\u201d said Jim Orr, who heads Universal\u2019s domestic distribution. \u201cOur great partners in Scott Derrickson and Blumhouse once again took this property and crafted an unbelievably haunting, chilling story that audiences just simply couldn\u2019t get enough of.\u201d",
      "The first \u201cBlack Phone\u201d was a bit of a sleeper hit for Universal and Blumhouse in 2021 as cinemas were beginning to come back to life after COVID shutdowns. By the end of its run, it had earned more than $161 million worldwide against an $18 million budget.",
      "Blumhouse has had a rocky 2025, with a handful of duds including \u201cWolf Man\u201d and \u201cThe Woman in the Yard.\u201d But the once impenetrable horror hitmaker could be on the upswing again with a \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d sequel coming in December. The first movie earned nearly $300 million worldwide.",
      "The horror genre in general has soared to record-breaking heights this year, with hits like \u201cWeapons\u201d and the multi-genre \u201cSinners,\" generating over $1.2 billion for the industry, noted Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s head of marketplace trends.",
      "\u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d was also the only film to really break through this weekend, despite a slew of options playing in wide release including the R-rated Seth Rogen, Aziz Ansari and Keanu Reeves comedy \u201cGood Fortune,\u201d which opened in 2,990 locations to $6.2 million, and the expansion of the Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield drama \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d which made $1.6 million from 1,238 theaters. Also new in theaters is Guillermo del Toro\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d although Netflix does not report box office grosses.",
      "\u201cTron: Ares\u201d fell about 67% to $11.1 million in its second weekend in theaters, which was enough to snag second place on the charts. Globally it has now earned $103 million.",
      "\u201cGood Fortune,\u201d which opened in third place, had mostly positive reviews on its side, but Ansari's comedy with a side of social commentary did not drum up a lot of enthusiasm in its first weekend. With a B+ CinemaScore, though, it likely has a better chance in the coming weeks than the campus drama \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d which got a very poor C- score.",
      "\u201cThis is a quintessential October for movies, meaning this is not a hotbed of box office blockbusters,\u201d said Dergarabedian. \u201cBut the marketplace is flush with titles. This is awards season; this is where you have a lot of auteur driven films, edgier films. Collectively these don\u2019t generate a ton of box office, but there\u2019s the currency of goodwill created with movie fans.\u201d",
      "Next weekend audiences will get another batch of awards-hopefuls, including Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s latest Emma Stone collaboration \u201cBugonia\u201d and the Bruce Springsteen biopic \u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,\u201d starring \u201cThe Bear\u2019s\u201d Jeremy Allen White.",

      "San Francisco (AP) \u2014 A Northern California aquarium has raised more than $2 million for sea otter conservation in just two days. All it took was Taylor Swift wearing a vintage T-shirt.",
      "Swift wore a vintage Monterey Bay Aquarium otter conservation T-shirt in a release party movie for her new \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d album, sending her ardent fans on a quest to buy the shirt last produced in the 1990s. After the aquarium was flooded with calls about buying the T-shirt showing two otters floating on their back, it decided to re-release the garment Thursday as part of a special campaign to raise $1.3 million, a nod to Swift\u2019s favorite number, said Liz MacDonald, the aquarium\u2019s director of content strategy.",
      "The aquarium met and surpassed its goal to raise the funds for its sea otter conservation program in less than eight hours, averaging about $100,000 in sales every 15 minutes, MacDonald said. Donors who give at least $65.13 to its newest fundraising campaign to help injured and orphan otters will be mailed a T-shirt, MacDonald said.",
      "\u201cWe definitely had a little Taylor Swift dance party in the office yesterday afternoon when we hit the goal,\u201d she said.",
      "The aquarium began accepting back-orders and by Friday afternoon it had raised more than $2 million, according to its website.",
      "How Swift acquired the T-Shirt that was last produced more than 32 years ago \u2014 when she was just 3 years old \u2014 remains a mystery.",
      "She and fianc\u00e9 Travis Kelce have been documented visiting nearby Carmel, but MacDonald said the aquarium is not aware of the couple having been in their shop.",
      "MacDonald said the staff has had fun speculating about Swift's interest in the T-shirt.",
      "When Taylor announced the release of her new album on Kelce\u2019s podcast \"New Heights\" a couple of weeks ago, the couple had a little banter about how he loves otters and loves sending her videos of the furry sea creatures.",
      "\u201cOne of my favorite theories is that we have a sea otter on our exhibit whose name is Opal and she was named by the fans through an online poll, and I wonder if Taylor Swift may have been one of the people that voted for the name Opal,\u201d MacDonald said, adding that opal is Kelce\u2019s birthstone and that Opalite is the name of one of Swift\u2019s songs.",
      "Whatever the reason, the aquarium and Liberty Graphics, an employee-owned company printing the T-shirts, are reveling in the moment.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cIt's \u2018Tycoon\u2019 season,'\u201d a beaming Ty Dolla $ign, declares.",
      "It is indeed. The inventive R&B singer has just released his fifth studio album, his first full-length solo release in five years. He chose \u201cTycoon\u201d for its title because the word encompasses his current state of mind. \u201cIt\u2019s like (being at) the top of your game,\" he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like, not only have I done all the stuff you could do in artistry, (but) there\u2019s still more to do.\u201d",
      "Call it confidence or swagger or showboating: The Grammy-nominated artist has a trove of multiplatinum records to his name from 2018 to the present, and recently, his controversial project with Kanye West, $, released two albums, \u201cVultures 1\u201d and \u201cVultures 2\u201d in 2024. They debuted at No. 1 and 2 on the Billboard 200, respectively.",
      "\u201cTycoon\u201d is classic Ty Dolla $ign. The album is what he's made a name for himself doing: a collection of ceaselessly catchy, NSFW R&B anthems about lust and love (both mostly lechery), stacked with A-list collaborations: Quavo,Juicy J, 2 Chainz, Tyga, Travis Scott, Chlo\u00eb \u2014 the list goes on.",
      "Also among them: Rappers Kodak Black and Ty Dolla $ign's longtime kindred spirit YG. (Ty Dolla $ign and YG have worked together for a number of years, certainly going back to 2010's \u201cToot It & Boot It.\") For his latest album, the trio teamed up for \u201cSMILE BODY PRETTY FACE.\u201d It was one of the last songs to make \u201cTycoon,\u201d says Ty Dolla $ign, \u201cBut when we started messing with the beat. I was like, \u2018This has got to be YG.\u2019\u201d",
      "There's a romantic element to the song \u2014 with some of his explicitly sexual posturing. The same can be said about the lead single to \u201cTycoon,\u201d \u201cAll In,\u201d where Ty Dolla $ign's rich baritone considers devotion to a partner. \u201cThey say love don\u2019t cost a thing,\u201d he swoons on the chorus. \u201cAnd if it did, I\u2019d go all in.\u201d",
      "\u201cI'm always loving something,\u201d he says. \u201cIt hasn't all the way worked out for me yet.\u201d Love, then, is still a constant source of inspiration \u2014 enriched by the song's sample of Wayne Wonders\u2019 2002 reggae fusion track \u201cNo Letting Go.\u201d",
      "For Ty Dolla $ign, this new era means being a business \u201cTycoon\u201d as well. He's taken on his fair share of industry endeavors \u2014 like launching a label, EZMNY, with Motown Records executive Shawn Barron \u2014 and experiencing immediate success with its first signing, the R&B upstart Leon Thomas. His single, \u201cMutt,\u201d hit No. 11 on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on its Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.",
      "Thomas told AP earlier this year about working with Ty Dolla $ign: \u201cI was around some epic legends in the field, and I feel like the best teacher is experience.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy goal there, with EZMNY, is to give the real artists a chance. Myself, I didn\u2019t make it until I was 27 and I was always good. I was always making music,\u201d Ty Dolla $ign says. \u201cAnd I just wanted to reach back to people that are actually great.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely going to be a comeback in R&B very soon,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe're talking Leon specifically.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 As the government shutdown enters its fourth week, Senate Republicans are headed to the White House on Tuesday \u2014 not for urgent talks on how to end it, but for a display of unity with President Donald Trump as they refuse to negotiate on any Democratic demands.",
      "Senate Democrats, too, are confident in their strategy to keep voting against a House-passed bill that would reopen the government until Republicans, including Trump, engage them on extending health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year.",
      "With both sides showing no signs of movement, it\u2019s unclear how long the stalemate will last \u2014 even as hundreds of thousands of federal workers will miss another paycheck in the coming days and states are sounding warnings that key federal programs will soon lapse completely. And the meeting at the White House appears unlikely, for now, to lead to a bipartisan resolution as Senate Republicans are dug in and Trump has followed their lead.",
      "\u201cI think the president\u2019s ready to get involved on having the discussion\u201d about extending the subsidies, said Senate Republican leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Monday. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they are prepared to do that until (Democrats) open up the government.\u201d",
      "While Capitol Hill remains at a standstill, the effects of the shutdown are worsening. Federal workers are set to miss additional paychecks amid total uncertainty about when they might eventually get paid. Government services like the  Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, and Head Start preschool programs that serve needy families are facing potential cutoffs in funding. On Monday, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the National Nuclear Security Administration is furloughing 1,400 federal workers. The Federal Aviation Administration has reported air controller shortages and flight delays in cities across the United States.",
      "Still, there has been little urgency in Washington as each side believes the other will eventually cave.",
      "\u201cOur position remains the same, we want to end the shutdown as soon as we can and fix the ACA premium crisis that looms over 20 million hardworking Americans,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Monday, referring to the expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire in December.",
      "Schumer called the White House meeting a \u201cpep rally\u201d and said it was \u201cshameful\u201d that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has kept the House out of town during the shutdown.",
      "Members of both parties acknowledge that as the shutdown drags on, it is becoming less likely every day that Congress will be able to either extend the subsidies or fund the government through the regular appropriations process. The House GOP bill that Senate Democrats have now rejected 11 times would only keep the government open through Nov. 21.",
      "Thune on Monday hinted that Republicans may propose a longer extension of current funding instead of passing individual spending bills if the shutdown doesn\u2019t end soon. Congress would need to pass an extension beyond Nov. 21, he said, \u201cif not something on a much longer-term basis.\u201d",
      "Democrats are focused on Nov. 1, when next year\u2019s enrollment period for the ACA coverage begins and millions of people will sign up for their coverage without the expanded subsidy help that began during the COVID-19 pandemic. Once those sign-ups begin, they say, it would be much harder to restore the subsidies even if they did have a bipartisan compromise.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 A planned five-day strike by thousands of registered nurses and other Kaiser Permanente health care workers in California, Hawaii and Oregon ended on Sunday, union leaders and the health care system said.",
      "California-based Kaiser Permanente said it welcomed back about 30,000 employees who participated in the strike, which began Tuesday and ended Sunday morning. Its statement said its facilities were \u201cstaffed by physicians, experienced managers and trained staff, along with nearly 6,000 contracted nurses, clinicians and others who worked with us during the strike.\u201d",
      "Plans call for bargaining to resume this week, with a focus on \u201ceconomic issues,\u201d the statement said. While unions also raised staffing and other concerns, \u201cwages are the reason for the strike and the primary issue in negotiations,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The United Nurses Associations of California/Union of Health Care Professionals, which represents registered nurses, pharmacists, nurse midwives and other health care professionals in California and Hawaii, said in a statement that more than 500 hospitals and clinics were impacted by the strike.

      "More women are defying traditional beauty standards and finding empowerment by going without hair on their heads",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cBeing bald is sexy. It\u2019s an attitude. It\u2019s a luxury. It\u2019s a lifestyle.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s how Brennan Nevada Johnson, who shaved her head voluntarily 14 years ago, opens the video podcast she launched last November to celebrate the advantages of choosing a bald look.",
      "Sensuous, self-assured and glamorous are not the adjectives typically assigned to women with shorn hair. For centuries, many cultures have viewed long hair as a symbol of femininity, health and fertility. But more women are defying that traditional beauty standard and finding empowerment by baring their heads.",
      "\u201cOnce you do it, it brings all this confidence into your life,\u201d Johnson, 34, said. \u201cWhenever you see someone who\u2019s bald and not wearing a wig, just know that they have fully embraced themselves, and I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s really challenging to do.\"",
      "Her initial decision to go baldheaded was practical. Johnson played competitive volleyball in college and found the sweating she did on the court affected the expensive hair relaxing treatments she often had done. Once she started shaving off her hair, though, she was hooked. She was relieved to save money on salon trips.",
      "Johnson now owns a New York public relations firm. \u201cBald and Buzzed with Brennan,\u201d the video podcast she posts on YouTube, was an attempt to fill a void in social media content that affirmed bald people, especially women. She says she always thought baldness was sexy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such a fashion statement, and it\u2019s a really powerful look,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Other women without hair, whether voluntarily or due to medical conditions, also have sought ways to support each other, attending conferences, joining \u201cbaldie\u201d groups and swapping grooming and scalp care tips.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a whole community of us out there,\u201d said Dash Lopez, a content creator who posts a weekly video series of her shaving routine called \u201cFresh Cut Friday.\u201d \u201cWe need to talk about it because we do find comfort and empowerment and beauty in what some people think is weird.\u201d",
      "Lopez said members of her family praised the long curly hair she had growing up. Some of her friends played with different hair colors and styles, but Lopez said she didn't have the same freedom. And she didn't enjoy detangling her hair or spending long afternoons at the salon.",
      "As soon as she turned 18 and could get a haircut without permission, she chopped her locks into a pixie cut. Then she shaved it all off during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cIt makes me feel powerful in the sense that I\u2019m able to detach from the things that people place so much emphasis on,\u201d Lopez, 29, said. \u201cI\u2019m not sitting here planning, \u2018Oh my gosh, when am I going to get my next color appointment done? That\u2019s gonna cost me $300. Oh my gosh. I\u2019ve got to get my hair done before I go to this event.\u2019\u201d",
      "Lopez signed a contract with a modeling agency in 2020, a time when brands wanted to showcase diversity, she said. Back then, being bald worked for her professionally.",
      "\u201cThere was an appreciation for quirks and if you had a gap in your tooth, if you had a bald head, if you had a face full of freckles, that\u2019s what casting directors were looking for,\u201d Lopez said.",
      "She noticed the tide shifting last year, when her bookings for modeling jobs decreased. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, the odds were stacked against me in the modeling world,\" Lopez said. \"I was 5\u2032 4\u2033, 5\u2032 5\u2033 on paper, no hair.\u201d",
      "A client suggested she wear wigs to land more work. Lopez did not want to do that or grow out her hair. Her modeling contract ended. Since then, she has shared glimpses of her life as a bald woman on Instagram and TikTok, where some of her videos have been watched millions of times.",

      "Felicia Flores, a flight attendant who lives in Atlanta, was diagnosed in 2001 with alopecia, an autoimmune disorder that causes hair to fall out. Six years later, all her hair was gone. Initially, she wore wigs.",
      "Then she came across a group called The Baldie Movement on Facebook. \u201cThe ladies just really inspired me,\u201d Flores, 47, said. \u201cThey really did help to encourage me and give me strength, ... and they were just so confident.\u201d",
      "She eventually decided to stop wearing wigs and embrace being bald in 2015, after a romantic breakup. \u201cI was tired of lying. I felt like I was hiding something. I felt like I wasn\u2019t myself,\u201d she said.",
      "To help uplift and inspire other women, Flores founded an annual conference called Baldie Con. The fourth one drew drew more than 200 attendees to Atlanta last month for a fashion show, guest speakers, a jazz brunch and a black tie gala, she said.",
      "Aicha Soumaoro, who works in Philadelphia as a nurse on weekdays and as a mechanic on weekends, said some of her patients call her \u201csir\u201d instead of \u201cma\u2019am,\u201d but she doesn\u2019t let it bother her. \u201cIt\u2019s new to them, girls that are bald.\u201d",
      "Soumaoro, 27, said that after she shaved her head, her mother told her that most men wouldn't want to marry a woman with no hair. She focuses instead on the compliments she's received while out in public, including \u201cYou wear it with confidence\u201d and \u201cYour face is gorgeous.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeing bald, it\u2019s like a boost of confidence out of nowhere,\u201d said Soumaoro, who cuts her hair every Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s like a new skin, a new layer, a new personality. I just feel fresh. Like I was born again.\u201d",
      "She also hikes on Sundays, savoring the feeling of cold breezes on her scalp. \u201cHaving that connection with Earth, it feels amazing,\u201d Soumaoro said. \u201cI feel like I can hear everything more clearly. It\u2019s like I have a clear mindset when my head is bald.\u201d",
      "Tiffany Michael Thomas, an Atlanta-based performer who goes by the stage name Amor Lauren, shaved her head in a show of support when her mother was undergoing treatment for pancreatic cancer.",
      "After her mother died, Thomas continued receiving compliments from other women. She decided to keep the bald look.",
      "\u201cOnce I began to really embrace it, it just made me feel like I was unstoppable,\u201d Thomas, 37, said. \"There\u2019s nothing that I have to hide behind anymore. ... It forced me to deal with all of my insecurities.\u201d",
      "If you\u2019re thinking about shaving your head, don\u2019t hesitate, Thomas advises. Women tell her they\u2019re concerned that their head isn\u2019t the right shape, or they have a lump or a scar. \u201cDo it without thought,\u201d she said. \u201cDo it scared. Everything in life, just do it scared. The best way to get through that fear is to actually do it.\u201d",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Saudi Arabia appointed a prominent ultraconservative scholar late Wednesday as the country's new grand mufti, the kingdom's top religious scholar.",
      "Sheikh Saleh bin Fawzan al-Fawzan, 90, took over the position, the state-run Saudi Press Agency reported. The decision came from King Salman, based on the recommendation of his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the report added.",
      "Sheikh Saleh, reportedly born Sept. 28, 1935, in Saudi Arabia's al-Qassim province, studied the Quran with a local imam after his father's death. He became a prominent scholar, speaking to the faithful via the \u201cNoor ala al-Darb,\u201d or \u201cLight the Way,\u201d radio show and via multiple books he's authored and his television appearances. His fatwas, or religious orders, have been shared via social media as well.",
      "Sheikh Saleh has faced criticism in Western media in the past for some of his pronouncements. Human Rights Watch in 2017 reported Sheikh Saleh, when asked if Sunni Muslims should view Shiite as their \u201cbrothers,\u201d responded: \"They are brothers of Satan.\"",
      "The Shiite \u201clie about God, his prophet, and the consensus of Muslims \u2026 There is no doubt about the unbelief of these\u201d people, Human Rights Watch separately quoted Sheikh Saleh saying at another moment.",
      "Such comments about the Shiite from religious leaders in Saudi Arabia are common, particularly amid political tensions between the kingdom and Iran. Sheikh Saleh also criticized Yemen's Houthi rebels for firing missiles toward holy sites in the kingdom.",
      "In 2003, Sheikh Saleh was quoted as saying: \u201cSlavery is a part of Islam. Slavery is part of jihad, and jihad will remain as long as there is Islam.\u201d",

Sheikh Mohammed's ultraconservative teachings of Islam in the 18th century, widely referred to as \u201cWahhabism\u201d in his name, had guided the kingdom for decades, particularly after the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran saw the kingdom grow even more conservative.",
      "The grand mufti is one of the top Islamic clerics in the world of Sunni Muslims. Saudi Arabia, home to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, hosts the annual Hajj pilgrimage required of all able-bodied Muslims once in their lives, making the pronouncements of the grand mufti that much more closely followed.",

    "story": [
      "Last week\u2019s military coup in Madagascar followed weeks of protests by youth angry about a lack of opportunity, poverty, and regular power and water cutoffs in the sprawling African island nation",
      "ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar -- ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) \u2014 For Donah Falia and the other young people whose weeks of protests paved the way for Madagascar\u2019s military coup last week, the change at the top has brought no immediate relief to their lives.",
      "The 20-year-old accounting student still has to wait in line for hours to get water from a tank in his neighborhood on the outskirts of the capital, Antananarivo, because the taps at home generally only work at night, and sometimes not even then. The job market is just as dry.",
      "\u201cFor us, personally, there is no answer here yet. I still don\u2019t see any hope for us,\u201d Falia told The Associated Press the day after Col. Michael Randrianirina was sworn in as president.",
      "Randrianirina\u2019s ousting of the democratically elected president, Andry Rajoelina, and decision to install himself as the new head of state followed a playbook that Madagascar's roughly 30 million people have become all too familiar with since the 1960 end of French colonial rule and one that has been used in several other African countries in recent years.",
      "Madagascans largely celebrated the overthrow of the old regime, as they did when Rajoelina first came to power as a transitional leader in a 2009 military coup. But the young protesters, whose anger and sacrifices over Madagascar's high unemployment, poverty, and utility outages made the conditions ripe for a coup, can now only hope their lives will improve under the new leader and that he\u2019ll eventually make good on his promise to cede power to a civilian government.",
      "The protests, which began in September and were largely leaderless, brought thousands into the streets in several cities and initially sparked a harsh crackdown by security forces that left 22 people dead and more than 100 injured, according to the United Nations. The government at the time disputed those figures.",
      "When Randrianirina\u2019s politically powerful CAPSAT unit sided with the demonstrators earlier this month, Rajoelina realized he had lost a power struggle and fled the country, declaring the coup illegal.",
      "The protesters, who rallied around images of the same \u201cOne Piece\u201d Jolly Roger that has featured in so-called Gen Z protests elsewhere in the world, welcomed the military overthrow, cheering on Randrianirina as he declared he was now in charge. They said getting rid of the old government was their top priority and took heart in how Randrianirina emphasized their importance, telling the nation after being sworn in, \u201cWe must take the opinion of the youth to the politicians and all the power groups.\u201d",
      "Tsantsa Fiderana Rakotoarison, a 22-year-old student and protester, said he was hopeful that protesters would continue to be heard.",
      "\u201cEven though the CAPSAT group took responsibility after the whole change, they know that young people are able to speak up again,\" he said.",
      "Falia said he was grateful to the military for helping topple Rajoelina, but that protesters had hoped that with Rajoelina gone, the people would get to choose their new leader.",
      "If successful military coups in five African nations since 2020 are anything to go on, Randrianirina won\u2019t be leaving office anytime soon, even if Madagascar holds elections within two years, as he said would happen. In all five of those countries \u2014 Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Gabon and Niger \u2014 the man who led the overthrow of the government is still in charge.",
      "\u201cThis same army unit played a crucial role in regime change in 2009 and now says it is in command of all the armed forces,\" Kaajal Ramjathan-Keogh, a policing and military interventions expert with the human rights think tank the International Commission of Jurists, said in an email. \"... It is likely that they will try to remain in place for as long as they can.\u201d",

      "JOHANNESBURG -- JOHANNESBURG (AP) \u2014 A Pretoria High Court on Wednesday ordered former South African President Jacob Zuma to pay back the Office of the State Attorney 28.9 million rand (about $1.6 million) for the legal fees incurred over the years in his private litigation, including interest.",
      "Judge Anthony Millar set a 60-day deadline for Zuma to pay the debt, stipulating that the state attorney could seize his assets \u2014 including his presidential pension benefit \u2014 if he defaulted.",
      "Zuma, who served as the president of South Africa from 2009 to 2018, has been embroiled in various litigations, primarily revolving around corruption charges and allegations of using public funds to evade accountability.",
      "While Zuma's legal fees were initially covered by the State coffers, previous rulings \u2014 from the Gauteng High Court in December 2018 and the Supreme Court of Appeal in April 2021 \u2014 made it plain that the taxpayer money used for his private representation had to be reimbursed.",
      "Court documents show that interest on about 18.9 million rand (about $1 million) is due from January 25, 2024, until the date of payment.",
      "In 2021, Zuma served two months in prison for contempt of court after defying a judicial order to testify at an inquiry probing corruption during his presidency. Additionally, he faces charges of corruption, racketeering, fraud, tax evasion and money laundering in relation to a multi-billion-dollar arms deal the South African government signed with a French arms manufacturer in 1999, when he was an influential politician.",

      "KAFR MARIS, Syria -- KAFR MARIS, Syria (AP) \u2014 The small Druze minority in Syria\u2019s northern Idlib province was shaken by an apparently targeted shooting that killed three members of their community this week.",
      "The attack came in the wake of clashes in another area of Syria months earlier in which Druze communities were targeted, and amid heightened sectarian tensions and calls by some Druze groups for secession.",
      "No group claimed responsibility for the attack in Idlib Tuesday evening, in which unidentified gunmen on motorcycles opened fire on a van near the Druze village of Kafr Maris, killing two women and a man.",
      "Idlib is a Sunni-majority province that was the birthplace of the Islamist former insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which led last year\u2019s offensive that unseated Syria\u2019s former autocratic leader, President Bashar Assad. Former HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa is now the country\u2019s interim president.",
      "At the funeral Wednesday for the victims, one of their uncles, Rafiq Ahmad, said the Druze in Idlib had in recent months faced false accusations of being affiliated with Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri, a Druze spiritual and political leader in the southern Sweida province with affiliated militias that have clashed with pro-government forces.",
      "Ahmad said his nephew and nieces had taken the van to a dentist appointment in a neighboring town Tuesday and were returning when the gunmen opened fire on them.",
      "\u201cIf they had wanted to rob the van they would have made a checkpoint and stopped it to rob it, but they intended to kill and to intimidate and scare the people here and maybe to make them leave this country,\u201d he said.",
      "Ahmad said there had also been recent incidents of robbery and intimidation and that olive farmers in the area were afraid to go to their orchards. He called on the state to arrest the killers and to put checkpoints around the Druze villages for their protection.",
      "Abdelrahman Ghazal, a local government official, said authorities are \u201ctaking the necessary procedures\u201d to identify and prosecute the perpetrators of the deadly shooting, and are installing more checkpoints and security cameras in the area.",
      "\u201cAs we all know, the purpose of this wicked criminal act is to undermine civil peace in the region,\u201d he said.",
      "There had been previous attacks on Druze communities in Idlib during the civil war, including one in 2015 in which militants with al-Nusra Front - the predecessor of HTS - killed at least 20 Druze villagers. Islamist militants also forced hundreds of members of the sect, whom they consider to be heretics, to covert to Sunni Islam.",

The number is now believed to have decreased by as much as two thirds.",
      "During the civil war, Ahmad said, when Syrian and Russian military planes would strike neighboring Sunni villages affiliated with the opposition to Assad, \u201cwe used to open up our houses and welcome them and their wives and children,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWe hope that the state will control these matters so we can all live as family and brothers with no one saying, \u2018This one is a Muslim, this one is Druze, this one is Shiite, this one is Armenian,\u2019\u201d Ahmad said. \u201cOur ancestors have lived here for a long time.\u201d",

      "The Vatican is expected to soon announce that it will return a few dozen artifacts sought by Indigenous communities in Canada",
      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 The Vatican is expected to soon announce that it will return a few dozen artifacts sought by Indigenous communities in Canada as part of its reckoning with the Catholic Church\u2019s troubled role in helping suppress Indigenous culture in the Americas, officials said Wednesday.",
      "The items, including an Inuit kayak, are part of the Vatican Museum\u2019s ethnographic collection, known as the Anima Mundi museum. The collection has been a source of controversy for the Vatican amid the broader museum debate over the restitution of cultural artifacts taken from Indigenous peoples during colonial periods.",
      "Negotiations on returning the Vatican items accelerated after Pope Francis in 2022 met with Indigenous leaders who had traveled to the Vatican to receive his apology for the church's role in Canada's disastrous residential schools. During their visit, they were shown some objects in the collection, including wampum belts, war clubs and masks, and asked for them to be returned.",
      "Francis later said he was in favor of returning the items and others in the Vatican collection on a case-by-case basis, saying: \u201cIn the case where you can return things, where it\u2019s necessary to make a gesture, better to do it.\u201d",
      "The Canadian Catholic Conference of Bishops said Wednesday it has been working with Indigenous groups on returning the items to their \u201coriginating communities.\u201d It said it expected the Holy See to announce the return. Vatican and Canadian officials said they expected an announcement in the coming weeks, and that the items could arrive on Canadian soil before the end of the year.",
      "The Globe and Mail newspaper first reported on the progress in the restitution negotiations.",
      "Most of the items in the Vatican collection were sent to Rome by Catholic missionaries for a 1925 exhibition in the Vatican gardens that was a highlight of that year\u2019s Holy Year.",
      "The Vatican insists the items were \u201cgifts\u201d to Pope Pius XI, who wanted to celebrate the church\u2019s global reach, its missionaries and the lives of the Indigenous peoples they evangelized.",
      "But historians, Indigenous groups and experts have long questioned whether the items could really have been offered freely, given the power imbalances at play in Catholic missions at the time. In those years, Catholic religious orders were helping to enforce the Canadian government\u2019s policy of eliminating Indigenous traditions, which Canada\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission has called \u201ccultural genocide.\u201d",
      "The return of the items will follow the \u201cchurch-to-church\u201d model the Vatican used in 2023, when it gave its Parthenon Marbles to the Orthodox Christian Church in Greece. The three fragments were described by the Vatican as a \u201cdonation\u201d to the Orthodox church, not a state-to-state repatriation to the Greek government.",
      "In this case, the Vatican is expected to hand over the items to the Canadian bishops conference, with the explicit understanding that the ultimate keepers will be the Indigenous communities, a Canadian official said Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the negotiations are not concluded.",

      "The official declined to say how many items were under negotiation or who decided what would be returned, but said the total numbered \u201ca few dozen.\u201d",
      "The aim is to get the items back this year, the official said, noting the 2025 Jubilee celebrating hope, and the centenary of the 1925 Holy Year that was the reason for the items to be brought to Rome in the first place.",
      "The 1925 exhibit is now so controversial that its 100th anniversary has been virtually ignored by the Vatican, which celebrates a lot of anniversaries.",
      "The Assembly of First Nations said some logistical issues need to be finalized before the objects can be returned, including establishing protocols.",
      "\u201cFor First Nations, these items are not artifacts. They are living, sacred pieces of our cultures and ceremonies and must be treated as the invaluable objects that they are,\u201d National Chief Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak told Canadian Press.",

      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) \u2014 Hungary's two main political parties will mark a national holiday on Thursday by holding rival demonstrations that will likely bring hundreds of thousands to the streets and kick off a campaign for elections next year.",
      "With the ballot approaching in April, long-serving Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n \u2014 trailing in most polls to his main political rival, P\u00e9ter Magyar \u2014 hopes to use Thursday's show of force to reinvigorate his base that has had its confidence shaken by a series of political scandals and years of high prices and economic stagnation.",
      "Magyar, a onetime insider within Orb\u00e1n's Fidesz party who erupted onto Hungary\u2019s political scene last year, aims to channel a growing number of dissatisfied voters into what will be both a political rally and anti-government protest. Observers of Thursday's events will be watching the size and enthusiasm of the crowds as a barometer for which way the needle is tilting within the country\u2019s polarized political climate.",
      "Thursday's marches, which will culminate with speeches by Orb\u00e1n and Magyar, coincide with the 69th anniversary of Hungary's failed 1956 anti-Soviet uprising. The date has long been a sobering reminder of Moscow's domination of Hungary during the Cold War, but Orb\u00e1n's warm relations with the Kremlin and combative approach toward Ukraine have in recent years transformed the country's posture toward its former occupier.",
      "That alignment was underscored last week when U.S. President Donald Trump announced he would meet in Budapest with Russia's Vladimir Putin for talks on ending the war in Ukraine. Orb\u00e1n, a close Trump ally, celebrated the move as a personal political achievement, and said Hungary was \u201cthe only place in Europe\u201d such talks could be held.",
      "Yet Orb\u00e1n will go into Thursday's demonstrations with a sense of deflation after the White House announced Tuesday that the planned meeting will not go forward, at least not for now. His supporters will still hold what's been billed as a \u201cpeace march,\u201d and his speech is expected to focus on what he argues are the dangers posed by Ukraine and the need to negotiate with Moscow.",
      "Many Hungarians, however, viewed the prospect of Putin\u2019s visit as carrying dark historical echoes. Hosting the Russian leader so near the anniversary of the 1956 uprising \u2014 crushed by Soviet tanks \u2014 struck some as another example of Orb\u00e1n's drift into Russia's orbit. One group planned to protest the visit, calling it \u201cnot diplomacy, not neutrality, but a national disgrace.\u201d",
      "Since Magyar's arrival on Hungary's political stage, Orb\u00e1n's anti-EU government has engaged its massive media machine to smear and discredit him, portraying him as a puppet controlled by bureaucrats in Brussels. The Hungarian leader has also accused his political rival, without providing evidence, of working with Ukrainian secret services to topple his government.",
      "Fidesz officials have posted and shared dozens of AI-generated videos depicting Magyar in various fabricated scenarios, while a taxpayer-funded \u201cnational consultation\u201d questionnaire has been mailed to every Hungarian adult, insinuating that Tisza plans to impose disastrous tax hikes on Hungarian families.",

      "Orb\u00e1n's sinking popularity has coincided with growing accusations of corruption and the increasing visibility of opulent lifestyles enjoyed by government-connected figures. Magyar has regularly accused Orb\u00e1n and his allies of misusing public funds for their own enrichment, allegations Orb\u00e1n denies.",

      "Ukraine's state security service has unveiled an upgraded sea drone that can operate anywhere in the Black Sea",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Ukraine's state security service has unveiled an upgraded sea drone it says can now operate anywhere in the Black Sea, carry heavier weapons and use artificial intelligence for targeting.",
      "Ukraine has used the unmanned naval drones to target Russian shipping and infrastructure in the Black Sea. The Security Service of Ukraine, known by its Ukrainian acronym SBU, has credited strikes by the unmanned vessel known as the \u201c Sea Baby\" with forcing a strategic shift in Russia\u2019s naval operations.",
      "The range of the Sea Baby was expanded from 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) to 1,500 kilometers (930 miles), SBU said. It can carry up to 2,000 kilograms (about 4,400 pounds) of payload, SBU officials said.",
      "At a demonstration attended by The Associated Press, variants included vessels fitted with a multiple-rocket launcher and another with a stabilized machine-gun turret.",
      "SBU Brig. Gen. Ivan Lukashevych said the new vessels also feature AI-assisted friend-or-foe targeting systems and can launch small aerial attack drones and multilayered self-destruct systems to prevent capture.",
      "Drone strikes have been used in successful attacks against 11 Russian vessels, including frigates and missile carriers, SBU said, prompting the Russian navy to relocate its main base from Sevastopol in Crimea to Novorossiysk on Russia\u2019s Black Sea coast.",
      "\u201cThe SBU became the first in the world to pioneer this new kind of naval warfare \u2014 and we continue to advance it,\u201d Lukashevych said, adding that the Sea Baby has evolved from a single-use strike craft into a reusable, multipurpose platform that expands Ukraine\u2019s offensive options.",
      "Authorities asked that the time and location of the demonstration not be made public for security reasons.",
      "The craft are operated remotely from a mobile control center inside a van, where operators use a bank of screens and controls.",
      "\u201cCohesion of the crew members is probably the most important thing. We are constantly working on that,\u201d said one operator who was identified only by his call sign, \u201cScout,\" per Ukrainian military protocol.",
      "The SBU also said sea drones helped carry out other high-profile strikes, including repeated attacks on the Crimean Bridge, most recently targeting its underwater supports in a bid to to render it unusable for heavy military transport.",

      "Roberto Mosquera del Peral was one of five men sent to the small kingdom in southern Africa in mid-July as part of the expanding U.S. deportation program to Africa, which has been criticized by rights groups and lawyers, who say deportees are being denied due process and exposed to rights abuses.",

      "\u201cMy client is arbitrarily detained, and now his life is on the line,\u201d said David. \u201cI urge the Eswatini Correctional Services to provide Mr. Mosquera\u2019s family and me with an immediate update on his condition and to ensure that he is receiving adequate medical attention. I demand that Mr. Mosquera be permitted to meet with his lawyer in Eswatini.\u201d",
      "Mosquera was among a group of five men from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos, Vietnam and Yemen deported to Eswatini, an absolute monarchy ruled by a king who is accused of clamping down on human rights. The Jamaican man was repatriated to his home country last month, but the others have been kept at the prison for more than three months while an Eswatini-based lawyer has launched a case against the government demanding they be given access to legal counsel.",

They have expressed concern that they know little about the conditions in which their clients are being held.",

      "Their opposing views sum up two of the key issues in campaigning for the Oct. 29 election for all 150 seats in the Dutch parliament's legislative House of Representatives. They also echo debates about migration across Europe as right-wing politics gain support.",
      "Far-right, anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders ' Party for Freedom, known by its Dutch acronym PVV, swept to a shock victory in 2023 on a pledge to drastically rein in migration. He triggered the downfall of the subsequent four-party coalition government in June by withdrawing his lawmakers from the Cabinet in a dispute over implementing his crackdown.",
      "This time around, Wilders\u2019 campaign pledge is a \u201ctotal halt\u201d to asylum-seekers. An analysis of parties\u2019 election manifestos by the Dutch Order of Lawyers said that such a policy would be a breach of international treaties.",
      "\u201cWe have too many foreigners, too many asylum-seekers, too much Islam and far too many asylum-seeker centers,\u201d Wilders\u2019 manifesto says. What he casts as the \u201dopen-borders policy\u201d of his political rivals \u201cis totally destroying our country.\u201d",
      "Wilders' party leads polls as the voting day nears, but even if he manages to win again, he is unlikely to manage to piece together a coalition, because many other mainstream parties have ruled out working with him. Other more mainstream parties also have included moves to cut migration in their manifestos as the issue cuts across political fault lines.",
      "Violent protests against new asylum-seeker centers have broken out in recent months in towns and villages across the Netherlands, with protesters lighting flares and sometimes waving a tricolor flag that was adopted by Dutch Nazi sympathizers around World War II. Wilders says he's opposed to violence.",

She fled the Afghan capital, Kabul, as a child and eventually settled in this historic city close to Amsterdam.

But its theocracy so far hasn't taken any major action to halt the slide, restart crucial nuclear negotiations with the West nor fully prepare for possible further hostilities with Israel and the United States.",

Now, however, concern is growing that patience has slipped into paralysis as Iran's partners in its self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d have been devastated and there's no overt sign of materiel support from either China or Russia.",

      "The United Nations reimposed sanctions on Iran last month, but Tehran has sought to downplay their effect or even insist they don't exist. The sanctions date from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal and were reimposed by a mechanism known to diplomats as \u201csnapback.\u201d China, Iran and Russia issued a tripartite statement over the weekend, decrying them as \u201clegally and procedurally flawed.\u201d",
      "But while China and Russia have signaled they won't enforce the sanctions, the U.S., European nations and others are.",
      "Some of the measures are pretty out of date \u2014 for instance, sanctions on Iranian Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad during President Donald Trump's first term in 2020.",
      "But the main ones squeeze Iran's Central Bank and its oil exports, one of the few sources of hard currency for the government. That could allow for the seizure of Iranian crude oil shipments on the seas, something that in the past has sparked confrontations with Tehran.",
      "The June war saw Israel kill top leadership in Iran's regular military and its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, a force answerable only to Khamenei that controls its own arsenal of ballistic missiles. In the time since, Iran has held no major military parades and conducted only limited drills at sea \u2014 likely out of the concern of providing Israel with any tempting targets.",
      "Criticism is slowly rising to the surface of Iran's theocracy, which under Khamenei has grown into various competing camps and agencies often tasked with the same missions.",
      "Ali Shamkhani, a top adviser to Khamenei who survived an Israeli attack targeting him during the war, said in an online video that Iran's earlier attacks against Israel in 2024 \u201cdid not achieve the outcomes\u201d sought by Tehran \u2014 a rare acknowledgment by a senior official of the low accuracy plaguing the theocracy's vaunted missile arsenal.",
      "He also even went as far as to openly muse about Iran pursuing a nuclear weapon \u2014 something Tehran long has insisted it doesn't want to do despite the West and the International Atomic Energy Agency saying the Islamic Republic had an organized weapons program up until 2003.",
      "\"Now that it has become clear, Iran should have developed this capability for itself,\u201d Shamkhani said.",
      "After the interview, Shamkhani found himself targeted by the leak of a video from his daughter's wedding, in which she was unveiled and wearing a wedding dress with a plunging neckline \u2014 something criticized by hard-liners who have been calling for a new campaign targeting women over the mandatory hijab, or headscarf.",

      "A longtime critic of Georgia Power is under arrest for allegedly stealing confidential information from Georgia Power",
      "ATLANTA -- ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 A vocal critic of Georgia Power Co. was arrested Tuesday on felony charges that allege she swiped the company's confidential information from a desk during a break in a regulatory hearing.",
      "Georgia Capitol Police arrested Patty Durand of Mableton, Georgia, and charged her with felony theft of trade secrets, booking her into the Fulton County Jail. Online records showed Durand remained jailed on Wednesday afternoon with no bail set and she didn't immediately respond to a text message seeking comment.",
      "The law carries penalties of between one and five years in prison and a fine of up to $50,000.",
      "Durand sought to run for Public Service Commission as a Democrat in 2022, but the election was never held because of litigation over whether statewide elections were racially discriminatory. After that, Durand founded Georgians for Affordable Energy to carry on with her advocacy against Georgia Power, the state's only privately owned electric utility. The company, with 2.3 million customers, is the largest subsidiary of Atlanta-based Southern Co.",
      "Durand has long complained that too much information is kept private through trade secret designations in proceedings before the Georgia Public Service Commission, which regulates Georgia Power's rates and must give approval before the utility can build new power plants or transmission lines. The utility says releasing that information could put it at an economic disadvantage.",
      "\u201cThe lack of transparency with this commission the worst in the country with heavy redactions and trade secret designations on nearly everything,\u201d Durand wrote in an email to The Associated Press in December 2024.",

After that, as the commission broke for lunch, a warrant alleges that Durand was captured on video looking at a booklet labeled \u201cGeorgia Power Trade Secrets.\u201d",
      "The warrant alleges that Durand set the booklet down, then went to a second desk with the same booklet, put it in her purse and left the meeting room.",
      "It's unclear who discovered the booklet was missing or called Capitol Police, who provide security at the state Capitol and in adjoining office buildings. Tom Krause, a spokesperson for the Public Service Commission, said the commission didn't file a report or ask for an arrest, saying only \u201cthis is a matter for law enforcement.\u201d",
      "Matthew Kent, a spokesperson for Georgia Power, said the company is \u201ccooperating with law enforcement,\u201d but declined to comment further or say whether the utility had asked for Durand's arrest.",
      "\u201cTheft or exposure of proprietary information is a serious matter,\u201d Kent said in a statement. \u201cWhile we operate transparently, some data must remain confidential to protect customer interests and ensure we deliver the best value to all customers.\u201d",

      "Gold futures in New York closed at a record $4,374 per troy ounce on Monday, before falling more than $250 (or 5.74%) Tuesday. That's the largest, single-day percentage drop seen since September 2011, according to data in FactSet. And despite some brief rebounds, losses continued to pile up Wednesday \u2014 with gold futures trading at about $4,036 as of 11 a.m. ET.",
      "Prices are still up since the start of 2025. Gold sales often rise sharply amid wider economic uncertainty, as anxious investors seek a \u201csafe haven\u201d for their money. More have turned to gold amid President Donald Trump's barrage of tariffs on imports from around the world, rising concerns about inflation and the now weekslong U.S. government shutdown. And even before that, geopolitical tensions and strong demand from central banks bolstered gold's gains over recent years.",
      "But precious metals can be volatile \u2014 so it's not uncommon for gold to see day-to-day fluctuations in value. Some analysts say this week's pullback was triggered by hopes of cooling trade tensions between the U.S. and China, for example. Meanwhile, criticism had already been growing that gold\u2019s price had gone too far, too fast. Others speculate there could be broader correction.",
      "Here's what we know.",
      "Again, gold futures were trading at $4,036 per troy ounce \u2014 the standard for measuring precious metals \u2014 as of as of 11 a.m. ET. Wednesday. Spot prices had previously closed Tuesday at just over $4,125, down from a record more than $4,355 on Monday.",
      "Silver also saw some losses this week. Silver futures in New York fell more than 7% on Tuesday, before seeing slight rebounds Wednesday morning. Prices were trading at $47.60 per troy ounce as of 11 a.m. ET, down from a record $53.44 hit last week.",
      "No investment's price consistently goes up forever, and some fluctuation isn't surprising after such meteoric rises.",
      "\u201cWhy precious metals sold off yesterday \u2014 and whether this is the beginning of a broader correction \u2014 remains to be seen,\u201d Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote wrote in a Wednesday note.",
      "Ozkardeskaya said Tuesday's losses were \u201ctriggered by hopes of easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China and a rebound in the U.S. dollar.\u201d Still, she noted that the future is far from guaranteed, and many of the same factors that drew buyers to gold this year remain. \u201cWhat probably better explained yesterday\u2019s precious metals sell-off was mainly the fact that the metals are now trading in deeply overbought market conditions with heightened volatility,\" she added, noting that further price pullback is possible.",
      "Again, despite this week's losses, gold futures are still up 50% overall since the start of 2025. And silver has climbed even higher, up 60% year to date.",

Some also take comfort in buying something tangible that has the potential to increase in value over time.",
      "Still, experts caution against putting all your eggs in one basket. Not everyone agrees gold is a good investment.

      "The Commodity Futures Trade Commission has previously warned people to be wary of investing in gold. Precious metals can be highly volatile, and prices rise as demand goes up \u2014 meaning \u201cwhen economic anxiety or instability is high, the people who typically profit from precious metals are the sellers,\u201d the commission noted.",

But it pollutes water, accumulates in fish, makes its way into food and builds up in people\u2019s bodies, leading to neurological and developmental harm.

Some ends up in informal scrapyards, where workers burn or dismantle devices by hand, often without protection, releasing toxic fumes and scrap.",
      "About 2,000 containers \u2014 roughly 33,000 metric tons (36,376 U.S. tons) \u2014 of used electronics leave U.S. ports every month, according to the report.

To ensure you don\u2019t miss out on the latest and greatest, the car experts at Edmunds highlight five vehicles you should consider waiting for.",
      "America\u2019s bestselling SUV is getting completely redesigned for the 2026 model year. Notably, the new RAV4 is going all-hybrid for 2026. Trust us, this is a good thing. The base RAV4 should get about 40 mpg for combined city/highway driving and produce a respectable 226 horsepower. Alternatively, you can get the RAV4 Plug-in Hybrid. It makes a sporty 320 horsepower and can drive an estimated 50 miles on all-electric power with a fully charged battery. Toyota has also modernized the RAV4\u2019s interior with a fresh design featuring large display screens and the brand\u2019s latest tech. The RAV4 will be available in several trim levels, including the outdoorsy RAV4 Woodland and the new sporty GR version.",

If the new styling isn\u2019t for you, the new interior likely will be. It\u2019s a big departure from the outgoing design. It\u2019s highlighted by a new infotainment system that has sharper-looking graphics and quicker responses to your touch. Unchanged, thankfully, is the Outback\u2019s impressive 8.7 inches of ground clearance that\u2019s helpful for wintertime travel and recreational off-roading.

Kia won\u2019t release official information on the next Telluride until late November, but we can get an idea of what to expect from the related Hyundai Palisade that has already been unveiled.

The new Prelude makes 200 horsepower, which is likely underwhelming for acceleration junkies. On the upside, however, the Prelude should get more than 40 mpg combined. It should also be fun to drive on twisty roads. Honda has given it a sophisticated suspension that should help the Prelude have sporty handling as well as a comfortable ride quality. The new Prelude has two small rear seats and a hatchback-style trunk, so it should be reasonably useful for everyday driving. Interestingly, Honda says there will be only one trim level of the Prelude and it will come fully loaded with features.",

The Rev has a large battery pack and two electric motors that provide an electric driving range of 145 miles and produce 647 horsepower. When the battery runs low, a V6 engine fires up and charges the battery, extending the total driving range to 690 miles. When the tank gets low, you can pump gas or charge the battery to hit the road again. The Rev touts an impressive towing capacity of 14,000 pounds and looks much like a regular Ram 1500 inside and out. We expect the hybrid Ram to hit the market sometime in 2026.",

      "In 2020, the tech firm MicroStrategy became the first DAT when it started accumulating bitcoin, the world\u2019s oldest and most popular cryptocurrency. Led by ultra bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor, the company\u2019s stock price has been one of the best performing in the past five years.",
      "The success of MicroStrategy, which has rebranded as Strategy, has spawned dozens of imitators. The first wave of crypto treasury companies focused on bitcoin while more recently companies have started buying large stakes in more niche and unproven forms of cryptocurrency.",
      "One reason DATs are booming is that buying and managing crypto holdings\u2014especially newer tokens\u2014can be daunting for newcomers.",
      "S.Y. Lee, founder of the crypto project Story, said even sophisticated investors hesitate to manage digital wallets. DATs make the process as simple as buying a stock.",

      "The 30-word statement says:",
      "\u201cWe call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.\u201d",
      "In a preamble, the letter notes that AI tools may bring health and prosperity, but alongside those tools, \"many leading AI companies have the stated goal of building superintelligence in the coming decade that can significantly outperform all humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. This has raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\u201d",
      "Prince Harry added in a personal note that \"the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.\u201d",
      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\u201cThis is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It\u2019s simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. Is that too much to ask?\u201d",

      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",

      "Confounding the broader debates is that the same companies that are striving toward what some call superintelligence and others call artificial general intelligence, or AGI, are also sometimes inflating the capabilities of their products, which can make them more marketable and have contributed to concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and AI scientists when its researcher claimed ChatGPT had figured out unsolved math problems \u2014 when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of stuff that\u2019s overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that \u2014 zooming out \u2014 AI has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,\u201d Tegmark said.",
      "Tegmark's group was also behind a March 2023 letter \u2014 still in the dawn of a commercial AI boom \u2014 that called on tech giants to pause the development of more powerful AI models temporarily. None of the major AI companies heeded that call. And the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, Elon Musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own AI startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.",
      "Asked if he reached out to Musk again this time, Tegmark said he wrote to the CEOs of all major AI developers in the U.S. but didn't expect them to sign.",
      "\u201cI really empathize for them, frankly, because they\u2019re so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,\u201d Tegmark said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the U.S. government just steps in.\u201d",

      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump \u2019s plan to cut record beef prices by importing more meat from Argentina is running into heated opposition from U.S. ranchers who are enjoying some rare profitable years and skepticism from experts who say the president\u2019s move probably wouldn\u2019t lead to cheaper prices at grocery stores.",
      "The National Cattlemen's Beef Association along with the Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund United Stockgrowers of America and other farming groups \u2014 who are normally some of the president's biggest supporters \u2014 all criticized Trump's idea because of what it could do to American ranchers and feedlot operators. And agricultural economists say Argentine beef accounts for such a small slice of beef imports \u2014 only about 2% \u2014 that even doubling that wouldn't change prices much.",
      "South Dakota rancher Brett Kenzy said he wants American consumers to determine whether beef is too expensive, not the government. And so far there is little sign that consumers are substituting chicken or other proteins for beef on their shopping lists even though the average price of a pound of ground beef hit its highest point ever at $6.32 in the latest report before the government shutdown began.",
      "\u201cI love \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 rhetoric. I love \u2018America First\u2019 rhetoric,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to me this feels a lot like the failed policies of the past \u2014 the free trade sourcing cheap global goods.\u201d",
      "Several factors have sent beef prices soaring, starting with continued strong demand combined with the smallest U.S. herd size since 1961. In part, that small herd is due to years of drought and low cattle prices.",
      "Beef imports also are down overall because of the 50% tariffs that Trump imposed on Brazil, a big beef exporter, and limits on Mexico, where the country is fighting a flesh-eating pest.",
      "Kansas State University agricultural economist Glynn Tonsor said Argentina can't produce enough beef to offset those other losses of imports.",
      "Through July, the United States has imported 72.5 million pounds of Argentine beef while producing more than 15 billion pounds of beef. Much of what is imported is lean beef trimmings that meatpackers mix with fattier beef produced in the United States to produce the varieties of ground beef that domestic consumers want, so any change in imports would affect primarily hamburger. Steak prices that were averaging $12.22 per pound probably wouldn't change much.",
      "Even if increased imports from Argentina won't reduce prices, the idea creates uncertainty for ranchers, making them less likely to invest in raising more cattle.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re always going to have uncertainty in the world. But the more uncertain something is, the less likely most are to put money on the line,\u201d Tonsor said.",
      "Argentine livestock producers like Augusto Wallace are excited about the prospect of selling more beef to America because he said \u201cwhenever an additional buyer comes, it's beneficial for everyone, right? For all the producers.\u201d",
      "But economists caution that exporting too much beef could backfire for Argentina because that would drive up prices for consumers there.",
      "American ranchers say the idea of boosting imports from Argentina runs counter to the stated purpose of Trump's tariffs to encourage more domestic production and help American ranchers compete.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a contradiction of what we believed his new course of action was. We thought he was on the right track,\" said the president of R-CALF, Bill Bullard, who hoped Trump's policies would discourage imports and encourage ranchers to expand their herds.",

      "Bryant Kagay, part owner of Kagay Farms in Amity, Missouri, said he thinks the plan would hurt ranchers.

      "Ranchers are hopeful Trump will reconsider this plan. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said Tuesday on CNBC that the administration remains committed to helping ranchers prosper while trying to reduce consumer prices. She promised more details soon about the Argentina plan and a larger effort to reinvigorate U.S. beef production by opening up more land and opening new processing plants while securing trade deals for new markets. The administration wants ranchers to raise more cattle and produce more beef.",
      "\u201cThe bigger supply \u2014 even aligned with a bigger demand \u2014 is going to allow those prices to come down, but also to have a vital industry for these ranchers to be able to survive, which is what we've got to do,\u201d Rollins said.",

      "By beating Toronto in the World Series that starts Friday night, Los Angeles would capture its third title in six years.",
      "\u201cJust winning one is hard,\u201d Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman said. \u201cIf you can get three in a matter of five, six years, I guess you could say it is one.

      "Baseball has no widely accepted definition.",
      "Most give pantheon status to the 1949-53 New York Yankees (five straight titles), the 1936-39 Yankees (four), the 1972-74 Oakland Athletics (three) and the 1998-2000 Yankees (three) \u2014 the last team to win consecutive championships. The Dodgers are the first defending champion to reach the World Series since the 2009 Philadelphia Phillies.",
      "\u201cIf I was broadcasting, I would not refer to them as a dynasty,\u201d Emmy-winning commentator Bob Costas said. \u201cYou can compare them to the Braves who won 14 divisions in a row but got to the World Series five times and lost it four of those five times.\u201d",
      "Yet he is willing to consider using the word because times have changed. The Dodgers have won 12 of the last 13 NL West titles and had 106 victories the year they finished second.",
      "\u201cThere has to be lines of demarcation once you go to wild cards and then especially once you expand the playoffs as they\u2019ve now been expanded,\u201d Costas said. \u201cIf you were really the best team over 162 or 154 (games) back in the day and you proved you were the best team, now you just got to win four out of seven.\u201d",
      "Mookie Betts, who has been with the Dodgers since 2020, said he's more concerned about preparing for games than contemplating the team's historical place.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking about going to the postseason and obviously having a chance to win World Serieses year after year, I guess that would kind of qualify as some type of dynasty, but I don\u2019t know what it takes to call it that,\u201d he said.",
      "Since the expansion era started, the only consecutive titles have been won by the 1961-62 Yankees, the mid-70s A's, the 1975-76 Cincinnati Reds, the 1977-78 Yankees, the 1992-93 Toronto Blue Jays and the late-century Yankees.",

Three straight WS appearances, rather than three straight titles, does it for me.\u201d",
      "Los Angeles won the title during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season and that year's expanded playoffs, then beat the Yankees in a five-game Series last year. Winning this year would for some make them comparable to the Yankees, who won four in seven years from 1956-62, and the Dodgers, who took three in seven seasons from 1959-65.",

      "FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) \u2014 Aaron Glenn knows who the New York Jets\u2019 starting quarterback will be at Cincinnati. But the coach, still looking for his first victory, isn't revealing his plan.",
      "\u201cWe'll have a quarterback on Sunday,\u201d Glenn said Wednesday. \u201cI will tell you that.\u201d",
      "Justin Fields was benched after another awful performance last Sunday and Tyrod Taylor played the second half of New York's 13-6 loss to Carolina.",
      "Glenn said Monday he would deliberate over his decision, a process that would include speaking to his staff and even talking to other coaches who have dealt with quarterback quandaries. He also said his call would come down to who he thought gives the Jets the best chance to win Sunday against the Bengals.",
      "And he doesn't want Cincinnati to know who that might be.",
      "\u201cI wouldn't want to give them a competitive advantage when I have that opportunity,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cBut we have a quarterback.\u201d",
      "Adding to the ambiguity of the situation, Glenn said Taylor is among several Jets players who'll be day to day at practice this week. Taylor is dealing with a knee ailment \u2014 \u201cIt's something that he had before,\u201d Glenn said.",

      "\u201cHe has the ability, but something just is not jiving,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe offense is just not clicking. And you can\u2019t run the ball if you can\u2019t pass the ball. That\u2019s Football 101.\u201d",

      "In that first season of NIL in 2021-22, the margin of victory was 18 points for the Big Ten, 15.7 points for both the SEC and Pac-12, 15.2 for the Big 12 and 14.1 for the Atlantic Coast Conference.",

      "But a European fan group praised the decision, and the Spanish government called for more transparency in any future negotiations to try to play a league game abroad.",
      "The Dec. 20 game at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was called off on Tuesday amid growing opposition from players, fans and some clubs. The league cited the \u201cuncertainty that has arisen in Spain over the past few weeks.\u201d",
      "Game promoter Relevent said it informed La Liga of the need to \u201cpostpone the planned match\u201d because there was \u201cinsufficient time to properly execute an event of this scale\u201d and that it would be \u201cirresponsible to begin selling tickets without a confirmed match in place.\u201d",
      "\u201cSpanish soccer has lost an opportunity to advance, project itself globally and strengthen its future,\u201d Tebas said on X on Wednesday. \u201cThe defense of \u2018tradition\u2019 is invoked from a narrow-minded and provincial perspective.\u201d",
      "UEFA's officially recognized fan liaison group Football Supporters Europe celebrated that \u201cLa Liga\u2019s tired idea to export a game to Miami has once again collapsed.\u201d",
      "\u201cCommon sense and the rules of the game have prevailed. This is a seismic victory for European football and everyone who believes the game belongs at the heart of our communities,\" the group said in a statement. \u201cLa Liga\u2019s defeat sends a clear message to the world of football: such ill-conceived projects are doomed to fail.

      "The Minnesota Supreme Court has delivered a win to transgender weightlifter JayCee Cooper, saying she\u2019s protected by the state\u2019s expansive human rights law",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The Minnesota Supreme Court on Wednesday delivered a win to a transgender weightlifter, saying she's protected by the state's expansive human rights law, while the organization that banned her from competing in its women's division said it still has a chance.",
      "The high court found that USA Powerlifting's policy that bars JayCee Cooper from competing in its women's division is \u201cfacially discriminatory\u201d under the Minnesota Human Rights Act. That law protects transgender individuals against discrimination based on sexual orientation.",
      "While the court sent part of the case back to a lower court to determine whether USA Powerlifting has a \u201clegitimate business purpose\u201d for excluding JayCee Cooper, her attorneys said they won on the most important legal claim and that further proceedings won't change the ultimate outcome.",
      "The LGBTQ+ rights group Gender Justice, which represents Cooper, claimed the ruling as a complete victory, noting that Cooper won on the issue of state law barring discrimination in a place of public accommodation. The group also said the ruling goes further and will protect all transgender people in Minnesota against discrimination.",
      "\u201cThat claim will not be unraveled,\u201d Gender Justice legal counsel Jess Braverman said.",
      "The justices noted that the law carves out a \u201clegitimate business purpose defense,\u201d and said there is a \u201cgenuine dispute of material fact\u201d on whether \u201cseeking to ensure competitive fairness in an athletic competition\u201d meets that test. So it sent the case back to the original trial court for further proceedings.",
      "But Braverman said they only needed to win on the public accommodations claim, which they did, and that the ruling still legally trumps USA Powerlifting's arguments.",
      "USA Powerlifting attorney Ansis Viksnins called it a mixed decision \u2014 a partial victory for both sides.",
      "\u201cOur opponents like to spin losses as victories and victories and victories, so I\u2019m not surprised that they are claiming this is a victory,\u201d Viksnins said in an interview.",
      "He said the ruling means they will get to tell a jury \u201cwhy excluding a transgender woman from competing in the women\u2019s division was for legitimate reasons, for maintaining fairness in athletics.\u201d And he said they'll get to argue that transgender women have an unfair strength advantage in powerlifting.",
      "But to win on the remaining issue, Braverman said, the courts would have to do so on an impossibly narrow track. She said the court left only a \u201creally narrow carve-out\u201d that doesn't leave much room for discrimination.",
      "USA Powerlifting rejected Cooper\u2019s application in 2018 to compete in its women\u2019s division. Cooper sued in 2021, and the trial court sided with her.",
      "But the Minnesota Court of Appeals sent the case back to the trial court, saying there were \u201cgenuine issues of fact\u201d about whether USA Powerlifting excluded Cooper because of her transgender identity and whether the organization had a \u201clegitimate business reason\u201d for doing so. Cooper then took the case to the state\u2019s highest court.",
      "The justices ordered that the trial court must now address whether USA Powerlifting has a defense, based on its claim \u201cthat fair competition opportunities for similarly situated athletes is a legitimate business reason, that its interpretation of fair play is based on unique considerations of powerlifting,\u201d and on evidence the group says shows that transgender women powerlifters enjoy strength advantages.",

      "Late last month, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration said the state of Minnesota and its governing body for high school sports are violating a key federal law against sex discrimination by allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls sports.",
      "The Minnesota Human Rights Act contains broad protections against discrimination, including on the basis of sex defined broadly, and was updated in 2023 when Democrats controlled the Legislature to specifically include gender identity.",

GOP Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth called the ruling \u201canother setback in the fight to protect girls sports,\u201d and said in a statement that GOP lawmakers will try to change the law in the 2026 legislative session. However, the House is now tied 67-67 between Republicans and Democrats, and Democrats only narrowly control the Senate, so nothing can pass without some bipartisan support.",
      "The No. 2 House GOP leader, Rep. Harry Niska, said Republicans saw the ruling coming, so they tried unsuccessfully to change the law earlier this year. They'll keep trying, he said.",
      "\u201cWhether intentional or not, this decision has sweeping implications that could effectively eliminate girls\u2019 sports in Minnesota unless we provide statutory clarification,\u201d Niska said in a statement.",

But it's also one of the busiest for parents as they try to keep track of their trick-or-treaters, give out candy and watch over their homes.",
      "Fortunately, there are some tech tricks out there that can help families stay safe this Halloween, and have a little more fun too.",

But don't think of these apps as basic.

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence has caused concern for its tremendous consumption of water and power",
      "Artificial intelligence has caused concern for its tremendous consumption of water and power. But scientists are also experimenting with ways that AI can help people and businesses use energy more efficiently and pollute less.",
      "Data centers needed to fuel AI accounted for about 1.5% of the world\u2019s electricity consumption last year, and those facilities' energy consumption is predicted to more than double by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. That increase could lead to burning more fossil fuels such as coal and gas, which release greenhouse gases that contribute to warming temperatures, sea level rise and extreme weather.",
      "But when AI's computing power is used to analyze energy usage and pollution, it can also make buildings more efficient, charge devices at optimal times, make oil and gas production less polluting and schedule traffic lights to reduce vehicle emissions.",
      "Experts say that if uses like these continue to grow, they could help offset the energy consumed by AI.",
      "\u201cI am pretty optimistic that while more and more AI use is going to continue to increase,\u201d said Alexis Abramson, dean of the Columbia University Climate School, \u201cwe\u2019re going to see our ability to process be much more efficient and as a result, the energy consumption won\u2019t go up as much as some are predicting.\u201d",
      "AI can be used to make buildings more energy-efficient by automatically adjusting lighting, ventilation, heating and cooling based on weather data, electricity usage and other factors, said Bob French, chief evangelist at the building automation company 75F. Around one-third of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution comes from homes and buildings.",
      "Letting AI schedule air conditioning and heating around workers' arrivals and departures can be more efficient than manually adjusting the thermostat. Otherwise, a worker's instinct might be to blast the air to quickly adjust the temperature. Automated thermostats can be particularly useful for smaller buildings where it's not cost-effective to overhaul the entire heating and cooling system.",
      "For building ventilation, automation can balance the intake of outside air against how much heating or cooling is needed to maintain indoor temperatures.",
      "AI can also monitor the maintenance needs of HVAC systems and other equipment to predict and detect failures before they lead to costlier repairs.",
      "Combined, these automations can reduce a building's energy consumption by between 10% and 30%, experts said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s literally a super low-hanging fruit,\" said Zoltan Nagy, professor of building services at Eindhoven University of Technology.",
      "AI can schedule the most efficient charging of electric vehicles and other devices such as smartphones.",
      "This means setting a schedule for when it is best to draw power from the grid, such as overnight, when demand and rates are lower so it\u2019s less likely to make the grid burn more fossil fuels.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s say it\u2019s a peak period when everybody\u2019s got their air conditioning on, and I walk in my house and I plug in my car and I have it set up such that my car doesn\u2019t start charging right away because it\u2019s peak period time,\u201d Abramson said.",
      "In California, a pilot program shifted charging to times where there was more renewable energy available, and saved customers money.",
      "AI can also help optimize how homeowners with solar panels store excess energy in batteries.",
      "Boston-based Geminus AI uses deep learning and advanced reasoning to help oil and gas companies reduce methane flaring and venting, and reduce the amount of energy they use in extracting and refining.",

Geminus does this in seconds. Traditionally it takes engineers about 36 hours to run simulations that make similar recommendations, Fallon added.",

      "\u201cAI is becoming the solution to its own energy problem,\u201d Hoiland, the CEO, said. \u201cIt's showing us a way to unlock resources that weren\u2019t possible without it.\u201d",
      "Last year, Zanskar purchased an underperforming geothermal power plant in New Mexico. Their AI modeling successfully indicated there was an untapped geothermal reservoir that could repower the facility.",

      "The letter, released Wednesday by a politically and geographically diverse group of public figures, is squarely aimed at tech giants like Google, OpenAI and Meta Platforms that are racing each other to build a form of artificial intelligence designed to surpass humans at many tasks.",
      "The 30-word statement says:",
      "\u201cWe call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.\u201d",
      "In a preamble, the letter notes that AI tools may bring health and prosperity, but alongside those tools, \"many leading AI companies have the stated goal of building superintelligence in the coming decade that can significantly outperform all humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. This has raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\u201d",
      "Prince Harry added in a personal note that \"the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.\u201d",
      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\u201cThis is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It\u2019s simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. Is that too much to ask?\u201d",
      "Also signing were AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, co-winners of the Turing Award, computer science's top prize. Hinton also won a Nobel Prize in physics last year. Both have been vocal in bringing attention to the dangers of a technology they helped create.",
      "But the list also has some surprises, including Bannon and Beck, in an attempt by the letter's organizers at the nonprofit Future of Life Institute to appeal to President Donald Trump's Make America Great Again movement even as Trump's White House staff has sought to reduce limits to AI development in the U.S.",
      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",

And the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, Elon Musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own AI startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.",

      "High-speed games became wildly popular online during the pandemic, creating a chess community that was soon rife with cheating allegations as players gained access to sophisticated computer programs that could give them an unfair advantage.",
      "Naroditsky's untimely death has shined a spotlight on the dark underbelly of the game that fellow pros say brought undue hostility upon the chess star in his final months.",
      "Naroditsky had been accused of cheating, and the allegations, never proven, had taken a toll. Ukrainian grandmaster Oleksandr Bortnyk, a competitor and friend of Naroditsky, was concerned and went to check on him Sunday. He and a friend found Naroditsky, known to many as Danya, unresponsive on a couch in his North Carolina home, Bortnyk recounted during an emotional livestream Monday.",

      "Naroditsky had denied the claims as he excelled at blitz and bullet chess, where players have mere minutes to finish intense matches.",
      "\u201cEver since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions,\u201d Naroditsky said Saturday in the last livestream he filmed before his death. \u201cThe issue is just the lingering effect of it.\u201d",
      "He ruminated about his legacy and hoped other top players would trust that he played with integrity.",
      "Chess pros from around the world have since praised Naroditsky as an honorable player who used his online platform to make chess more accessible. His family said in a statement that they hope he will be remembered for the joy and inspiration he brought people.",
      "Meanwhile, grandmasters have slammed Kramnik on social media for how he treated Naroditsky. American grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura went on an expletive-laden rant on his latest livestream, and Indian grandmaster Nihal Sarin accused the Russian pro of trying to destroy Naroditsky's life in a post on X.",

      "The results announced Tuesday broke Netflix's six-quarter streak of posting a profit that eclipsed analysts' projections.",
      "The Los Gatos, California, cited an unexpected $619 million expense tied to the Brazilian tax dispute for the earnings shortfall while hailing its lineup of distinctive TV series and films for keeping its audience engaged and delivering a mix of subscriber fees and increased ad sales that helped it deliver revenue that matched analyst forecasts.",
      "Investors, though, weren't placated by the explanation as Netflix's shares still fell by about 6% in extended trading after the numbers came out.",
      "Analysts varied in their interpretation of the third-quarter report.",
      "Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro worries Netflix is using the Brazilian tax hit as a way to mask signs of a slowdown in subscriber growth and advertising amid economy uncertainty. \u201cThe truth is that the company failed to deliver the kind of growth we\u2019ve grown used to over the past couple of years,\u201d he said.",
      "But Zacks analyst Jeremy Mullin said he sees little reason for concern, asserting Netflix's \u201cunderlying story remains solid.\u201d",
      "Netflix earned $2.5 billion, or $5.87 per share, in its July-September quarter, an 8% increase from the same time last year. Revenue climbed 17% from last year to $11.5 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet Research had predicted the Los Gatos, California, company to earn $6.96 per share on revenue of $11.5 billion.",

      "Making its popular AI chatbot a gateway to online searches could allow OpenAI, the world's most valuable startup, to pull in more internet traffic and the revenue made from digital advertising. It could also further cut off the lifeblood of online publishers if ChatGPT so effectively feeds people summarized information that they stop exploring the internet and clicking on traditional web links.",
      "OpenAI has said ChatGPT already has more than 800 million users but many of them get it for free. The San Francisco-based company also sells paid subscriptions but is losing more money than it makes and has been looking for ways to turn a profit.",

      "But U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta last month issued a decision that rejected the Chrome sale sought by the U.S. Justice Department in the monopoly case, partly because he believed advances in the AI industry already are reshaping the competitive landscape.",

      "Chrome\u2019s immense success could provide a blueprint for OpenAI as it enters the browser market. When Google released Chrome in 2008, Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer was so dominant that few observers believed a new browser could mount a formidable threat.",
      "But Chrome quickly won over legions of admirers by loading webpages more quickly than Internet Explorer while offering other advantages that enabled it to upend the market.

      "Perplexity, another smaller AI startup, rolled out its own Comet browser earlier this year. It also expressed interest in buying Chrome and eventually submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer for the browser that hit a dead end when Mehta decided against a Google breakup.",

      "\u201cWhat we want to do is make sure young people are as prepared as possible to find employment in a world that\u2019s moving really quickly,\u201d said Ed Skyler, Citi Head of Enterprise Services and Public Affairs.",

      "The country\u2019s largest teachers unions are teaming up with tech companies like Microsoft and OpenAI to help educators build literacy in artificial intelligence",
      "SAN ANTONIO -- SAN ANTONIO (AP) \u2014 On a scorching hot Saturday in San Antonio, dozens of teachers traded a day off for a glimpse of the future. The topic of the day\u2019s workshop: enhancing instruction with artificial intelligence.",
      "After marveling as AI graded classwork instantly and turned lesson plans into podcasts or online storybooks, one high school English teacher raised a concern that was on the minds of many: \u201cAre we going to be replaced with AI?\u201d",
      "That remains to be seen. But for the nation\u2019s 4 million teachers to stay relevant and help students use the technology wisely, teachers unions have forged an unlikely partnership with the world\u2019s largest technology companies. The two groups don\u2019t always see eye to eye but say they share a common goal: training the future workforce of America.",
      "Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic are providing millions of dollars for AI training to the American Federation of Teachers, the country\u2019s second-largest teachers union. In exchange, the tech companies have an opportunity to make inroads into schools and win over students in the race for AI dominance.",
      "AFT President Randi Weingarten said skepticism guided her negotiations, but the tech industry has something schools lack: deep pockets.",
      "\u201cThere is no one else who is helping us with this. That\u2019s why we felt we needed to work with the largest corporations in the world,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cWe went to them \u2014 they didn\u2019t come to us.\u201d",
      "Weingarten first met with Microsoft CEO Brad Smith in 2023 to discuss a partnership. She later reached out to OpenAI to pursue an \u201cagnostic\u201d approach that means any company's AI tools could be used in a training session.",
      "Under the arrangement announced in July, Microsoft is contributing $12.5 million to AFT over five years. OpenAI is providing $8 million in funding and $2 million in technical resources, and Anthropic has offered $500,000.",
      "With the money, AFT is planning to build an AI training hub in New York City that will offer virtual and in-person workshops for teachers. The goal is to open at least two more hubs and train 400,000 teachers over the next five years.",
      "The National Education Association, the country\u2019s largest teachers union, announced its own partnership with Microsoft last month. The company has provided a $325,000 grant to help the NEA develop AI trainings in the form of \u201cmicrocredentials\u201d \u2014 online trainings open to the union\u2019s 3 million members, said Daaiyah Bilal, NEA\u2019s senior director of education policy. The goal is to train at least 10,000 members this school year.",
      "\u201cWe tailored our partnership very surgically,\u201d Bilal said. \u201cWe are very mindful of what a technology company stands to gain by spreading information about the products they develop.\u201d",
      "Both unions set similar terms: Educators, not the private funders, would design and lead trainings that include AI tools from multiple companies. The unions own the intellectual property for the trainings, which cover safety and privacy concerns alongside AI skills.",
      "The Trump administration has encouraged the private investment, recently creating an AI Education Task Force as part of an effort to achieve \"global dominance in artificial intelligence.\u201d The federal government urged tech companies and other organizations to foot the bill. So far, more than 100 companies have signed up.",
      "Tech companies see opportunities in education beyond training teachers. Microsoft unveiled a $4 billion initiative for AI training, research and the gifting of its AI tools to teachers and students. It includes the AFT grant and a program that will give all school districts and community colleges in Washington, Microsoft\u2019s home state, free access to Microsoft CoPilot tools. Google says it will commit $1 billion for AI education and job training programs, including free access to its Gemini for Education platform for U.S. high schools.",
      "Several recent studies have found that AI use in schools is rapidly increasing but training and guidance are lagging.",
      "The industry offers resources that can help scale AI literacy efforts quickly. But educators should ensure any partnership focuses on what\u2019s best for teachers and students, said Robin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education.",

She can take a difficult reading passage and ask a chatbot to translate it into Spanish, Pashto or other languages. And she can ask AI to rewrite difficult passages at any grade level to match her students' reading levels. All in a matter of seconds.",
      "\u201cI can give my students access to things that never existed before,\u201d Simone said. \u201cAs a teacher, once you\u2019ve used it and see how helpful it is, I don\u2019t think I could go back to the way I did things before.\u201d",

      "A growing number of people protesting against President Donald Trump's administration are wearing inflatable costumes at rallies",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 Seth Todd was wearing an inflatable frog costume while protesting outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Building in Portland, Oregon, when a federal officer unleashed a torrent of chemical spray directly into the costume's air vent.",
      "Video of the incident on Oct. 2 has spread, and puffed-out costumes \u2014 hippos in tutus, Mr. Potato Heads, dinosaurs \u2014 have quickly become a feature of protests against President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, including the massive \"No Kings\" marches across the U.S. last weekend.",
      "Todd, 24, said that while the attention has been overwhelming, he is nonetheless \u201chonored to have inspired a movement like this.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s helping to \u2026 combat that specific narrative that we are violent and we are agitating,\u201d he said.",
      "For protesters like Todd, the costumes are a way of fighting absurdity with absurdity: a playful counter to Trump\u2019s portrayal of Portland as \u201cwar ravaged,\u201d \u201cburning down\u201d and \u201clike living in hell.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s efforts to deploy the National Guard there for the stated purpose of protecting federal property are still blocked by the courts for now.",
      "Portland\u2019s ICE building outside downtown has been the site of nightly protests that peaked in June when police declared one demonstration a riot. Smaller clashes have also occurred since then, and federal officers have fired tear gas to clear crowds, which at times have included counter-protesters and live-streamers.",
      "Nighttime protesters, frequently numbering just a couple dozen in the weeks before Trump called up the Guard, have used bullhorns to shout obscenities. They have also sought to block vehicles from entering and leaving the facility. Federal officials argue that they have impeded law enforcement operations.",
      "The inflatable costumes are a testament to the city\u2019s quirky protest culture \u2014 which also recently included a naked bike ride \u2014 and its unofficial motto, \u201cKeep Portland Weird.\u201d",
      "\u201cPortland has always prided itself on this spirit of protest,\u201d said Marc Rodriguez, a Portland State University professor of history and expert in social justice movements.",
      "The costumes also play well on social media, showing the protesters as nonviolent, he added.",

      "\u201cI think everybody just got the memo after Portland that this is something that we can do, and it\u2019s something that the right doesn\u2019t know what to make of,\u201d said Vandawalker, the political action director for Indivisible Chicago Northwest. \u201cCertainly, like the ICE agents don\u2019t seem to know what to make of people in costumes. It\u2019s hard to look threatening when there\u2019s a fan blowing you up.\u201d",
      "The Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on the inflatable costumes at protests.",
      "In recent weeks, Portland residents have launched groups such as the Portland Frog Brigade, whose members sport inflatable frog costumes, and Operation Inflation, which hands out inflatable costumes to protesters for free.",

      "The group has seen donations pour in and plans to expand to other U.S. cities, Brown said.",

      "Anthony Boyd, 54, was sentenced to death for his role in killing Gregory Huguley in Talladega County more than 30 years ago. Prosecutors said Huguley was doused in gasoline and set on fire after he didn\u2019t pay for $200 worth of cocaine.",

Prosecutors said Boyd was one of four men who kidnapped Huguley the prior evening.",

      "Russian grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik, who held the world title for several years in the early 2000s, began accusing the California-born pro of cheating in online chess last October. He continued to share his suspicions on social media over the past year without providing substantial evidence.",

      "A proposal to sell a city-owned golf course built on top of the burial grounds for enslaved people is sparking public outcry in Tallahassee",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 A dark history long buried under the towering live oak trees and manicured lawns of a country club in Florida\u2019s capital city of Tallahassee is reviving painful memories of the community's segregated past and fueling some residents' calls for a public reckoning.",
      "Under the rolling hills of the Capital City Country Club in one of Tallahassee's most sought-after neighborhoods, the evidence of Florida's slave-holding past lies just beneath the surface, in the form of the long-lost burial grounds of enslaved people who lived and died on the plantation that once sprawled with cotton there.",
      "Across the country, many thousands of unmarked and forgotten cemeteries of enslaved people are at risk of being lost, as descendants and volunteers fight development and indifference.",
      "Less than a mile from Florida's state Capitol, archaeologists with the National Park Service have identified what they believe to be 23 unmarked graves and 14 possible graves near the 7th hole of the golf course, which is semiprivate and currently operates on city-owned land.",
      "\u201cWe know they were enslaved. But who were they?\" said Tifany Hill, a Tallahassee resident whose family maintains a historic Black cemetery that dates to the 1800s.",
      "More than four years after the Tallahassee City Commission approved plans to create a commemorative site to preserve and protect the unmarked graves at the golf course, no such memorial has been built. Now, city officials are considering selling the land to the country club, which has paid a nominal $1 a year in rent for nearly 70 years.",
      "That lease has been in place since 1956, when the club reverted to private ownership, allowing it to sidestep a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that banned the segregation of public parks and recreational facilities. Among the club's former members was a judge whose nomination to the nation's highest court failed after he faced questions about whether he helped privatize the club to avoid integration.",
      "After receiving a recent offer from the country club, the city had proposed selling the 178-acre (72-hectare) golf course for $1.25 million to the club \u2014 with the legal requirement that it perpetually operate the property as an 18-hole golf course and that the city be allowed to build and maintain a commemorative site for the graves, with public access guaranteed.",
      "After residents opposed to the sale crowded the City Hall chambers on Wednesday, the commission voted to postpone the issue until its next meeting.",
      "The prospect of selling the land that includes the burial grounds is an outrage to Delaitre Hollinger, a local activist whose ancestors were enslaved in Leon County, where on the eve of the Civil War, three out of every four residents were human chattel owned by elite white families. Hollinger helped lead the push to memorialize the rediscovered graves.",

      "One of Chicago's most infamous gang leaders is now asking Gov. JB Pritzker for clemency after winning a pardon from President Donald Trump earlier this year",
      "CHICAGO -- CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 One of Chicago's most infamous gang leaders asked Gov. JB Pritzker for clemency Wednesday after winning a pardon from President Donald Trump earlier this spring, arguing that he had been \u201clost in an enduring pattern of criminality\u201d but he's grown into a different person in the decades since he's been in prison.",
      "Larry Hoover, once a key leader of the Gangster Disciples, was sentenced to up to 200 years in Illinois state prison in 1973 in connection with a murder. He was sentenced decades later to life in federal prison for running a criminal enterprise behind bars. Hoover has still left his mark even from prison, launching a jail-inspired fashion line, starting a political action committee and inspiring rap lyrics.",
      "Trump commuted Hoover's federal sentence in May and he was moved from a federal \u201csupermax\u201d prison in Colorado to a nearby Colorado state facility to continue serving his state sentence.",
      "His attorneys sent a request to the Illinois Prisoner Review Board to hold a hearing on whether Hoover deserves clemency in the state case. The board makes recommendations to Pritzker, who makes the final decision on clemency. They argued in the filing that Hoover is now 74 years old, has had three heart attacks doing hard labor at the Colorado state prison and has no desire to commit any more crimes.",
      "Hoover wrote in a letter included with the request that he takes responsibility for his crimes, saying he wasted his talents on \u201cdestructive and self-defeating endeavors\u201d that hurt almost everyone around him.",
      "\u201cI was lost in an enduring pattern of criminality those many years ago,\u201d he wrote.",
      "He said he's no longer the person he was when he entered prison after spending 25 years in \u201ca front row seat to the passing by of the World\" and he has renounced all ties to any criminal organization, including the Gangster Disciples. He said he suffers from a range of age-related ailments and just wants to be home with his family and grandchildren.",
      "\u201cThere is zero chance I would re-offend,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI know there are some that will probably remain unconvinced and choose to believe I\u2019m beyond redemption. I hope to prove them wrong, or at a minimum, to allay their concerns eventually.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Pritzker referred questions Wednesday to the prisoner review board. The Associated Press left a message with the board's clemency unit seeking comment.",
      "The second-term Democratic governor has not publicly indicated what he will do. In May, Pritzker met with members of Hoover\u2019s family in Springfield where they discussed the clemency process.",
      "\u201cA recommendation is made by the prisoner review board to me that includes that entire record, and I review the entire record when that happens,\u201d Pritzker told reporters the day after the meeting.",

      "Hoover's request comes as Pritzker's frustrations with Trump mount. The governor has long been one of Trump's loudest critics and tensions between them have been growing sharper as the president escalates a crackdown on Chicago immigrants. Trump's administration last week asked the U.S. Supreme Court to allow the deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area.",
      "Hoover was a founder of the Gangster Disciples more than 50 years ago. To this day, the Gangster Disciples remain one of Chicago's most notorious street gangs. Federal prosecutors maintain the gang generated around $100 million in drug sales annually during the height of Hoover's leadership.",
      "Hoover was convicted of murder in 1973 after prosecutors accused him of ordering a gang member killed. He was sentenced to 150 to 200 years in state prison. According to prosecutors, he continued to run the gang from behind bars for more than 20 years, expanding it to more than two dozen states. A federal jury in 1997 found him guilty of dozens of crimes, including engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise. He got six life sentences.",
      "In the 1990s, Hoover launched his \u201cGhetto Prisoner\u201d fashion line, telling The Associated Press in 1995 that he hoped the clothing would help people come together. He also formed a political action committee that his supporters contend inspired thousands to protest outside Chicago City Hall.",
      "He still became a central figure in the rap world. Rick Ross' 2010 single \u201cB.M.F.\u201d paid tribute to Hoover's power and influence. Rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, and Drake, have pushed for Hoover's release, with West pleading Hoover's case to Trump during an Oval Office meeting in 2018. Drake and Ye headlined a \u201cFree Larry Hoover\u201d benefit concert in Los Angeles in 2021.",

      "Here's a look at Trump's claims and the process that could play out:",
      "Before reclaiming the White House, Trump filed two claims with the Justice Department seeking $230 million in damages related to the FBI\u2019s 2022 search of his Mar-a-Lago property for classified documents and for a separate investigation into potential ties between Russia and his 2016 presidential campaign, The New York Times reported Tuesday.",
      "He filed the claims in 2023 and 2024 under a law that permits individuals to sue federal agencies, like the Justice Department, if they believe they\u2019ve been harmed by employees of those agencies acting within the scope of their duties. Under the Federal Tort Claims Act, individuals must first file an administrative claim with the government agency. The agency then has six months to either settle the claim or deny it outright.",
      "If the agency denies the claim or doesn't act on it within that time frame, the person can then file a federal lawsuit. Trump has not yet filed a lawsuit on either claim, even though six months have passed.",

      "The U.S. Justice Department has announced an agreement with the University of Virginia to pause civil rights investigations",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The University of Virginia has agreed to abide by White House guidance forbidding discrimination in admissions and hiring, becoming the latest in a growing list of campuses striking deals with the Trump administration as it tries to pause months of scrutiny brought by the U.S. Justice Department.",
      "The agreement was announced by the Justice Department, which began reviewing the admissions and financial aid processes at the Charlottesville campus in April. Officials accused its president of failing to end diversity, equity and inclusion practices President Donald Trump has called unlawful.",
      "The mounting pressure prompted James Ryan to announce his resignation as university president in June, saying the stakes were too high for others on campus if he opted to \u201cfight the federal government in order to save my job.\u201d",
      "The university agreed to be bound by federal guidance forbidding racial discrimination in admission and hiring, as described by the Justice Department. It also agreed to provide relevant data on a quarterly basis through 2028. The president will have to personally certify that the university is in compliance each quarter.",
      "The university did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Virginia\u2019s settlement follows other agreements signed by Columbia and Brown universities to end federal investigations and restore access to federal funding. Columbia paid $200 million to the government, and Brown paid $50 million to Rhode Island workforce development organizations.",
      "Some of the Justice Department's letters squarely took aim at Ryan, accusing him of engaging in \u201cattempts to defy and evade federal anti-discrimination laws and the directives of your board.\u201d Much of the federal scrutiny centered on complaints that Ryan was too slow to implement a March 7 resolution by the university\u2019s governing board demanding the eradication of DEI on campus.",
      "As a public university, the University of Virginia was an outlier in the Trump administration\u2019s effort to reform higher education according to the president\u2019s vision. Previously, the administration had devoted most of its scrutiny to elite private colleges, including Harvard and other Ivy League institutions, accused of tolerating antisemitism.",

      "The Charlottesville campus became a flashpoint this year after conservative critics accused it of simply renaming its DEI initiatives rather than ending them. The Justice Department expanded the scope of its review several times and announced a separate investigation into alleged antisemitism in May.",
      "Among the most prominent critics was America First Legal, a conservative group created by Trump aide Stephen Miller. In a May letter to federal officials, the group said Virginia had only moved to \u201crename, repackage, and redeploy the same unlawful infrastructure under a lexicon of euphemisms.\u201d",
      "Similar accusations have embroiled George Mason University, where the governing board came to the defense of the president even as the Education Department cited allegations that he promoted diversity initiatives above credentials in hiring. On Aug. 1, the board unanimously voted to give President Gregory Washington a pay increase of 1.5%. The same day, the board approved a resolution forbidding DEI in favor of a \u201cmerit-based approach\u201d in campus policies.",

      "The detentions Sunday came a day after the Houthis raided another U.N. facility in Sanaa, but all staff there were reported to be safe. Those detained Sunday included five Yemenis and 15 international staff. The rebels released another 11 U.N. staffers after questioning.",

      "The South Carolina Supreme Court has suggested solutions to avoid a legal dispute over lawmakers' pay",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) \u2014 The South Carolina Supreme Court suggested solutions Wednesday that could have prevented lawmakers from going unpaid for months while the court reviewed the legality of a June raise.",
      "During oral arguments for a suit brought by one of the legislature\u2019s own members, the justices said legislators could have officially called the fund for the raise an expense fund instead of compensation. They could have held off paying the extra money until 2027 after the next election for all members of the General Assembly, or they could have separated the raise in the budget from the money lawmakers already get paid so it all wouldn\u2019t have gone away, the justices said.",
      "But none of that happened, so the legislative branch crossed the street to the South Carolina Supreme Court's building so the five justices could consider if their $1,500 a month raise passed earlier this year and was set to start in July is legal.",
      "On one side of the courtroom were the clerks of the Senate and the House. On the other was Sen. Wes Climer, the Republican who sued over the increase saying the state constitution prohibits the general assembly from increasing its pay until after an election has taken place.",
      "The issue involves what lawmakers call \u201cin-district compensation\u201d which is money set aside for legislative duties but has few limits on how it can be spent. A line in the budget, passed by both chambers, increased that compensation from $1,000 a month to $2,500 a month for all 46 senators and 124 House members starting July 1. It was the first raise in the General Assembly's pay in over three decades.",
      "Attorneys for the House and Senate emphasized the raise was for expenses and not salary and was exempt from the waiting period after the election. The attorneys on the other side argued lawmakers themselves called it compensation and since they aren't required to provide any receipts or documentation, it is salary.",
      "Chief Justice John Kittredge went back to 1988 with one of his questions when legislators changed the name of the payment to \u201cin-district compensation.\u201d It used to be called \u201clegislative expense allowance.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey hit the bullseye. There was no question what it was for,\u201d Kittredge said.",
      "Attorneys for the General Assembly don't know why the name was changed.",
      "The budget item with the increase was tied into the reoccurring budget item that pays lawmakers when they aren't in session. So as it sorts through the lawsuit, the South Carolina Supreme Court handed down a decision in late June just before the extra pay kicked in that stopped not only the raise, but the payment of $1,000 a month in the same budget line.",
      "Separating the items in the budget would at least have allowed lawmakers to be paid what they always have.",

Part-time legislators, who meet three days a week for about four months, will then get a lump sum of $10,400 to account for their $260 a day compensation.",
      "The South Carolina Supreme Court typically takes months to decide their cases.",
      "Climer, who filed the suit, said he understands the difficulties lawmakers face having to use their own money, but the law is the law. For 250 years it\u2019s mostly been frowned on, if not illegal, for legislators to immediately raise their own pay, he said.",
      "\u201cIt's supposed to be a sacrificial act of public service,\u201d Climer said after the arguments.",
      "The in-district compensation raise was first suggested toward the end of the budget process by Republican Sen. Shane Martin. He spent about 30 seconds on the Senate floor saying the first raise in 30 years was needed because inflation and a world where there are more expenses means the amount was no longer adequate.",
      "South Carolina already has some of the lowest compensated legislators in the country. Comparing pay is hard because it includes salary, expenses and mileage, but the combination of $22,400 for salary and in-district expenses is well below other states with part-time legislatures like Alabama and Tennessee, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "It is a lot more than the $100 a year plus mileage that New Hampshire lawmakers get, but well below California and New York, where being a legislator is considered a full-time job with a salary over $100,000 a year.",

      "As the U.S. Supreme Court ponders whether to clear the way for the National Guard in Chicago, a federal appeals court is hearing arguments in California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s challenge to the deployment of troops in Los Angeles. Guard troops could also soon be on the ground in Portland, Oregon, pending legal developments there.",
      "Here's what to know about legal efforts to block or deploy the National Guard in various cities.",
      "A federal judge in Chicago already blocked deployment of Guard troops to the Chicago area for two weeks. On Wednesday, Judge April Perry agreed to extend that order by 30 days. But she said each party could discuss the extension further before meeting again at 3 p.m. local time, noting they would not be able to issue another one.",
      "Still, anything she does could be moot if the U.S. Supreme Court rules in the meantime.",
      "Attorneys representing the Trump administration said in court filings Tuesday that they would agree to possibly extend the block on deployment for 30 days. However, they are continuing to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene. The Trump administration is pressing for an emergency order that would let Guard troops be deployed.",
      "\u201cEvery day this improper TRO remains in effect imposes grievous and irreparable harm on the Executive,\u201d Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a Supreme Court filing Tuesday.",
      "Lawyers representing Chicago and Illinois have asked the Supreme Court to continue to block the deployment, calling it a \u201cdramatic step.\u201d",
      "An appeals court said Monday that Trump could take command of 200 Oregon National Guard troops, but a separate court order still blocks him from actually deploying them.",
      "U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued two temporary restraining orders earlier this month. One prohibited Trump from calling up the Oregon troops so he could send them to Portland. The other prohibited him from sending any Guard members to Oregon at all after he tried to evade the first order by deploying California troops instead.",
      "The Justice Department appealed the first order, and in a 2-1 ruling Monday, a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel sided with the administration.",
      "However, Immergut\u2019s second order remains in effect, so no troops may immediately be deployed.",

    "story": [
      "The NFL is not considering dropping Bad Bunny as its Super Bowl halftime headline performer, Commissioner Roger Goodell said Wednesday, reaffirming a decision to put the Grammy-winning Puerto Rican artist on the league's biggest stage that led to criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and some of his supporters.",
      "Goodell addressed the Bad Bunny controversy at his news conference following the annual fall owners meeting. It is the first time he has commented on the move announced in late September that garnered worldwide attention, including an increase in streams of Bad Bunny's music, along with backlash.",
      "\"It's carefully thought through,\" Goodell said. \"I'm not sure we've ever selected an artist where we didn't have some blowback or criticism. It's pretty hard to do when you have literally hundreds of millions of people that are watching.\"",
      "The 31-year-old born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio has been vocal in his opposition to Trump and his policies. He decided to do a 31-day residency in Puerto Rico, avoiding stops in the mainland U.S., citing concerns about the mass deportation of Latinos.",
      "He performs in Spanish and is expected to do so at the Super Bowl.",
      "\"We're confident it's going to be a great show,\" Goodell said, acknowledging there could be more talent added to the lineup along with Bad Bunny. \"He understands the platform that he's on, and I think it's going to be exciting and a united moment.\"",
      "The San Francisco 49ers are hosting the Super Bowl on Feb. 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. It is unclear if Trump plans to be there, though he has made appearing in person at major sporting events a significant part of his second term in the White House.",
      "Trump in an interview on conservative news network Newsmax said he had \"never heard of\" Bad Bunny.",
      "\"I don't know who he is,\" Trump said. \"I don't know why they're doing it. It's, like, crazy. And then they blame it on some promoter they hired to pick up entertainment. I think it's absolutely ridiculous.\"",
      "Goodell defended the decision on Wednesday, explaining it was made because of Bad Bunny's immense popularity.",
      "\"He's one of the leading and most popular entertainers in the world,\" Goodell said. \"That's what we try to achieve. It's an important stage for us. It's an important element to the entertainment value.\"",
      "Echoing what senior VP of football operations Troy Vincent said Tuesday, Goodell said there has not been much discussion about the tush push quarterback sneak since an effort to ban it narrowly failed to pass in the spring.",
      "Vincent said the primary concern is how tough it is to officiate the maneuver that the Philadelphia Eagles have successfully executed so often. It was not on the formal agenda at this meeting, though owners did get an update on penalties and other football matters.",
      "\"It's something we will continue to monitor on all phases, just like we do every other aspect of the game,\" Goodell said. \"We don't have any proposals to bring it back up. It wouldn't surprise me if something does evolve. But it's not something we're really focused on during the season.\"",
      "Asked about replay reviews and the length of time they are taking, Goodell said game times are actually down through the first seven weeks compared to last season, despite a surge in kick returns after an adjustment was made to the so-called dynamic kickoff.",
      "\"That's quite remarkable when you add the number of kickoffs,\" Goodell said. \"You're going to get more fouls. You're going to get different sets of fouls. You're going to have a little bit (more) length of the game.\"",
      "Goodell said he had breakfast with interim Players Association executive director David White before one of the league's international games this season but expects any talk about a move to an 18-game regular season and other collective bargaining discussions to wait until the union chooses its long-term leader.",
      "The current CBA runs through the 2031 league year. White told The Associated Press last month that an 18-game season was not inevitable.",
      "\"The negotiations will be a lot more than just simply the 18 and two (exhibition games),\" Goodell said. \"There are a lot of issues that we are going to raise and I'm certain that the players will raise, and that's what it should be. That's what collective bargaining is all about. They're going to need time to make sure that they're prepared, that they're ready for the negotiations (and) they have their priorities straight, and then we can begin negotiations.\"",
      "Goodell said work is being done to choose sites for the Super Bowl to cap the 2028 and '29 seasons and expects an announcement on those next year."

Luckily, as much renewed success as the show was now having, it wasn't terribly difficult to get tickets. We went in and sat toward the back of the theater. I was far more interested in viewing the spectacle than in participating, and the crowd's engagement was a true delight to behold.",
      "Before long, people started noticing me. A group of girls came up to my seat, giggling, touched my arm or leg, then tittered as they dispersed. It was all rather surreal, especially with the film, the fevered audience participation, and the all-too- familiar music carrying on in the background.",
      "Unintentionally, I'd created a stir among the already animated audience. About a half hour into the film, the woman from the ticket booth of the Waverly \u2014 a slightly bedraggled, very unlikely blonde \u2014 hustled down the aisle and pulled me out of my seat.",
      "\"You are an imposter,\" she hissed. \"You must leave. You're a nightmare! And you are not Tim Curry at all \u2014 you don't even look like him!\" She pointed at the screen, her long red fingernail trembling with emphasis.",
      "I stood up slowly and, with a mixture of embarrassment and triumph (neither of which were particularly founded), I handed her my passport.",
      "She snatched it, squinted at the photo, looked back at my face, then back at the passport. In the flickering light, I watched her haughty expression collapse. Speechless, she seemed to sort of melt in front of me, evoking a wicked witch who had been assaulted by a bucket of water.",
      "Aware I was now on a stage of sorts, I steadied myself and waited for her response.",
      "\"Ohhh my God. Oh, Mr. Curry. I didn't ... Please just ... please sit down.\"",
      "I took my passport back and gestured to my friends.",
      "\"I wouldn't dream of it!\" I said, and promptly strode out of the cinema.",
      "By definition \u2014 as one who has professionally pretended or masqueraded onstage, onscreen, and into a microphone \u2014 there is an argument to be made that I have been a career imposter for most of my life.",
      "But if you ask me, there's a much better word for my vocation and identity, a word that carries me back to my earliest days.",
      "Vagabond.",
      "Vagabonds rove. We travel about and pick up work wherever we go. We wander, drift, stagger, wink. Reluctant to be pinned down, we're enticed by risk, restless if we linger, fueled by curiosity and a sense of wonder.",
      "Vagabonds learn, often from a young age, that indeed time is fleeting. As is fame \u2014 a fairly worthless pursuit, really. We are less startled by life's unpredictable shifts than those who choose to remain safe and settled. We often practice our trade in varied locations.",
      "Those of us with itinerant upbringings or similar proclivities often have no choice but to adapt and reinvent ourselves. Over and over and over again. We rely on charming exteriors and don't mind saying so, leading us to project an inflated sense of self-confidence. We feel deeply but are perhaps less inclined to express our true selves to others \u2014 because our relationships so often prove to be ephemeral.",
      "Of course, these qualities don't apply to all vagabonds. I'm not sure they'll apply to me tomorrow. But it feels about right today.",
      "In Shakespearean times, people of the stage were considered rogues and vagabonds. I always rather liked that. I presume that such labels came about because of actors assuming manifold identities, traveling from one town to the next in pursuit of new audiences and a bit of coin here and there. How can you trust somebody, or truly know somebody, who appears as a king one day and a jester the next? What does it mean when neither role is the true identity of the person, and when that very person might be gone the next day? These entertainers with ever-changing faces and varied costumes were presumed to be scoundrels, not regarded as honorable or honest members of society.",
      "That part doesn't define me, of course.",
      "I'm very trustworthy.",
      "You believe me, don't you?",
      "Over the course of my life, my vagabond blues, hopes, and highs have found their way into varied channels of expression, different creative boxes from which flashes of my real self could emerge. Through my songs. Delivered upon the stage. Exhibited on screens. Cultivated in my homes and gardens. Re-envisioned, attached to, and filtered through more voices and personas than I can recall.",
      "Much of this book has involved returning to those characters, the ones who defined my professional life. As there is a piece of me who either exists in or understands each of the roles we'll be revisiting, surveying them together will hopefully yield a colorful, curious mosaic of who I am, beneath the cosmetics and costumes.",
      "Looking in the rearview mirror is neither my instinct nor my preferred way of being. I'd rather get on with it and keep moving forward. I have never been one to dwell on past performances any more than is required. I do not snatch memorabilia from my films to keep it displayed around my house like glistening ashes. I find little reward lingering in nostalgia. Living gig to gig for the better (and worse) part of half a century, I have grown accustomed to appreciating and accepting lessons offered, then looking forward to the next challenge.",
      "That's the vagabond's way.",
      "And yet, it hasn't escaped my notice that others have jumped at the opportunity to make their own assumptions. I have been described as everything from a confounding sex symbol, to a home designer, to a rock 'n' roll singer, to an imposter, to the prince of Halloween, to a paralyzed tragic case, to a dead legend.",
      "Contrary to village gossip, I am still very much alive.",
      "So, while that remains the case, I believe it's my turn \u2014 and my privilege \u2014 to malign my own reputation.",
      "Why expose myself now? After all, I'm quite comfortable in the shade, and it would be easy enough to remain there. But with time, the thought of sharing my story stayed on my mind and felt just risky enough to intrigue me as a creative pursuit. I've also developed increasing respect for the characters I've played over the course of my life, characters about whom I've spent no small amount of time answering (and avoiding) questions.",
      "More than anything, the challenges presented to me by being alive, by the pandemic, and by sundry health issues have offered an appalling amount of time to reflect. Strewn amid those reflections has been a recurring fantastical notion: Maybe it's time to write my story. Before I could even finish musing about what that might mean, self-doubt had persistently reared up, chuckling malevolently: You've got a nerve.",
      "I'm prone to heed that voice, which has so often intervened, posing the deceptively simple question: Who do you think you are?",
      "However, as loud and obstructive as that voice has been throughout my life, generations of you (yes, you) have continued to flatter me with curiosity and kind attention. In doing so, you have given me permission to mute my self-deprecating instincts \u2014 or at least to hold them at bay.",
      "Today, I am physically unable to take you on a vigorous vagabond's adventure, due to a stroke I endured in 2012 that has limited my capacity as an active tour guide. But my mind and most of my memories have remained intact, and within them exist a multitude of journeys perhaps worth sharing. Before I can no longer be bothered to recount them, I humbly invite you into my stories of living across various environments: seaside living, country living, city living; on the road, on the stage, crossing borders and blurring them, ever in a vagabond state. I've loved inhabiting most of those settings, and \u2014 with some notable exceptions \u2014 enjoy remembering the times I've had.",
      "You should know what you're in for, however.",
      "I'd hate to leave you dissatisfied.",
      "Before we raise the curtains, before the elevator descends, know this:",
      "This will not be a master class. I have stories to impart, not explicit lessons to teach. You may glean profound takeaways from where I've been, how I got there, whom I've met, what I've done, or how I finagled my way into repeatedly being cast as an irresistible villain. Even so, my words are not meant to serve as instructions on how to act, sing, become a voiceover artist, or remain resilient in the face of unforeseen physical hardship. In part, because I do not believe that I have mastered any of those things. Furthermore, since I was a young boy, I've been dubious of anyone who claims to be an authority. Far be it for me to adopt an expert's stance now.",
      "I must also warn (or assure) you that while there are scraps of my nature in all of my characters, I am none of them. That sentence feels too ludicrously obvious to put in writing, but the distinctions between who I really am and who I've pretended to be as an actor have proven to be a source of great disappointment to some audiences. It has not caused me much personal distress, beyond the periodic necessity to deter stalkers.",
      "Nor will this be a juicy Hollywood tell-all. Not because my moral compass won't allow it, or because I haven't had ample run-ins with juicy celebrities \u2014 but simply because I find such books immensely dull and highly susceptible to gathering dust.",
      "I also won't be dishing out lurid details of my love affairs. I guarantee you, if it matters, that I have experienced true love, true heartbreak, and everything in between, including no small amount of wreckage. Which, naturally, helps inform who I am. I have loved and been loved and I hope you have, too. But I'm not interested in your romances. And specifics about my affairs of the heart or the bedroom are \u2014 respectfully \u2014 none of your f***ing business.",
      "With those caveats taken care of, I sincerely hope you enjoy the escapades, illusions, and contradictions I've collected recklessly over the course of my vagabond days.",
      "I trust you're now shivering with antici - I'll play along; I'll SAY IT - pation ...",
      "Let's get on with it.",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Oct 2025 10:10:12 -0400",
    "summary": "After the deaths of his mother and father, actor-director Ben Stiller sought to pay tribute as few sons could: a documentary about their lives on-stage and off. But even he didn't anticipate to what depths his film, \"Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost,\" would go.",
    "story": [
      "A-List actor and director Ben Stiller knows a good story when he sees one, so he knew profiling his late parents, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, would be compelling. But even he had no idea how deep it would take him. \"No, I didn't!\" he laughed. \"I mean, I didn't know where it was gonna go.\"",
      "Stiller & Meara had been the husband-and-wife comedy team of the 1960s and '70s, appearing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" 36 times. But for Ben and sister Amy, Stiller & Meara were also Mom & Dad \u2013 and that could get confusing.",
      "Stiller's new Apple TV documentary, \"Stiller & Meara\" Nothing Is Lost,\" examines how his parents navigated both roles.",
      "Married 62 years, their family life was shaped by Jerry's relentless ambition, and Anne's resentment doing comedy when her dream was to be a serious actress \u2013 and the drinking that followed. As Ben noted in his film, \"She had to go up there and do that act, because she was so good at it. But it wasn't really her true thing, you know? It wasn't her true happiness.\"",
      "The film is an adult's attempt to answer the complicated question that shaped his childhood: Where did the act end, and the marriage begin?",
      "In one archival interview, Jerry Stiller calls his wife \"the funniest woman in the world off stage and on stage. Now the thing is, when she does these funny things, I am an exploiter and opportunist, and I'll take a pencil and I'll start to write it down.\"",
      "Anne Meara picks up: \"He says we can use that on a show, and I'm ready to kill him! Again, where does the act end and the marriage begin?\"",
      "Ben Stiller said, \"There's so much footage and material and things to show of the good and the bad and the tension and the happy times. I felt it was really important to try to have a balance in the film that would relay to the audience what the reality was of their relationship, which was, I think, grounded in love.\"",
      "From 2010: Stiller & Meara on love and marriage (\"Sunday Morning\")",
      "It wasn't just old clips from long-ago shows that Stiller had access to. He stumbled into some unexpected help while cleaning out the family apartment to sell: Jerry Stiller had secretly taped everything, producing boxes and boxes of recordings. \"I had no idea that there were these sort of arguments and discussions that he had recorded,\" said Ben. \"All of it, I'd never heard before. It brought me back to being a kid in the house when they were working together.\"",
      "For a filmmaker trying to figure it all out, Ben Stiller had struck gold.",
      "Among the recordings was a conversation in which his father talks to his mother about her drinking, and confronts her about it.",
      "I asked, \"Was it important to you in terms of understanding your dad, that you could hear him do that?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Ben. \"I was like, 'Oh, okay. He really did speak to her about it.' Because as kids that was never anything we talked about.\"",
      "\"You may be carrying around this sense of, why didn't dad ever confront mom? Guess what \u2013 he did.\"",
      "\"Right! He did,\" said Ben. \"And it changed.\"",
      "This deconstruction of his parents' marriage came while Stiller was wrestling with his own mid-life issues. Separated at the time from his wife, actress Christine Taylor (with whom he later reconciled), Stiller describes himself as having felt out of balance and unhappy, disconnected from his family, and a little bit lost.",
      "He talked about the irony of thinking he was doing so much better than his parents: \"When you're younger, you think, Okay, I'm gonna do everything better. I'm not gonna make THAT mistake. I found myself at a place in my life where things weren't really in sync.\"",
      "Stiller & Meara now had some company under the magnifying glass: their son. \"I didn't want to pretend to be some sort of objective judge of their relationship when I had so many issues in my own relationships and my stuff,\" he said,",
      "Was that a challenging journey to make himself? \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Then it changed everything because it was like, oh, okay. I'm gonna have to, you know, talk about my own feelings! It's stuff that I don't really ever, you know, talk about.\"",
      "Not exactly where he expected to end up, when he started the project. In honest, raw, and revealing conversations with his daughter Ella and son Quin, Ben talked in the film about his own issues being the child of someone famous: \"I remember there was this one time I literally was on the street talking to him about the fact that I felt like he didn't pay enough attention to us, and while we were talking someone on the street came over and said, 'Jerry, I love you work' and he started talking [to them]!\"",
      "Stiller exposes the excruciating challenge of breaking patterns, when his son adds: \"That's hilarious, because just a few weeks ago we were all out at a restaurant and I'd been stressed about college stuff. And then the people there wanted to get a picture of you, and I remember I was so frustrated, like, the world just has to stop to get this picture.\"",
      "Stiller said, \"I was genuinely surprised when he told me that. As a filmmaker I thought, This is an interesting moment in the movie.\"",
      "\"As a father?\" I asked.",
      "\"As a father I was like, Oh, s***,\" he laughed.",
      "Ben Stiller has done something requiring more courage than simply making an honest movie about loved ones; he's made an honest movie about himself.",
      "I said, \"One of the most uncomfortable places you can ever be is the mirror, right? Sometimes your kids are holding up the mirror.\"",
      "\"Yeah, you know, it's kind of like \u2026 it is a bummer, 'cause I'm never gonna get to go back, you know?\" Stiller said.",
      "And that's helped him round the edges from his own childhood \u2013 finding the grace to give his parents by understanding he might need to seek some of his own.",
      "Asked where he stands in his relationship to his parents, Stiller replied, \"I don't know!\"",
      "\"All this work, and you don't know?\"",
      "\"Well, I mean, they're still not here. That was the sad thing for me about finishing the movie. It was like, Oh, now I don't have an excuse to kind of just be connecting with them here.\"",
      "I asked, \"This was an intense reconnection when it sounds like you needed it the most?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Stiller. \"Like my mom probably would have said, like, 'Yeah, go make a movie about it if you wanna figure out how to process your feelings!'\"",

    "summary": "The star of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\" \"Clue\" and \"It\" has played roles campy, comical, and menacingly sinister, yet his most inscrutable role is still Tim Curry. He talks about his memoir \"Vagabond,\" the stroke he suffered in 2012, and learning how to speak again.",
    "story": [
      "A stroke 13 years ago left Tim Curry partially paralyzed, but it hasn't diminished his memorable laugh, or the mystique about him. In 50 years on the screen, he's played so many types \u2013 campy, comical, menacingly sinister \u2013 yet his most inscrutable role is still Tim Curry.",
      "And being an enigma is exactly how he wants it. \"I think it's important,\" he said. \"I encourage it.\"",
      "Though Curry is out with a new memoir, \"Vagabond\" (to be published Tuesday by Grand Central), he's keeping some secrets to himself. \"One of the keys is to not encourage an identity, I think, and I've tried to nurse that,\" he said. \"I have protected that, and continue to.\"",
      "Born a military brat in Hong Kong, Curry grew up moving from place to place. As a boy, he worshipped his dad, a chaplain in the British Royal Navy. The last time he saw his father, when he was 10, was when his dad had a stroke: \"And as they were about to take him into the ambulance, he said, 'Look after your mother.'\"",
      "After his father's death, there was no one to buffer the impact of his mother, who would be kind one minute, then cruel the next. \"I actually think now that she was probably bipolar, because she could turn on a dime,\" Curry said.",
      "Acting offered him an escape from his mother's moods \u2013 and access to so different many different lives. He said what excited him about acting was \"the freedom of being somebody else, and I think that I was (like everybody else) drawn to the idea of fame probably, although I came to kind of rather despise it.\"",
      "His first nibble of notoriety came from his first paid gig, in the 1969 London production of \"Hair.\" It was a big deal, but nothing in comparison to what came next: \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\" first on stage, then the movie. He joked that he got the part of Dr. Frank-N-Furter because of his legs. It was a transformative performance, for Curry, and the audience.",
      "Curry says what made the role unique was his power: \"He gave a lot of teenagers permission to be different, and I'm very happy that he did have that power.\"",
      "\"Rocky Horror\" earned Curry stardom. It did not earn praise, or even respect, from his mother. She lived well into her son's success, but \"she didn't make much of it,\" Curry said. \"She was scared of it.\"",
      "Why? \"Well, she said to me later that, 'I thought your head was gonna grow too big.' She would have preferred me to operate under the radar!\"",
      "He laughed: \"I never did. I didn't give a s*** about the radar!\"",
      "I asked, \"When Frank is committing his particularly most heinous act in 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' [killing Eddie with an axe], was some of that directed at your mom maybe?\"",
      "\"It's not directed at her, it's just channeling,\" Curry replied.",
      "\"Rocky Horror\" set up Curry to play some memorable screen villains \u2013 under a mountain of prosthetics in \"Legend,\" opposite Tom Cruise; as Pennywise in the Stephen King thriller \"It\"; and as Carol Burnett's scheming and duplicitous brother in \"Annie.\" \"I loved her to bits,\" Curry said of Burnett.",
      "And don't forget the hotel concierge in \"Home Alone 2,\" and the manipulative butler in \"Clue.\"",
      "But then came 2012, and the moment that changed Tim Curry's life. \"It was so strange,\" he said. \"I was actually having a massage, and the guy who was giving me a massage said, 'I'm worried about you. I think we should call a doctor.' I felt fine. I had no symptoms that I was aware of. I wasn't in pain.\"",
      "But he was taken to the hospital, where he learned he'd had a stroke. \"I though immediately of my dad. So, I was scared,\" he said.",
      "He then underwent invasive brain surgery, and had rehabilitation to learn how to speak again. \"That was very weird,\" he said. \"I hated not being able to speak.\"",
      "He also has paralysis on his left side. \"My face kind of went sideways,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"From reading the book, and from talking to the people here who care about you, there hasn't been a lot \u2013 I'm sure there was some self-pity, but it doesn't sound like there was a lot?\"",
      "\"I don't think so,\" Curry said. \"I hope not, because I don't admire self-pity much. Another legacy from my mother, I guess. It's one that I'm thankful for: Why are you so important that we have to pity you?\"",
      "Now 79, he's reached an age he didn't think he'd see back in 2012. Today, he's not remotely afraid of dying \u2013 though exactly what he means remains, fittingly, a mystery.",
      "\"I don't fear death,\" he said. \"I try to avoid it, as I think we all do! But I suspect that in the end, I will welcome it.\"",
      "And what does that mean? \"Well, I think it may be very comforting to go bye-bye \u2013 and I want to earn it!\" he laughed.",

    "summary": "Britain's Prince Andrew will not use his royal titles any longer, he said in a statement released by Buckingham Palace on Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Britain's Prince Andrew will not use his royal titles, including the Duke of York, any longer, he said in a statement released by Buckingham Palace on Friday. The announcement comes after the release of excerpts from a posthumous memoir by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who had repeatedly claimed to have been sexually trafficked by the late financier to Andrew.",
      "\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, said in the statement. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"",
      "He continued: \"With His Majesty's agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"",
      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, sued Andrew in 2021, alleging that he forced her to engage in sexual acts against her will when she was 17 years old. The two reached an out-of-court settlement in 2022. Andrew has denied the allegations.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Guiffre's family said they believe Prince Andrew's decision to give up his royal titles is \"vindication for our sister and survivors everywhere.\" They called on Charles to strip him of the title of prince.",
      "\"This moment serves as victory for Virginia, who consistently maintained, 'He knows what happened, I know what happened, and there's only one of us telling the truth, and I know that's me,'\" the statement said. \"This is not just a victory for her, but for every single survivor of the horrific crimes perpetrated by Epstein and his co-conspirators.\"",
      "Giuffre was one of the most vocal accusers of Epstein, a convicted sex offender, and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty of helping Epstein groom, recruit and sexually abuse underage girls. Giuffre alleged Maxwell connected her with Epstein, which Maxwell denies.",
      "In an excerpt of her memoir published by The Guardian, Giuffre describes her alleged encounters with Andrew in detail.",
      "\"He was friendly enough, but still entitled \u2014 as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she wrote. \"The next morning, Maxwell told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun.' Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy.'\"",
      "Andrew, once second in line to the British throne, has long been a source of tabloid fodder because of his links to Epstein, other questionable characters and money woes.",
      "His attempt to refute Giuffre's allegations backfired during a November 2019 BBC interview. Viewers saw a prince who proffered curious rebuttals \u2014 such as disputing Giuffre's recollection of sweaty dancing by saying he was medically incapable of perspiring \u2014 and showed no empathy for the women who said Epstein abused them.",
      "Within days of the interview, Andrew stepped down from his royal duties.",
      "As well as no longer being known as the Duke of York, Andrew will also give up other titles: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.",
      "He will remain a prince, which he has been entitled to since birth."

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/grand-sumo-tournament-london-second-time-outside-japan/",
    "published": "Sat, 18 Oct 2025 10:01:26 -0400",
    "summary": "The Grand Sumo Tournament is rumbling London's iconic Royal Albert Hall in a rare foreign foray for Japan's centuries-old sport.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The world of professional sumo wrestling stepped outside of Japan for only the second time in its centuries-long history on Wednesday night, as fighters clashed on a specially constructed ring in the middle of London's Royal Albert Hall.",
      "The iconic venue in the British capital is hosting the Grand Sumo Tournament\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the roughly 1,500-year-old sport's most important competition\u00a0\u2014\u00a0for the second time, drawing more than 44 professional wrestlers, or rikishi, to compete in 100 bouts over five days. The only other time the tournament was held outside Japan was in 1991, when it also came to the Royal Albert Hall.",
      "There are unique challenges in bringing sumo to London, as the contemporary national sport of Japan is rooted in two millennia of tradition, interwoven with the Shinto religion, and thus treated with the utmost respect and protection to ensure adherence to its rituals and norms.",
      "\"One of the things that we've worked really hard at is to make sure that we have a good understanding of the cultural and religious significance that sumo has,\" Matthew Todd, the Royal Albert Hall's programming director, told CBS News.",
      "He said attention to detail was \"really critical to the authentic presentation that we're able to make here.\"",
      "That meant shipping 11 tons of clay from Japan to construct the ring, or dohyo, in the center of the concert venue, where the wrestlers compete. Shipping containers were at sea for three months making the voyage. A big team of ring attendants (yobidashi), also had to make the trip from Japan\u00a0\u2014\u00a0alongside 11 interpreters to help them communicate with British workers.",
      "The roof for the dohyo, now suspended from the Albert Hall ceiling, was built in Britain, but its design is taken straight from traditional Japanese Shinto shrines, which, according to Todd, \"helps to show that this is a sacred area,\" in which routines and holy ceremonies are conducted as part of the tournament.",
      "It's a vital step, he said, to ensure the Shinto gods are paid their due respects before the fights.",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Sumo is deeply intertwined with Japanese culture and religion in ways that many Western sports fans may find difficult to comprehend. According to legend, it originated as a ritual to ask the gods for a bountiful harvest, but it transformed over almost 2,000 years into the sport it is today, drawing competitors still primarily from Japan, but also from around the world.",
      "Many of the most recent champions have been from Mongolia, and this year's tournament features two rikishi from Ukraine. While Americans have competed successfully in past tournaments, there are no U.S. rikishi competing in this year's event in London.",
      "The nuance of the wrestling competition itself can also be difficult to fully grasp, with 82 winning techniques called kimarite, numerous ranks and divisions and a host of other rules. So to help translate all this for a largely Western audience, in-ear English language commentary is provided at the Royal Albert Hall, alongside video replay screens to describe and explain the bouts, which can sometimes end in just seconds when a competitor is forced out of the ring.",
      "The wrestlers themselves live an incredibly regimented life. They are forbidden from driving cars and, somewhat counterintuitively, eating breakfast, and are normally required to take a long nap after their hefty lunch, to help them pack on the pounds.",
      "The average weight of a rikishi is about 330 pounds, but some tip the scales at 550.",
      "They have been given some leave during their visit to the British capital to enjoy themselves, however\u00a0\u2014\u00a0with organizers likely seeing the value in some degree of publicity.",
      "During the lead-up to the tournament, social media platforms were full of photos and videos of the traditionally kimono-clad wrestlers sightseeing around London.",
      "The Albert Hall will also be graced this week by the presence of two yokozuna, the highest ranking of all sumo wrestlers. The word yokozuna is generally translated as grand champion, but it translates literally to \"horizontal rope,\" in a reference to the special rope worn around their waists to display their rank.",
      "Once a rikishi is promoted to the rank of yokozuna, they keep it until retirement. In nearly 400 years of professional sumo, only 75 men have attained the vaunted grand champion status. The honor typically requires not only multiple consecutive championship wins, but approval by a dedicated council that judges rikishi on their wrestling skills, but also a range of other personal attributes.",
      "The tournament is due to end on Sunday, when the wrestler with the most victories in the ring will be crowned this year's champion.",
      "The field is considered wide open this year, but many, especially back at home in Japan, will be hoping for 25-year-old Yokozuna Onosato, the country's first grand champion in almost a decade, to emerge victorious."

      "Frehley died peacefully surrounded by family in Morristown, New Jersey, following a recent fall at his home, his agent said.",
      "Family members said in a statement\u00a0that they are \"completely devastated and heartbroken.\"",
      "\"In his last moments, we were fortunate enough to have been able to surround him with loving, caring, peaceful words, thoughts, prayers and intentions as he left this earth,\" Frehley's family said. \"We cherish all of his finest memories, his laughter, and celebrate his strengths and kindness that he bestowed upon others. The magnitude of his passing is of epic proportions, and beyond comprehension. Reflecting on all of his incredible life achievements, Ace's memory will continue to live on forever!\"",
      "Frehley's former Kiss bandmates, Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons, said in a statement they were \"devastated\" by Frehley's passing.",
      "\"He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history,\" the two said. \"He is and will always be a part of KISS's legacy. Our thoughts are with Jeanette, Monique and all those who loved him, including our fans around the world.\"",
      "Frehley is the first death among the four founding members.",

Doctors advised Frehley not to travel following his fall, Ostrosky said.",
      "Born in 1951 in the Bronx, Frehley grew up surrounded by music and received his first electric guitar as a Christmas present in 1964. Before joining Kiss, he played in local bands around New York City and was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix at age 18.",
      "Frehley co-founded Kiss in 1973 alongside Stanley, Simmons and Peter Criss. He played on many of Kiss' classic albums, including \"Destroyer,\" \"Rock and Roll Over\" and \"Love Gun.\" Today, Kiss has more gold albums than any other American band and has sold more than 100 million records worldwide.",
      "Kiss, whose hits include \"Rock and Roll All Nite\" and \"Detroit Rock City,\" was known for its intense stage shows, which included fireworks, smoke and eruptions of fake blood performed by band members in black-and-white painted faces, platform boots and black wigs.",
      "Band members took on the personas of comic book-style characters \u2014 Frehley was known as \"Space Ace\" and the \"Spaceman.\" The New York-born entertainer often experimented with pyrotechnics, making his guitars glow, emit smoke and shoot rockets from the headstock.",
      "The band was extremely popular, especially in the mid-1970s, selling tens of millions of albums and licensing its iconic look to sell numerous products. \"Beth\" was its biggest commercial hit in the U.S., peaking at No. 7 on the Billboard Top 100 in 1976.",
      "Frehley later released his first solo album, \"Ace Frehley,\" in 1978, and his song \"New York Groove\" quickly became a hit. Frehley frequently feuded with Stanley and Simmons through the years and left Kiss in 1982 to form the band Frehley's Comet and later continued recording under his own name.",
      "In 1996, Frehley rejoined Kiss for their 1996 reunion tour but left again in the early 2000s. The band continued with replacement members wearing the Frehley and Criss makeup and costumes. Kiss performed a\u00a0farewell tour in 2023.",
      "When the original four entered the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, a dispute scrapped plans for them to perform. Simmons and Stanley objected to Criss and Frehley being inducted instead of then-guitarist Tommy Thayer and then-drummer Eric Singer.",
      "Simmons told Rolling Stone magazine that year that Frehley and Criss \"no longer deserve to wear the paint.\" \"The makeup is earned,\" he added. \"Just being there at the beginning is not enough.\"",
      "Frehley and Kiss also had a huge influence on the glammy style of 1980s so-called hair metal bands, including M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Poison.",
      "\"Ace, my brother, I surely cannot thank you enough for the years of great music, the many festivals we've done together and your lead guitar on Nothing But A Good Time,\" Poison front man\u00a0Bret Michaels\u00a0wrote Thursday on Instagram.",
      "As the Kennedy Center's new chair, President Trump named Kiss as one of this year's honorees.",
      "In 2024, the band sold its catalog, brand name and intellectual property to Swedish company Pophouse Entertainment Group in a deal estimated to be more than $300 million."

    "summary": "With open enrollment starting soon, employees could get sticker shock, with their costs expected to rise 6% to 7% for 2026, a new study says.",
    "story": [
      "Open enrollment \u2014 the annual window when employees can adjust their benefits \u2014 may deliver sticker shock this year. Workers are likely to pay between 6% to 7% more for their 2026 employer-sponsored health insurance, more than double the current rate of inflation, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from consultant Mercer.",
      "That means employees could pay about $2,400 next year for single coverage in an employer-provided preferred provider organization, or PPO, the most common type of medical plan, Mercer said. Families would likely face paycheck deductions of $8,900 a year for their coverage, according to the group, whose projections are based on a survey of more than 1,700 employers.",
      "More working-age Americans receive health insurance through their employers than any other source, with about 60% \u2014 or 164.7 million people \u2014 covered by their workplaces, according to KFF.",
      "Companies, which typically pick up the bulk of their employees' health insurance costs, are likely to spend more than $18,000 on average to insure each worker in 2026, Mercer told CBS News. Workers typically shoulder between 16% to 25% of the total, depending on whether they are receiving single or family coverage, according to KFF's\u00a02024 employer health benefits survey.",
      "The findings come as American households continue to feel squeezed by rising prices, with inflation inching higher this year on everything from groceries to housing. The jump in health insurance costs are partly due to an aging workforce that's tapping more medical services, as well as increased demand for costly treatments such as the GLP-1 drugs used for weight loss, Mercer Chief Actuary Sunit Patel said.",
      "Employees \"might also see an increase in the cost-sharing provisions in the design as well \u2014 higher co-pays, higher deductibles \u2014 so it's getting hit on both ends,\" Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer, told CBS News.",
      "Employees who receive their health insurance through their employers will soon learn their new costs when open enrollment begins, which typically runs for several weeks in the fall but varies by company.",
      "Health care prices aren't likely to ease soon, Patel added, pointing to higher provider wages, inflation in medical goods, and an older workforce, as ongoing pressures. \"We think costs are pretty sticky right now,\" he said.",
      "Financial squeeze",
      "Americans pay double what residents in other developed nations pay for health care, even though outcomes in the U.S. are worse than those in other countries, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation noted in an August\u00a0analysis.",
      "In addition to an aging workforce and inflation, the complexity of the U.S. health care system is also driving those costs higher, noted Peterson. On top of that, growing consolidation amongst health insurers has made the market less competitive, resulting in higher costs, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a\u00a0December report.",
      "Higher health care costs could add to the financial squeeze felt by many families, who are already coping with higher grocery, utility and housing prices, noted Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal-leaning economic think tank.",
      "A KFF poll in July found that 4 in 10 insured adults under 65 years old worry about affording their monthly health insurance.",
      "\"You can't really go without health care, so something else will have to give,\" Owens said. That could mean cutting \"a family vacation, a family trip to a soccer game, or putting groceries on the credit card so you can clear the health care premiums.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically purchased by Americans, likely rose 3.1% on an annual basis in September, an uptick from August's 2.9% annual rate, according to economists polled by FactSet. The September inflation data will be released on Oct. 24."

      "\"Reaching $38 trillion in debt during a government shutdown is the latest troubling sign that lawmakers are not meeting their basic fiscal duties,\" Michael A. Peterson, CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a nonpartisan nonprofit focused on fiscal policy, said in a statement.",

    "summary": "New tax cuts in the Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill\" act are retroactive to 2025, which means many Americans may get bigger refunds in early 2026. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Many Americans could see heftier tax refunds next year when they file their 2025 tax returns, largely due to new provisions enacted through the Republicans' \"one big, beautiful bill\" act that are retroactive to the start of the current year, according to an analysis from Oxford Economics.",
      "Total taxpayer savings could amount to an additional $50 billion through bigger tax refunds or a cut in their 2026 taxes, Oxford lead economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in the Oct. 21 report.",
      "A $50 billion boost in tax refunds would represent an 18% increase from the $275 billion in refunds the IRS sent this year to nearly 94 million taxpayers who overpaid on their 2024 federal tax returns, according to data\u00a0from the agency. The average refund in 2025 was $2,939, according to the IRS.",
      "The \"big, beautiful bill,\" signed into law by Mr. Trump in July, extended the tax reductions enacted under th 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. But the new law also added an array of new breaks, such as eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income. It also lifted the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, from $10,000 to $40,000, a change that is expected to primarily help higher-income Americans.",
      "Although the tax changes are effective this year, the IRS hasn't yet updated its\u00a0withholding tables, which provide guidance to employers on how much in federal tax to withhold from their employees' paychecks, Vanden Houten wrote. As a result, many taxpayers are unlikely to have taken the step of lowering their withholding amounts on their own, she noted.",
      "\"[M]any taxpayers will pay too much in tax this year and see larger tax refunds or smaller tax bills next year than otherwise would be the case,\" Vanden Houten said, adding that will likely produce a \"windfall at tax time in 2026 through larger refunds and lower tax bills.\"",
      "The Oxford analysis doesn't estimate the average size of individual tax refunds next year, but it noted that a \"disproportionate share of the benefits will accrue to upper-income households.\"",
      "That echoes earlier analyses from tax specialists who said that higher-income Americans are likely to see a bigger relative boost from the new tax law compared with lower-income households. For instance, $6 of every $10 in new tax breaks from the \"big, beautiful bill\" will go to the top 20% of households, or people with incomes over $217,000 per year, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis published in July.",
      "Wealthy households also will benefit from the higher SALT cap, which can only be tapped by tax filers who itemize \u2014 typically high-income households with sizable deductions that surpass the standard deduction. That boost from the bigger SALT break will deliver an extra $5.1 billion in total tax savings, Oxford estimated.",
      "Seniors are also likely to enjoy a bigger tax refund in early 2026, with the new $6,000 deduction for people over 65 years old under the \"big, beautiful bill\" providing as much as $9.3 billion in tax savings, the Oxford estimated."

      "By contrast, delaying Social Security until age 70 results in a roughly 24% higher monthly payment than if you claimed benefits at age 67 \u2014 also locked in as long you're collecting benefits. As a result, financial experts often recommend that seniors hold off as long as they can, with one study finding that filing early for benefits can cost $182,000 in foregone payments.",
      "The Schroders survey\u00a0suggests that many Americans who haven't yet retired aren't buying that advice. In the survey of 1,500 adults, most respondents said they understand the trade-offs of claiming early, but only 10% plan to wait until age 70, while 44% expect to file for benefits before they reach full retirement age.",
      "Social Security provides an online calculator that lets users plug in their birthdate, then calculate the percentage difference in their monthly payment based on the age at which they plan to claim the retirement benefit.",
      "Another\u00a0new study, released Tuesday by the Allianz Center for the Future of Retirement, finds that a majority of Americans say they don't know much about Social Security or how it will fit into their retirement plan. And about 1 in 5 believe Social Security will provide all the retirement income they need, even though it generally replaces only 40% of a worker's wages when they retire, the study found.",
      "\"Not an oversight\"",
      "The disconnect illustrates the financial reality facing most workers, Deb Boyden, head of U.S. defined contribution at Schroders, told CBS News.",
      "\"The decision to sacrifice extra Social Security income is not an oversight for most Americans,\" she said. \"According to our research, 70% of Americans are aware that waiting longer to claim Social Security leads to higher payments, and yet so few are willing to hold off.\"",
      "Many retirees are facing a shortfall in their own retirement savings, a financial gap that's been well documented as a growing share of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Many workers \"need the income generated by Social Security to meet their expenses immediately upon retiring,\" Boyden noted.",
      "Why many seniors start Social Security early",
      "While the advice to wait as long as possible to claim Social Security makes financial sense, it also doesn't fully account for people's individual needs and circumstances. Many older adults claim benefits early out of financial necessity, while others may do so because health issues or chronic conditions lead them to expect a shorter-than-average lifespan.",
      "Some seniors also weigh the so-called break-even point \u2014 the age at which the total money you've collected from starting benefits early equals what you would have collected if you had delayed claiming Social Security in oder to get a higher monthly check. In other words, someone who starts collecting at 62 will have banked eight years of benefits, as opposed to claiming at age 70.",
      "Based on today's average monthly Social Security benefit of $2,000, that early claimer would receive a reduced benefit of about $1,400 a month. Over the following eight years, that would amount to $134,400 in total benefits received by the time the person started collecting Social Security at age 70.",
      "By filing for benefits at 70, that individual would receive a monthly payment $2,480, but it would take 10.4 years for the extra amount in their monthly payment to surpass the $134,400 that an early filer collected in the prior eight years. That makes the break-even age about 80.4 years old.",
      "The upshot: Some seniors, especially those with health issues, might decide they're unlikely to reach that break-even age and opt to have money in their pockets earlier rather than waiting to start collecting Social Security.",
      "The average life expectancy for a 62-year-old man today is an additional 22 years, or about age 83.6, while a woman the same age is expected to live to around 86.5, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "Concerns about Social Security's future",
      "There's another reason why many Americans plan on claiming their Social Security benefits before reaching full retirement age, she added. That's due to concerns about the future of Social Security, which is fueling concerns that \"the money may not be there if they wait,\" Boyden said.",
      "Social Security is indeed facing a financial crunch, with an aging U.S. population resulting in its payments now outpacing contributions from workers. Without changes to the program, that will result in its trust funds becoming insolvent by 2034, according to the most recent calculation from the Social Security Board of Trustees.",
      "Yet many people wrongly believe that means Social Security will halt payments if the trust funds become insolvent. Payments would continue in such an event, but benefits would be reduced by about 20% \u2014 a potentially major financial hit to the program's more than 70 million beneficiaries.",
      "Still, there are ways lawmakers can shore up the program, such as by raising the income cap on Social Security taxes, which stands at $176,100, according to experts. Earnings over that amount are exempt from the payroll tax, which funds Social Security.",
      "In the meantime, non-retired Americans told Schroders they believe they need $5,032 in monthly income to retire comfortably. But today's retirees on average generate about $3,250 in monthly retirement income, Boyden said, adding that the gap signals the need to help workers plan better for retirement.",
      "A recent analysis from Goldman Sachs found three-quarters of younger working Americans say they're struggling to save for retirement because basic expenses such as housing are eating up a bigger share of their income compared with prior generations."

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 13:09:21 -0400",
    "summary": "A lapse in funding due to the shutdown could have a devastating effect on the millions of Americans who rely on the federal food stamps program for groceries.",
    "story": [
      "States are warning struggling Americans who rely on food stamps to pay for groceries that they may miss out on benefits come November.",
      "\"Starting October 16, SNAP [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] benefits will not be paid until the federal government shutdown ends and funds are released to PA,\" reads a\u00a0notice from the Pennsylvania state website.",
      "New Jersey,\u00a0Maryland, New York and\u00a0Texas are among the other states that have issued similar notices.",
      "The wave of announcements come after the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal food stamps program, issued a letter to state agencies on Oct. 10 saying that if the lapse in appropriations continues, there will be \"insufficient funds\" to pay full November SNAP benefits.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS News to the USDA, which then shared the letter it sent to states. Both declined to comment on what a lapse in funding could mean for the millions of Americans who rely on the program.",
      "Advocates and SNAP recipients have warned the effects of being cut off from nutrition assistance could be devastating.",
      "Gina Plata-Nino, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit focused on ending hunger, said delayed SNAP benefits would mean individuals have to make extreme choices such as whether to pay their rent or feed their kids. Many recipients, she said, are living paycheck to paycheck and that's the reason they depend on SNAP.",
      "According to the USDA, 73% of SNAP recipients had a gross monthly income at or below 100% of the poverty level in fiscal year 2023.",
      "While the majority of beneficiaries are not expected to work while on SNAP, primarily because they are children, older adults or disabled people, most SNAP participants who can work do so, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research and policy institute, said in an April report.",
      "How SNAP benefits are normally administered",
      "Over 40 million Americans are enrolled in SNAP. Recipients, on average, receive a payment of $187 (or roughly $6 per day) on prepaid cards that they can use\u00a0to buy produce, meat, dairy and other household food staples.",
      "While SNAP is a federally funded program run by the USDA, states are responsible for administering benefits and setting their own disbursement dates. As described by The Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) on its website, the program is a \"delicate partnership of public and private entities.\"",
      "To ensure benefits are available at the first of every month, states send electronic case files with information on SNAP recipients on a monthly basis to an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) vendor so they can process the data and load recipients' cards.",
      "\"EBT processors have to get all of this data in time,\" Plata-Nino explained. \"They need to be able to process the payment so when that person utilizes their card at that EBT retailer, the money will be there for the retailer to be able to swipe.\"",
      "The shutdown, however, has thrown a wrench in the process. In its letter to state agencies on Oct. 10, the USDA directed states to hold off on sending electronic files to EBT vendors \"until further notice.\" The pause opens the door to possible delays and disruptions in November benefits.",
      "That could be an issue for SNAP recipients like Deb Powers, a 66-year-old Massachusetts resident who receives around $260 a month in SNAP benefits. Powers said she'll be OK if benefits don't come through in November, but a longer delay would force her to change how she shops. The fresh produce she buys to keep a healthy diet would no longer be in her budget, she said.",
      "\"Letting people go hungry is a choice, and it's not a good one,\" Powers told CBS News.",
      "Contingency funding",
      "One way for the USDA to cover SNAP costs, explained Plata-Nino, would be for the agency to tap into its contingency funds. According to FRAC, the reserve stood at $6 billion during the Biden administration.",
      "After Democrats and Republicans\u00a0failed to come to an agreement to extend government funding on Oct. 1, 2025, the USDA said in its Lapse of Funding\u00a0plan that the SNAP program has been provided for with multiyear contingency funds that could be used to cover state administrative expenses during a federal government shutdown.",
      "\"These multiyear contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year,\" the plan states.",
      "However, it's unclear if the USDA plans to utilize those funds to ensure November SNAP benefits. The agency did not respond to CBS News' request for comment on whether that option is under consideration.",
      "During the government shutdowns in 2018 and 2019, the USDA disbursed SNAP funds early to prevent benefits from running out, Plata-Nino said.",
      "\"This administration didn't do any of that [this time], but they still have the contingency funding ...\" Plata-Nino said. \"They have the money, so it really is a policy choice.\"",
      "It's also possible states could attempt to free up money from their own budgets to bridge the gap, although approval would be an uphill battle given that it costs tens to hundreds of millions of dollars monthly to cover SNAP benefits. Whether states would get that money back is unclear.",
      "Peter Hadler, the deputy commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Social Services, told lawmakers in his state Thursday that he doesn't expect the federal government to ever reimburse states.",
      "The fate of WIC funding",
      "Another social safety net program that could be affected by the government shutdown is the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. Known as WIC, the program provides nutrition assistance, including infant formula, to around 6.7 million people.",
      "The National WIC Association (NWA), the nonprofit education arm for the government program, warned Tuesday that millions of families could lose access to their WIC benefits as early as Nov. 1, when certain state agencies are set to run out of funds.",
      "The group said the White House provided temporary emergency funds that will stabilize the program through Oct. 31, but noted that those funds are rapidly depleting. To keep the programing running for the first two weeks of November, an additional $300 million is needed, according to NWA.",
      "\"Without additional funding, State WIC Agencies may be forced to take drastic measures that prevent families from accessing the services they need, such as halting food benefits,\" NWA said in a statement."

    "story": [
      "Guidance from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) clarifies that a $100,000 fee imposed in September to obtain H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers applies only to new applicants who are living abroad.",
      "In a notice\u00a0posted\u00a0on the agency's website late Monday, USCIS explains what types of visa applicants must pay the new six-figure fee and who is exempt. Applications for H-1B visas filed on or after Sept. 21 for workers outside the U.S. and who are not current H-1B visa holders are subject to the $100,000 charge, USCIS said.",
      "The fee also applies if a petition filed on or after Sept. 21 \"requests consular notification, port of entry notification or pre-flight inspection for an alien in the United States.\"",
      "The $100,000 payment must be paid prior to applying for an H-1B visa, according to USCIS.",
      "Importantly for employers, the fee does not apply when a visa applicant files to move from one type of visa to another, such as from an F-1 visa for non-U.S. students to H-1B status.",
      "The White House had previously said the fee would apply to all new H-1B visa applicants, with exemptions for some specialized workers who do not \"pose a threat to the security or welfare\" of the U.S.",
      "In announcing the new H-1B policy on Sept. 19, President Trump said the new fee was necessary \"to address the abuse of that program while still permitting companies to hire the best of the best temporary foreign workers.\" He also said some employers take advantage of the visa program to undercut U.S. workers' wages by hiring lower-paid foreign workers.",
      "The Trump administration has said the $100,000 fee for foreign employees to obtain an H-1B visa will compel U.S. companies to hire Americans, instead of relying on labor from overseas. Many economists, however, expect mixed results.",
      "In the short term, some U.S. technology workers could see their job prospects improve, as employers turn away from foreign labor because of the hefty fee attached. Other research, however, such as a 2024\u00a0study\u00a0on the impact of U.S. immigration on employment, from the nonprofit IZA Institute of Labor Economics, found that H-1B workers actually \"help firms increase their employment,\" and that every H-1B worker a company hired helped produce additional job gains, which includes domestic hires.",
      "Earlier this month, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sued the Trump administration over the foreign worker visa fee, calling it unlawful. It was the second complaint to be filed challenging the fee, with a coalition of health care groups and labor unions also challenging the policy's legality in a\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0filed in October."

    "summary": "Experts say the incident revealed what can happen when a such a broad spectrum of companies rely on singular cloud provider.",
    "story": [
      "The 15-hour\u00a0disruption to Amazon Web Services, a cloud-based computing service, on Monday shook internet users around the world, disrupting everything from travel to financial transactions \u2014 and underscoring the fragility of a system reliant on only a handful of tech giants.",
      "Monday's problems at Amazon Web Services, or AWS, spawned 11 million total outage reports, with 3 million reports stemming from U.S. users, Downdetector, a website that tracks online outages,\u00a0said\u00a0on Facebook.",
      "While other cloud providers support the world's businesses \u2014 including Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure \u2014 AWS has the largest foothold in the market. Since it debuted in 2006, the company has grown to control 38% of the cloud computing infrastructure market,\u00a0according to research and advisory firm Gartner.",
      "Experts say Monday's outage reveals the vulnerabilities of a system where a small number of companies provide such a large chunk of the internet's backbone.",
      "\"[The] outage is a stark reminder of the massive 'concentration risk' the global economy has accepted by building on a handful of cloud providers,\" Dave McCarthy, who leads global research for cloud services at the International Data Corporation, told CBS News.",
      "AWS' rolodex of customers include government departments, universities and businesses, and platforms such as Venmo, Netflix and Snapchat.",
      "\"Frankly, many customers may have been unaware that a service they used relied upon AWS and are only learning that now, due to system failures,\" said Craig Shue, a professor and the head of the computer science department at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.",
      "As Shue explained, companies that are not technology-centric may seek out a cloud service like AWS to host their web servers and databases, allowing them to focus on their day-to-day operations. Amazon, meanwhile,\u00a0 handles the more technical aspects such as server maintenance and responses to fluctuations in customer demand, he added.",
      "Amazon declined to comment directly on the incident, instead sharing a statement from their\u00a0website\u00a0published on Oct. 20.",
      "How the AWS outage started",
      "The outage started Monday morning in Northern Virginia, home to AWS' oldest and biggest cloud computing hub in the U.S. AWS refers to the cluster of data centers in Virginia as US-EAST-1. The company also has cloud computing hubs in California, Ohio and Oregon.",
      "According to expert accounts and Amazon's own\u00a0explanation, the issue was partially tied to AWS' domain name system (DNS) servers. As Shue explained, this is the part of the internet that takes domain names like Amazon.com and converts them to IP addresses, numerical labels that identify locations on the internet.",
      "The service can be used to distribute traffic to multiple servers to make things faster, Shue said.",
      "\"It is akin to waiting in a checkout line that then splits off to multiple cashier lanes,\" Shue explained. \"A staff member can direct the customer at the front of the line to the first available server that can handle the job.\"",
      "This function was disrupted on Monday, leading to a backlog of server requests without anything to route them. It's still unclear how the disruption began, experts said.",
      "For people on the ground, this meant they were unable to carry out simple web-based functions like checking their flight time on an airline app or sending a payment on Venmo.",
      "While the issue started in the eastern U.S. region, its effects were global. Experts say it's difficult to quantify the impact in dollar figures. McCarthy, however, noted that it appears to be one of the most significant outages in recent years.",
      "Amazon said that the issue was resolved around 6 p.m. EDT on Monday, or more than 15 hours after the company first reported a problem on the AWS Health Dashboard, where it tracks service disruptions.",
      "\"This wasn't a minor glitch; it was a cascading failure originating in US-EAST-1, the very nerve center of AWS, which took down everything from gaming and social media to critical financial and educational platforms,\" he said.",
      "Will the outage impact AWS?",
      "While the incident may have sparked a small reckoning with cloud services, it's not expected to shake up the landscape too much, experts told CBS News.",
      "McCarthy doesn't expect the outage to lead to a mass exodus of AWS customers, but he said it could compel companies to diversify their cloud services so they're not reliant on a single provider. That way if one goes down, the company can still keep some operations going."

    "story": [
      "Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have joined prominent computer scientists, economists, artists, evangelical Christian leaders and American conservative commentators Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck to call for a ban on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
      "The letter, released Wednesday by a politically and geographically diverse group of public figures, is squarely aimed at tech giants like Google, OpenAI and Meta Platforms that are racing each other to build a form of artificial intelligence designed to surpass humans at many tasks.",
      "The 30-word statement says, \"We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.\"",
      "In a preamble, the letter notes that AI tools may bring health and prosperity, but alongside those tools, \"many leading AI companies have the stated goal of building superintelligence in the coming decade that can significantly outperform all humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. This has raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\"",
      "Prince Harry added in a personal note that \"the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.\"",
      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\"This is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It's simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. Is that too much to ask?\"",
      "Also signing were AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, co-winners of the Turing Award, computer science's top prize. Hinton also won a Nobel Prize in physics last year. Both have been vocal in bringing attention to the dangers of a technology they helped create.",
      "But the list also has some surprises, including Bannon and Beck, in an attempt by the letter's organizers at the nonprofit Future of Life Institute to appeal to President Trump's Make America Great Again movement even as Mr. Trump's White House staff has sought to reduce limits to AI development in the U.S.",
      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",
      "Former Irish President Mary Robinson and several British and European parliamentarians signed, as did actors Stephen Fry and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and musician will.i.am, who has otherwise embraced AI in music creation.",
      "Caution urged",
      "\"Yeah, we want specific AI tools that can help cure diseases, strengthen national security, etc.,\" wrote Gordon-Levitt, whose wife Tasha McCauley served on OpenAI's board of directors before the upheaval that led to CEO Sam Altman's temporary ouster in 2023. \"But does AI also need to imitate humans, groom our kids, turn us all into slop junkies and make zillions of dollars serving ads? Most people don't want that.\"",
      "The letter is likely to provoke ongoing debates between the AI research community about the likelihood of superhuman AI, the technical paths to reach it and how dangerous it could be.",
      "\"In the past, it's mostly been the nerds versus the nerds,\" said Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"I feel what we're really seeing here is how the criticism has gone very mainstream.\"",
      "Labeling is complicating the discourse",
      "Confounding the broader debates is that the same companies that are striving toward what some call superintelligence and others call artificial general intelligence, or AGI, are also sometimes inflating the capabilities of their products, which can make them more marketable and have contributed to concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and AI scientists when its researcher claimed ChatGPT had figured out unsolved math problems \u2014 when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online.",
      "\"There's a ton of stuff that's overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn't change the fact that \u2014 zooming out \u2014 AI has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,\" Tegmark said.",
      "Tegmark's group was also behind a March 2023 letter \u2014 still in the dawn of a commercial AI boom \u2014 that called on tech giants to temporarily  pause the development of more powerful AI models. None of the major AI companies heeded that call. And the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, Elon Musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own AI startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.",
      "Asked if he reached out to Musk again this time, Tegmark said he wrote to the CEOs of all major AI developers in the U.S. but didn't expect them to sign.",
      "\"I really empathize for them, frankly, because they're so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,\" Tegmark said. \"I think that's why it's so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the U.S. government just steps in.\""

      "\"Tabs were great, but we haven't seen a lot of browser innovation since then,\" he said.",
      "What the Atlas browser can do",
      "Like other search engines, Atlas has a home page with a search bar where people can ask questions, similar to Google's landing page. Users can also toggle through different tabs across the top of the browser to find news stories, images and other content.",
      "But a few features set the browser apart, according to OpenAI. One is a ChatGPT side bar, which users can activate by clicking an \"Ask ChatGPT\" button in the upper right-hand corner of the browser.",
      "\"It's basically you inviting ChatGPT into your corner of the internet,\" said Ryan O'Rouke, the lead designer for Atlas, in OpenAI's video unveiling the browser.",
      "The technology functions like ChatGPT but takes into account what web page people are on. In practice, that means users can ask questions about whatever content they are looking at. Users can also call on the ChatGPT function while drafting emails. In the demo, O'Rouke shows how he uses it to ask for edits on an email.",
      "\"It's using the internet for you,\" Altman said.",
      "Atlas also has an \"agent mode\" that can take action on a person's behalf, armed with what it has learned from users' browsing history and what they are searching for. The agent also can help people complete a range of tasks, such as booking a flight, editing a document or ordering groceries. For now, agent mode is only available for plus and pro users, according to Altman.",
      "Competition with Google",
      "Whether Atlas will erode Google's dominance in browsing and searching the internet remains to be seen.",
      "Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, said Google is expected to generate $220 billion in search revenues this fiscal year alone. But OpenAI is a potentially formidable competitor, she noted.",
      "\"Ultimately, Google is still the leader in search, but OpenAI's move with Atlas is worth watching,\" she said.",
      "OpenAI has said ChatGPT has more than 800 million users, although the San Francisco-based company has yet to turn a profit. Google's Chrome browser has roughly 3 billion worldwide users and has been adding some AI features drawing on the company's Gemini AI technology."

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 10:12:09 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",
      "Benefit verifications",
      "Earnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefits",
      "Payee accountings",
      "Prisoner activities \u2014 suspension",
      "Requests from third parties for queries",
      "Freedom of Information Act requests",
      "IT enhancement activities, public relations and training",
      "Replacement Medicare cards",
      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News."

    "summary": "A prolonged government shutdown, as occurred in 2018, could lead to long lines at TSA checkpoints and economic losses, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",
      "Passport services are also deemed essential and would be expected to operate during a government shutdown."

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 08:41:17 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists say the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs on imports are boosting consumer prices in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Trump administration tariffs imposed this year on dozens of nations and a range of industries are fueling inflation, especially for goods that are widely imported into the U.S., a recent\u00a0analysis\u00a0shows.",
      "Product categories seeing some of the biggest price hikes due to tariffs include\u00a0furniture, car parts, electronics and musical instruments, according to economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The findings are based on research models estimating tariff-related price hikes and drawing on Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data, a widely used gauge of inflation.",
      "Importers bear the cost of tariffs, typically passing at least some of the added expenses to consumers, economic research shows.",
      "The St. Louis Fed researchers found that companies passed 35% of tariff costs onto consumers from May through July. Other research from Goldman Sachs suggests that businesses could eventually pass on as much as 55% of added tariff costs to consumers. Companies would swallow 22% of the extra costs, while foreign exporters would absorb 18% of the expenses, economists with the investment bank found.",
      "How much could inflation rise?",
      "Businesses are expected to continue experimenting with pricing based on how tariffs affect their own costs, according to Max Dvorkin, an economist and one of the authors the St. Louis Fed study.",
      "\"Even if you don't change tariffs anymore, the dynamics of prices will continue to evolve and affect consumers over the next few months,\" he said.",
      "The regional Fed bank found that tariffs account for a sizable share of recent inflation. Between June through August, the tariffs imposed by President Trump added 0.5 percentage points to the headline PCE rate, which averaged 2.85% during that period, according to the findings. The levies added 0.4 percentage points to core PCE, which excludes volatile energy and food prices and which hovered around 2.9% during that three-month period, the study found.",
      "\"Tariff measures are already exerting measurable upward pressure on consumer prices,\" the economists conclude.",
      "As of August, the Consumer Price Index was up 2.9% from a year ago after, remaining above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target. Inflation as measured by the index had fallen in April to a low of 2.3%, but has flared during the second half of the year. The Labor Department is expected to release CPI data for September, which has been delayed by the government shutdown, on Friday.",
      "The St. Louis Fed study notes that tariffs haven't driven up consumer prices as sharply as some experts had predicted. That's chiefly because many businesses are waiting to see where tariff rates settle before they adjust their prices, according to the research.",
      "\"We believe the passthrough of tariff increases by U.S. businesses to consumers remains in the early stages, delayed by stop-and-go announcements, pauses and drawn-out implementation,\" anaysts with the Wells Fargo Investment Institute said in a report on Tuesday.",
      "The White House did not respond to CBS News' request for comment. President Trump has defended his administration's trade policy, saying that it will benefit the country's manufacturing sector and boost job growth over the long-term.",
      "Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariffs will cost businesses in the U.S. an additional $1.2 trillion this year, with consumers shouldering most of those costs, according to S&P Global\u00a0analysts\u00a0who reviewed data from 9,000 companies.",
      "Companies have passed on roughly two-thirds of those tariff costs \u2014 $592 billion \u2014 to consumers in the form of higher prices, S&P said. The levies have reduced corporate earnings by a total of $315 billion."

      "The priceless jewels thieves stole from the Louvre museum in a brazen heist this week were not privately insured, France's Ministry of Culture said in a statement to the daily newspaper\u00a0Le Parisien.",
      "French law prohibits entities like the Louvre from insuring its property, except when part of a collection is moved or loaned to another institution, Romain D\u00e9chelette, president of France-based Serex Assurances, a fine art insurer, told CBS News.",
      "Because the Louvre is a national museum, its collections are considered state property for which the state alone bears responsibility, according to D\u00e9chelette. The French Ministry of Culture did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "\"Everything that belongs to state museums in France is uninsured, unless it leaves the museum,\" D\u00e9chelette told CBS News.",
      "D\u00e9chelette added that if any of the stolen crown jewels had left the museum for another exhibit, the price of insurance would have been calculated based on an estimated value.",
      "\"There is necessarily a value in the government accounts, and an estimate would be assigned with commissions and experts,\" he explained.",
      "Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau, who is investigating the incident, said Tuesday that the stolen crown jewels are worth an estimated 88 million euros, or $102 million, according to the Associated Press. That estimate doesn't account for their historical value to France",

      "The French law does not apply to collections housed in private museums, like the Foundation Louis Vuitton in Paris. \"In that case it's different, and they buy insurance,\" D\u00e9chelette said.",
      "\"The state is its own insurer as long as the works belonging to national museums remain in their usual place of storage,\" a spokesperson for the Ministry of Culture said in a statement to Le Parisien.",
      "As a result, neither the museum nor the government will receive any private insurance payments to cover the value of the stolen objects, according to D\u00e9chelette.",
      "While French authorities are likely to locate the robbery suspects, they may not ever recover the stolen national treasures, a criminologist told CBS News.",
      "\"We will catch them,\" Alain Bauer, a professor of criminology at France's National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts, told CBS News. \"I don't think we will capture the jewels.\"",
      "While the missing French crown jewels are widely considered to be priceless based on their historical value, they could be broken up into pieces, with the gems sold for millions on the black market, experts have told CBS News.",
      "The heist raises concerns about the national museum's security vulnerabilities. According to a recent security audit, 35% of the rooms in the Denon Wing, where the stolen jewels are displayed, are not monitored by security cameras, Radio France reported."

      "\"There is tremendous concern over technology, how it's being adopted and how it will impact people's jobs in the future,\" Susan Houseman, a senior economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research and a contributor to the the report, told CBS News. \"The research indicates that they lack input on these issues.\"",
      "The degree of autonomy employees have in their jobs also shapes their daily routine and can affect their overall work-life balance, Jobs for the Future found. More than six in 10 employees said they lack control over their schedules, while more than half of workers said they often or sometimes work more than scheduled."

Eight objects were taken, according to officials: a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a matching set linked to 19th-century French queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense; an emerald necklace and earrings from the matching set of Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte's second wife; a reliquary brooch; and Empress Eug\u00e9nie's diadem and her large corsage-bow brooch, a prized 19th-century imperial ensemble.",
      "Alain Bauer, a professor of criminology at France's National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts, told CBS News that a lot of DNA was left at the scene by the robbers, including on the crown of the empress Eug\u00e9nie, which was left behind by the thieves as they made their getaway on motorcycles.",
      "\"We will catch them,\" he said of the thieves. But he added: \"I don't think we will capture the jewels.\"",
      "The crown jewels are priceless in historical terms, but experts have told CBS News they would still be worth millions of dollars if broken up and sold on the black market.",
      "The jewels were not privately insured, the French Ministry of Culture said in a statement to the daily newspaper Le Parisien. French law prohibits entities like the Louvre from insuring its property, except when part of a collection is moved or loaned to another institution, Romain D\u00e9chelette, president of France-based Serex Assurances, a fine art insurer, told CBS News."

    "published": "Tue, 21 Oct 2025 09:08:28 -0400",
    "summary": "Some people taking out a home loan and purchasing flood insurance could face delays during the U.S. government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S. government shutdown could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email."

      "Amazon says a massive outage of its cloud computing service has been resolved as of Monday evening, after a problem disrupted internet use around the world, taking down a broad range of online services, including social media, gaming, food delivery, streaming and financial platforms.",
      "The all-day disruption and the ensuing exasperation it caused served as the latest reminder that 21st century society is increasingly dependent on just a handful of companies for much of its internet technology, which seems to work reliably until it suddenly breaks down.",
      "About three hours after the outage began early Monday morning, Amazon Web Services said it was starting to recover, but it wasn't until 6 p.m. Eastern that \"services returned to normal operations,\" Amazon said on its AWS health website, where it tracks outages.",
      "Cybersecurity expert Mike Chapple said \"a slow and bumpy recovery process\" is \"entirely normal.\"",
      "Amazon pinned the outage on issues related to its domain name system that converts web addresses into IP addresses, which are numeric designations that identify locations on the internet. Those addresses allow websites and apps to load on internet-connected devices.",
      "Downdetector, a website that tracks online outages, said in a Facebook post that it received over 11 million user reports of problems at more than 2,500 companies.",
      "The Amazon division provides remote computing services to many apps, websites, governments, universities and companies. Early Monday, users reported issues with Snapchat, Roblox, Fortnite, online broker Robinhood, the McDonald's app and many others, according to Downdetector.",
      "Even Amazon's own services weren't immune. Users of the company's Ring doorbell cameras and Alexa-powered smart speakers posted on DownDetector that they weren't working, while others said they were unable to access the Amazon website or download books to their Kindle.",
      "By mid-morning, Amazon said it had started to recover, but around 1 p.m. ET, users were still reporting problems. Thousands of Venmo users reported difficulties at about 1:30 p.m. ET, while people also reported problems with AI chatbot Claude, the Wall Street Journal and Amazon services like Alexa around the same time, according to Downdetector.",
      "Some companies and apps posted on social media to alert their users that the AWS outage was impacting their services.",
      "\"An Amazon Web Services outage is impacting information in Transit app. The length of disruption is currently unknown. We apologize for any inconvenience,\" said RTC Southern Nevada, the transit authority for the region, on X at 1:54 p.m. ET.",
      "The outage also had ripple effects in the travel industry, with major airline carriers\u00a0reporting issues.",
      "A Southwest spokesperson said the outage affected the airline's ability to efficiently dispatch some early morning flights, while United said it disrupted customers' access to the United app and website overnight. Delta said the issue caused a small numbers of minor delays Monday morning.",
      "The nation's railroad services were also affected. Amtrak reported at 1:30 p.m. EDT that it was experiencing \"intermittent technical difficulties\" which hobbled SMS, email and push notifications, and prevented customers from booking reservations through Amtrak.com or the mobile app.",
      "\"If you are traveling today, please arrive at your station at your regularly scheduled time typically 30 minutes prior to your train's departure,\" Amtrak said in a statement shared with CBS News.",
      "How did this start?",
      "Amazon first reported the outage issue at 3:11 a.m. ET. Shortly after, it said its services in its eastern U.S. region were disrupted and engineers were working to understand what was causing the problem. At 5:27 a.m. ET, AWS began reporting progress, saying, \"We are seeing significant signs of recovery.\"",
      "A little more than a half-hour later, it said, \"We continue to observe recovery across most\" of the affected services.",
      "AWS customers include some of the world's biggest businesses and organizations.",
      "\"So much of the world now relies on these three or four big (cloud) compute companies who provide the underlying infrastructure that when there's an issue like this, it can be really impactful across a broad range, a broad spectrum\" of online services, said Patrick Burgess, a cybersecurity expert at U.K.-based BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT.",
      "\"The world now runs on the cloud\" and the internet is seen as a utility like water or electricity as we spend so much of our lives on our smartphones, Burgess said.",
      "And because so much of the online world's plumbing is underpinned by a handful of companies, when something goes wrong \"it's very difficult for users to pinpoint what is happening because we don't see Amazon, we just see Snapchat or Roblox,\" Burgess said."

    "story": [
      "Americans are still cracking open cold ones, but what's inside their cans is changing.",
      "More people are now reaching for cannabis beverages, nonalcoholic drinks infused with tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the main ingredient in marijuana that makes you feel high. Some varieties also include cannabidiol, or CBD, a chemical compound found in marijuana or hemp that proponents say helps relieve pain, anxiety and other health symptoms. The drinks come in different forms including seltzers, juices, sodas and teas.",
      "Consumer demand for cannabis beverages is growing as Americans drink less booze. According to a July Gallup survey, the percentage of U.S. adults who say they consume alcohol fell to 54%, the lowest level since 1939, when the polling organization first started tracking people's drinking behavior. More Americans also believe even moderate alcohol consumption is unhealthy, the poll found.",
      "Hundreds of brands small and large now hawk cannabis beverages, many promising to help take the edge off in social settings.",
      "\"There's a replacement factor going on between THC beverages and wine and beer and distilled spirits,\" said Beau Whitney, chief economist at Whitney Economics, an Oregon-based consultancy focused on the cannabis and hemp industry.",
      "THC beverage sales in the U.S. are expected to grow from $1.1 billion last year to nearly $5.6 billion by 2035, according to Whitney Economics.",
      "\"The remarkable growth and innovation we're seeing in the hemp-derived beverage space is a clear sign of consumer enthusiasm and entrepreneurial success,\" Michelle Rutter Friberg, director of government relations at the National Cannabis Industry Association, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Potential health impacts, side effects",
      "Several THC beverage brands market themselves as nonalcoholic alternatives and say their drinks contain zero calories and zero sugar. Doctors, however, warn that cannabis beverages can come with side effects.",
      "Whether smoked or ingested as an edible or drink, cannabis can affect the brain, heart, lungs and mental health, CBS News medical contributor Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder said, adding that the drug can trigger anxiety, paranoia, elevated heart rate and, in rare cases, psychosis.",
      "Potential short-term effects of cannabis include issues with memory, focus and coordination, said Gounder.",
      "\"People may have trouble remembering new information, paying attention or moving smoothly,\" she said. \"This can slow reaction time, cause slurred speech, and raise the risk of car crashes by 30%-40%. The effects depend on how much cannabis is used, how it's taken and how used to it someone is.\"",
      "Heavy or long-term intake of the drug, especially in teens, can lead to lasting issues with memory, attention and decision-making, said Gounder. Long-term use, she added, can also lead to cannabis-use disorder, which is a clinical term for addiction,\u00a0defined\u00a0by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as when users are unable to stop using cannabis even though it's causing them health and social problems.",
      "Some heavy users may also develop severe nausea and vomiting, Gounder said. Those most at risk are pregnant individuals, teens, and people with mental or heart conditions, she added.",
      "The potential effects of a cannabis-infused drink can be felt in as little as 15 to 20 minutes, compared with 30 to 90 minutes for an edible, according to Dr. Staci Gruber, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, in a recent article on the school's website.",
      "\"If you are interested in trying it and it is legal for you to do so, be mindful about controlling the experience until you know how a particular product affects you,\" Gruber said.",
      "Target eyes THC segment",
      "The U.S. has a patchwork of regulations governing the sale of cannabis products, with states offering varying degrees of restrictions, including minimum-age requirements. THC beverages can be legally sold in 44 states in total, \u00a037 of which allow sales outside of the marijuana dispensary systems according to Whitney.",
      "In those areas, the beverages can commonly be found at restaurants, bars, grocery stores and liquor stores.",
      "In Atlanta, for example, Scofflaw Beverage Company \u2014 previously a brewery fighting for its financial life after the pandemic \u2014 revived its business by canning drinks without alcohol that contain 5 to 10 milligrams of hemp-derived THC, CBS News Atlanta reports. Cannabis products are legal in Georgia and can be shipped across the U.S.",
      "\"It's really been an almost seismic shift in customer preference,\" Scofflaw co-founder Matt Shirah told CBS News Atlanta. \"The THC infused business has the potential to be 10 to 20 times the size of beer business.\"",
      "Cannabis beverages have even caught the attention of major retailers like Target. The Minneapolis-based chain confirmed to CBS News that it is testing the sale of THC beverages at certain Target liquor stores in Minnesota. While other retailers, such as Total Wine & More, already sell cannabis beverages, Target is the first big-box player to explore the THC beverage market.",
      "\"At Target, we're always exploring new ways to meet our guests' evolving preferences and needs,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Whitney Economics estimates there are 500 to 750 brands marketing cannabis drinks. Of those, roughly 30 are sizable labels with national distribution, while the rest are regional and local brands, according to Diana Eberlein, chair of the Coalition for Adult Beverage Alternatives Retailers, a group that represents stakeholders in the hemp and alcohol industries.",
      "Better-known names in the space include Cycling Frog, which makes THC seltzers and edibles; Cann, which markets itself as a \"social beverage\"; and Nowadays, which employs the motto \"the future of drinking is here.\"",
      "Mainstream alcohol brands are also testing the waters. Beer makers Lagunitas Brewing and Pabst have come up with their own THC-infused beverages.",
      "Whitney and Eberlein said the cannabis drink sector is growing most rapidly among women in their 30s and early 40s who are looking for more accessible, and less caloric, alternatives to alcoholic beverages.",
      "\"They still want to have a beverage, but they don't want the high amount of calories. They don't want the alcohol, they don't want the sugar, and they don't want to have a hangover the next morning,\" Whitney said. \"They're replacing their evening glass of wine with THC beverages.\""

The upward trend continues even as delinquency rates in other loan categories \u2014 including credit card loans, personal loans and home equity loans \u2014 have declined, according to the report.",
      "\"Back in 2010, auto loans were the least risky of all products at that point in time,\" Rikard Bandebo, chief economist at VantageScore, said in a recent video. \"Now, as we look at 2025, it's actually \u2014 excluding student loans \u2014 the riskiest credit product.\"",

      "The rise in delinquency rates includes all household income groups, VantageScore's data shows. What's more, delinquency rates among prime borrowers have climbed faster than subprime borrowers on an absolute basis.",

      "VantageScore also found that the average loan amount has increased 57% over the last 15 years \u2014 a bigger jump than any other loan category, including mortgages.",
      "Why people are falling behind on payments",
      "One of the main factors hurting car owners is rapidly increasing monthly payments.\u00a0Data from the Federal Reserve shows that average monthly payments increased roughly $130 from January 2020 to January 2023, to $600. By contrast, in the three-year-period from January 2017 to January 2020, average monthly car loan payments had increased approximately $40, from $430 to $470.",
      "Payments have continued to escalate: One in five new car loans have monthly payments that exceed $1,000, according to auto researcher\u00a0Edmunds.",
      "Behind the ballooning payments are rising car prices and interest rates. The average cost of a new vehicle is now more than $50,000, according to September data from Cox Automotive \u2014 the highest it's ever been.",
      "\"Prices for both new and used vehicles surged during and after the pandemic and they haven't come down,\" Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Those higher vehicle costs have encouraged more buyers to finance their purchases, often at increased interest rates, Kates added. The average auto loan rate in September was 7% for new cars and approximately 11% for used cars, September\u00a0data\u00a0from Edmunds shows.",
      "\"The combination of elevated prices and borrowing costs has led to longer loan terms, which increase the total interest paid and raise the risk of borrowers becoming underwater as their cars depreciate faster than they pay down the loan,\" Kates said.",
      "Broader economic conditions are also influencing delinquency rates, experts have noted. Fahy from VantageScore said that in addition to higher borrowing costs, the rise in auto loan delinquencies could also be attributed to inflation and an unsteady employment picture.",
      "While inflation has cooled since its 2022 peak, many Americans are still feeling stretched by sky-high prices. A Bankrate analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data found that while the gap is narrowing, average wages are still trailing behind inflation and won't catch up until mid-2026."

Families would likely face paycheck deductions of $8,900 a year for their coverage, according to the group, whose projections are based on a survey of more than 1,700 employers.",
      "More working-age Americans receive health insurance through their employers than any other source, with about 60% \u2014 or 164.7 million people \u2014 covered by their workplaces, according to KFF.",
      "Companies, which typically pick up the bulk of their employees' health insurance costs, are likely to spend more than $18,000 on average to insure each worker in 2026, Mercer told CBS News. Workers typically shoulder between 16% to 25% of the total, depending on whether they are receiving single or family coverage, according to KFF's\u00a02024 employer health benefits survey.",
      "The findings come as American households continue to feel squeezed by rising prices, with inflation inching higher this year on everything from groceries to housing. The jump in health insurance costs are partly due to an aging workforce that's tapping more medical services, as well as increased demand for costly treatments such as the GLP-1 drugs used for weight loss, Mercer Chief Actuary Sunit Patel said.",
      "Employees \"might also see an increase in the cost-sharing provisions in the design as well \u2014 higher co-pays, higher deductibles \u2014 so it's getting hit on both ends,\" Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer, told CBS News.",
      "Employees who receive their health insurance through their employers will soon learn their new costs when open enrollment begins, which typically runs for several weeks in the fall but varies by company.",
      "Health care prices aren't likely to ease soon, Patel added, pointing to higher provider wages, inflation in medical goods, and an older workforce, as ongoing pressures. \"We think costs are pretty sticky right now,\" he said.",
      "Financial squeeze",
      "Americans pay double what residents in other developed nations pay for health care, even though outcomes in the U.S. are worse than those in other countries, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation noted in an August\u00a0analysis.",
      "In addition to an aging workforce and inflation, the complexity of the U.S. health care system is also driving those costs higher, noted Peterson. On top of that, growing consolidation amongst health insurers has made the market less competitive, resulting in higher costs, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a\u00a0December report.",
      "Higher health care costs could add to the financial squeeze felt by many families, who are already coping with higher grocery, utility and housing prices, noted Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal-leaning economic think tank.",
      "A KFF poll in July found that 4 in 10 insured adults under 65 years old worry about affording their monthly health insurance.",
      "\"You can't really go without health care, so something else will have to give,\" Owens said. That could mean cutting \"a family vacation, a family trip to a soccer game, or putting groceries on the credit card so you can clear the health care premiums.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically purchased by Americans, likely rose 3.1% on an annual basis in September, an uptick from August's 2.9% annual rate, according to economists polled by FactSet. The September inflation data will be released on Oct. 24."

      "Frozen meals served to students across the United States as part of federally-funded school breakfast and lunch programs may be contaminated with listeria and have been recalled, officials announced on Saturday.",
      "The recall applied to approximately 91,585 pounds of prepackaged breakfast burritos and wraps, manufactured by the California company M.C.I. Foods between Sept. 17 and Oct. 14,\u00a0said the Food Safety and Inspection Service, a branch of the U.S. Department of Agriculture that focuses on public health regulations.",
      "Its announcement cited seven different types of frozen breakfast products that could be tainted. They are distributed to low-income students around the country as part of the National School Breakfast and Lunch Programs, which the Department of Agriculture administers. The breakfast program served more than 14 million children in 2016, and close to 30 million children participated in the lunch program in 2019, according to the department.",
      "There are no confirmed reports of illnesses tied to the recalled products, which include burritos and wraps sold by the brands El Mas Fino, Los Cabos and Midamar and contain egg, cheese and various meats like beef, ham, sausage and turkey, according to the Food Safety and Inspection Service. The agency said it recalled those products after the manufacturer discovered listeria while conducting routine testing on egg ingredients from its external suppliers.",
      "\"FSIS is concerned that some product may be in institutional refrigerators of freezers,\" said the agency. \"Institutions are urged not to serve these products. These products should be thrown away.\"",
      "Listeria is an infection caused by bacteria of the same name that spreads through food. Fever, headache, stiff neck, muscle aches, confusion, loss of balance and a range of gastrointestinal problems are some of the symptoms brought on by the illness,\u00a0according to the Mayo Clinic. The clinic warns that pregnant women, newborns, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are at the highest risk of developing a harmful infection.",
      "People can be infected with listeria without becoming seriously ill, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency has estimated that listeria is the third leading cause of death from foodborne illness in the U.S., with 1,250 people contracting the infection and 172 dying from the infection each year.",
      "Public health officials note that flu-like symptoms caused by listeria can signal an \"invasive\" infection, meaning one that has spread from the gastrointestinal tract, where symptoms may start, to other parts of the body. These invasive infections typically develop within two months of eating contaminated food, according to the CDC.",
      "Multiple listeria outbreaks have been reported just this month. One impacted meal kits from the food subscription service HelloFresh\u00a0and another forced the recall of nearly 245,000 pounds of precooked pasta, from the California company Nate's Fine Foods, which turned deadly and potentially contaminated dozens of different products sold in grocery stores nationwide"

      "One of the U.S. officials said the Border Patrol agents would stage at the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda, roughly 15 miles from San Francisco. That plan was reported earlier Wednesday by The San Francisco Chronicle. The Department of Homeland Security oversees Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Coast Guard.",
      "The U.S. officials said Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, one of the most visible faces of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, is expected to be involved in the operation. Bovino is currently leading Border Patrol arrests in Chicago, where a judge on Monday ordered him to answer questions about agents' use of force during those operations. He also oversaw the agency's controversial immigration raids in the Los Angeles area this summer.",

As it does every day, DHS law enforcement will enforce the laws of our nation.\"",
      "In a video posted on social media Wednesday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, denounced the Trump administration's plans, accusing the president of seeking to create \"conditions for anxiety\" in American cities.",
      "\"He sends out masked men, he sends out Border Patrol. He sends out ICE, creates anxiety and fear in the community, so that he can lay claim to solving for that by sending in the Guard in the first place,\" Newsom said.",

Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker whose district includes most of San Francisco, issued a statement saying reports of what she called a \"planned mass immigration raid in the Bay Area\" are \"an appalling abuse of law enforcement power.

Tours of the building \u2014 which typically start in the East Wing \u2014 have been suspended for about two months due to the construction, though officials say they expect to accommodate an updated tour route in the coming days.",
      "The bunker under the East Wing will also be upgraded, sources told CBS News. The White House Military Office is handling the renovation of the bunker, which is known as the President's Emergency Operations Center.",
      "The changes have drawn pushback from some historic groups. Earlier this week, the nonprofit National Trust for Historic Preservation urged the administration to hold off on further demolition until the ballroom can go through a public review process, arguing the massive addition \"will overwhelm the White House itself.\"",
      "A White House official said construction plans for the ballroom will be submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission. Administration officials say there are three key stages in the process of building on federal property \u2014 preservation, demolition and construction \u2014 and the planning commission typically isn't involved until the construction phase.",
      "Bryan Green, a Biden-era former member of the National Capital Planning Commission, confirmed to CBS News that the organization usually isn't consulted on demolitions \u2014 but he noted that it is atypical for a demolition to be separated from a construction application. He argued that projects like the ballroom should be presented to the commission early.",
      "\"This is part of our heritage. This is part of our story as Americans,\" he said of the White House complex. \"And we deserve to have that conversation about its fate and what happens to it.\"",
      "And for tourists outside the White House, the modifications to the complex have drawn reactions as polarizing as people's views on Mr. Trump himself.",
      "\"It's so funny, they are saying how Trump's destroying everything. Go back through history, all the different presidents,\" Joe Thompson told CBS News, pointing to other changes to the White House. \"He's adding his touch, and it's going to be beautiful when it's done. Absolutely beautiful.\"",
      "\"I think it's disgraceful,\" said Mark, a retired physician. \"It's a desecration, really. \u2026 I don't know that anybody particularly wants a big ballroom. And even for those people who did want it, the promise was that the White House wasn't going to be touched.\"",
      "The White House has called pushback against the ballroom project \"manufactured outrage,\" noting that many former presidents have modified the building.",
      "Mr. Trump first teased plans to build a ballroom over the summer, the most dramatic in a series of changes he's made to the White House, from turning the Rose Garden into a patio to adding gilded decorations to the Oval Office. He has also discussed building a massive triumphal arch in Virginia, across the river from the Lincoln Memorial.",
      "The administration has argued that the ballroom project will allow the White House to more easily host major functions like state dinners.",
      "But some Democrats have criticized the plans and questioned whether donors \u2014 which include major tech companies \u2014 are getting anything in return. Democratic Rep. Mark Takano of California blasted reports that donors' names could be etched into the ballroom's bricks.",
      "\"This is the White House \u2014 it's an emblem of our nation,\" Takano told CBS News last week. \"It's not like a NASCAR tournament, where all the sponsors are going to get their name emblazoned someplace.\""

    "summary": "President Trump's lawyers previously filed paperwork for two damage claims over the past federal criminal cases against him.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump and his legal team have asked the Justice Department to pay him about $230 million to settle two federal damage claims over investigations into him during both his first administration and the Biden administration, according to a source familiar with the claims. This raises the possibility of a conflict of interest, since some of the top Justice Department officials tasked with settling the claims defended Mr. Trump in those cases.",
      "Both claims were filed before Mr. Trump was inaugurated for his second term.",
      "It's unclear whether discussions between the Trump legal team and the Justice Department are underway or whether they have occurred, but the paperwork on both claims relating to past investigations into him has been filed, the source said.",
      "The first claim is related to the FBI and special counsel investigation into Mr. Trump regarding alleged interference by Russia in the 2016 presidential election, and the second claim concerns\u00a0 the FBI search at Mar-a-Lago that centered around Mr. Trump's handling of classified documents after he left the White House in 2021. The claims were first reported by The New York Times on Tuesday.",
      "According to the Justice Department manual, any settlement of the claims would have to be approved by the deputy attorney general or the associate attorney general. Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, was one of Mr. Trump's criminal defense attorneys. Stanley Woodward, associate attorney general, was Trump co-defendant Walt Nauta's defense attorney in the classified documents case. If any compensation is approved, it would be paid for by American taxpayers.",
      "\"There is such a thing as restitution in criminal cases, but that's for the victims of the crimes, not for those under investigation for committing one. Maybe this has happened in the past, but it's very rare,\" longtime D.C. attorney Paul Dueffert said in an interview. \"I'd love to see the backup on these numbers.\"",
      "\"It's hard to imagine how with these two cases you could get to $230 million in legal fees,\" Dueffert added. \"I could see tens of millions, but not hundreds of millions.\"",
      "The claims were first referenced by Mr. Trump last week during an Oval Office event with FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi and Blanche.",
      "\"I have a lawsuit that was doing very well, and when I became president I said, 'I'm sort of suing myself.' I don't know, how do you settle the lawsuit, I'll say give me X dollars, and I don't know what to do with the lawsuit,\" Trump said in reference to the claims, although administrative claims are not lawsuits. \"It sort of looks bad, I'm suing myself, right?\"",
      "When asked by reporters at a White House event Tuesday about a potential settlement, Mr. Trump said of the federal government that \"they probably owe me a lot of money\" for those investigations, later adding that he would \"donate\" any compensation he receives.",
      "\"I don't know what the numbers are. I don't even talk to them about it,\" Mr. Trump said, seeming to refer to whether he was consulting with his personal legal team or the Justice Department. \"All I know is that they would owe me a lot of money. But I'm not looking for money. I'd give it to charity or something.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Mr. Trump's legal team said in a statement, \"President Trump continues to fight back against all Democrat-led Witch Hunts,\" including the Russian interference investigation and the federal indictments he faced before winning reelection last year.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement regarding the possibility of a conflict of interest involving top Justice Department officials that \"in any circumstance, all officials at the Department of Justice follow the guidance of career ethics officials.\"",
      "\"[Blanche and Woodward] were both personally involved in this very case, and you don't get more of a conflict of interest than that,\" Dueffert said. \"It's just unimaginable that they should proceed.\"",
      "He called on both to recuse themselves, though he said, \"I'm skeptical that will happen.\"",
      "In July, Bondi fired the Justice Department's top ethics official.",
      "Stacey Young, a former Justice Department attorney, said,\"This is a clear example of the conflicts posed by installing the president's personal defense lawyers to run the Justice Department.\"",
      "\"These same loyalists ousted senior ethics officials who would have helped guide them through the proper way to handle the president's unprecedented demand for taxpayer money,\" said Young, who now leads the Justice Connection, a networking organization to help former Justice Department employees who have resigned or been fired.",
      "On Capitol Hill, GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said he has \"a lot of optics concerns\" about the president's claims.",
      "\"I don't think the president should be treated any differently than anyone else who was maybe a target of prosecution,\" he told reporters Wednesday. \"Obviously, if the prosecution prevailed, it should be a no-brainer that there wouldn't be any compensation. If it's one where the president as a defendant prevailed, ... let's talk about how that's been handled in the past.\"",
      "Before a trial in either of the federal cases against Mr. Trump could take place, both were dismissed after the election at the request of the special counsel because the Justice Department's longstanding policy is not to prosecute a sitting president."

    "story": [
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced new sanctions Wednesday against Russia's two biggest oil companies and blasted Moscow's refusal to end its \"senseless war\" in Ukraine, as the Trump administration struggles to strike a ceasefire deal and the Ukrainian president seeks more foreign military help.",
      "The sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil, as well as dozens of subsidiaries, followed months of bipartisan pressure on President Trump to hit Russia with harder sanctions on its oil industry.",
      "\"Now is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire,\" Bessent said in a statement. Given Russian President Vladimir Putin's \"refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia's two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin's war machine.\"",
      "Bessent said the Treasury Department is prepared to take further action if necessary to support Trump's effort to end the war. \"We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.\"",
      "The announcement came after Russian drones and missiles blasted sites across Ukraine, killing at least six people, including a woman and her two young daughters.",
      "The attack came in waves from Tuesday night into Wednesday and targeted at least eight Ukrainian cities, as well as a village in the region of the capital, Kyiv, where a strike set fire to a house in which the mother and her 6-month-old and 12-year-old daughters were staying, regional head Mykola Kalashnyk said.",
      "At least 29 people, including five children, were wounded in Kyiv, which appeared to be the main target, authorities said.",
      "Russian drones also hit a kindergarten in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, later Wednesday when children were in the building, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. One person was killed and six were hurt, but no children were physically harmed, he said.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said many of the children were in shock.",
      "Russia fired 405 strike and decoy drones and 28 missiles, mainly targeting Kyiv, Ukraine's air force said.",
      "The new sanctions on Russia were unveiled as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte visited Washington for talks with Mr. Trump. The military alliance has been coordinating deliveries of weapons to Ukraine, many of them purchased from the United States by Canada and European countries.",
      "\"I'm absolutely convinced that with sustained pressure, we will be able to get Putin to the table to agree with a ceasefire,\" Rutte told reporters Wednesday.",
      "Mr. Trump's efforts to end the war that started with Russia's all-out invasion of its neighbor more than three years ago have failed to gain traction. The U.S. president has repeatedly expressed frustration with Putin's refusal to budge from his conditions for a settlement after Ukraine offered a ceasefire and direct peace talks.",
      "Mr. Trump floated meeting with Putin in Hungary last week. But on Tuesday, he said his plan for a swift meeting with Putin was on hold because he didn't want it to be a \"waste of time.\" European leaders accused Putin of stalling.",
      "Zelenskyy said Wednesday that Trump's proposal to freeze the conflict where it stands on the front line \"was a good compromise\" \u2014 a step that could pave the way for negotiations.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the planned summit requires careful preparation, suggesting that laying the groundwork could be protracted. \"No one wants to waste time: neither President Trump nor President Putin,\" he said.",
      "In what appeared to be a public reminder of Russian atomic arsenals, Putin on Wednesday directed drills of the country's strategic nuclear forces.",
      "Zelenskyy urged the European Union, the United States and the Group of Seven industrialized nations to force Russia to the negotiating table. Pressure can be applied on Moscow \"only through sanctions, long-range (missile) capabilities and coordinated diplomacy among all our partners,\" he said.",
      "More international economic sanctions on Russia are likely to be discussed Thursday at an EU summit in Brussels. On Friday, a meeting of the Coalition of the Willing \u2014 a group of 35 countries that support Ukraine \u2014 is to take place in London.",
      "Zelenskyy credited Mr. Trump's remarks that he was considering supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine for Putin's willingness to meet. The American president later said he was wary of tapping into the U.S. supply of Tomahawks over concerns about available stocks."

    "summary": "Two former federal prosecutors who helped prosecute President Trump \u2014 and were fired when he returned to office \u2014 are starting a law firm focused on public corruption, an area the Justice Department has stepped back from.",
    "story": [
      "Two years ago, longtime federal corruption prosecutor Molly Gaston signed her name to a court filing unlike any before it.",
      "That day, in October 2023, Gaston filed a 32-page motion asking a federal judge to continue limiting public statements of then-former President Trump, who was accused of witness intimidation ahead of a trial in his criminal case for seeking to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "Gaston, who was a lead prosecutor for the trial, knew the case was unprecedented and high-stakes. She did not know how much would change in two years.",
      "She was a member of special counsel Jack Smith's team, which investigated a pair of criminal cases involving Mr. Trump, including one for election subversion. Gaston and fellow prosecutor J.P. Cooney were part of a prosecutorial unit that submitted hundreds of pages of court filings.\t Throughout 2023 and 2024, they stood before judges and courtrooms packed with news media for historic proceedings that were immediately recognized as landmark legal moments.",
      "Smith's two cases against Mr. Trump were dropped when he won reelection in 2024, because under Justice Department policy, sitting presidents are not prosecuted.",
      "Gaston and Cooney, among the most accomplished corruption prosecutors in the Justice Department, would lose their jobs once Mr. Trump took office in January.",
      "They were fired in a Trump administration\u00a0 purge of prosecutors associated with Smith and staff from the Justice Department's Public Integrity section, which has specialized in corruption cases in the 50 years since Watergate.",
      "The pair of former prosecutors have now embarked on a new chapter, opening a new private law firm, which they hope will fill a void left by the purge.",
      "Their eponymous firm, Gaston and Cooney, will leverage and promote their experience working on Smith's special counsel cases and offer to help local and state governments investigate public corruption. Gaston and Cooney said the ouster of veteran prosecutors from the Justice Department's Public Integrity section shifts the burden to local investigators to unearth and uproot public corruption.",
      "Gaston told CBS News, \"Institutional relationships are crumbling right now. It presents an opportunity and a need for the kind of services that we will provide to impartially and independently give advice and guidance.\"",
      "Cooney said, \"Our view is that corruption imposes great harm to communities,\" and it incurs \"economic costs, intrinsic costs.\"",
      "Gaston said, \"We think that there is this need and an appetite for this.\"",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Justice Connection, an organization representing former agency employees, told CBS News it estimates the Justice Department's Public Integrity section has shrunk to just two full time attorneys, down from dozens in recent years.",
      "Gaston and Cooney told CBS News they will also offer private legal services to clients who are the subject of investigations, including in congressional probes. Their work with Smith will be listed in a press release Wednesday announcing the launch of their new firm.",
      "The two defend Smith and the unit's work, amid a torrent of criticism from Mr. Trump and his allies, who accuse Smith of being politically motivated.",
      "Cooney told CBS News, \"We're immensely proud of the work that we did with Jack Smith and with the body of our work.\" He added that they sought to \"carry out prosecutions without fear or favor to anyone, to a political party, to a cause, to a wealthy interest, or to our own career prospects.\"",
      "Smith himself has maintained a low profile in the nine months since Mr. Trump's second term began. In public remarks last week at an event with former Justice Department attorney Andrew Weismann, Smith defended the investigations of Trump as righteous and fair.",
      "Cooney and Gaston were both fired by the Trump administration soon after the president was inaugurated. Even as they open their new private law firm, the pair say they are challenging their firings as unlawful, without due process or a specified cause. The pair filed complaints with the Merit System Protections Board.",
      "Gaston told CBS News her firing was \"incredibly sad and disappointing and also surprising.\"",
      "\"Ethical government cannot operate under circumstances where civil servants are terminated simply for doing their jobs and carrying out their responsibilities to the American people,\" said Cooney.",
      "Greg Rosen, a former head of the Justice Department's Capitol Siege section, which prosecuted more than 1,500 Jan. 6 cases, lauded the opening of Gaston and Cooney's firm. He told CBS News, \"It's hard to imagine two colleagues better suited for the challenge. Their exceptional character and eagerness to engage with both complex and novel legal issues set them apart and promise to make distinctive contributions to the legal field.\"",
      "Stacey Young, executive director of Justice Connection, which assists ousted Justice Department attorneys, told CBS News \"We desperately need the expertise this new firm is offering. The Justice Department has abdicated its duty to enforce public corruption laws. Without state and local governments filling that void, public officials will have no incentive to treat citizens fairly within the law.\""

      "North Carolina is the latest Republican-led state to reshape a congressional district in hopes of boosting the GOP's chances of keeping the House in next year's midterms.",
      "The North Carolina House on Wednesday passed a new congressional map that shifts the state's major battleground Democratic-held House district and makes it more favorable to conservatives, following the state Senate's approval one day earlier. And while the state has a Democratic governor, his veto power is limited and he cannot reject a standalone map.",
      "North Carolina Republicans are targeting Democratic Rep. Don Davis, whose victory in 2024 was a rare bright spot for Democrats.",
      "Rep. Suzan DelBene, the chair of the House Democrats' campaign arm, said in a statement that the map \"was clearly drawn to dilute the voting power of Black voters by dismantling the Black Belt to stop North Carolinians from holding Trump and House Republicans accountable for ignoring the needs of hardworking Americans.\"",
      "In a statement obtained by CBS News, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said state Republican lawmakers \"rigged the state's congressional map after being ordered to do so by Donald Trump,\" adding that it was a \"morally corrupt move\" that was \"part of a long line of desperate schemes to steal the midterms.\"",
      "Jeffries also said in a news conference Wednesday that Democrats plan to \"sue immediately,\" saying they believe the new North Carolina maps \"clearly violate the voting rights.\"",
      "North Carolina Republicans are championing the map. Before the redraw passed, the state House GOP Majority Leader Brenden Jones said during a speech that \"the end result is a congressional map that should perform to elect 11 Republicans,\" from North Carolina, rather than the 10 that serve in the U.S. House right now.",
      "North Carolina's quick turn to draw new congressional lines is deeply intertwined with attempts by Republican leaders around the country to help President Trump. Democrats are locked out of power in Washington and the House is widely seen as the party's most likely route to gaining back power in next year's midterms.",
      "At one point, Democrats winning back as few as three seats in the 2026 elections may have flipped control of the House. That dynamic has changed considerably in recent months as Mr. Trump and his allies have looked for Republican-led states to take Democratic districts and shift their boundaries in a way that boosts the GOP's chances at keeping control of the House next year.",
      "Republicans in Texas overhauled their state's map earlier this summer in an attempt to flip five Democratic-held seats. In response, California Democrats have put a measure on next month's ballot that could flip five of the state's GOP House seats toward Democrats. Not long after, Missouri Republicans were able to follow through on a longstanding push to alter a\u00a0 Kansas City-area district held for decades by Democrats and turn into one that favors Republicans.",
      "North Carolina is now primed to join that list, and more states could follow before the end of the year. No Democrat has won North Carolina in a presidential election since 2008, but statewide races in the southern battleground tend to be competitive. The state has a Democratic governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general but its two U.S. senators are Republicans. The state's congressional districts are already tilted to favor the GOP, with 10 of the state's 14 Congressional seats currently held by Republicans.",
      "Under the new map, Davis' Democratic battleground 1st Congressional District seat will be moved to try and make it more winnable for Republicans. This is done by adding parts of GOP Rep. Greg Murphy's current 3rd Congressional District, to the 1st.",
      "Davis said in a statement Tuesday that \"this new congressional map is beyond the pale,\" and noted that \"in the 2024 election with record voter turnout, NC's First Congressional District elected both President Trump and me.\"",
      "But Phil Berger, the GOP leader in the state Senate, contended in a statement of his own that \"this new map respects the will of the North Carolina voters who sent President Trump to the White House three times.\""

      "The move by the university is an attempt to bring to an end months of scrutiny by the Justice Department. Under the agreement, the university will provide the department with relevant information and data quarterly through 2028.",
      "The Justice Department began reviewing the admissions and financial aid processes at the Charlottesville campus in April. Officials accused its president of failing to end diversity, equity and inclusion practices President Trump has deemed unlawful.",
      "The mounting pressure prompted university president James Ryan to announce his resignation in June, saying the stakes were too high for others on campus if he opted to \"fight the federal government in order to save my job.\"",
      "The president of the university will have to personally certify that the university is in compliance each quarter. Interim UVA president Paul Mahoney said in a message to the community, \"After months of discussions with DOJ, I believe strongly that this agreement represents the best available path forward.\"",
      "The university confirmed the agreement regarding the government's five remaining federal investigations in a statement and said that it did not include a monetary penalty or external monitoring and \"it affirms UVA's academic freedom.\"",
      "The university said that under the agreement, the government will suspend its current investigations, while university leaders will confirm its compliance with the Justice Department through 2028. At that point the government will conclude its investigations.",
      "Mahoney said in his statement that the university's leaders would continue \"our thorough review of our practices and policies to ensure that we are complying with all federal laws.\"",

      "Columbia and Brown universities have also signed agreements to end federal investigations and restore access to federal funding. Columbia paid $200 million to the government, and Brown paid $50 million to Rhode Island workforce development organizations.",
      "The Justice Department had accused Ryan, the former UVA president, of engaging in \"attempts to defy and evade federal anti-discrimination laws and the directives of your board.\" The department focused on complaints that Ryan was too slow to implement a March 7 resolution by the university's governing board demanding the eradication of DEI on campus.",
      "As a public university, the University of Virginia was an outlier in the Trump administration's effort to reform higher education according to the president's vision. Previously, the administration had devoted most of its scrutiny to elite private colleges, including Harvard and other Ivy League institutions, accused of tolerating antisemitism.",
      "Since then, the White House has expanded its campaign to other public campuses, including the University of California, Los Angeles, and George Mason University.",
      "The Charlottesville campus became a flashpoint this year after conservative critics accused it of simply renaming its DEI initiatives rather than ending them. The Justice Department expanded the scope of its review several times and announced a separate investigation into alleged antisemitism in May.",
      "Earlier in October, UVA declined to sign an agreement pledging to uphold the Trump administration's higher education priorities, or risk losing out on preferred access to federal funding."

      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, delivered a marathon speech on the Senate floor that stretched 22 hours and 37 minutes across Tuesday and Wednesday, protesting President Trump's policies in one of the longest addresses in the chamber in recent years.",
      "Merkley, 68, began speaking at 6:21 p.m. on Tuesday and continued until 4:58 p.m. Wednesday. Over the course of the speech, he railed against the Trump administration for its deportation efforts, canceled federal programs, so-called weaponization of the Justice Department and efforts to send the National Guard into American cities \u2014 including Portland, Oregon.",
      "\"I've come to the Senate floor tonight to ring the alarm bells,\" Merkley said at the outset of his speech. \"We're in the most perilous moment, the biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War. President Trump is shredding our Constitution.\"",
      "A slew of Merkley's fellow Democrats took turns asking him extended questions, giving him breaks over the course of his speech and providing a platform for other senators to make their own arguments. The address was the fourth-longest in the Senate since 1900, according to the Senate Press Gallery.",
      "Portland, which Merkley represents, has been a target of Mr. Trump's ire for years and again came into focus last month, when the president directed the Defense Department to coordinate the deployment of National Guard troops to the city. On Monday, a federal appeals court cleared the way for the administration to federalize and deploy members of the Oregon National Guard to Portland while a legal challenge moves forward.",
      "\"President Trump wants us to believe that Portland, Oregon, in my home state, is full of chaos and riots because if he can say to the American people that there are riots, he can say there's a rebellion,\" Merkley said. \"And if there's a rebellion, he can use that to strengthen his authoritarian grip on our nation. Pretend there are riots, or even try to provoke violence, and tighten his authoritarian grip.\"",
      "Merkley said Portlanders aren't \"taking the bait.\" Instead, he said, \"they are demonstrating with joy and whimsy.\"",
      "\"They want to make it clear to the world that what Trump is saying about there being violent protests or a rebellion in Portland is just not true,\" he added.",
      "The remarks come as Democrats and Republicans remain at an impasse over how to fund the government, with the shutdown stretching into a fourth week Wednesday. Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, criticized the speech in a post on X before it began Tuesday evening, highlighting that Capitol Police are not being paid.",
      "\"The Democrats are going to make Capitol Police and Capitol support staff \u2014 who they refuse to pay \u2014 work all night so they can give speeches patting themselves on the back for shutting down the government and hurting the American people,\" Barrasso said.",
      "Merkley's marathon address follows a record-breaking speech by Booker on the Senate floor earlier this year, spanning more than 25 hours. The speech was also made in a protest against the Trump administration's policies. In 2017, Merkley delivered one of the longest Senate floor speeches on record when he spoke for more than 15 hours to oppose the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer praised Merkley on the floor as the speech approached 21 hours in the afternoon.",
      "\"I just want to thank the great senator from Oregon for his strength, his fortitude, his integrity, and just shining a spotlight on this erosion of democracy under Trump,\" Schumer said.",
      "\"I've been on the Senate floor to ring the alarm bells for a long time,\" Merkley said as he began wrapping up his remarks.",
      "He thanked members of his staff and the Capitol Police and staff who stayed to continue the chamber's operations, and colleagues who engaged with him during the remarks.",
      "\"We are in the most perilous moment, the biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War,\" Merkley said. \"President Trump is shredding our Constitution.\""

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 16:13:08 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump said in September he would not back an Israeli annexation of the West Bank.",
    "story": [
      "Israeli lawmakers on Wednesday voted to advance two proposed bills that call for the formal annexation of the already Israeli-occupied West Bank, an ambition openly promoted by far-right ministers in recent months but opposed by President Trump.",
      "The vote by Israel's parliament, the Knesset, came with Vice President JD Vance visiting Israel to shore up the Gaza ceasefire that was brokered by Mr. Trump's administration. The president has made clear he would not back annexation of the West Bank.",
      "\"I will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank,\" Mr.\u00a0Trump told reporters at the White House in September. \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "Israeli media reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had called on lawmakers from his Likud party to abstain from voting. In a statement, the party called the votes \"another provocation by the opposition aimed at damaging our relations with the United States.\"",
      "\"True sovereignty will be achieved not through a showy law for the record, but through proper work on the ground,\" it added.",
      "During a preliminary reading on Wednesday, lawmakers voted in favor of examining two bills, which means they will be brought forward for further readings in the Knesset. The first text, passed by a vote of 32-9, proposed annexing Maale Adumim, a large Israeli settlement home to some 40,000 people just east of Jerusalem.",
      "The second proposal to annex the entire West Bank was supported by 25 members, while 24 voted against. Almost all the lawmakers from Netanyahu's Likud party boycotted the vote, with one voting in support of the measure, according to Israeli media. The Knesset has 120 members in total.",
      "Far-right members of Netanyahu's Cabinet have openly called for annexation of the West Bank, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967.",
      "\"Mr. Prime Minister. The Knesset has spoken. The people have spoken,\" Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich posted on social media.",
      "\"The time has come to impose full sovereignty over all of Judea and Samaria \u2014 the inheritance of our ancestors \u2014 and to promote peace agreements in exchange for peace with our neighbors with strength,\" he said, using the Israeli Biblical term for the West Bank.",
      "In a statement, the Ramallah-based Palestinian foreign ministry condemned the Knesset's vote, saying it \"strongly rejects the Knesset's attempts to annex Palestinian land.\"",
      "\"The ministry emphasized that the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank, including Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, constitute a single geographic unit over which Israel has no sovereignty,\" it said, as reported by Palestinian official news agency Wafa.",
      "Jordan's foreign ministry also said it \"strongly condemned\" the votes, which it called \"a blatant violation of international law and a grave undermining of the two-state solution.\"",
      "All of Israel's settlements in the West Bank are widely considered illegal under international law, but Israel disputes that and Netanyahu's government has supported their expansion.",
      "In August, Israel approved a major civilian settlement project between Maale Adumim and Jerusalem in an area of the disputed territory that the international community has warned threatens the viability of a future Palestinian state.",
      "At a signing ceremony for the project in September, Netanyahu vowed that there would be no Palestinian state. The 20-point Middle East peace plan put forward by the U.S. recognizes that there may be a \"credible pathway\" for Palestinian statehood after the Palestinian Authority, which has limited autonomy in some parts of the West Bank, undergoes reforms.",
      "\"We are going to fulfill our promise that there will be no Palestinian state, this place belongs to us,\" Netanyahu said at the event in Maale Adumim.",
      "Excluding Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, the West Bank is home to around 3 million Palestinians, as well as more than 500,000 Israelis living in settlements.",
      "Since the war in Gaza began in October 2023, violence has also surged in the West Bank, with Palestinian residents describing escalating attacks by Israeli settlers. Some attacks on Israelis, by knife- or gun-wielding Palestinians, have originated from the territory.",
      "Vance met with Netanyahu on Wednesday as the fragile ceasefire deal in Gaza continues to hold between Israel and Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization by the U.S.",
      "\"We have a very, very tough task ahead of us, which is to disarm Hamas but rebuild Gaza to make life better for the people in Gaza, but also to ensure that Hamas is no longer a threat to our friends in Israel. That's not easy,\" Vance told reporters. \"There's a lot of work to do, but I feel very optimistic about where we are.\""

    "story": [
      "Public access to the White House has been suspended for about two months because\u00a0tours started at the East Wing, and the demolition of parts of that wing and construction of the new ballroom have made the visits impossible, officials told CBS News.",
      "White House officials said that although the tours are still paused, they expect to accommodate an updated tour route in coming days, as well as other public events, such as Halloween trick-or-treating.",
      "Members of Congress, who receive White House tour requests from their constituents, told CBS News that bookings were suspended in late August.",
      "The tours included public rooms in the East Wing as well as the Vermeil Room, Library, China Room, Blue Room, Red Room, Green Room and State Dining Room in the White House residence.",
      "A message on the tour website, posted over the summer, says: \"The White House Ballroom will be substantially separated from the main building of the White House, but at the same time, it's theme and architectural heritage will be almost identical. The site of the new ballroom will be where the small, heavily changed, and reconstructed East Wing currently sits.\"",
      "During construction, first lady Melania Trump's office has moved to the ground floor of the White House. East Wing staffers' desks have been set up in the China Room, and aides now gather in the map room.",

      "The White House Historical Association, a nonprofit organization that aims to protect, preserve and provide public access to the White House, confirmed that it took steps to document the White House East Wing this summer, prior to demolition. The association was founded by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy in 1961.",
      "This week, construction crews began dismantling the White House's eastern facade to make room for the forthcoming White House ballroom.",
      "A spokesperson for the association said it undertook \"a comprehensive digital scanning project and photography to create an historic record\" of the East Wing and gardens.",

The letter expressed concern about the size of the ballroom annex \u2014 that \"the proposed new construction will overwhelm the White House itself.\""

    "summary": "A majority of California voters oppose Trump's deportation program \u2014 many say it weakens their local economy.",
    "story": [
      "It's a state ballot measure about redistricting, but Proposition 50 has many California voters thinking nationally \u2014 and a lot about President Trump.",
      "Those voting for it overwhelmingly say one reason is for them to oppose the Trump administration \u2014 which they also feel generally treats California worse than other states \u2014 and oppose national Republicans.",
      "Overall, those who see their Prop 50 vote as a national issue are backing it, and that rationale is in turn helping push the \"yes\" side of the measure into the lead.",
      "By contrast, those who see it more as a state issue are opposed: Those voting \"no\" are driven by a concern that redistricting would shift power away from the state's rural areas and toward the cities and cost the state money. But their views are outnumbered at the moment.",
      "Some of Californians' views on President Trump are in turn driven by their widespread feeling that the administration treats California worse than other states. Only about a third say they're generally treated the same. (Even a quarter of Republicans, who overwhelmingly backed Trump in 2024, feel he treats the state worse than others.)",
      "In all, and given those national dynamics voters express, it may be little surprise the measure has majority backing overall for the moment in the heavily-Democratic state.",
      "California's statewide debate on redistricting provides a unique look at a public perspective on the matter, while in many other states where it is being implemented or discussed, it is in the hands of legislatures and governors.",
      "In sum, those who see it as a national issue are overwhelmingly backing it. Those seeing it more in state terms tend to be opposed.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom has a positive overall job approval from California voters, and is a net-positive for those who consider him a factor and are voting \"yes\" on Prop 50.",
      "However, he's even more of a motivating force for the \"no\" side, many of whom are Republicans, and half of whom say he's a reason for them to oppose it.",
      "The potential dynamics of the proposed redistricting are seen to favor cities over both suburbs and rural areas \u2014 perhaps a function of voters' views on proposed maps, or simply that more of California's Democrats live in and around its cities.",
      "The argument made by opponents that it would cost the state money has gained some traction in the sense that four in 10 think it will, and it's a prevailing view on the \"no\" side. But that's not enough to sway the overall vote right now. A sizable number of those who think it'll cost money are still voting \"yes\" nonetheless.",
      "Finances, the deportation program, and President Trump",
      "One reason Donald Trump may be drawing opposition \u2014 besides a low statewide approval rating \u2014 is that California's voters tend to feel his policies are making them financially worse off.",
      "And there is majority opposition to his deportation program, even more so than has been the case of late in the nation at large.",
      "That said, Californians do see the administration's policies reducing the number of border crossings, specifically at California's section of the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "On the deportation program, there are at least two reasons behind the sentiment: one, most California voters \u2014 and especially those who disapprove of the program \u2014 feel the administration is trying to deport more people than they'd expected.",
      "The Californians who feel this way overwhelmingly voice opposition to the program. This connection has also been the case in recent months nationally. Hispanic voters, in particular, think the administration is deporting more than they'd expected and are slightly more disapproving of the program than White voters.",
      "There is also opposition to the administration sending the National Guard to L.A.",
      "The other factor is the prevailing view that the deportation program is making their local economies weaker. These views are often shaped by partisanship, but they also span areas from people living in both cities and smaller towns.",
      "This is strongly connected to views of the program overall: those who see it weakening the local economy almost universally disapprove.",
      "Most of California's voters don't think the program is making their own communities safer. It's often a matter of partisanship behind that perception. Republicans say it is making their communities safer, but independents and Democrats do not.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a representative sample of 1,504 registered voters in California interviewed between October 16-21, 2025. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education, and geographic region based on the voter file and U.S. Census data, as well as to 2024 presidential vote. The margin of error is \u00b1 3.8 points for registered voters and \u00b1 3.6 points for likely voters.",

    "summary": "Senate hopeful Graham Platner told The Associated Press he was unaware his tattoo resembled a Nazi symbol.",
    "story": [
      "Maine Democratic Senate hopeful Graham Platner said Wednesday that a tattoo on his chest has been altered to no longer reflect an image widely recognized as a Nazi symbol.",
      "The first-time political candidate said he got the skull and crossbones tattoo in 2007, when he was in his 20s and in the Marine Corps. It happened during a night of drinking while he was on leave in Croatia, he said, adding he was unaware until recently that the image has been associated with Nazi police.",
      "Platner, in an Associated Press interview, said that while his campaign initially said he would remove the tattoo, he chose to cover it up with another tattoo due to the limited options where he lives in rural Maine.",
      "\"Going to a tattoo removal place is going to take a while,\" he said. \"I wanted this thing off my body.\"",
      "The initial tattoo image resembled a specific symbol of Hitler's paramilitary Schutzstaffel, or SS, which was responsible for the systematic murders of millions of Jews and others in Europe during World War II. Platner didn't offer details about the new tattoo when he spoke to AP, but he later\u00a0posted a video on X\u00a0in which he showed off the updated version.",
      "He wrote, \"Years ago I got a skull and crossbones tattoo with my buddies in the Marine Corps.   I was appalled to learn it closely resembled a Nazi symbol. I altered it yesterday, into something that isn't deeply offensive to my core beliefs.   I am very sorry to all of you who had to contemplate a symbol of hate over the past 48 hours.\"",
      "The tattoo revelation closely follows the discovery of a series of controversial online statements on Reddit, including one in which he dismissed sexual assault in the military. Platner attempted to explain his past online comments in a video he posted to X last week. In it, he addressed not only his previous comments dismissing military sexual assaults, but also his questioning Black patrons' gratuity habits and criticizing police officers and rural Americans.",
      "\"As I read through them, I read things that I absolutely do not agree with,\" Platner said in a five-minute apology video. \"I read through and I see things that \u2014 words and statements that I abhor. I also see the trajectory of my life.\"",
      "Platner also told Pod Save America that his past Reddit comments were intended to \"get a rise out of people on the Internet\" and \"weren't even reflective of my opinions back then.\"",
      "He has resisted calls to drop out of the race and has the backing of Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who has described Platner as a stronger candidate for the seat than Mills.",
      "Platner said he was not ashamed to confront his past comments and actions because it reflects the lessons he needed to take to get where he is today.",
      "\"I don't look at this as a liability,\" he told the AP. \"I look at this as is a life that I have lived, a journey that has been difficult, that has been full of struggle, that has also gotten me to where I am today. And I'm very proud of who I am.\"",
      "DNC Chair Ken Martin was asked over the weekend, before the tattoo revelation, if Platner's past comments are disqualifying.",
      "\"I don't think they're disqualifying, but certainly they're not right,\" Martin said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" And I'm glad that he apologized for them. They're indefensible, they're hurtful, and they're offensive. The question, though, is I believe in second chances. I believe a lot of people say things at their most vulnerable times. They say things when they're young that again are offensive. And the question for me is whether or not they actually learn from them, whether or not they actually reflect on those, that they're sincere in their apology, and more importantly that they have changed their behavior.\"",
      "Platner has a planned town hall Wednesday in Ogunquit, Maine."

      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",

      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News."

    "summary": "A prolonged government shutdown, as occurred in 2018, could lead to long lines at TSA checkpoints and economic losses, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",
      "Passport services are also deemed essential and would be expected to operate during a government shutdown."

      "Republicans have rejected Democrats' push to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

The bill differed from a version passed in the House and funding technically lapsed at midnight, but since Nov. 21 fell on a Saturday, the effects weren't felt immediately. House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

      "The issue was which agency's budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of Management and Budget, the White House should use to show that the budget was balanced within seven years. In the end, Republicans backed down: then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole indicated in a floor speech on New Year's Eve that \"we ought to end this.

      "The White House, however, said it would not engage in negotiations over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which extended legal protections for Dreamers, while the government was shut down.",

      "As the shutdown stretched to become the longest in history and Democrats took control of the House, the president ended up signing a bill to reopen agencies for three weeks and did not include money for the border wall. Weeks later, Congress averted another shutdown by passing a measure that included $1.375 billion for the border wall, far less than the $5.7 billion Trump requested."

But for me, they shut down the camp, they shut down the facility, they took people and put them all indoors, made them stand up for a count so I can walk in. Kicked people out of their beds and shifted people around so I can have this, I guess, privileged spot bed, as if there was a difference between any of the other beds.

And I am here standing, and I take responsibility, because I want to move forward. There's no point in rehashing the past. That's already been adjudicated, right? I was granted a second lease on life and I want to use that to do good. I know what I shouldn't do.

      "\"We are working together and planning their deployment,\" Kirkpatrick told CBS News in an interview Tuesday evening. \"They are not coming in to take us over \u2014\u00a0 this is a partnership.\"",
      "While New Orleans had requested Louisiana National Guard support for upcoming New Year's Eve events, the earlier assistance from federal National Guard troops came at the request of Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry in late September.",
      "Kirkpatrick said the troops are scheduled to arrive in time for the city's Bayou Classic \u2014 a major two-day college football event held at Caesars Superdome from Nov. 27 through Nov. 29 featuring Grambling State and Southern University. The troops are expected to remain in the city through New Year's Eve and Mardi Gras in February and will patrol between those events as well.",
      "National Guard troops were previously deployed to New Orleans at the beginning of the year following a New Year's Day terror attack that killed 14 people on Bourbon Street in the city's iconic French Quarter district. Super Bowl LIX was held in New Orleans in February, drawing heightened security.",
      "\"If you remove the politics out of that, our relationships were already established. We've had excellent working relationships with the National Guard,\" Kirkpatrick said. \"My number one mission is to safety, and if National Guard can advance and be a force multiplier, great.\"",
      "Recently, the federal government has sent National Guard troops to other U.S. cities \u2014 including Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland, Oregon \u2014 in response to protests over the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.",
      "In New Orleans, crime is down in almost every category compared to last year, according to crime statistics provided by the New Orleans Police Department.",
      "Kirkpatrick spoke to CBS News during the city's annual Night Out Against Crime event, which aims to bridge divides between community members and various law enforcement agencies.",
      "The New Orleans Police Department is currently understaffed, Kirpatrick said. A DJ at the event spoke over the loudspeaker encouraging people to consider either signing up for the police academy or as a deputy with the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office.",
      "The city still needs about 300 more police officers, a New Orleans Police Department spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "Regardless, asked if she thinks Guard troops should be deployed to New Orleans outside of assisting with a major event, Kirkpatrick responded, \"I don't.\"",
      "\"We are peacemakers and soldiers are trained to engage in enemy combat. Our community is not our enemy, but they are here to help support us in law enforcement functions for specific results,\" Kirkpatrick said. \"I am not confused about our different missions, but there's some things we can overlap on and indeed work collaboratively.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the city said 20 more officers are set to graduate the police academy this Friday."

      "Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson tackles everything from moon explosions to Superman's time-traveling tricks in his new book, \"Just Visiting This Planet, Revised and Updated for the Twenty-First Century: Further Scientific Adventures of Merlin from Omniscia,\" introducing readers to Merlin, an alien character he created early in his career.",
      "\"Back then, you could have a simple question, but you couldn't get an easy answer,\" Tyson said on \"CBS Mornings\" on Friday. \"Now, you can type anything into Google, into ChatGPT. If you have ever seen those replies that come in from AI, it's got no soul. It's got no personality.\"",
      "He says the questions he gets today are more playful and imaginative.",
      "\"People are now asking questions that are a little more fun, rather than, 'How hot is the sun?' Stuff you can just look up.\"",
      "One example he highlights: \"If aliens came and exploded the moon, what effect would that have on us?\"",
      "Tyson notes that while the moon might not be crucial now, it may have helped early life by creating isolated tide pools. \"Without the moon, astronomers would be very happy, because the sky would be dark all the time,\" he said.",
      "Likelihood of life elsewhere",
      "On the topic of aliens, Tyson is clear about the science and the skepticism.",
      "\"Everyone that studied the question of life in the universe\u2026 would not deny the likelihood of life elsewhere,\" he said. But he doubts they have visited Earth.",
      "\"We all grew up when no one had cameras, so everything was an eyewitness testimony. Everybody has got a high resolution camera video, and nobody's got some alien walking off their flying saucer.\"",

      "\"So someone said, 'How accurate is the leap year correction?' Because one day every four years, you have a leap day. Turns out, that over corrects. So every 100 years, you have to take away a leap day that would otherwise be there. And that under corrects. Now you have to add a leap day back every 400 years to correct for the other two leap days.\"",
      "He even addresses the famous \"Superman\" scene where reversing Earth's rotation supposedly turns back time. Tyson's verdict is blunt: impossible.",
      "\"Your time is not linked to the rotation of the Earth, they have nothing to do with each other,\" he explained. \"But if he did that, the oceans, which are not attached to the Earth, would have kept moving ... he would have killed a billion people in North and South America.\"",
      "His brother, an artist, did the illustrations for the book.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 10:43:00 -0400",
    "summary": "There are many big names in a group of unlikely allies seeking a ban, for now, on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
    "story": [
      "Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have joined prominent computer scientists, economists, artists, evangelical Christian leaders and American conservative commentators Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck to call for a ban on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
      "The letter, released Wednesday by a politically and geographically diverse group of public figures, is squarely aimed at tech giants like Google, OpenAI and Meta Platforms that are racing each other to build a form of artificial intelligence designed to surpass humans at many tasks.",
      "The 30-word statement says, \"We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.\"",
      "In a preamble, the letter notes that AI tools may bring health and prosperity, but alongside those tools, \"many leading AI companies have the stated goal of building superintelligence in the coming decade that can significantly outperform all humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. This has raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\"",
      "Prince Harry added in a personal note that \"the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.\"",
      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\"This is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It's simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. Is that too much to ask?\"",
      "Also signing were AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, co-winners of the Turing Award, computer science's top prize. Hinton also won a Nobel Prize in physics last year. Both have been vocal in bringing attention to the dangers of a technology they helped create.",
      "But the list also has some surprises, including Bannon and Beck, in an attempt by the letter's organizers at the nonprofit Future of Life Institute to appeal to President Trump's Make America Great Again movement even as Mr. Trump's White House staff has sought to reduce limits to AI development in the U.S.",
      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",
      "Former Irish President Mary Robinson and several British and European parliamentarians signed, as did actors Stephen Fry and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and musician will.i.am, who has otherwise embraced AI in music creation.",
      "Caution urged",
      "\"Yeah, we want specific AI tools that can help cure diseases, strengthen national security, etc.,\" wrote Gordon-Levitt, whose wife Tasha McCauley served on OpenAI's board of directors before the upheaval that led to CEO Sam Altman's temporary ouster in 2023. \"But does AI also need to imitate humans, groom our kids, turn us all into slop junkies and make zillions of dollars serving ads? Most people don't want that.\"",
      "The letter is likely to provoke ongoing debates between the AI research community about the likelihood of superhuman AI, the technical paths to reach it and how dangerous it could be.",
      "\"In the past, it's mostly been the nerds versus the nerds,\" said Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"I feel what we're really seeing here is how the criticism has gone very mainstream.\"",
      "Labeling is complicating the discourse",
      "Confounding the broader debates is that the same companies that are striving toward what some call superintelligence and others call artificial general intelligence, or AGI, are also sometimes inflating the capabilities of their products, which can make them more marketable and have contributed to concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and AI scientists when its researcher claimed ChatGPT had figured out unsolved math problems \u2014 when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online.",
      "\"There's a ton of stuff that's overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn't change the fact that \u2014 zooming out \u2014 AI has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,\" Tegmark said.",
      "Tegmark's group was also behind a March 2023 letter \u2014 still in the dawn of a commercial AI boom \u2014 that called on tech giants to temporarily  pause the development of more powerful AI models. None of the major AI companies heeded that call. And the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, Elon Musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own AI startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.",
      "Asked if he reached out to Musk again this time, Tegmark said he wrote to the CEOs of all major AI developers in the U.S. but didn't expect them to sign.",
      "\"I really empathize for them, frankly, because they're so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,\" Tegmark said. \"I think that's why it's so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the U.S. government just steps in.\""

      "The new browser, called ChatGPT Atlas, is for now only available on Apple laptops that run the company's Mac operating system. Access will soon expand to Apple's iOS, Microsoft Windows and Google's Android platforms, OpenAI said.",
      "In the company's launch\u00a0video, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described Atlas as an AI-powered web browser built around ChatGPT that will allow people to converse with web pages. In a video presentation, he also expressed confidence that a chatbot interface will eventually supplant a traditional browser's URL bar.",
      "\"Tabs were great, but we haven't seen a lot of browser innovation since then,\" he said.",
      "What the Atlas browser can do",
      "Like other search engines, Atlas has a home page with a search bar where people can ask questions, similar to Google's landing page. Users can also toggle through different tabs across the top of the browser to find news stories, images and other content.",
      "But a few features set the browser apart, according to OpenAI. One is a ChatGPT side bar, which users can activate by clicking an \"Ask ChatGPT\" button in the upper right-hand corner of the browser.",
      "\"It's basically you inviting ChatGPT into your corner of the internet,\" said Ryan O'Rouke, the lead designer for Atlas, in OpenAI's video unveiling the browser.",
      "The technology functions like ChatGPT but takes into account what web page people are on. In practice, that means users can ask questions about whatever content they are looking at. Users can also call on the ChatGPT function while drafting emails. In the demo, O'Rouke shows how he uses it to ask for edits on an email.",
      "\"It's using the internet for you,\" Altman said.",
      "Atlas also has an \"agent mode\" that can take action on a person's behalf, armed with what it has learned from users' browsing history and what they are searching for. The agent also can help people complete a range of tasks, such as booking a flight, editing a document or ordering groceries. For now, agent mode is only available for plus and pro users, according to Altman.",
      "Competition with Google",
      "Whether Atlas will erode Google's dominance in browsing and searching the internet remains to be seen.",
      "Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, said Google is expected to generate $220 billion in search revenues this fiscal year alone. But OpenAI is a potentially formidable competitor, she noted.",
      "\"Ultimately, Google is still the leader in search, but OpenAI's move with Atlas is worth watching,\" she said.",
      "OpenAI has said ChatGPT has more than 800 million users, although the San Francisco-based company has yet to turn a profit. Google's Chrome browser has roughly 3 billion worldwide users and has been adding some AI features drawing on the company's Gemini AI technology."

      "The U.S. has struck two alleged drug vessels on the Pacific side of Latin America over the last two days, killing five people, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth confirmed Wednesday.",
      "The Trump administration has now carried out nine known strikes against alleged narcotics trafficking boats since last month, leading to at least 37 deaths. The first seven strikes were within the Caribbean Sea \u2014 but this week, the strategy broadened to the East Pacific.",
      "The first strike took place on Tuesday, with two people killed. A defense official confirmed the vessel was in international waters off of Colombia. A second strike took place on Wednesday, according to Hegseth, killing three more.",
      "In a pair of nearly identical X posts announcing the strikes Wednesday, Hegseth said the boats were operated by a \"Designated Terrorist Organization\" and were \"transiting along a known narco-trafficking route\" in international waters. He said they were \"known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling.\" He did not specify the organization that allegedly operated the boats.",
      "Hegseth said no U.S. forces were harmed in the strikes.",
      "He also shared videos of the strikes, both of which show vessels moving in the water before they are seemingly hit and engulfed in flames. In the video from Wednesday's strike, bags or parcels appear to be floating in the water after the boat was struck.",

      "Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" \"We want to keep fentanyl out of the United States, ... but those routes through the Caribbean on boats are predominantly used to bring cocaine to Europe,\" not to the U.S. And fentanyl tends to be transported to to the U.S. \"from a different way,\" Kelly added.",
      "The Pentagon has not yet responded to a request for information about the nationalities of the individuals on the boat that was struck Tuesday.",
      "Kelly also told \"Face the Nation\" that when administration officials briefed Congress on the drug vessel strikes, they \"had a very hard time explaining to us the rationale, the legal rationale for doing this and the constitutionality of doing it.\" He said lawmakers were told there is \"a secret list of over 20 narco organizations, drug trafficking cartels,\" but U.S. officials did not share the list with Congress.",
      "The Trump administration\u00a0has told Congress\u00a0the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels, arguing that the narcotics they smuggle kill tens of thousands of Americans every year, and this constitutes an \"armed attack.\"",
      "Two men survived a U.S. strike on a suspected drug-trafficking submersible vessel in the Caribbean last week, and the U.S. repatriated the men, one from Ecuador and one from Colombia. Ecuador released the man, identified as Andr\u00e9s Fernando Tufi\u00f1o, after authorities said they had found no evidence that he had committed a crime.",
      "The Colombian citizen remains hospitalized after his repatriation. Interior Minister Armando Benedetti said he \"arrived with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator.\" Authorities there said he would face prosecution. Two other men were killed in the strike on the submersible vessel.",
      "Meanwhile, the Dominican Republic granted permission to the U.S. military to use its airports for staging operations in support of counternarcotics flights, according to two American officials who spoke to CBS News on Wednesday under conditions of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about ongoing military operations.",
      "The U.S. and the Dominican Republic have worked together on countering drug trafficking and other forms of transnational organized crime going back to the mid-1980s."

    "summary": "President Trump's lawyers previously filed paperwork for two damage claims over the past federal criminal cases against him.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump and his legal team have asked the Justice Department to pay him about $230 million to settle two federal damage claims over investigations into him during both his first administration and the Biden administration, according to a source familiar with the claims. This raises the possibility of a conflict of interest, since some of the top Justice Department officials tasked with settling the claims defended Mr. Trump in those cases.",
      "Both claims were filed before Mr. Trump was inaugurated for his second term.",
      "It's unclear whether discussions between the Trump legal team and the Justice Department are underway or whether they have occurred, but the paperwork on both claims relating to past investigations into him has been filed, the source said.",
      "The first claim is related to the FBI and special counsel investigation into Mr. Trump regarding alleged interference by Russia in the 2016 presidential election, and the second claim concerns\u00a0 the FBI search at Mar-a-Lago that centered around Mr. Trump's handling of classified documents after he left the White House in 2021. The claims were first reported by The New York Times on Tuesday.",
      "According to the Justice Department manual, any settlement of the claims would have to be approved by the deputy attorney general or the associate attorney general. Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, was one of Mr. Trump's criminal defense attorneys. Stanley Woodward, associate attorney general, was Trump co-defendant Walt Nauta's defense attorney in the classified documents case. If any compensation is approved, it would be paid for by American taxpayers.",
      "\"There is such a thing as restitution in criminal cases, but that's for the victims of the crimes, not for those under investigation for committing one. Maybe this has happened in the past, but it's very rare,\" longtime D.C. attorney Paul Dueffert said in an interview. \"I'd love to see the backup on these numbers.\"",
      "\"It's hard to imagine how with these two cases you could get to $230 million in legal fees,\" Dueffert added. \"I could see tens of millions, but not hundreds of millions.\"",
      "The claims were first referenced by Mr. Trump last week during an Oval Office event with FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi and Blanche.",
      "\"I have a lawsuit that was doing very well, and when I became president I said, 'I'm sort of suing myself.' I don't know, how do you settle the lawsuit, I'll say give me X dollars, and I don't know what to do with the lawsuit,\" Trump said in reference to the claims, although administrative claims are not lawsuits. \"It sort of looks bad, I'm suing myself, right?\"",
      "When asked by reporters at a White House event Tuesday about a potential settlement, Mr. Trump said of the federal government that \"they probably owe me a lot of money\" for those investigations, later adding that he would \"donate\" any compensation he receives.",
      "\"I don't know what the numbers are. I don't even talk to them about it,\" Mr. Trump said, seeming to refer to whether he was consulting with his personal legal team or the Justice Department. \"All I know is that they would owe me a lot of money. But I'm not looking for money. I'd give it to charity or something.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Mr. Trump's legal team said in a statement, \"President Trump continues to fight back against all Democrat-led Witch Hunts,\" including the Russian interference investigation and the federal indictments he faced before winning reelection last year.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement regarding the possibility of a conflict of interest involving top Justice Department officials that \"in any circumstance, all officials at the Department of Justice follow the guidance of career ethics officials.\"",
      "\"[Blanche and Woodward] were both personally involved in this very case, and you don't get more of a conflict of interest than that,\" Dueffert said. \"It's just unimaginable that they should proceed.\"",
      "He called on both to recuse themselves, though he said, \"I'm skeptical that will happen.\"",
      "In July, Bondi fired the Justice Department's top ethics official.",
      "Stacey Young, a former Justice Department attorney, said,\"This is a clear example of the conflicts posed by installing the president's personal defense lawyers to run the Justice Department.\"",
      "\"These same loyalists ousted senior ethics officials who would have helped guide them through the proper way to handle the president's unprecedented demand for taxpayer money,\" said Young, who now leads the Justice Connection, a networking organization to help former Justice Department employees who have resigned or been fired.",
      "On Capitol Hill, GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said he has \"a lot of optics concerns\" about the president's claims.",
      "\"I don't think the president should be treated any differently than anyone else who was maybe a target of prosecution,\" he told reporters Wednesday. \"Obviously, if the prosecution prevailed, it should be a no-brainer that there wouldn't be any compensation. If it's one where the president as a defendant prevailed, ... let's talk about how that's been handled in the past.\"",
      "Before a trial in either of the federal cases against Mr. Trump could take place, both were dismissed after the election at the request of the special counsel because the Justice Department's longstanding policy is not to prosecute a sitting president."

He greeted his attorneys and interpreter, who had flown in to Lafayette for the hearing, with a \"Good afternoon.\"",

      "Prosecutors claim he coordinated a \"group of armed fighters\" to cross into Israel after hearing about Hamas' attack.

The max penalty for the first count is life in prison, the max penalty for the latter is 10 years. Both counts are connected to his alleged involvement with the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack against Israel. He's also accused of lying on his visa application form to gain entry into the U.S.",
      "For now, his attorney waived his right to a detention hearing, and al-Muhtadi signed the waiver in court. Thus, the judge said she is issuing an order for detention pending trial.",

      "North Carolina is the latest Republican-led state to reshape a congressional district in hopes of boosting the GOP's chances of keeping the House in next year's midterms.",
      "The North Carolina House on Wednesday passed a new congressional map that shifts the state's major battleground Democratic-held House district and makes it more favorable to conservatives, following the state Senate's approval one day earlier. And while the state has a Democratic governor, his veto power is limited and he cannot reject a standalone map.",
      "North Carolina Republicans are targeting Democratic Rep. Don Davis, whose victory in 2024 was a rare bright spot for Democrats.",
      "Rep. Suzan DelBene, the chair of the House Democrats' campaign arm, said in a statement that the map \"was clearly drawn to dilute the voting power of Black voters by dismantling the Black Belt to stop North Carolinians from holding Trump and House Republicans accountable for ignoring the needs of hardworking Americans.\"",
      "In a statement obtained by CBS News, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said state Republican lawmakers \"rigged the state's congressional map after being ordered to do so by Donald Trump,\" adding that it was a \"morally corrupt move\" that was \"part of a long line of desperate schemes to steal the midterms.\"",
      "Jeffries also said in a news conference Wednesday that Democrats plan to \"sue immediately,\" saying they believe the new North Carolina maps \"clearly violate the voting rights.\"",
      "North Carolina Republicans are championing the map. Before the redraw passed, the state House GOP Majority Leader Brenden Jones said during a speech that \"the end result is a congressional map that should perform to elect 11 Republicans,\" from North Carolina, rather than the 10 that serve in the U.S. House right now.",
      "North Carolina's quick turn to draw new congressional lines is deeply intertwined with attempts by Republican leaders around the country to help President Trump. Democrats are locked out of power in Washington and the House is widely seen as the party's most likely route to gaining back power in next year's midterms.",
      "At one point, Democrats winning back as few as three seats in the 2026 elections may have flipped control of the House. That dynamic has changed considerably in recent months as Mr. Trump and his allies have looked for Republican-led states to take Democratic districts and shift their boundaries in a way that boosts the GOP's chances at keeping control of the House next year.",
      "Republicans in Texas overhauled their state's map earlier this summer in an attempt to flip five Democratic-held seats. In response, California Democrats have put a measure on next month's ballot that could flip five of the state's GOP House seats toward Democrats. Not long after, Missouri Republicans were able to follow through on a longstanding push to alter a\u00a0 Kansas City-area district held for decades by Democrats and turn into one that favors Republicans.",
      "North Carolina is now primed to join that list, and more states could follow before the end of the year. No Democrat has won North Carolina in a presidential election since 2008, but statewide races in the southern battleground tend to be competitive. The state has a Democratic governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general but its two U.S. senators are Republicans. The state's congressional districts are already tilted to favor the GOP, with 10 of the state's 14 Congressional seats currently held by Republicans.",
      "Under the new map, Davis' Democratic battleground 1st Congressional District seat will be moved to try and make it more winnable for Republicans. This is done by adding parts of GOP Rep. Greg Murphy's current 3rd Congressional District, to the 1st.",
      "Davis said in a statement Tuesday that \"this new congressional map is beyond the pale,\" and noted that \"in the 2024 election with record voter turnout, NC's First Congressional District elected both President Trump and me.\"",

      "Columbia and Brown universities have also signed agreements to end federal investigations and restore access to federal funding. Columbia paid $200 million to the government, and Brown paid $50 million to Rhode Island workforce development organizations.",
      "The Justice Department had accused Ryan, the former UVA president, of engaging in \"attempts to defy and evade federal anti-discrimination laws and the directives of your board.\" The department focused on complaints that Ryan was too slow to implement a March 7 resolution by the university's governing board demanding the eradication of DEI on campus.",
      "As a public university, the University of Virginia was an outlier in the Trump administration's effort to reform higher education according to the president's vision. Previously, the administration had devoted most of its scrutiny to elite private colleges, including Harvard and other Ivy League institutions, accused of tolerating antisemitism.",
      "Since then, the White House has expanded its campaign to other public campuses, including the University of California, Los Angeles, and George Mason University.",
      "The Charlottesville campus became a flashpoint this year after conservative critics accused it of simply renaming its DEI initiatives rather than ending them. The Justice Department expanded the scope of its review several times and announced a separate investigation into alleged antisemitism in May.",
      "Earlier in October, UVA declined to sign an agreement pledging to uphold the Trump administration's higher education priorities, or risk losing out on preferred access to federal funding."

      "\"Reaching $38 trillion in debt during a government shutdown is the latest troubling sign that lawmakers are not meeting their basic fiscal duties,\" Michael A. Peterson, CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a nonpartisan nonprofit focused on fiscal policy, said in a statement.",
      "\"If it seems like we are adding debt faster than ever, that's because we are. We passed $37 trillion just two months ago, and the pace we're on is twice as fast as the rate of growth since 2000,\" he added.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history, the 35-day stalemate in 2018, cost the economy $11 billion, largely to a reduction in spending by federal workers, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "In September, 81% of voters surveyed by the Peterson Foundation highlighted the national debt an issue of concern. According to economists, the growing mountain of debt leads to higher interest costs for the U.S. government.",
      "Interest payments on the nation's debt are forecast to rise from $4 trillion over the past decade to $14 trillion over the next 10 years, curtailing public and private spending in key economic sectors, the Peterson Foundation said.",
      "Rising U.S. debt could also undermine investor confidence in the economy, David Kelly, chief global strategist with J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in a report\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "Credit rating agency Moody's\u00a0downgraded the U.S. credit rating\u00a0in May from its top rating of Aaa to Aa1, reflecting investor concerns about the government's growing debt. The two other major credit rating agencies, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings, have also lowered the U.S. rating.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and a prominent voice on the nation's fiscal policies, also expressed concern at the national debt topping $38 trillion.",
      "\"The reality is that we're becoming distressingly numb to our own dysfunction. We fail to pass budgets, we blow past deadlines, we ignore fiscal safeguards and we haggle over fractions of a budget while leaving the largest drivers untouched,\" she said in a statement. \"Social Security and Medicare, for example, are just seven years from having their trust funds depleted \u2014 and you don't hear anything from our political leaders on how to avoid such a disaster.\""

    "summary": "Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, delivered a marathon speech protesting President Trump's policies that stretched 22 hours and 37 minutes.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, delivered a marathon speech on the Senate floor that stretched 22 hours and 37 minutes across Tuesday and Wednesday, protesting President Trump's policies in one of the longest addresses in the chamber in recent years.",
      "Merkley, 68, began speaking at 6:21 p.m. on Tuesday and continued until 4:58 p.m. Wednesday. Over the course of the speech, he railed against the Trump administration for its deportation efforts, canceled federal programs, so-called weaponization of the Justice Department and efforts to send the National Guard into American cities \u2014 including Portland, Oregon.",
      "\"I've come to the Senate floor tonight to ring the alarm bells,\" Merkley said at the outset of his speech. \"We're in the most perilous moment, the biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War. President Trump is shredding our Constitution.\"",
      "A slew of Merkley's fellow Democrats took turns asking him extended questions, giving him breaks over the course of his speech and providing a platform for other senators to make their own arguments. The address was the fourth-longest in the Senate since 1900, according to the Senate Press Gallery.",
      "Portland, which Merkley represents, has been a target of Mr. Trump's ire for years and again came into focus last month, when the president directed the Defense Department to coordinate the deployment of National Guard troops to the city. On Monday, a federal appeals court cleared the way for the administration to federalize and deploy members of the Oregon National Guard to Portland while a legal challenge moves forward.",
      "\"President Trump wants us to believe that Portland, Oregon, in my home state, is full of chaos and riots because if he can say to the American people that there are riots, he can say there's a rebellion,\" Merkley said. \"And if there's a rebellion, he can use that to strengthen his authoritarian grip on our nation. Pretend there are riots, or even try to provoke violence, and tighten his authoritarian grip.\"",
      "Merkley said Portlanders aren't \"taking the bait.\" Instead, he said, \"they are demonstrating with joy and whimsy.\"",
      "\"They want to make it clear to the world that what Trump is saying about there being violent protests or a rebellion in Portland is just not true,\" he added.",
      "The remarks come as Democrats and Republicans remain at an impasse over how to fund the government, with the shutdown stretching into a fourth week Wednesday. Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, criticized the speech in a post on X before it began Tuesday evening, highlighting that Capitol Police are not being paid.",
      "\"The Democrats are going to make Capitol Police and Capitol support staff \u2014 who they refuse to pay \u2014 work all night so they can give speeches patting themselves on the back for shutting down the government and hurting the American people,\" Barrasso said.",
      "Merkley's marathon address follows a record-breaking speech by Booker on the Senate floor earlier this year, spanning more than 25 hours. The speech was also made in a protest against the Trump administration's policies. In 2017, Merkley delivered one of the longest Senate floor speeches on record when he spoke for more than 15 hours to oppose the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer praised Merkley on the floor as the speech approached 21 hours in the afternoon.",
      "\"I just want to thank the great senator from Oregon for his strength, his fortitude, his integrity, and just shining a spotlight on this erosion of democracy under Trump,\" Schumer said.",
      "\"I've been on the Senate floor to ring the alarm bells for a long time,\" Merkley said as he began wrapping up his remarks.",
      "He thanked members of his staff and the Capitol Police and staff who stayed to continue the chamber's operations, and colleagues who engaged with him during the remarks.",
      "\"We are in the most perilous moment, the biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War,\" Merkley said. \"President Trump is shredding our Constitution.\""

    "summary": "Wholesale prices for frozen turkeys are expected to be $1.32 per pound this year, a 40% increase from last year's average.",
    "story": [
      "Turkeys aren't known for flying but their prices are soaring ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "A September outlook report from the United States Agriculture Department estimates that wholesale prices for frozen turkeys will be $1.32 per pound this year, a 40% increase from 2024's\u00a0average of $0.94 per pound.",
      "The wholesale price is what retailers pay to buy items in bulk. Retailers then decide how much they want to charge consumers.",
      "The reason the birds \u2014 traditionally the centerpiece at the Thanksgiving table \u2014 are getting more expensive comes down to supply. The number of available turkeys has shrunk in recent years amid slightly weakened demand and avian flu outbreaks, according to USDA\u00a0data.",
      "More than 3 million turkeys have been impacted by bird flu outbreaks this year, including over half a million this month alone, USDA data shows.",
      "That translates to less turkeys: USDA forecasts that farmers raised around 195 million turkeys in 2025 compared with 200 million in 2024, a 3% decrease. To be sure, the number of turkeys in supply has been sliding over the last decade. In 2016, farmers raised around 245 million turkeys, roughly 50 million more than today's supply.",
      "Deals abound",
      "Amid the rise in wholesale turkey prices, several companies are floating deals in an attempt to win over budget-conscious customers.",
      "Walmart announced Tuesday that it is offering Butterball turkeys for $0.97 per pound this year. The retailer also said its 10-person meal deal will cost under $4 per person. Grocery chain Aldi has\u00a0offered a similar deal, at $40 for 10 people.",
      "\"Retailers typically use turkeys as a loss leader,\" David Ortega, a professor and food economist at Michigan State University, told CBS News. \"That is, they price them very competitively \u2014 sometimes even below cost \u2014 to draw shoppers into stores ahead of Thanksgiving.\"",
      "Both deals represent a decrease in the average cost for a Thanksgiving meal from 2024, which was $58 for 10 people, according to a\u00a0report from the American Farm Bureau Federation. Frozen turkeys that year accounted for a large share of Americans' holiday grocery bill, at an average retail cost of $25 for a 16-pound bird.",
      "Despite the surge in wholesale turkey prices in 2025, Bernt Nelson, an economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation\u00a0 doesn't expect consumer prices to increase much.",
      "\"We see that uptick right now in the wholesale price by about 40%, so we'll definitely see some price increases there, but I don't think they're going to go a whole lot higher above where they are at,\" he said on a Farm Bureau podcast.",
      "\"Higher wholesale prices for turkeys are likely to translate into somewhat higher prices at the grocery store, but the increase consumers see will probably be smaller than what's happening upstream,\" Ortega explained.",
      "In other welcome news for shoppers, CBS News' price tracker shows that prices for Thanksgiving dinner ingredients like butter, milk and potatoes haven't budged much compared with prices the same time last year."

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 16:10:49 -0400",
    "summary": "New tax cuts in the Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill\" act are retroactive to 2025, which means many Americans may get bigger refunds in early 2026. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Many Americans could see heftier tax refunds next year when they file their 2025 tax returns, largely due to new provisions enacted through the Republicans' \"one big, beautiful bill\" act that are retroactive to the start of the current year, according to an analysis from Oxford Economics.",
      "Total taxpayer savings could amount to an additional $50 billion through bigger tax refunds or a cut in their 2026 taxes, Oxford lead economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in the Oct. 21 report.",
      "A $50 billion boost in tax refunds would represent an 18% increase from the $275 billion in refunds the IRS sent this year to nearly 94 million taxpayers who overpaid on their 2024 federal tax returns, according to data\u00a0from the agency. The average refund in 2025 was $2,939, according to the IRS.",
      "The \"big, beautiful bill,\" signed into law by Mr. Trump in July, extended the tax reductions enacted under th 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. But the new law also added an array of new breaks, such as eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income. It also lifted the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, from $10,000 to $40,000, a change that is expected to primarily help higher-income Americans.",
      "Although the tax changes are effective this year, the IRS hasn't yet updated its\u00a0withholding tables, which provide guidance to employers on how much in federal tax to withhold from their employees' paychecks, Vanden Houten wrote. As a result, many taxpayers are unlikely to have taken the step of lowering their withholding amounts on their own, she noted.",
      "\"[M]any taxpayers will pay too much in tax this year and see larger tax refunds or smaller tax bills next year than otherwise would be the case,\" Vanden Houten said, adding that will likely produce a \"windfall at tax time in 2026 through larger refunds and lower tax bills.\"",
      "The Oxford analysis doesn't estimate the average size of individual tax refunds next year, but it noted that a \"disproportionate share of the benefits will accrue to upper-income households.\"",
      "That echoes earlier analyses from tax specialists who said that higher-income Americans are likely to see a bigger relative boost from the new tax law compared with lower-income households. For instance, $6 of every $10 in new tax breaks from the \"big, beautiful bill\" will go to the top 20% of households, or people with incomes over $217,000 per year, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis published in July.",
      "Wealthy households also will benefit from the higher SALT cap, which can only be tapped by tax filers who itemize \u2014 typically high-income households with sizable deductions that surpass the standard deduction. That boost from the bigger SALT break will deliver an extra $5.1 billion in total tax savings, Oxford estimated.",
      "Seniors are also likely to enjoy a bigger tax refund in early 2026, with the new $6,000 deduction for people over 65 years old under the \"big, beautiful bill\" providing as much as $9.3 billion in tax savings, the Oxford estimated."

Platner didn't offer details about the new tattoo when he spoke to AP, but he later\u00a0posted a video on X\u00a0in which he showed off the updated version.",
      "He wrote, \"Years ago I got a skull and crossbones tattoo with my buddies in the Marine Corps.   I was appalled to learn it closely resembled a Nazi symbol. I altered it yesterday, into something that isn't deeply offensive to my core beliefs.   I am very sorry to all of you who had to contemplate a symbol of hate over the past 48 hours.\"",
      "The tattoo revelation closely follows the discovery of a series of controversial online statements on Reddit, including one in which he dismissed sexual assault in the military. Platner attempted to explain his past online comments in a video he posted to X last week. In it, he addressed not only his previous comments dismissing military sexual assaults, but also his questioning Black patrons' gratuity habits and criticizing police officers and rural Americans.",

They're indefensible, they're hurtful, and they're offensive. The question, though, is I believe in second chances. I believe a lot of people say things at their most vulnerable times. They say things when they're young that again are offensive. And the question for me is whether or not they actually learn from them, whether or not they actually reflect on those, that they're sincere in their apology, and more importantly that they have changed their behavior.\"",

      "The prosecution noted to the judge that the case is complex, involving classified documents litigation, and will therefore require certain classified information protections under the Patriot Act. They said they plan to propose a protective order governing discovery in the case.",
      "After the hearing ended, al-Muhtadi's attorney, Aaron Adams, was heard telling his client, \"so far so good.\" The defendant was heard asking Adams more about jail conditions, including how his family is doing.",
      "Asked about that conversation, Adams said, \"no comment.\"",
      "Prosecutors in the case also declined to comment and referred all press inquiries to a public relations spokesperson. CBS News has sent emails to that spokesperson for comment."

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 16:13:08 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump said in September he would not back an Israeli annexation of the West Bank.",
    "story": [
      "Israeli lawmakers on Wednesday voted to advance two proposed bills that call for the formal annexation of the already Israeli-occupied West Bank, an ambition openly promoted by far-right ministers in recent months but opposed by President Trump.",
      "The vote by Israel's parliament, the Knesset, came with Vice President JD Vance visiting Israel to shore up the Gaza ceasefire that was brokered by Mr. Trump's administration. The president has made clear he would not back annexation of the West Bank.",
      "\"I will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank,\" Mr.\u00a0Trump told reporters at the White House in September. \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "Israeli media reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had called on lawmakers from his Likud party to abstain from voting. In a statement, the party called the votes \"another provocation by the opposition aimed at damaging our relations with the United States.\"",
      "\"True sovereignty will be achieved not through a showy law for the record, but through proper work on the ground,\" it added.",
      "During a preliminary reading on Wednesday, lawmakers voted in favor of examining two bills, which means they will be brought forward for further readings in the Knesset. The first text, passed by a vote of 32-9, proposed annexing Maale Adumim, a large Israeli settlement home to some 40,000 people just east of Jerusalem.",
      "The second proposal to annex the entire West Bank was supported by 25 members, while 24 voted against. Almost all the lawmakers from Netanyahu's Likud party boycotted the vote, with one voting in support of the measure, according to Israeli media. The Knesset has 120 members in total.",
      "Far-right members of Netanyahu's Cabinet have openly called for annexation of the West Bank, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967.",
      "\"Mr. Prime Minister. The Knesset has spoken. The people have spoken,\" Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich posted on social media.",
      "\"The time has come to impose full sovereignty over all of Judea and Samaria \u2014 the inheritance of our ancestors \u2014 and to promote peace agreements in exchange for peace with our neighbors with strength,\" he said, using the Israeli Biblical term for the West Bank.",
      "In a statement, the Ramallah-based Palestinian foreign ministry condemned the Knesset's vote, saying it \"strongly rejects the Knesset's attempts to annex Palestinian land.\"",
      "\"The ministry emphasized that the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank, including Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, constitute a single geographic unit over which Israel has no sovereignty,\" it said, as reported by Palestinian official news agency Wafa.",
      "Jordan's foreign ministry also said it \"strongly condemned\" the votes, which it called \"a blatant violation of international law and a grave undermining of the two-state solution.\"",
      "All of Israel's settlements in the West Bank are widely considered illegal under international law, but Israel disputes that and Netanyahu's government has supported their expansion.",
      "In August, Israel approved a major civilian settlement project between Maale Adumim and Jerusalem in an area of the disputed territory that the international community has warned threatens the viability of a future Palestinian state.",
      "At a signing ceremony for the project in September, Netanyahu vowed that there would be no Palestinian state. The 20-point Middle East peace plan put forward by the U.S. recognizes that there may be a \"credible pathway\" for Palestinian statehood after the Palestinian Authority, which has limited autonomy in some parts of the West Bank, undergoes reforms.",
      "\"We are going to fulfill our promise that there will be no Palestinian state, this place belongs to us,\" Netanyahu said at the event in Maale Adumim.",
      "Excluding Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, the West Bank is home to around 3 million Palestinians, as well as more than 500,000 Israelis living in settlements.",
      "Since the war in Gaza began in October 2023, violence has also surged in the West Bank, with Palestinian residents describing escalating attacks by Israeli settlers. Some attacks on Israelis, by knife- or gun-wielding Palestinians, have originated from the territory.",
      "Vance met with Netanyahu on Wednesday as the fragile ceasefire deal in Gaza continues to hold between Israel and Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization by the U.S.",
      "\"We have a very, very tough task ahead of us, which is to disarm Hamas but rebuild Gaza to make life better for the people in Gaza, but also to ensure that Hamas is no longer a threat to our friends in Israel. That's not easy,\" Vance told reporters. \"There's a lot of work to do, but I feel very optimistic about where we are.\""

      "They said the abduction by unknown assailants took place only about 100 yards from the presidential palace in Niamey, where ousted President Mohamed Bazoum has been held since he was toppled by a coup more than two years ago.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Niamey issued\u00a0a security alert Wednesday warning that American citizens \"remain at a heightened risk of kidnapping throughout Niger, including in the capital city.\"",
      "Sources told CBS News the man abducted on Tuesday is a missionary who has worked for years for a U.S.-based charity.",
      "CBS News has asked the U.S. State Department for any information it can provide about the apparent abduction.",
      "The sources said the American was kidnapped by three unidentified armed men. Messages circulating among security officials in Niamey suggested the American had been working in Niger since 2010.",
      "There has been no known demand from any kidnappers, nor any official response from the Nigerien government nor the U.S. Embassy in Niamey.",
      "The U.S. Embassy said it is adding security measures due to the risk of kidnapping, including requiring armored vehicles for Embassy personnel and family travel, imposing a curfew and and declaring restaurants and open-air markets off-limits to personnel and their families.",
      "A State Department spokesperson said that the U.S. Embassy has been working with local authorities since being alerted to the incident.",
      "\"It is a top priority for the Trump Administration to look after the safety of every American, and we are seeing efforts from across the U.S. government to support the recovery and safe return of this U.S. citizen,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The apparent kidnapping comes two years after a July 2023 coup that removed Bazoum and brought General Abdourahamane Tiani to power, with his military junta vowing to restore security.",
      "Sources told CBS News the back door of the presidential palace is just a few hundred yards from where the kidnapping took place, in the capital's highly secured Plateau district.",
      "Sources told CBS News that Basoum has been held in the palace since his ouster, living in two rooms with no windows and no outside contact permitted by the military junta apart from an occasional doctor's visit. Tiani has stayed in a military barracks not far from the residential palace since seizing power.",
      "Security officials in the region have speculated that the abduction could be the work of the ISIS affiliate in the region, the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, which operates in the area along the shared borders of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso.",
      "From Niamey, it is only about a one-hour drive to the Burkina Faso border, and two hours to the Malian border.",
      "Multiple Nigerien sources said Wednesday that the abduction was carried out by \"three armed individuals\" who \"neutralized the guard before taking over their victim and quickly leaving the scene.\"",
      "They said the kidnapped American's phone was tracked less than an hour after the abduction late Tuesday night to a location about 56 miles north of Niamey \u2014 in an area \"considered a sanctuary for groups affiliated with the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara\" between the Nigerien capital and the Malian border.",
      "All three of the neighboring states have seen military regimes overthrow civilian rule within the last half of a decade, along with Gabon and Guinea, earning the region of West and Central Africa the dubious moniker of Africa's \"coup belt.\""

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 15:06:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Master jeweler Stephen Portier said the Louvre robbers might recut the stolen gems, which would significantly decrease their value.",
    "story": [
      "The thieves who made off with priceless treasure from the Louvre may have a hard time cashing in.",
      "The French government valued the pieces \u2014 which include an exquisite tiara and a sapphire necklace worn by French royalty \u2014 at about $102 million. But Stephen Portier, master jeweler and Parisian gem appraiser, says that's only if they're intact.",
      "If the thieves prise the jewels out of their settings to sell on the black market, they will be worth much less, Portier said.",
      "\"Taken apart and sold as stones and metal, their value drops by 90%,\" he said.",
      "Like many jewelry professionals, Portier nurses a sliver of hope that the police will catch the robbers and recover the historic pieces undamaged. But he knows the chances are slim. With so much attention on the pieces, they will be too hard to sell as-is. They will also be highly illegal to buy.",
      "\"The market for fine jewelry is big,\" he said. \"But the network is small. Everybody knows everybody in the world of precious stone.\"",
      "\"The whole world knows about this robbery. Dealers will have pictures of every single piece up in their offices,\" he continued. \"So if they think they're being offered diamonds from the Louvre ... They will ask some hard questions. And contact the police.\"",
      "The Louvre is likely to have minute descriptions of the precious stones in the treasures that were taken in the brazen heist, which saw the thieves enter through a window and smash antique glass cases before escaping with the treasure. The thieves took nine pieces, but dropped the crown of Empress Eugenie as they made their escape.",
      "Each stone in the stolen pieces has \"unique properties,\" like their weight, color and tiny impurities, Portier said. These descriptors \"are like the stones' DNA.\"",
      "Some of the pieces, notably a brooch in the shape of a bow with elaborate tassels, contain hundreds of tiny diamonds. Even these smaller stones will be hard for the thieves to fence.",
      "They're at least a century and a half old, cut in a distinctive old-fashioned style.  Criminal specialists could try re-cutting them to disguise them, says Portier,  but that would make them even smaller and much less valuable.",
      "Among the stolen objects is an exquisite diamond and pearl tiara.",
      "\"Old pearls, especially large ones, are easy to identify by their shape and color,\" said Portier.",
      "Theoretically, it is possible to make the large pearls in it unrecognizable with a risky process known as peeling, Portier said.",
      "\"You need a solvent like perfume, or hairspray.  They dissolve the surface of the pearl and hide the minute cracks of age,\" Portier explained. \"But it's a dangerous game, because it can expose the layer below which may be an unattractive color and so the pearl suddenly becomes much less valuable.\"",
      "Given that getting rid of the jewels will be difficult, and not hugely profitable, why did the thieves commit such a risky crime?",
      "\"Good question,\" Portier said.  \"Good question.\""

      "The grandchildren of the last woman to be executed in Britain have called for Ruth Ellis to be pardoned, 70 years after she was sent to the gallows for murdering her \"abusive\" lover, their lawyers said Wednesday.",
      "Ellis, a 28-year-old nightclub hostess, was hanged in July 1955 for shooting dead racing driver David Blakely as he came out of the Magdala pub in London three months earlier.",
      "The case gripped Britain and was turned into the 1985 film \"Dance with a Stranger\" starring Miranda Richardson and Rupert Everett. It also inspired this year's true crime miniseries\u00a0\"A Cruel Love: The Ruth Ellis Story.\"",
      "Four of Ellis' six grandchildren have formally applied to Justice Minister David Lammy for a posthumous pardon.",

      "Such abuse was poorly understood at the time, but would in a modern-day case likely result in a charge of manslaughter not murder, the firm said.",
      "\"We are determined to do what we can to right this historic injustice and honor not only Ruth but all victims of domestic abuse who have been let down by the criminal justice system,\" her granddaughter Laura Enston said in a statement.",
      "\"Ruth was traumatized\"",
      "Enston's mother Georgina was just three when Ellis was hanged at London's Holloway Prison after the trial jury took just 20 minutes to find her guilty.",
      "Enston said her grandmother would now have been considered a victim of battered woman syndrome and treated very differently by the justice system.",
      "\"At the time there was no appetite to give Ruth a fair chance and we now realize how much social bias was at play,\" she said.",
      "The glamorous single mother of two from a modest background had shown no emotion during her trial.",
      "\"She inadvertently played up to that sort of cold-blooded killer persona that she'd been portrayed to be, but knowing what we know now about trauma and slow-burn provocation, Ruth was traumatized ... and typical of domestic abuse victims,\" Enston said.",
      "The abuse included an incident 10 days before the killing when Ellis suffered a miscarriage after Blakely, the baby's father, punched her in the stomach.",
      "James Libson of Mischon de Reya, said Ellis \"suffered considerably\" at the hands of her \"abusive, violent partner.\"",
      "Alex Bailin, who also represents the Ellis family, said in a statement: \"Thankfully, 70 years after Ruth was hanged, there is now a much better understanding of the impact of domestic abuse on the emotional wellbeing and behavior of victims.\"",
      "\"She should never have been executed\"",
      "\"While there is no dispute that Ruth Ellis killed David Blakely, the weight of evidence of her vulnerability makes it absolutely clear that she should never have been executed,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Ellis' hanging provoked a public outcry and helped swing public opinion against the death penalty.",
      "Following a number of other controversial executions and a series of miscarriages of justice it was permanently abolished for murder in 1969.",
      "Two years after Ellis' execution, the law was also changed to allow a defense of diminished responsibility.",
      "The Court of Appeal in 2003 upheld Ellis' conviction after the family mounted an earlier attempt to clear her name.",
      "Unlike court appeals however, pardons can be issued on the grounds of broader factors that may render a conviction unfair.",
      "Enston, whose own mother sat her down to watch the film about Ellis when she was seven years old, said it had had a \"devastating\" effect on the family.",
      "Her mother and uncle never really recovered and the grandchildren had felt the \"ripple effects.\"",
      "She said they were determined to correct the narrative around the case for themselves and their grandmother \u2014 but also for the thousands of women who endure domestic violence every day and are \"let down by the criminal justice system.\"",
      "Her family have spent decades\u00a0fighting for her case to be reconsidered, BBC News reported.",

      "Yousafzai also writes about finding love and overcoming her early fears of marriage. She married Asser Malik, a Pakistani sports management investor, in 2021, describing their relationship as one built on partnership and shared values.",
      "\"I had doubts about marriage. Growing up, I had seen little girls married off, forcefully, illegally, and I was afraid of marriage,\" she said. \"When I met the right person, I knew I wanted to be with him.\""

      "Sudan's government relocated to Port Sudan when the\u00a0civil war erupted in April 2023, and Burhan has been pushing to show a normalization of life in the capital city since then, encouraging Sudanese civilians to return to Khartoum and undertaking a six-month intensive reconstruction campaign across the city.",
      "Burhan is expected to move back to the presidential palace, which had been severely damaged in the fighting, in the relatively near future. He has called on the government's various ministries to move back to their headquarters in Khartoum by early next year.",
      "European diplomats are expected to visit Khartoum by the end of this month, with SAF officials pushing for Western countries to reopen their embassies.",
      "Port Sudan has been Sudan's only functioning international airport since the war began, despite several recent drone attacks in the vicinity of that facility, too.",
      "Residents say Khartoum has been largely calm since the SAF pushed RSF forces out of the capital in March. The RSF has concentrated its military efforts since the spring on the beleaguered Darfur region, where it has been trying for weeks to fully capture the city of el-Fasher, the last Darfur city not under its control.",
      "El-Fasher has been completely surrounded, cut off to the outside world and under siege, for weeks. Residents say the markets are empty after the RSF built earthen berms to surround the city, cutting off vital supplies.",
      "The U.N. has warned that fighting in el-Fasher has intensified, including repeated drone strikes.",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said last week that el-Fasher was \"under siege from all directions.\"",
      "Tens of thousands of Sudanese have been killed in the war, with millions forced to flee from their homes.",
      "The conflict began as a power struggle between Hemedti and Burhan, but descended quickly info full-scale war between their forces, fueling what the U.N. says is the world's worst humanitarian crisis."

      "Kyiv \u2013 A Russian missile and drone barrage on Ukraine killed six people in and around the capital Kyiv overnight, including two children, proving once again that Vladimir Putin isn't feeling \"enough pressure\" to end the war against his neighbors, Ukraine's leader said.",
      "The wave of strikes left at least 17 other people wounded and triggered power cuts across the country, Ukrainian authorities said, hours after President Trump's efforts to settle the nearly four-year war appeared to hit another roadblock. The White House said Tuesday that a planned meeting between Mr. Trump and Putin in Hungary \u2014 announced by the U.S. leader less than a week earlier \u2014 was canceled.",
      "A White House official said there were \"no plans\" for such a meeting in the \"immediate future,\" after Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had a \"productive call,\" but determined that another in-person presidential summit was \"not necessary.\"",

      "\"Another night proving that Russia does not feel enough pressure for dragging out the war,\" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on social media following the latest overnight Russian attack on his country. \"As of now, 17 people are known to have been injured. Unfortunately, six people were killed, among them two children.\"",
      "AFP journalists in Kyiv heard multiple explosions during the night and saw a pillar of smoke rising above the capital. The strikes also targeted the country's energy infrastructure, leaving thousands without heating and electricity across Ukraine as cold fall temperatures start to bite, according to the energy ministry.",
      "\"Due to a massive missile and drone attack on the energy infrastructure, emergency power outages have been introduced in most regions of Ukraine,\" it said in a statement.",
      "Russia said it had intercepted 33 Ukrainian drones overnight without reporting any substantial damage.",

      "This week\u00a0Mr. Trump said that while he believed Ukraine \"could still win\" the war, \"I don't think they will.\"",
      "The president has pressured Zelenskyy to give up Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, 78% of which Mr. Trump said Russia's invading forces already control, during talks at the White House on Friday, a senior Ukrainian official told AFP.",
      "Ukraine's leaders have repeatedly rejected those calls to give up any land, and many of America's European allies have warned against appeasing Russia by allowing it to unilaterally seize part of a sovereign nation.",
      "France, Germany and Britain have lead the charge to rally behind Ukraine, rejecting the idea of Kyiv giving up territory and the White House's repeated suggestion that the fighting should be frozen along the current front lines. Ukraine's European partners, under the guises of the \"coalition of the willing,\" are due to meet again in London on Friday to discuss support for Kyiv's war effort.",
      "But Zelenskyy has in recent days indicated a willingness to at least negotiate with Russia under a halt to the fighting based on Mr. Trump's proposal to freeze the battle lines where they currently stand.",
      "Speaking Wednesday during a visit to Oslo, Norway, Zelenskyy said Mr. Trump had \"proposed: 'Stay where we stay and begin conversation,'\" and he called that \"a good compromise,\" but the Ukrainian leader added: \"I'm not sure that Putin will support it, and I said it to the president.\"",
      "In a statement following the overnight attack, Zelenskyy said, \"Russian words about diplomacy mean nothing as long as the Russian leadership does not feel critical problems.\"",

    "story": [
      "Mosquitoes have been discovered in Iceland for the first time, a researcher told the AFP Monday. The volcanically active country has long been one of the world's few mosquito-free places.",
      "Three Culiseta annulata mosquitoes, two females and one male, were sighted around 20 miles north of Reykjavik, the country's capital, according to Matth\u00edas Alfre\u00f0sson, an entomologist at the Natural Science Institute of Iceland.",
      "\"They were all collected from wine ropes ... aimed at attracting moths,\" the researcher said in an email, referring to a method of adding sugar to heated wine and dipping ropes or strips of fabric into the solution, which are then hung outside to entice the sweet-toothed insects.",
      "The Icelandic Monitor, a local paper, reported that the insects had been found in a residential backyard. Bj\u00f6rn Hjaltason said he spotted the mosquitoes over multiple days. He captured the bugs and sent them to Alfre\u00f0sson for identification, the outlet reported.",
      "\"If three of them came straight into my garden, there were probably more,\" Hjaltason told the publication.",
      "Along with Antarctica, Iceland has long been one of the rare places on earth without a mosquito population. Iceland's neighboring countries, Norway, Scotland and Greenland, all are home to mosquitoes, according to Live Science.",
      "\"It is the first record of mosquitoes occurring in the natural environment in Iceland. A single Aedes nigripes specimen (arctic mosquito species) was collected many years ago from an airplane at Keflavik airport,\" Alfredsson said, adding that \"unfortunately, that specimen is lost.\"",

      "Rising temperatures, longer summers and milder winters, all brought on by climate change, create a more favorable environment for mosquitoes to thrive. Iceland has taken major steps to fight climate change, including opening a large carbon capture facility and establishing the planet's first direct air capture plant.",
      "But Alfredsson did not believe that a warmer climate explained the discovery. The species \"appears to be well adapted to colder climates,\" he said, which \"allows them to withstand long, harsh winters when temperatures drop below freezing.\"",
      "He added that its \"diverse breeding habitats ... further enhances its ability to persist in Iceland's challenging environment.\""

      "Investigations showed she had left France the day of the break-in and was preparing to return to China.",
      "At the time of her arrest, she was trying to dispose of nearly one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of melted gold pieces, the prosecutor said, without providing more details.",
      "The Natural History Museum curator discovered the theft of exhibited gold nuggets after a cleaner reported debris on site.",
      "The stolen items included nuggets from Bolivia donated in the 18th century, from Russia's Ural region gifted by Tsar Nicholas I in 1833, and from California dating to the gold rush era.",
      "A five-kilogram nugget from Australia discovered in 1990 was also taken, Beccuau said.",
      "Nearly six kilograms of native gold was stolen, with damages estimated at 1.5 million euros ($1.7 million), she added, noting that the historical and scientific value of the pieces was \"priceless.\"",

      "Police are also still on the hunt for thieves who stole priceless royal jewels from the Louvre museum in a spectacular daylight robbery on Sunday. Officials said Tuesday the jewels are worth an estimated $102 million not including their historical value to France.",
      "The heist has reignited a row over a lack of security in France's museums, which have suffered a spate of break-ins in recent months.",
      "In early September, thieves snatched three porcelain works worth millions of dollars and classed as national treasures in a heist at the Adrien Dubouche National Museum in Limoges in central France.",
      "Last November, four men with axes and baseball bats smashed the display cases in broad daylight at the Cognacq-Jay museum in Paris, making off with several 18th-century works. That heist resulted in an insurance payment of over $4 million to the Royal Collection Trust,\u00a0BBC News reported.",

      "President Trump warned Hamas on Monday against breaching the deal that took months to negotiate.",
      "\"They're gonna behave, they're gonna be nice,\" he said. \"And if they're not, we're gonna go and eradicate them if we have to.\"",
      "Kushner and Witkoff met Monday with Netanyahu, and the Israeli leader's office said Vance would also meet him this week. The vice president and second lady Usha Vance were greeted upon their arrival Tuesday by U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Yechiel Leiter and Israel's Minister of Justice Yariv Levin.",
      "Vance was scheduled to have a working lunch with Witkoff and Kushner on Tuesday before his meeting with Netanyahu.",
      "Ex-Israeli official casts doubt on prospects for Trump's peace plan",
      "Some Israelis remain skeptical that the Israeli prime minister is genuinely interested in a lasting peace. Among them is fierce Netanyahu critic Alon Pinkas, who served as an advisor to four Israeli foreign ministers.",
      "He told CBS News that Netanyahu signed the peace deal brokered by Mr. Trump, but never really backed its core purpose, or Mr. Trump's stated goal of securing an enduring peace in the heart of the Middle East.",
      "\"This was an agreement he was bullied into,\" Pinkas said. \"This is an agreement he signed under duress, and now he is developing a new scheme to manipulate Trump.\"",
      "Pinkas credited Mr. Trump for doing \"something that his predecessors were disinclined or hesitant to do, and that is exert real pressure\" on Israel's leader.",
      "\"It worked, but it only worked for the first phase,\" Pinkas said, referring to the living Israeli hostages being released and the ceasefire coming into effect.",
      "He said after the weekend's violence that the deal had been \"ostensibly restored, but when Netanyahu says, 'I'm restoring the ceasefire,' it's only because there's a visit here of the vice president, JD Vance, and because the U.S. sent its envoy.\"",
      "Pinkas said he was certain Israeli forces would resume operations in Gaza within days, noting they remained deployed in about half of the Palestinian territory.",
      "\"The hostages are no longer in danger because they were freed, and Hamas was not decisively destroyed, as Mr. Netanyahu promised and boasted and bragged for two years, so I see a serious incentive for Mr. Netanyahu to resume\" an offensive against Hamas, Pinkas told CBS News. \"Maybe not on a huge scale, given the agreement, but I do see ... a local skirmish that becomes a wider flare-up, that then deteriorates or escalates into a full Israeli military operation.\"",
      "Hamas' top negotiator said Tuesday that the group remained committed to the ceasefire agreement. But President Trump's peace plan calls for the demilitarization of Gaza, and many analysts, including Pinkas, have doubts that Hamas will willingly hand over all its weapons.",
      "\"That's probably the biggest flaw in the agreement,\" said Pinkas. \"The agreement in and of itself is a good agreement, but in order for an agreement like that to work, it requires good faith, good will, and trust. None of these ingredients exist. In fact, both sides have a vested interest in not progressing beyond the ceasefire.\"",
      "\"Hamas wants to lure Israel inside [Gaza] into a de-facto occupation, and mount an insurgency and show to the Palestinians that they are the real resistance. And Netanyahu wants to go in because he knows that if everything stops now and there is progress into the next phases, that almost inevitably means that he will be deemed as the guy who failed to defeat Hamas.\"",
      "Pinkas said that while the past two years of war have left Hamas defeated militarily and degraded, \"Hamas is not done. Hamas are there, and you see those pictures every day. You show them on CBS \u2014   Hamas gangs walking around in battle fatigues, armed. That's not going to cut it politically for Mr. Netanyahu.\"",
      "Speaking in a recent interview with CBS News' Tony Dokoupil, Netanyahu said his government had agreed \"to give peace a chance,\" but he noted that the conditions of Mr. Trump's 20-point peace plan \"are very clear \u2014 it's not only that we get the hostages out without getting our military out, but that we would subsequently have both demilitarization and disarmament. They're not the same thing. First Hamas has to give up its arms. And second, you want to make sure that there are no weapons factories inside Gaza. There's no smuggling of weapons into Gaza.\"",
      "\"We also agreed: Okay, let's get the first part done. Now let's give a chance to do the second part peacefully, which is my hope,\" the Israeli leader told CBS News."

    "published": "Tue, 21 Oct 2025 19:07:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir shares a personal account of the story that made headlines worldwide: her accusations against Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "In her posthumously published memoir, Virginia Roberts Giuffre shares a personal account of the story that made headlines worldwide: her accusations against Prince Andrew and years of alleged trafficking by Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"Nobody's Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice\" was released on Tuesday. Guiffre died by suicide earlier this year.",
      "Here are some key takeaways from the book:",
      "More details about Prince Andrew",
      "Giuffre's book alleges that she had sex with Prince Andrew three times, including when she was 17, after being trafficked by Epstein. One time, she said, was part of an orgy involving around eight other girls.",
      "\"The other girls all seemed and appeared to be under the age of eighteen and didn't really speak English,\" Giuffre said.",
      "She said that, as her legal case progressed, Andrew made it difficult for her legal team to serve him papers by \"fleeing to Queen Elizabeth's Balmoral Castle in Scotland and hiding behind its well-guarded gates.\" Andrew denied her allegations.",
      "But a turning point came with Andrew's November 2019 interview on the BBC program Newsnight. He was widely criticized for seeming to lack empathy when asked about the accusations, and Giuffre says the interview \"was like an injection of jet fuel\" for her legal team.",
      "\"Its contents would not only help us build an ironclad case against the prince but also open the door to potentially subpoenaing his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, and their daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie,\" Giuffre wrote.",
      "She said her settlement negotiations with Andrew began to move quickly after he hired American lawyer Andrew Brettler, who had worked with other public figures facing #MeToo allegations.",
      "Brettler \"was less reluctant than some of his British counterparts to face reality,\" Giuffre wrote.",
      "Giuffre said she and her team were asking for more than money as part of the settlement: They wanted an acknowledgement of what Giuffre had been through.",
      "\"After casting doubt on my credibility for so long \u2014 Prince Andrew's team had even gone so far as to try to hire internet trolls to hassle me \u2014 the Duke of York owed me a meaningful apology as well. We would never get a confession, of course.\"",
      "The settlement was announced on Feb. 15, 2022, and Prince Andrew and Giuffre issued a joint statement which made clear he would pay Giuffre money, but didn't specify the amount. It also said he would make a \"substantial donation\" in support of victims' rights to Giuffre's nonprofit organization. Andrew did not admit wrongdoing but said in court documents that he \"regrets his association with Epstein.\"",
      "\"I agreed to a one-year gag order, which seemed important to the prince because it ensured that his mother's Platinum Jubilee would not be tarnished any more than it already had been,\" Giuffre wrote.",
      "Last week, ahead of the publication of Giuffre's memoir, Prince Andrew announced he would no longer use his Duke of York title, after already having stepped back from royal duties in 2019.",
      "Mar-a-Lago and a meeting with Trump",
      "Before she first encountered Gislaine Maxwell and was brought into Epstein's world, in 2000, Giuffre worked at President Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, alongside her father, who was a maintenance man responsible for the air conditioning units in hotel rooms, as well as the clay tennis courts.",
      "\"I remember he gave me a brief tour before presenting me to the hiring manager who \u2014 after I passed both a drug test and a polygraph \u2014 agreed to take me on,\" Giuffre wrote. She said she met Mr. Trump a few days after starting work at the resort.",
      "\"They weren't friends exactly. But Dad worked hard, and Trump liked that,\" Giuffre said.",
      "When she met Mr. Trump in his office, she said he \"couldn't have been friendlier, telling me it was fantastic I was there.\"",
      "He also asked if she babysat, Guiffre wrote, mentioning families with children who stayed in his properties nearby.",
      "But it was also at Mar-a-Lago that Giuffre said she first met Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "\"One steaming hot day some weeks before my seventeenth birthday, I was walking toward the Mar-a-Lago spa, on my way to work, when a car slowed behind me. I wish I could say that I sensed that something evil was tracking me, but as I headed into the building, I had no inkling of the danger I was in,\" Giuffre said.",
      "Maxwell jumped out of the car and introduced herself to Giuffre.",
      "\"I wish I could say that I saw through Maxwell's polished facade \u2014 that, like a horse, I intuited the immense threat she posed to me. Instead, my first impression of Maxwell was the same one I formed when I greeted any well-heeled Mar-a-Lago guest. I'd be lucky, I thought, if I could grow up to be anything like her.\"",
      "Maxwell was convicted in 2021 on federal charges including sex trafficking conspiracy, and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Epstein died in jail in 2019 after his arrest on sex trafficking charges.",
      "Mr. Trump has denied knowledge of Epstein and Maxwell's activities.",
      "Giuffre's message to the world",
      "Giuffre writes about how the abuse she was subjected to affected her and how she dedicated herself to standing up those who harmed her and supporting others to do the same.",
      "\"Don't be fooled by those in Epstein's circle who say they didn't know what Epstein was doing,\" Guiffre said at the end of the book. \"Anyone who spent any significant amount of time with Epstein saw him touching girls in ways you wouldn't want a creepy old man touching your daughter. They can say they didn't know he was raping children. But they were not blind. (Not to mention the fact that many prominent people were still associating with him years after).\"",
      "Though it was difficult, Guiffre said she was glad she had worked to share her story.",
      "\"I don't regret it, but the constant telling and retelling has been extremely painful and exhausting,\" she said.",
      "Guiffre leaves readers with this message:",
      "\"I hope my story has moved you \u2014 to seek ways to free yourself from a bad situation, say, to stand up for someone else in need, or to simply reframe how you judge victims of sexual abuse. Each one of us can make positive change. I truly believe that. I hope for a world in which predators are punished, not protected; victims are treated with compassion, not shamed; and powerful people face the same consequences as anyone else. I yearn, too, for a world in which perpetrators face more shame than their victims do and where anyone who's been trafficked can confront their abusers when they are ready, no matter how much time has passed. We don't live in this world yet. \u2026 If this book moves us even an inch closer to a reality like that \u2014 if it helps just one person \u2014 I will have achieved my goal.\""

      "Prince Andrew's daughters Princess Beatrice of York and Princess Eugenie of York are facing the fallout from their father's scandals, according to experts.",
      "Last Friday, Andrew, 65, announced that he was giving up his royal title of the Duke of York and other honors following renewed public scrutiny of his relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and explosive new allegations made by the prince's late accuser Virginia Giuffre in her posthumous memoir, \"Nobody\u2019s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice.\"",

      "Fitzwilliams also pointed out that the \"scandal is likely to worsen\" with the publication of Giuffre's memoir, which was released Tuesday.",
      "\"This will not be easy!\" Fitzwilliams added.",
      "Royal commentator Amanda Matta noted that Beatrice and Eugenie are viewed by many in a sympathetic light as they have been impacted solely by association through no fault of their own.",
      "\"Beatrice and Eugenie are being described by friends as \u2018innocent victims\u2019 and \u2018collateral damage\u2019 in their father\u2019s ongoing fallout,\" Matta said. \"But they are aware enough of the weight of the scandal to lie low for now.\"",
      "\"They even skipped the British Museum Pink Ball this weekend in connection with their father\u2019s controversies,\" she continued. \"Their father\u2019s own distancing from royal duties and titles affects perceptions of the entire family. That can influence how charities, brands, or public institutions want to engage Beatrice and Eugenie, even if they themselves have behaved impeccably.\"",
      "\"They do support their father, and have never wavered from that,\" she added. \"Sources suggest Andrew has become increasingly dependent on his daughters for emotional support amid his reputational decline. That dynamic must be placing additional pressure on Beatrice and Eugenie in both their personal and professional lives.\"",
      "Beatrice and Eugenie have been described as \"collateral damage\" in their father's controversies.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",

      "She is married to Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, 41, a property developer and CEO of the real-estate firm Banda Property. He is also a count and a descendant of an Italian noble family. The couple share daughter Sienna Elizabeth, 4, and Beatrice is stepmother to Mozzi's son from a previous relationship, Christopher \"Wolfie\" Wolffe, 9.",

      "Though they are not working royals, both sisters were born princesses as the daughters of Andrew and the granddaughters of the late Queen Elizabeth II and hold the style \"Her Royal Highness\" by right of birth. Though Andrew and Sarah have lost their titles as the Duke and Duchess of York, Fox News Digital understands that Beatrice and Eugenie's titles will be wholly unaffected.",
      "Matta told Fox News Digital that Beatrice and Eugenie, as well as their parents, would not be excluded from royal family events despite the controversies.",
      "\"We likely will still see the former Yorks and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie at royal family events in the future, but in a more private capacity,\" she said. \"With Sarah\u2019s title no longer in use, though, her visibility at big royal events is unlikely \u2014 as is Andrew\u2019s. I don\u2019t foresee the pair doing the Christmas morning walk, for example, though they\u2019ll likely still be invited to family functions behind closed doors.\"",
      "\"The sisters are a different story, as their titles remain intact and their attendance at select royal functions has no reason to be in doubt,\" the royal expert added. \"They might still even greet the public during walkabouts for high-visibility occasions, family milestones, or key patronage events.\"",
      "\"Beatrice and Eugenie will likely always retain their \u2018Princess\u2019 status by birth, but their formal duties and proximity to the Crown could fade away in the future,\" she added. \"Essentially, in this case, they would move further from the \u2018working royal\u2019 sphere. But there\u2019s just no way to know for sure how they\u2019ll be affected, despite hopeful chatter that Prince William may tap them for official duties in the future.\"",
      "Princess Eugenie married her husband Jack Brooksbank in 2018.\u00a0 (Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images)",
      "Eugenie and Beatrice are known to have friendly relationships with their cousin Prince William, who is heir to the throne, and his wife Kate Middleton, both 43. Matta noted that the alliance between the sisters and William appears to have become stronger in recent years.",
      "\"There have been some signs of a more focused alignment between William and his cousins, particularly Eugenie who reportedly shares his environmental interests,\" she said. \"They can be seen engaging warmly with the Waleses at official events, and even stepping in to represent the institution at garden parties. That said, it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll be working in the same \u2018front-line\u2019 capacity as Will and Kate anytime soon.\"",
      "\"If Beatrice and Eugenie do aspire to take on larger royal roles or even maintain their current patronages, they will have to navigate the fallout from Andrew\u2019s scandals more proactively going forward,\" she explained. \"I imagine they are going back to the drawing board on public life, choosing engagements carefully, strengthening their personal brands, and demonstrating their independence from their parents.\"",
      "The sisters share a friendly relationship with William and Kate.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "Royal photographer Ian Pelham Turner noted that Beatrice and Eugenie are still viewed positively by the public and supported the royal family through King Charles III and Middleton's battles with cancer over the past two years.",
      "\"Most commentators feel sorry for Beatrice and Eugene for they are two very well-behaved young ladies who really stepped in to engage with royal duties during Charles and Kate\u2019s illnesses and convalescence,\" Turner said. \"They are both exemplary examples of how modern-day royals should behave in this day and age.\"",
      "\"Thus, we have been informed that there will be no retribution towards them and apparently will still be invited for Christmas at Sandringham,\" he added.",

      "In 2021, Giuffre filed a sexual abuse lawsuit against Andrew, who has consistently denied her allegations. In her memoir, she recounted his alleged attempts to discredit and intimidate her as well as reinforce his statements that they had never met. Giuffre wrote that the royal's team \"went so far as to try to hire internet trolls to hassle me\" and claimed his protection officers attempted to \"dig up dirt\" on her.",
      "On Oct. 19, The Mail on Sunday published leaked emails suggesting Andrew passed Giuffre\u2019s date of birth and her Social Security number to his personal protection officer with instructions to investigate if she had a criminal record in the U.S. \u2014 a step that could be part of a smear-campaign strategy.",
      "The leaked emails were reportedly sent hours before the 2011 release of a now-infamous photo showing Andrew with an underage Giuffre. In a statement, London's Metropolitan Police told the Guardian, \"We are aware of media reporting and are actively looking into the claims made.\"",

      "\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" a statement released by the royal, and obtained by Fox News Digital, read. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"",
      "\"With His Majesty\u2019s agreement, we feel I must now go a step further,\" the statement continued. \"I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"",
      "However, royal commentators said that the move might not be enough amid the public outrage and the damage that Andrew's controversies have inflicted on the royal family.",
      "Turner noted \"every day more insinuations are emerging about Andrew\u2019s character\" and politicians are calling for him to be stripped of all titles.",
      "While speaking with Fox News Digital, Matta weighed in on whether Charles was likely to take that step.",
      "\"In the end, I think it\u2019s important to remember this is being framed as \u2018voluntary,\u2019 and none of Andrew\u2019s titles have actually been removed, as that would require immense government involvement,\" she pointed out.",
      "\"Even titles one doesn\u2019t \u2018use\u2019 have cultural weight in the UK royal context. \u2018Stripping\u2019 them would send a crystal clear message about status, trust, and belonging \u2014 the acknowledgment that someone is no longer part of the inner institutional circle.

      "Prince Andrew is facing another wave of humiliation due to his accuser Virginia Giuffre's upcoming posthumous memoir, \"Nobody\u2019s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice.\"",
      "In the bombshell book, Giuffre \u2014 who died by suicide at the age of 41 earlier this year \u2014 recalled the multiple sexual encounters she allegedly had with the disgraced royal when she was just 17.",
      "She accused the prince of treating her as a \"birthright,\" described being trafficked for sex by Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and recounted an alleged group sex encounter and how she \"believed that I might die a sex slave.\"",
      "PRINCE ANDREW GIVES UP ROYAL TITLE WITH KING CHARLES' SUPPORT",
      "In addition to her explosive allegations, Giuffre made scathing remarks about Andrew's disastrous 2019 BBC \"Newsnight\" interview, reviving the conversation around the TV appearance that triggered the downfall of his public life.",
      "\"He said he had no recollection of ever meeting me\u2014\u2018None whatsoever.\u2019 Most outlandishly, he said he couldn\u2019t have danced sweatily with me at the Tramp nightclub, as I\u2019d described, because he\u2019d temporarily developed an inability to perspire after enduring \u2018an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War,'\u2014a bizarre reference to his military service nineteen years prior to our meeting,\" she wrote in a copy of the book, obtained by Fox News Digital.",

      "Andrew's interview centered on his friendship with convicted sex-offender Epstein and Giuffre's allegations that he had sex with her when she was underage. The royal agreed to the interview in order to clear his name and explain his relationship with Epstein.",
      "Instead, the interview became infamous due to Andrew\u2019s defensive and tone-deaf answers. After it aired on Nov. 16, 2019, the response was overwhelmingly negative.",
      "The interview was branded a \"car crash\" and a PR disaster, with widespread disbelief at Andrew\u2019s explanations and criticism of his lack of empathy along with other odd moments, including the references to not sweating.",
      "Media, politicians and the public widely viewed it as catastrophic for both his personal reputation and the monarchy\u2019s image. Within days, Buckingham Palace announced that Andrew would step back from public duties \"for the foreseeable future.\" He later lost his military titles and royal patronages, and corporate sponsors and charities cut ties with him and his initiatives.",
      "Meanwhile, Giuffre wrote, \"as devastating as this interview was for Prince Andrew, for my legal team it was like an injection of jet fuel.\"",
      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, detailed her alleged sexual encounters with Andrew in her posthumous memoir.\u00a0 (Steve Parsons/Getty Images)",
      "In 2021, Giuffre filed a sexual abuse lawsuit against Andrew, who has consistently denied her allegations. In her memoir, she recounted his alleged attempts to discredit and intimidate her as well as reinforce his statements that they had never met. Giuffre wrote that the royal's team \"went so far as to try to hire internet trolls to hassle me\" and claimed his protection officers attempted to \"dig up dirt\" on her.",
      "While speaking with Fox News Digital, royal expert Hilary Fordwich weighed in on the fallout from the book.",
      "PRINCE ANDREW'S IMAGE REMAINS A DANGER TO MONARCHY'S IMAGE AMID REPORTS OF BUCKINGHAM PALACE EVICTION: ROYAL EXPERT",
      "\"In addition to all we know, [Andrew] comes across even worse as unrepentant and manipulative. This is ghastly for the royal family,\" she said.",
      "\"The orgy with eight others is revolting,\" Fordwich continued. \"Her quote that he was having sex with her if having sex with me was his birthright is damning and all the cover-up attempts, which demonstrate deliberate actions and contradict his Newsnight interview where he stated he didn\u2019t even know Giuffre. If he didn\u2019t know her, then why was he trying to cover up?\"",
      "On Oct. 19, The Mail on Sunday published leaked emails suggesting Andrew passed Giuffre\u2019s date of birth and her Social Security number to his personal protection officer with instructions to investigate if she had a criminal record in the U.S. \u2014 a step that could be part of a smear-campaign strategy.",
      "The leaked emails were reportedly sent hours before the 2011 release of a now-infamous photo showing Andrew with an underage Giuffre. In a statement, London's Metropolitan Police told the Guardian, \"We are aware of media reporting and are actively looking into the claims made.\"",
      "Sources also told the BBC that the recent claims about Andrew are being treated by Buckingham Palace with \"very great concern and should be examined in the appropriate ways to the fullest extent.\"",
      "Andrew allegedly appears in this photograph with his arm around the waist of then-17-year-old Giuffre. Ghislaine Maxwell is standing to the right. (U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals)",
      "Fordwich noted that, \"Andrew\u2019s team attempting to hire online trolls in order to harass her so as to cast doubt regarding her credibility during her U.S. lawsuit in a smear campaign, which is now being investigated by British police is also horrendous. It indicates such hubris, moral blindness and entitlement.\"",
      "Royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams explained that Giuffre's depiction of Andrew in the memoir and her revival of his 2019 interview could deepen the lasting damage to his reputation and future within the royal family.",
      "\"The portrait she paints of Andrew is of a bovine, entitled and supercilious individual, in some ways never out of the nursery,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"If his Newsnight interview did not exist, no one would have been able to invent it outside a spoof,\" Fitzwilliams continued. \"Yet he was a brave pilot before he succumbed to the lure of disastrous friendships like that of the deceased pedophile Epstein.\"",
      "In August 2019, four months before Andrew's interview, Epstein died in prison while facing federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.",
      "After a U.S. judge rejected Andrew's bid to dismiss Giuffre's civil lawsuit, the two sides reached an out-of-court settlement in February 2022.",
      "Royal commentator Amanda Matta told Fox News Digital that Andrew could potentially face legal consequences over the claims made in Giuffre's book and the newly resurfaced emails.",
      "\"While past civil litigation in the U.S. is concluded, the new memoir revives several potential areas of concern for Andrew,\" she explained. \"Even though he has not (as of yet) been criminally charged, the renewed scrutiny over possible misuse of police resources or attempt to gather personal information on a survivor could trigger regulatory or investigative action.\"",
      "\"If the monarchy faces any renewed questions about oversight, privilege, and accountability, that action might even be greenlit by palace agents,\" Matta added.",
      "Andrew is being investigated by the Metropolitan Police due to newly leaked emails.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Sang Tan, File)",
      "In addition to the emails published by the Mail on Sunday, other leaked correspondence could prove to be a liability for Andrew, according to Fitzwilliams.",
      "On Oct. 12, The Guardian published details of an email dated Feb. 28, 2011 from Andrew to Epstein, which contradicted the royal\u2019s prior claim that he cut contact with the disgraced financier in 2010.",
      "\"I\u2019m just as concerned for you! Don\u2019t worry about me! It would seem we are in this together and will have to rise above it,\" he allegedly wrote in an email sent to Epstein. \"Otherwise keep in close touch and we\u2019ll play some more soon!!!!\"",
      "Both Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson currently reside at Royal Lodge, which is owned by the royal family and located in Windsor Great Park, about three miles south of Windsor Castle in Berkshire, England. (Chris Jackson/Getty Images)",
      "The leaked emails published by the Mail on Sunday emerged days after Andrew announced that he had relinquished his royal titles and honors due to the accusations connecting him with Epstein.",
      "\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" Andrew's statement read. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first.

      "\"No doubt the royals hoped that with Andrew voluntarily removing his titles that would be punishment enough, but more people are baying for blood with politicians seeking a legal resolve of title removals, Metropolitan police investigating the allegations of trying to use his security staff in establishing any scandals attached to Guiffre and the fact living in luxury in the 30 bedroom Royal Lodge at Windsor should still be allowed.\"",
      "Both Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson currently reside at Royal Lodge, which is owned by the royal family and located in Windsor Great Park, about three miles south of Windsor Castle in Berkshire, England.",

      "Fitzwilliams pointed out that the accusations in the memoir will most likely further damage Andrew's already tarnished reputation and result in social exile for the prince and Ferguson.",
      "\"The quotes I have seen compound the insights we have already had into the character of Prince Andrew, who denies all the charges against him and has not been convicted of anything,\" Fitzwilliams said.",

      "In previous analyses looking at data from another survey, Twenge found that the increase in identifying as transgender between 2014 and 2023 did not extend to people over age 45 (Gen X and boomers).",
      "\"That makes it less likely that the changes are due to acceptance, which should impact people of all ages,\" she said. \"However, it's possible that acceptance increased more among young adults between 2014 and 2023 and then decreased more into 2024.\"",

Cuomo was also hit by Mamdani over accusations he has \u2013 while in public office \u2013 failed to meet with Muslim constituents and only began doing so amid pressure from his mayoral campaign, and over his alleged poor handling of the COVID-19 virus in New York after Cuomo was party to issuing guidance forcing nursing homes and long-term care facilities to admit COVID-19 positive patients.",

      "\"You have been a divisive force in New York, and I believe that's toxic energy for New York. It's with the Jewish community.

You took the picture. You said you didn't know who she was. It turns out you did. How do you not renounce your citizenship or demand BDS against Uganda for imprisoning people who are gay just by their sexual orientation? Isn't that a basic violation of human rights?\"",

      "\"You have even gone so far as to legally go after these women. One of those women, Charlotte Bennett, is here in the audience this evening. You sought to access her private gynecological records. She cannot speak up for herself because you lodged a defamation case against her. I, however, can speak. What do you say to the 13 women that you sexually harassed?\"",
      "Cuomo, in 2021, was accused of multiple incidents of sexual harassment that preceded his resignation as governor that year. A subsequent report from New York Attorney General Letitia James confirmed Cuomo \"sexually harassed multiple women from 2013 through 2020,\" while in January 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice announced it had reached a nearly $500,000 settlement with Cuomo's executive office over one of the claims. However, no criminal charges were ever filed against Cuomo, with some district attorneys citing insufficient evidence.",

      "\"Andrew, you didn't \u2018leave.\u2019 You fled from being impeached by the Democrats in the state legislature,\" Sliwa began before getting into the homelessness issue, earning him a round-of-applause from the audience.",

      "\"I have never, not once, spoken in support of global jihad,\" Mamdani said. \"That is not something that I have said and that continues to be ascribed to me.

      "Mamdani applauded Tisch for taking on a \"broken status quo charter to deliver accountability, rooting out corruption and reducing crime across the five boroughs.\" Cuomo and Sliwa also confirmed they would keep her on as commissioner if elected.",
      "The Democratic nominee has faced a slew of criticism on the campaign trial for his past comments, including calling the NYPD \"racist, anti\u2011queer & a major threat to public safety\" in 2020, among other insults. Mamdani made a public apology to the NYPD during a Fox News interview last week.",
      "Ahead of those competitive midterm elections expected next year, Republicans have already seized on Mamdani's progressive politics, including Rep.

      "Republicans hold majorities in both General Assembly chambers, and Democratic Gov. Josh Stein is unable under state law to use his veto stamp on redistricting maps. So the GOP\u2019s proposal can now be implemented unless likely litigation by Democrats or voting rights advocates stops it. Candidate filing for 2026 is scheduled to begin Dec. 1.",
      "Republican lawmakers made the intent of their proposed changes crystal clear \u2014 it\u2019s an attempt to satisfy Trump\u2019s call for GOP-led states to secure more seats for the party nationwide, so that Congress can continue advancing his agenda. Democrats have responded with rival moves in blue states. A president\u2019s party historically loses seats in midterm elections, and Democrats currently need just three more seats to flip House control.",

      "What Ohio's AI marriage ban would do",
      "Under the proposed legislation, AI systems would not be able to own property, manage bank accounts or serve as company executives. They would not have the same rights or responsibilities as people. The bill also makes any marriage between a human and an AI, or between two AI systems, legally impossible.",
      "Ohio lawmakers consider a bill to ban AI from being recognized as a person. (Cyberguy.com)",
      "Claggett believes the concern is not about robot weddings happening anytime soon. Instead, he wants to prevent AI from taking on the legal powers of a spouse, such as holding power of attorney or making financial and medical decisions for someone else.",
      "The bill also specifies that if an AI causes harm, the human owners or developers would be responsible. That means a person cannot blame their chatbot or automated system for mistakes or damage. Responsibility stays with the humans who built, trained or used the system.",
      "Why Ohio is taking action on AI personhood",
      "The timing of the bill is not random. AI is spreading fast across nearly every industry. Systems now write reports, generate artwork and analyze complex data at lightning speed. Ohio has even started requiring schools to create rules for AI use in classrooms. And major data centers are being built to power AI infrastructure in the state.",
      "At the same time, AI is becoming more personal. A survey by Florida-based marketing firm Fractl found that 22 percent of users said they had formed emotional connections with a chatbot. Three percent even considered one a romantic partner. Another 16 percent said they wondered whether the AI they were talking to was sentient.",
      "That kind of emotional attachment raises red flags for lawmakers. If people start believing AI has feelings or intent, it blurs the boundaries between human experience and digital simulation.",
      "Ohio lawmakers consider a bill to ban AI from being recognized as a person. (iStock)",
      "AI COMPANIONS REPLACE REAL FRIENDS FOR MANY TEENS",
      "The bigger picture: Keeping humans in control",
      "Claggett said the bill is about protecting human agency. He believes that as AI grows smarter and more capable, it must never replace the human decision-maker.",
      "Claggett told CyberGuy, \"We see AI as having tremendous potential as a tool, but also tremendous potential to cause harm. We want to prevent that by establishing guardrails and a legal framework before these developments can outpace regulation and bad actors start exploiting legal loopholes. We want the human to be liable for any misconduct, and for there to be no question regarding the legal status of AI, no matter how sophisticated, in Ohio law.\"",
      "The proposed law would also reinforce that AI cannot make choices that affect human lives without oversight.",
      "If passed, it would ensure that no machine can act independently in matters of marriage, property, or corporate leadership. Supporters see the bill as a safeguard for society, arguing that technology should never gain the same legal footing as people.",
      "Critics, however, say the proposal might be a solution to a problem that doesn't yet exist. They warn that overly broad restrictions could slow down AI research and innovation in Ohio.",
      "Still, even skeptics admit that the conversation is necessary. AI is evolving faster than most laws can keep up, and questions about rights, ownership and accountability are becoming harder to ignore.",
      "What other states are doing about AI personhood",
      "Ohio isn't alone in pushing back against AI personhood. In Utah, lawmakers passed H.B. 249, the Utah Legal Personhood Amendments, which prohibits courts and government entities from recognizing legal personhood for nonhuman entities, including AI. The law also bars recognizing personhood for entities such as bodies of water, land and plants.",
      "In Missouri, legislators introduced H.B. 1462, the \"AI Non-Sentience and Responsibility Act,\" which would formally declare AI systems non-sentient and prevent them from acquiring legal status, marriage rights, corporate roles or property ownership.",
      "AI-GENERATED ATTORNEY OUTRAGES JUDGE WHO SCOLDS MAN OVER COURTROOM FAKE: \u2018NOT A REAL PERSON\u2019",
      "In Idaho, H.B. 720 (2022) includes language that reserves legal rights and personhood for human beings, effectively barring personhood claims by nonhumans, including AI.",
      "These measures reflect a broader trend among state governments. Many legislators are trying to get ahead of AI's development by setting clear legal boundaries before the technology becomes more advanced.",
      "Taken together, these proposals show that Ohio's effort is part of a larger national movement to define where technology ends and legal personhood begins.",
      "House Bill 469 aims to keep humans in control as AI becomes more lifelike. (XPENG)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you live in Ohio, House Bill 469 could influence how you use and interact with artificial intelligence. It sets clear boundaries that keep AI as a tool rather than a person. By keeping decision-making and responsibility in human hands, the law aims to avoid confusion about who is accountable when technology fails. If an AI system causes harm or makes an error, the responsibility stays with the humans who designed or deployed it.",
      "For Ohio businesses, this proposal could lead to real changes in daily operations. Companies that depend on AI to handle customer support, financial decisions, or creative projects may need to review how much authority those systems have. It may also require stricter policies to ensure that a human is always supervising important decisions involving money, health, or law. Lawmakers want to keep people firmly in charge of choices that affect others.",
      "For everyday users, the message is straightforward. AI can be useful, but it cannot replace human relationships or legal rights. This bill reinforces that no matter how human-like technology appears, it cannot form genuine emotional or legal bonds with people. Conversations with chatbots might feel personal, but they remain simulations created through data and programming.",
      "DETAILS OF TRUMP'S HIGHLY ANTICIPATED AI PLAN REVEALED BY WHITE HOUSE AHEAD OF MAJOR SPEECH",
      "For people outside Ohio, this proposal could point to what is coming next. Other states are closely watching how the bill develops, and some may adopt similar laws. If it passes, it could set a national example for defining the legal limits of artificial intelligence. What happens in Ohio may shape how courts, businesses and individuals across the country decide to manage their connection to AI in the years ahead.",
      "In the end, this debate is not limited to one state. It raises an important question about how society should balance the power of innovation with the need to protect human control.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Ohio's House Bill 469 is bold, controversial and timely. It challenges us to define the limits of what technology should be allowed to do. Claggett's proposal is not about stopping innovation. It's about ensuring that as machines become more capable, humans remain in charge of the choices that shape society. The debate is far from over. Some see this as a necessary safeguard, while others believe it underestimates what AI can contribute. But one thing is certain: Ohio has thrown a spotlight on one of the biggest questions of our time.",

      "Do rude prompts really get better answers? Short answer: sometimes. A 2025 arXiv study tested 50 questions rewritten in five tones and found that rude prompts slightly outperformed polite ones with ChatGPT-4o. Accuracy rose from 80.8% for very polite to 84.8% for very rude. The sample was small, yet the pattern was clear.",
      "But not so fast, this story has layers. A 2024 study that looked at multiple languages painted a different picture.

      "Rude prompts made ChatGPT more accurate. Polite ones scored lower. Tone changed the outcome. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why tone might change outcomes",
      "Large Language Models (LLMs) tend to mirror the wording they receive. When you sound direct or even a little blunt, you often give clearer instructions. That helps cut down on confusion and pushes the model to deliver sharper, more focused answers. A 2025 paper published on arXiv found that tone alone can shift accuracy by a few points, although more research is needed to confirm those results.",
      "In an earlier study led by researchers from Waseda University and RIKEN AIP, the team compared English, Chinese and Japanese prompts. They discovered that the ideal level of politeness varied by language, showing how cultural norms shape the way AI interprets human requests. In short, what works in one language might not land the same way in another.",
      "Americans split on whether to be polite to AI chatbots",
      "Nearly half of Americans say people should be polite to AI chatbots, according to an April 30, 2025, YouGov survey. Many users do it out of habit or courtesy. Microsoft's design leaders even recommend basic etiquette with Copilot.\u00a0\"Using polite language sets a tone for the response,\" says Kurtis Beavers. Models tend to mirror the professionalism and clarity of your prompt.",
      "A blunt prompt can sharpen results. Direct words help AI focus. Clear beats kind here. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Yes, niceties have a cost",
      "Good manners may be polite, but they are not free. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said people saying\u00a0\"please\" and\u00a0\"thank you\" to ChatGPT costs the company millions of dollars each year. Every extra word adds tokens for the model to process, and those tokens require computing power and electricity.",
      "For a single user, that cost is tiny and hardly noticeable. Yet when millions of users do it all day, those small gestures turn into a major expense. In the end, even kindness comes with a price tag.",
      "CHATGPT MAY ALERT POLICE ON SUICIDAL TEENS",
      "How to prompt for accuracy without being a jerk",

      "Start with the goal.\u00a0Tell the model what you want right away. Include the format and any limits up front so it knows where to focus.Get specific.\u00a0Use numbers instead of vague words. \"Write three bullet points\" works better than \"Write a few ideas.\"Add a check. Ask it to review its own steps or measure its answer against a simple checklist. That keeps things on track.Keep your tone firm but calm. You can be direct without being rude.

      "Researchers tested three languages. Each reacted differently to politeness. Culture shaped every reply. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Rude prompts and ChatGPT accuracy in practice",
      "Here's where things get interesting. If you're writing math problems, multiple-choice questions or coding tasks, a short, no-nonsense tone might actually help. The 2025 study showed that when users dropped the polite fluff and went straight to the point, ChatGPT's accuracy ticked upward.",
      "Still, don't expect miracles. The difference wasn't huge; think a few percentage points, not a full upgrade. Rude or direct prompts can sharpen a model's focus, but they won't suddenly turn an average prompt into a perfect one. The trick is to treat tone as just one lever in your prompt-engineering toolbox. Clarity, structure and context matter more than attitude.",
      "So, how should you use this in real life?",
      "The findings might sound odd, but they offer a clear takeaway for anyone who uses AI tools daily. Here's how to put them into practice.",

Whether you choose a polite tone or a more direct one, what matters is explaining exactly what you need. That is how you get consistent, high-quality answers without resorting to rudeness. So before you send your next question, ask yourself this: Are you being too polite to get results, or just polite enough to be understood?",

      "AI chat apps often feel safe and personal, but they store enormous amounts of sensitive data. When that data leaks, it can lead to blackmail, impersonation, or public embarrassment. Before trusting any AI service, check whether it uses secure encryption, access controls, and transparent privacy terms. If a company makes big promises about security but fails to protect your data, it is not worth the risk.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This leak exposes how unprepared many developers are to protect the private data of people using AI chat apps. The growing AI companion industry needs stronger security standards and more accountability to prevent these privacy disasters. Cybersecurity awareness is the first step. Knowing how your data moves and who controls it can help you stay safe before another leak puts your personal life online.",

One by one, global giants are admitting they've been breached, from tech powerhouses like Google to insurance leaders such as Allianz and Farmers and even luxury brands like Dior. The latest company to report a breach is Discord. The popular chat platform confirmed that hackers gained access to a third-party customer support provider, 5CA, exposing user data including names, email addresses, limited billing details and even government ID images.",

      "Hackers hit Discord\u2019s support vendor, exposing sensitive user data worldwide. (Phil Barker/Future Publishing via Getty Images)",
      "How the breach happened and what data was exposed",
      "The company confirmed that the breach, which occurred on September 20, did not involve a direct attack on Discord's servers. Instead, attackers gained unauthorized access to 5CA, one of Discord's third-party customer service providers. This allowed them to view information from users who had reached out to Discord's Customer Support or Trust & Safety teams.",
      "Discord is a chat app primarily used by gamers, but it has expanded to various other communities, enabling text messages, voice chats and video calls. Some even use it as a replacement for Slack. The platform currently has a monthly user base of over 200 million. The data exposed included Discord usernames, real names, emails, limited billing details such as payment type and the last four digits of credit cards, IP addresses and messages exchanged with customer service agents. In some cases, government ID images provided for age verification were also compromised. Discord estimates that around 70,000 users globally may have had government ID photos exposed.",
      "Reports suggest the attackers attempted to use this access to demand a ransom from Discord. Bleeping Computer reported that the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters (SLH) threat group claimed responsibility for the attack earlier this month. This is the same group that claims to have access to over a billion Salesforce records and is demanding ransom for those as well.",

      "What Discord is doing now and what users should do next",
      "Discord disclosed the incident 13 days later, on October 3. Since then, it has cut off the third-party support provider's access, launched an internal investigation with a digital forensics team and started informing affected users. It also clarified that any communication about the breach will come only from noreply@discord.com and that it will never contact users by phone regarding this incident. The company added that some data remained safe: full credit card numbers, CCV codes, account passwords and activity outside of customer support conversations were not exposed.",
      "Discord also stated that it has notified relevant data-protection authorities about the breach, is working closely with law enforcement and is auditing its third-party vendors to ensure they meet its enhanced security and privacy standards going forward.",
      "A representative at Discord issued a statement, saying in part, \"We want to address inaccurate claims by those responsible that are circulating online. First, as stated in our blog post, this was not a breach of Discord, but rather a third-party service we use to support our customer service efforts. Second, the numbers being shared are incorrect and part of an attempt to extort a payment from Discord. Of the accounts impacted globally, we have identified approximately 70,000 users that may have had government-ID photos exposed, which our vendor used to review age-related appeals. Third, we will not reward those responsible for their illegal actions.\u00a0All affected users globally have been contacted, and we continue to work closely with law enforcement, data protection authorities and external security experts. We've secured the affected systems and ended work with the compromised vendor. We take our responsibility to protect your personal data seriously and understand the concern this may cause.\"",

      "6 steps you can take to stay safe after the Discord breach",
      "If you think your details might have leaked in the Discord data breach, below are some steps you can take to stay protected.",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra verification step when logging in, making it much harder for attackers to access your account even if they have your password. Discord supports 2FA via authenticator apps or SMS. Once enabled, you'll receive a code each time you log in from a new device. This simple step can prevent account takeovers and gives you peace of mind.",
      "The less information available about you, the harder it is for attackers to target you. Review what personal details you've shared online, and remove unnecessary data from websites and apps. A personal data removal service can help scrub your information from data broker sites, making it more difficult for attackers to connect the dots and launch identity theft or phishing attacks.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "Reusing passwords across platforms makes it easy for attackers to access multiple accounts if one password is compromised. A password manager can generate long, complex passwords and store them securely, so you don't have to remember them all. This not only protects your Discord account but also your email, banking and other online services.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords, and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Even if you don't see immediate signs of compromise, attackers can try to exploit stolen data later. Regularly check your email and Discord login history for unusual sign-ins. Services like identity theft protection can scan the dark web for your credentials and alert you immediately if they appear, helping you react quickly before serious damage occurs.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Phishing attacks often spike after breaches. Attackers may send messages that look like official notifications asking you to reset your password or provide personal information. Always verify the sender, avoid clicking unknown links, and never share sensitive info. Treat every unexpected message as suspicious, even if it appears to come from Discord or another trusted service.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If the recent breaches are any indication, third-party services that companies rely on are often the weakest link in cybersecurity. Discord's steps to contain the situation are necessary, but they highlight a bigger problem. Many companies do not implement sufficient safeguards to protect sensitive user data. Weak oversight of third-party providers, delayed responses and inadequate security policies leave personal information exposed and vulnerable to attackers.",

A new survey from the Center for Democracy and Technology found that nearly one in five high school students in the United States say they or someone they know has used AI to have a romantic relationship.

Even more alarming, two-thirds of parents said they have no idea how their kids are using AI. Experts warn that while AI can simulate empathy, it has no real understanding or care. According to researchers, students need to remember that they are not actually talking to a person. They are interacting with a programmed tool that has clear limitations and cannot truly understand human emotions.",
      "AI in schools: Help or harm?",
      "AI tools are everywhere in schools. About 85% of teachers and students said they used AI during the last school year. While schools introduce AI to boost learning, this exposure may have a downside. Students who use AI more often in class are also more likely to turn to it for emotional or personal reasons.

      "Gmail data leaked in a zero-click attack requiring no user action.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the ShadowLeak attack worked",
      "Attackers embedded hidden instructions into an email using white-on-white text, tiny fonts or CSS layout tricks. The email looked completely harmless. But when a user later asked ChatGPT's Deep Research agent to analyze a Gmail inbox, the AI unknowingly executed the attacker's commands.",
      "The agent then used its built-in browser tools to exfiltrate sensitive data to an external server, all within OpenAI's own cloud environment, beyond the reach of antivirus or enterprise firewalls.",
      "Unlike previous prompt-injection attacks that ran on the user's device, ShadowLeak unfolded entirely in the cloud, making it invisible to local defenses.",

      "Hidden prompts expose how hackers silently hijacked ChatGPT\u2019s AI agent. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why this threat matters",
      "The Deep Research agent was designed to perform multistep research and summarize online data, but its wide access to third-party apps like Gmail, Google Drive and Dropbox also opened the door to abuse.",
      "Radware researchers said the attack involved encoding personal data in Base64 and appending it to a malicious URL, disguised as a \"security measure.\" Once sent, the agent believed it was acting normally.",
      "The real danger lies in the fact that any connector could be exploited the same way if attackers manage to hide prompts in analyzed content.",
      "What security experts say",
      "\"The user never sees the prompt. The email looks normal, but the agent follows the hidden commands without question,\"\u00a0the researchers explained.",
      "In a separate experiment, security firm SPLX showed another weakness: ChatGPT agents could be tricked into solving CAPTCHAs by inheriting a manipulated conversation history. Researcher Dorian Schultz noted that the model even mimicked human cursor movements, bypassing tests meant to block bots.",

      "Every connection is a potential entry point. Disable any integrations you're not actively using, such as Gmail, Google Drive or Dropbox. Fewer linked apps mean fewer ways for hidden prompts or malicious scripts to access your information.",

      "Stay alert for updates from OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and other platforms. Security patches close newly discovered vulnerabilities before hackers can exploit them. Turn on automatic updates so you're always protected without having to think about it.",
      "A strong antivirus program adds another wall of defense. These tools detect phishing links, hidden scripts and AI-driven exploits before they cause harm. Schedule regular scans and keep your protection up to date.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Microsoft is sounding the alarm, and this time, the warning hits home for everyday users. Hackers are now turning Microsoft Teams security threats into real-world dangers that go far beyond corporate networks. Using Teams, cybercriminals gather intel, pose as trusted contacts, trick people into sharing private data and even spread malware that can steal passwords or lock up personal files.",
      "What was once a simple video chat and collaboration tool has become a high-value target for cybercriminals and even state-backed hackers. Whether you use Teams for work, school or staying in touch, the risks are real and growing.\u00a0We'll break down how attackers abuse Teams, what Microsoft recommends and the simple steps you can take to protect yourself at home or on the job.",

      "How hackers use Teams to attack",
      "Hackers exploit Microsoft Teams at every stage of an attack, using it to spy, impersonate, spread malware and even control compromised systems, and consumers are now in their sights, too.",
      "SCAMMERS NOW IMPERSONATE COWORKERS, STEAL EMAIL THREADS IN CONVINCING PHISHING ATTACKS",
      "Hackers are finding new ways to weaponize Microsoft Teams, turning everyday chats into dangerous entry points. (David Becker/Getty Images)",
      "Attackers start by probing Teams environments to find weak spots. They look for users with open settings, public profiles or external meeting links. Microsoft warns that \"anonymous participants, guests and external access users\" can give hackers a way in. If your Privacy Mode is off, they can see when you're online, send unwanted chats, or try to join meetings outside your group, even if you're just using a free account.",
      "Hackers often pretend to be someone you trust, like an IT admin, a coworker or even a Microsoft representative. They create fake profiles and logos that look convincing to trick you into clicking a link or sharing credentials. Microsoft says attackers \"take advantage of the same resources as legitimate organizations\" to pull off their scams.",
      "Once they've earned your trust, hackers send a chat or call that includes a malicious link or file. You might get a message saying,\u00a0\"Your Teams account needs verification\" or \"Update required for better security.\" It's all bait. These links can install spyware, steal logins or deliver ransomware that locks up your data, whether you're on a company laptop or your personal PC at home.",
      "MICROSOFT SHAREPOINT BUG PUTS CRITICAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AT RISK",
      "After breaking in, attackers try to stay hidden. They might add guest accounts, install shortcuts or change permissions so they can come back later. In some cases, they use the same Microsoft tools meant for admins to move across Teams, OneDrive or even your personal files stored in the cloud.",
      "Once inside, hackers can send commands through Teams messages or hide malware in shared links. They've even been known to send ransom demands directly through Teams chat. Microsoft says one group, Octo Tempest, used Teams to taunt victims and pressure them into paying up, showing how personal these attacks can get.",
      "Tips to stay protected",
      "You don't need to be a cybersecurity expert to stay safe on Microsoft Teams. A few smart tools and habits can go a long way in keeping hackers, scammers and snoops from taking advantage of your information.",
      "Keep your online presence private. Turn on Privacy Mode in Teams to stop strangers from seeing when you're active or trying to join meetings. It's a simple setting that makes it harder for hackers to target you or your company.",
      "If you share your Teams account with coworkers or family members, don't give everyone full control. Keep admin access limited to one trusted person. This reduces the chance of someone accidentally approving a scam link or letting malware spread.",
      "Hackers often rely on personal details found online to make their scams more convincing, things like your job title, workplace or even who you've video-chatted with. That information helps them build fake Teams profiles or send messages that look legitimate. Using a personal data removal service helps wipe your private details from data broker sites, cutting off one of the main sources hackers use to impersonate you. The less they can learn about you, the harder it is for them to trick you into trusting a fake message or clicking a malicious link.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Hackers love to send fake messages pretending to be support or IT help. Never open links or attachments from people you don't recognize, even if the message looks official. Use strong antivirus software to automatically scan downloads and attachments before you open them.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Only allow trusted guests into your Teams chats and meetings. If you invited someone for a one-time project, remove them afterward. Tight control over who can join helps prevent impersonators from slipping in unnoticed.",
      "Activate Teams alerts to catch anything unusual, like sign-ins from new devices or unexpected permission changes. Pair that with your antivirus program's real-time protection to get notified if malicious activity starts on your device.",
      "Zero Trust means verifying every user, every time. Don't assume messages or calls are legitimate, especially if someone asks for a password or authentication code. If you're unsure, contact your company's IT team or verify the person's identity through a separate channel.",
      "GOOGLE CONFIRMS DATA STOLEN IN BREACH BY KNOWN HACKER GROUP",
      "Hackers rely on panic and urgency to make you click. If you get a message claiming your account will be locked or that support needs your password, pause. Report suspicious messages to Microsoft or your security provider. Regular phishing awareness training helps you spot scams faster.",
      "Always install the latest Teams and operating system updates. Patches fix security holes that hackers exploit to sneak in.",
      "Cybercriminals often impersonate IT support or trusted colleagues to trick users into sharing credentials. (CyberGuy.com)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Microsoft's warning about Teams is a reminder that hackers are always searching for new ways to reach you, even through apps you use every day. What makes these attacks so dangerous is their familiarity. Messages look normal, video calls seem real, and fake tech support chats can sound convincing. That's why awareness, not fear, is your strongest defense. With privacy settings enabled, antivirus protection running, and a reliable personal data removal service scrubbing your info from the web, you're already several steps ahead of scammers. Staying alert to phishing attempts and keeping your software up to date can turn Teams back into what it's meant to be: a safe, helpful way to stay connected.",

      "Dugan concluded, \"After billions of dollars,\u00a0Palestinians continue in desperate\u00a0dependence for humanitarian aid of the most basic kind.

      "As Britain marked the 100th anniversary of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s birth last week,\u00a0Japan made history of its own on Tuesday by electing its first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, a self-declared admirer of the \"Iron Lady.\"",
      "Takaichi, 64, who has long cited Thatcher as a personal and political inspiration, was chosen by Japan\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), during an extraordinary session of the country's lower house, replacing former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and ending several months of political turbulence that saw the party lose its upper-house majority in July.",
      "In remarks after her election, Takaichi said she felt \"the tough work starts here\" and promised to restore public confidence and strengthen Japan\u2019s security posture. Over the years, she has praised Thatcher\u2019s \"strength and womanly warmth\" as qualities she seeks to emulate. In 2013, shortly before Thatcher\u2019s death, Takaichi met her in London \u2014 a moment she later described as \"life-changing.\"",

      "Economically, she praises Abenomics, the policies adopted by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and favors fiscal and monetary stimulus. Abe was Japan\u2019s longest-serving prime minister and was assassinated in 2022 at a campaign rally, two years after leaving office.",
      "\"She\u2019s very different from the other people in the Liberal Democratic Party, and that\u2019s why she was selected this time,\" said Gordon Chang, author and Asia analyst, in an interview with\u00a0Fox News Digital. \"After losing its upper-house majority, the LDP realized it needed to protect its right flank by electing someone more conservative than in the past \u2014 so the Margaret Thatcher comparison does make sense.\"",
      "Known for her hawkish stance\u00a0on China, Takaichi is expected to maintain Japan\u2019s close alignment with the United States. Chang said her election could bolster Washington\u2019s strategic position in Asia, especially as tensions with Beijing remain high.",

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/artificial-intelligence-mammogram-scan-breast-cancer-results-reading-rcna237293",
    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 18:08:28 GMT",
    "summary": "When reading women\u2019s routine mammograms, radiologists are increasingly augmenting what they're observing with artificial intelligence to better interpret the scan.",
    "story": [
      "When a radiologist reviewed Deirdre Hall\u2019s mammogram images last summer, everything seemed fine. There were no shadows or lumps or irregular patches that could signal cancer.",
      "The doctor gave it a second look for one reason: artificial intelligence software had drawn a circle around an area in the upper part of her left breast that it found suspicious.",
      "Because the AI software had put up that red flag, Hall, 55, got an order for an ultrasound that led to a biopsy. There were four cancerous tumors in the spot AI had identified.",
      "\u201cThis would have been completely missed without the AI,\u201d said Dr. Sean Raj, chief medical officer and chief innovation officer at SimonMed Imaging in Tempe, Arizona, where Hall had her mammogram.",
      "Not only was Hall\u2019s breast tissue dense, but the layers of tissue crisscrossed over each other in a particularly complicated pattern.",
      "\u201cIt camouflaged the cancer,\u201d said Raj, a breast imaging specialist. \u201cEven I could have missed it.\u201d",
      "They caught her cancer at Stage 1, said Hall, who\u2019s a respiratory therapist at a local hospital.",
      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t find anything in the lymph nodes, which they were grateful for,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so glad they caught it early.\u201d",
      "When reading women\u2019s routine mammograms, radiologists are increasingly augmenting their eyes with artificial intelligence. While many major medical centers have adopted the technology enthusiastically, some experts point to concerns, including a lack of studies in the U.S. showing that AI actually saves lives and does not needlessly raise concerns about benign growths.",
      "Experts train AI software by feeding it hundreds of thousands, or sometimes millions of mammogram images. Some of the images contain cancerous tumors, and, over time, the AI learns to distinguish the often subtle differences between malignant and benign tissue. Some AI programs, like the one used on Hall, identify a suspicious area. Others predict the chance that a woman will develop breast cancer.",
      "At the University of California, San Francisco, researchers are using AI to try to speed up the time from a mammogram to cancer diagnosis. In a study released this week, the radiologists used the technology to flag suspicious-looking mammograms so those patients could be seen more quickly. For patients with breast cancer, that AI triage cut the average time from mammogram to biopsy by 87%, from 73 days to nine days. The study was posted Tuesday to the preprint server MedRxiv. (Studies posted to preprint servers have not been peer-reviewed.)",
      "However, Dr. Sonja Hughes, vice president of community health at Susan G. Komen, a breast cancer organization, said more research is needed before AI is used as the standard of care.  \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough research or enough data.\u201d",
      "Dense breasts: Finding a snowball in a blizzard",
      "Mammograms have saved countless lives, but they\u2019re imperfect. Dense breast tissue, which is a risk factor for developing cancer, makes mammograms harder to interpret. About 40% of U.S. women have dense breasts, according to the American Cancer Society.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like trying to find a snowball in a blizzard,\u201d said Dr. Otis Brawley, a professor of oncology and epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration has authorized many AI programs for mammograms, with varying rates of accuracy. The AI software used on Hall\u2019s mammogram, called Lunit, accurately identified cancers 88.6% of the time, according to a 2024 JAMA Oncology study of more than 8,800 women in Sweden who got mammograms. Another study published in Radiology noted that AI software caught cancers that were missed by two radiologists.",
      "However, in the Sweden study, AI gave a false positive 7% of the time, saying there might be a tumor when there wasn\u2019t one. A false positive can trigger more testing and anxiety while waiting for results. With any mammogram, the chance of having a false positive result is about 10%, according to research.",
      "A doctor interprets the screening's results",
      "Major academic medical centers using AI in their imaging centers include the MD Anderson Cancer Center, the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, the Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, the Siteman Cancer Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital, and MedStar Health.",
      "In all centers, the software is used along with, not instead of, a radiologist\u2019s eyes, as FDA regulations require a doctor to interpret mammograms. Some breast imaging experts see advantages to this human-machine combination.",
      "\u201cThe nice thing about AI is that it doesn\u2019t get tired,\u201d said Dr. Lisa Abramson, associate professor of radiology at Mount Sinai. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to replace the job or the expertise of radiologists, but I think it\u2019s only going to enhance our ability to detect more and more breast cancers.\u201d",
      "Brawley, the Johns Hopkins professor, said AI could help women who don\u2019t have access to radiologists who specialize in breast imaging, and instead have their mammograms read by general radiologists.",
      "A study using RadNet\u2019s software found that without AI, specialists correctly identified breast cancers 89% of the time, compared with 84% for generalists. With AI, the accuracy for both groups rose to about 93%.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly subjective when a human reads a mammogram,\u201d Brawley said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s going to reduce the disparities in how these things are read.\u201d",
      "Does AI cost more?",
      "Typically, academic medical centers don\u2019t charge patients extra for the use of AI software, and they can\u2019t charge insurance companies for it, since there\u2019s no billing code specifically for the AI, according to Susan G. Komen, a nonprofit breast cancer organization.",
      "SimonMed, which has centers in 11 states, and RadNet, which has centers in eight states, don\u2019t charge for an initial layer of AI on mammograms, although patients are charged $40 and $50 respectively if they opt to have their images run through a second set of the technology.",
      "Drawbacks of AI",
      "Brawley worries that AI might be too good at its job.",
      "According to the American Cancer Society, it\u2019s possible that mammograms flag some tumors that are technically cancerous, but not life-threatening. The patient then undergoes the physical, emotional, and financial toll of treating a tumor that was never going to hurt her.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019scancer, but it\u2019s not genetically programmed to grow, spread, or kill,\u201d Brawley said. \u201cI am worried that AI may help us find even more of these tumors that don\u2019t need to be found.\u201d",
      "Brawley pointed to the lack of data in the U.S. that shows AI actually saves women\u2019s lives.",
      "Last month, researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles and University of California, Davis, announced a $16 million, two-year study at seven medical centers to take a deeper look at the technology.",
      "There are several other concerns about using AI in mammography. The technology isn\u2019t perfect, and some worry that doctors could make mistakes if they become too dependent on it, according to an article last year in RadioGraphics.",
      "That\u2019s why radiologists emphasize that AI is a tool, not a solution in itself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to replace the job or the expertise of radiologists,\u201d said Abramson, the breast radiologist at Mount Sinai. \u201cI think it\u2019s only going to enhance our ability to detect more and more breast cancer.\u201d",
      "Another concern is that if AI is trained mainly on breast images of white women, it could be less accurate for women of color, since genetic differences can make tumors look different.",
      "Hall, the Arizona patient, said she\u2019s not necessarily a fan of AI in general \u2014 she says she finds the technology \u201ccreepy\u201d \u2014 but she\u2019s glad she paid $50 for the extra AI on her mammogram.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t love all this AI stuff, but I definitely love this for me or anyone else in my position,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter how it was found, I\u2019m glad it was found.\u201d",
      "Guidance for mammograms",
      "Guidance from the United Services Preventive Services Task Force recommends women to get a mammogram every other year starting at age 40.",
      "According to American Cancer Society guidelines:",
      "Women 45 to 54 should get mammograms every year.Women 55 and older can switch to a mammogram every other year, or they can choose to continue yearly mammograms.",

      "Dr. Shanthi Sivendran, senior vice president at the American Cancer Society, offers guidance for more accurate breast cancer screening.",
      "Try to go to the same place every year so radiologists can compare your images over time.Ask if a center uses radiologists who\u2019ve completed a fellowship in breast imaging. In some rural or underserved areas, it may be harder to find these specialists, and so women should seek out radiologists who primarily read breast images. Try to find a center that can either provide or direct you to follow-up care, such as additional imaging, in case your mammogram finds something suspicious. According to FDA regulations, your mammogram report should state if you have dense breasts. If you do, ask your doctor about whether you might need additional imaging tests.",

    "story": [
      "Fans of Netflix\u2019s hit rom-com series \u201cNobody Wants This\u201d swooned when Adam Brody lovingly cupped Kristen Bell\u2019s face in his hands the first time their characters locked lips.",
      "But if Erin Foster, the show\u2019s creator and showrunner, initially had her way, Brody\u2019s character, Noah Roklov aka \u201cHot Rabbi,\u201d would have been portrayed by comedian Nick Kroll.",
      "Foster opened up to The Hollywood Reporter about how \u201cevery Jewish man in Hollywood\u201d auditioned for the part of witty Rabbi Noah, who strikes up an unlikely romance with Bell's equally quippy sex podcast host character, Joanne, a confirmed agnostic.",
      "Foster recalled approaching Kroll about the part. But Kroll turned it down. That felt like a setback to Foster, who based the show on her own real-life love story with her husband, music executive Simon Tikhman.",
      "\u201cThere was just something validating to me about a comedian (like Kroll) as the lead that felt like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m making a real comedy,\u2019\u201d Foster told THR. \u201cIt was a lot of my own insecurities as a writer.\u201d",
      "In a May chat with Bell\u2019s husband Dax Shepard on the \u201cArmchair Expert\u201d podcast, Kroll said he didn\u2019t take the role because, \u201cLiterally, it was dead in the middle of when we were having our baby. And so I just think, there were a lot of elements that went into it.\u201d",
      "\u201cHave I regretted it? Watching Adam absolutely just (star in) one of the biggest shows on Netflix? And people fall in love with him all over again? Yeah,\u201d Kroll joked.",
      "Meanwhile, Bell urged Foster to consider her longtime pal Brody for the rabbi role, even going so far as to put together a reel highlighting her and Brody\u2019s chemistry in the Showtime series \u201cHouse of Lies\u201d and the 2013 movie \u201cSome Girls.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Guys, you\u2019re going to need an ice pack while you watch these scenes,\u201d Bell joked to THR. \u201cI just kept saying, like, \u2018Trust me, Adam knows how to stare dopily at someone and so do I, and that\u2019s kind of all you need.\u2019 I mean, I\u2019d love to tell you it\u2019s real. It\u2019s not. We both just know how to do it.\u201d",
      "Foster liked what she saw. She sent Brody a script. The two then hopped on a Zoom to discuss the possibilities. Though Foster wasn\u2019t then able to answer some of Brody\u2019s pressing questions about the direction of the show, Brody liked her.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Well, f--- it,\u2019\u201d said Brody. \u201c\u2018I really like her, I like this episode, and I love Kristen and it\u2019s Netflix and there are a lot of reasons to just roll the dice.\u2019\"",
      "The cast filmed the first two episodes of Season 1 and then took a break so Foster and her team could study the footage. Brody and Bell were also able to peek at those early scenes.",
      "Brody told THR he was \u201cblown away\u201d by the \u201cmagic\u201d he and Bell created onscreen.",
      "\u201cThere was an energy to it, a sort of sexiness that I wasn\u2019t sure about as we were making it,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWith some of the banter, as I was doing it, I\u2019d be like, \u2018Is this going to make me want to gag or is this charming?\u201d",
      "Turns out, viewers wanted \u201cNobody Wants This.\u201d The show debuted on Sept. 28, 2024 and landed on the streaming service\u2019s Top 10 list in 89 countries around the world, according to THR.",
      "As for the series\u2019 second season, which debuts Oct. 23, viewers can expect more zingy dialogue and steamy kisses from Bell and Brody and possibly a few other characters.",
      "\u201cErin said, \u2018We\u2019re going to give the people what they want,\u2019 and I thought that was very cool,\u201d said Bell. \u201cShe was like, \u2018You don\u2019t want it to turn into, like, a murder mystery \u2014 you just want the bubblegum flavor to last forever, and we\u2019re going to do our best to do that.\u2019\u201d"

    "summary": "What are the best heist movies to watch after the Louvre heist? Here's a list of the best art heist movies and why they appeal.",
    "story": [
      "A seven-minute heist in broad daylight from the most-visited museum in the world is like something straight out of a movie.",
      "For French authorities and officials at the Louvre, the daring robbery by four suspects on Oct. 19 is all too real as they work to try recover eight pieces from France's crown jewels that they say were taken.",
      "The cinematic nature of the heist, which authorities said involved using a truck with a basket lift, cutting tools and a pair of scooters, gave it some of the elements of a classic heist movie.",
      "\"Heist movies where you root the most for the team are when it's against a faceless institution,\" Paul Caiola, co-host of the movie podcast That Aged Well, tells TODAY.com. \"We all know what the Louvre is, and we can romanticize this team thanks to movies and pop culture. We go to a different place because the victim is not a human. I'm sure security guards didn\u2019t have great time afterward, but that\u2019s not who we think about when we think about the heist.\"",
      "The real-life drama brings to mind several films and shows that depict classic works of art or priceless jewels being snatched by a cunning crew.",
      "The best heist films and shows also usually have certain ingredients in common.",
      "\"You have some Robin Hood-type lead played by a movie star like George Clooney, Sandra Bullock or Robert Redford \u2014 someone the audience always loves,\" Caiola says. \"Then you put them against a bad guy the audience wants to root against, or a faceless institution.\"",
      "The feeling of the common man or woman taking from a powerful institution or person is also alluring.",
      "\"The bills, the jewels, the gems, the artworks: they are stowed away behind gates, doors, walls; shielded by locks, safes, impenetrable glass; protected by lasers, surveillance cameras, and motion detectors. Since ordinary people are always denied access to them, this exclusion allegorizes a key experience of modernity: being distanced from the centers of wealth and power,\" Julian Hanich of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands wrote in \"On Pros and Cons and Bills and Gates: The Heist Film as Pleasure\" in 2017.",
      "Once the two sides are established, next up is the crew.",
      "\"We all love found family, and watching people with a particular set of skills joining up to pull off a heist is thrilling,\" Caiola says. \"Then you ultimately get to watch how they do it. How are they going to get Tom Cruise past that pressure-sensitive floor in 'Mission Impossible'? What movie magic is going to get Catherine Zeta-Jones past that laser net in 'Entrapment'? \"",
      "It can't just be some smash-and-grab, either.",
      "\"It has to be complex, with plans within plans, which takes us away from ourselves and gives us that sense of escape,\" Caiola says. \"Then when it's over, what's the fallout? Do they get away with it?\"",
      "While there are a host of classic heist films like \"Ocean's Eleven\" and \"The Town\" where the crew is going after cash, these are focused on stealing precious artworks or valuable jewels.",
      "They also are a little more artsy and refined than a wild Indiana Jones adventure in search of the Holy Grail or the Ark of the Covenant.",
      "There also is a new film that was released on Oct. 17 called \"The Mastermind\" with \"Challengers\" star Josh O'Connor that may quickly join the pantheon. It's inspired by a 1972 robbery of four paintings from an art museum in Massachusetts.",
      "'The Thomas Crown Affair'",
      "The 1999 film stars Pierce Brosnan as a suave billionaire who swipes a Monet painting from New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art and lends another painting to the museum to take its place. It shows him as a classic art thief in that he appreciates the artwork more than he's completely motivated by money.",
      "He's pursued by an insurance investigator played by Rene Russo, who falls in love with him before she believes she is betrayed by him.",
      "'Entrapment '",
      "It turns out 1999 was a big year for art heist films with big movie stars, as this one features Catherine Zeta-Jones and Sean Connery.",
      "Just like Russo in \"The Thomas Crown Affair,\" Zeta-Jones portrays an insurance investigator on the hunt for Connery's art thief, although her job turns out to be a cover for her own identity as a thief.",
      "The classic shot from this movie is Catherine Zeta-Jones in a skintight outfit deftly moving through a field of laser beams while wearing a blindfold. She is training at a Scottish castle with Connery for the exact moves she will have to execute for a later heist.",
      "Connery is later revealed to have been an informant for the FBI helping to entrap Zeta-Jones' character, whom he then helps escape before they are reunited.",
      "'Lupin'",
      "The 2021 Netflix hit stars Omar Sy as the title character of Assane Diop, a master of disguise and illusion who was inspired by a fictional early 1900s character named Arsene Lupin.",
      "In his quest to seek revenge in memory of his late father, he steals an expensive diamond necklace from the family that wrongly accused his father of once pilfering it. The theft touches off a series of events that eventually lead to the son of Sy's character being kidnapped at the end of the first season.",
      "An episode in Season 2 involves pretending to steal a priceless Pissaro painting, and the show features numerous escapes, disguises and subterfuge.",
      "'Ocean\u2019s Twelve'",
      "This is the series that more than fulfills Caiola's \"get a big-name movie star to portray the thief\" rule for a good heist film, and then some.",
      "\"Ocean's Twelve\" is the first sequel to the classic \"Ocean's Eleven\" in which a gang of thieves led by George Clooney and Brad Pitt rob a Las Vegas casino owned by Terry Benedict, a villainous character played by Andy Garcia.",
      "\"Ocean's Twelve\" reunites the gang, which also includes Julia Roberts and Matt Damon, after Benedict tracks them down and demands they return the stolen money. He gives them two weeks to come up with it. This time there is more of a precious artifact twist compared to the cash heist in the original film.",
      "Their target becomes the Imperial Coronation Faberg\u00e9 egg, which they plan to take during an exhibition in Rome. A couple of double crosses result in the crew getting their money to pay back Benedict in the end.",
      "'The Score'",
      "Following on the heels of \"Entrapment\" and \"The Thomas Crown Affair,\" this Robert DeNiro vehicle from 2001 stars the legendary actor as an ace safe-cracker.",
      "This one might hit a little close to home for the people of France after the Louvre theft because it's about stealing an item considered in the movie to be a French national treasure.",
      "DeNiro and a crew that also includes Edward Norton aim to steal a royal scepter from the Montreal Customs House in Canada and its impenetrable safe. This fits the goal of complexity for a good heist film because it involves an elaborate scheme that features disguises, explosives and sneaking through sewer tunnels.",
      "'Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery'",
      "The sequel to the \"Knives Out\" whodunit, this 2022 movie returns Daniel Craig's master detective Benoit Blanc to unravel a mystery.",
      "A tech billionaire played by Edward Norton hosts a murder mystery at his private island on Greece in which he displays the iconic \"Mona Lisa,\" which he claims to have on loan from the Louvre.",
      "The movie has secret twins, a mysterious alternative fuel, power outages, and of course, murders. It does not end well for the \"Mona Lisa.\"",
      "'The Great Muppet Caper'",
      "If you're looking for a heist with a lighter side, what better cast could you have than the Muppets?",
      "The 1981 film is still a family favorites. It features Kermit, Fozzie and Gonzo on the hunt for a jewel thief with the help of Miss Piggy. Do the Muppets capture the villains and save the day? You already know.",
      "\"The Great Muppet Caper is a classic heist,\" Caiola says. \"And Muppets, they make everything better.\""

    "story": [
      "A new trend is taking over TikTok, with social media users hoping to land a coveted spot in the exclusive \u201cgroup 7.\u201d",
      "If you have been scrolling on the video platform , chances are, you have seen TikTok users posting videos and leaving comments about being in \u201cgroup 7\u201d without providing more context about the secret club. So who started the mysterious group and how can you score an invite?",
      "Who Started the Viral 'Group 7' TikTok Trend?",
      "The origins of group 7 can be traced back to 26-year-old singer Sophia James after the artist posted a series of videos on TikTok last week. In her first clip, she shared that she had recently received a parking ticket while dancing and singing along to her new song \u201cSo Unfair.\u201d James, who was a Season 18 \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d contestant, then continued to upload more clips with a goal: to get as many TikTok users as possible to see her posts and hear her song by flooding their feeds.",
      "By the fourth video, she started labeling the clips and the fans who came across them in groups.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re seeing this you are in group 4,\u201d the text over her fourth video read. \u201cI am posting a bunch of videos and seeing which ones reach the most viewers. This is the fourth post of the batch so you are group 4.\u201d",
      "As the night went on, more videos arrived. The seventh and final video in her algorithm experiment went viral.",
      "\u201cIf you are watching this video, you are in group 7,\u201d James explained. \u201cI have posted seven videos tonight and this is the seventh one. Just a little science experiment to see what kind of video gets the most reach.\u201d",
      "She playfully added, \u201cI don\u2019t know what that says about you, but you\u2019re in group 7!\u201d",
      "How Are People Responding?",
      "Her post has over 25 million views as of Oct. 21, with TikTok users celebrating and joking about being in the special group.",
      "\u201cI (hereby) declare group 7 is the most elite group,\u201d one wrote in a comment.",
      "Another wrote, \u201cGroup 7 is the hot girl group I don\u2019t make the rules.\u201d",
      "A third said, \u201cI have immediate beef with groups 1-6.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t just James\u2019 comment section that was filled with references to group 7. TikTok users started mentioning being members of group 7, and others \u2014 like Barbara Corcoran, Naomi Osaka and the official account for the Kansas City Chiefs \u2014 got in on the inside joke, too.",
      "One TikTok user also used a post to explain how the joke went viral. In her video, the TikTok user complimented James for succeeding in getting millions of people to listen to and promote her new single.",
      "\u201cIt is incredible. I haven\u2019t seen anything like this in awhile. It\u2019s also immaculate marketing,\u201d the TikTok user said.",
      "She then pointed out that \u201cSo Unfair\u201d has taken off on the TikTok, with some asking for it to be group 7\u2019s \u201canthem.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone is using her song, and it is the best marketing technique I have ever seen a musician do,\u201d she praised. \u201cI think we all should really know the name Sophia James.\u201d",
      "How Did Sophia James React to Going Viral?",
      "James spoke to The New York Times about how she came up with the clever idea. The musician said in an Oct. 21 interview she noticed she had to \u201cbully\u201d the TikTok algorithm to be successful on the platform.",
      "\u201cYou just have to post no matter what it is \u2014 it\u2019s really quantity over quality,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd so in my pursuit to get my music heard, I\u2019ve really been trying all of these different strategies.\u201d",
      "She revealed that she almost didn\u2019t post the group 7 video before changing her mind.",
      "\u201cI woke up the next morning and you know, like Alakazam, the group 7 video had hit the algorithm, and people just made it explode, and it became this hilarious, unexpected internet moment,\u201d James said.",
      "Since group 7 went viral, the singer has added more than 100,000 TikTok followers, according to The New York Times.",
      "What is she doing with her newfound internet stardom? She is bringing group 7 members together in real life. James posted details about a meetup in London on Friday, Oct. 24 on her website.",

He wrote in the book, \u201cYes, I also liked guys, but that was not a conflict with my love for Diane.\u201d",

      "\u201cSupporting him? What do you mean, supporting him?\u201d she replied in the interview published Oct. 16. \u201cPeople see it that way. For me, it\u2019s not that way. I don\u2019t know. Yes, I encouraged him to do that book, and yes, I encouraged him to do the Audible.\u201d",
      "She continued, \u201cBut for me, the book is not about that. It\u2019s about his life. And of course, with me, he opened immediately. For 50 years, I was the only person he opened to. Then he wrote the book.\u201d",
      "Von Furstenberg then seemed baffled after she was asked about being married to a gay man.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference? I don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said.",
      "She further explained, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change anything. I\u2019m sorry \u2014 it\u2019s a stupid question. I married two gay men, OK? I don\u2019t know why, but to me, they\u2019re not gay, so it doesn\u2019t make any difference.\u201d",
      "Before she tied the knot with Diller, von Furstenberg was previously married to Prince Egon von F\u00fcrstenberg, who died in 2004. The two officially divorced in 1983 after marrying in 1969.",
      "When asked about the start of her relationship with Diller, the Belgian fashion icon said their romance was unexpected. \u201cHe turned out to be my soulmate. I didn\u2019t think of it at first. He was a man about town,\u201d she recalled. Von Furstenberg said the two met at a party she threw for the late talent manager Sue Mengers.",

      "She said he called her the following day and the two had dinner. He later invited her to meet him in Los Angeles and picked her up in a limousine.",
      "Diller also reflected on their relationship in an excerpt from his book published by New York Magazine on May 6. He echoed the sentiment that his wife was initially dismissive of him before they met at the dinner party. \u201cI was instantly bathed in such attention and cozy warmth I couldn\u2019t believe it was the same woman I\u2019d been dismissed by a year earlier,\u201d he said.",
      "Diller added that they later had dinner at her apartment and \u201cafterward, on the same sofa as the night before, we wound around each other, making out like teenagers, something I hadn\u2019t done with a female since I was 16 years old.\u201d",
      "He recalled feeling pure excitement and was confused about what it meant.",
      "They went on to date for a few years before splitting in 1981. They reconciled after von Furstenberg had an affair with Richard Gere, Diller revealed in the memoir.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve lived for decades reading about Diane and me: about us being best friends rather than lovers,\u201d Diller said in his book. \u201cWe weren\u2019t just friends. We aren\u2019t just friends. Plain and simple, it was an explosion of passion that kept up for years. And, yes, I also liked guys, but that was not a conflict with my love for Diane.\u201d",
      "A couple weeks after the excerpt was released, Diller shared more details about the book during a CNBC interview that aired on TODAY on May 20.",
      "He rejected the notion that he had been in the closet for decades.",
      "\u201cAll this closet stuff, I mean, if I have been in a closet, it has been the most brightly lit closet with a glass door that you have ever seen,\u201d Diller said at the time. \u201cI understand, kind of, the catnip of media \u2014 but all this stuff about my sexuality at my frigging age just seems to me, well, it\u2019s kind of obvious and over the top.\u201d"

      "Vice President JD Vance stressed Wednesday that U.S. officials were not seeking to babysit the Gaza Strip ceasefire and that Israel was a partner, not a \u201cvassal state,\u201d as questions rose over the next steps in the Middle East.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has hosted a string of senior American officials in recent days, exchanged words of friendship and optimism with Vance at a joint news conference in Jerusalem as Washington worked to ensure the truce brokered by President Donald Trump will hold.",
      "\u201cI never said it was easy, but what I am is optimistic that the ceasefire is going to hold and that we can actually build a better future in the entire Middle East,\u201d Vance said, speaking alongside Netanyahu.",
      "The vice president\u2019s visit followed the arrival of Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and the president\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was set to follow Thursday and meet with Netanyahu on Friday, the Israeli government said.",
      "The vice president and the Israeli leader championed each other\u2019s efforts in securing the ceasefire deal, which came into effect on Oct. 10.",
      "But as a succession of U.S. representatives flocked to Israel this week after flares of violence threatened to undermine the ceasefire, Vance also appeared to seek to reassure the Israeli leader \u2014 and the world \u2014 that the U.S. wasn\u2019t looking to overstep.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want a vassal state and that\u2019s not what Israel is. We don\u2019t want a client state,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want a partnership.\u201d",
      "He later clarified the role of the Americans in Israel this week as the ceasefire looked fragile and the path to the second phase of the deal appeared uncertain.",
      "It wasn\u2019t about \u201cmonitoring in the sense of, you know, you monitor a toddler. It\u2019s about monitoring in the sense that there\u2019s a lot of work, a lot a good people who are doing that work and it\u2019s important for the principles of the administration to keep on ensuring that our people are doing what we need them to do,\u201d Vance said.",
      "The planned international security force in Gaza has loomed as a major question mark, with some in Israel concerned that such a force could limit its freedom to act in Gaza in the future.",
      "Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Tuesday that \u201cnumerous of our NOW GREAT ALLIES in the Middle East, and areas surrounding the Middle East,\u201d had \u201cexplicitly and strongly, with great enthusiasm, informed me that they would welcome the opportunity, at my request, to go into GAZA with a heavy force.\u201d",
      "He added that he had \u201ctold these countries, and Israel, \u2018NOT YET,\u2019\u201d but he warned that if Hamas did not \u201cdo what is right,\u201d or it violated the ceasefire agreement, the militant group could meet a \u201cFAST, FURIOUS, & BRUTAL\u201d end.",
      "The president did not directly reference the international security force that he envisions entering Gaza to help maintain peace in the territory in the future under his 20-point plan, but appeared to be referring to the initiative.",
      "Vance had said Tuesday that the international stabilization force envisioned by the president was still in its early planning stages, as he acknowledged that coordinating troops from different countries could be a difficult task."

    "story": [
      "TOKYO \u2014 Lawmakers in Japan elected hard-line conservative Sanae Takaichi as prime minister Tuesday, making her the first woman in modern times to lead the key U.S. ally.",
      "Takaichi, 64, the new leader of the governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), was elected by lawmakers in the lower house of parliament by a vote of 237-149 over her closest rival, Yoshihiko Noda, leader of the liberal opposition Constitutional Democratic Party. She was also elected by upper house lawmakers in a second vote of 125-46 after falling one vote shy of a majority in the first round.",
      "Though her election is a milestone in a country where women are severely underrepresented in government, Takaichi enters office with a fragile coalition and facing a number of pressing challenges, including a visit next week by President Donald Trump.",
      "Takaichi, who says her hero is former British conservative leader Margaret Thatcher, has appointed two other women to her Cabinet, the same as the previous government. They include Satsuki Katayama, Japan\u2019s first female finance minister.",
      "\u201cI place great importance on equal opportunity, equal chances. And also participation from people from all walks of life,\u201d Takaichi said at a news conference Tuesday. \u201cI formed my Cabinet with this idea in mind, bringing together the combined strength of all generations.\u201d",
      "But Takaichi\u2019s victory is not necessarily a victory for women in general, critics say, especially after she secured it by forming an alliance with an Osaka-based party that will pull her coalition even further to the right.",
      "\u201cOne would like to say this is a historic moment in Japan,\u201d Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus, told NBC News. \u201cBut it\u2019s really hard to make that case, given her rather poor track record on empowering women.\u201d",
      "Takaichi opposes same-sex marriage and favors keeping succession to men only in Japan\u2019s shrinking imperial family. She also opposes changing the rules to make it easier for married women to keep their maiden names in Japan, where married couples are required to have the same surname.",
      "Progress toward gender equality has been slow in Japan, where women are far outnumbered at the highest levels of business and government and bear a disproportionate responsibility for child care and household chores.",
      "Japan, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, ranked 118th out of 148 countries in the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2025 Global Gender Gap Report. It noted that women make up less than 16% of Japanese lawmakers in the lower house of parliament and 10% of government ministers.",
      "After Takaichi was elected leader of the LDP earlier this month, Japanese feminist author Chizuko Ueno said that the prospect of Japan getting its first female prime minister \u201cdoesn\u2019t make me happy.\u201d",
      "Takaichi \u201csees herself as the Japanese version of Thatcher,\u201d Ueno, 77, said in a post on X. \u201cBritish feminists, who inherited Thatcher, have no illusions about women in leadership positions.\u201d",
      "She noted Takaichi\u2019s opposition to allowing separate surnames for married couples even as she has kept her own maiden name. Though Takaichi changed her legal name in 2004 when she first married Taku Yamamoto, she continued to use her maiden name professionally until they divorced in 2017, in line with legislation she had proposed.",
      "When they remarried in 2021, Yamamoto, a former LDP lawmaker, changed his legal surname to Takaichi.",
      "Takaichi \u2014 who in her youth rode motorcycles and played the drums in a heavy metal band \u2014 has pushed for greater support for women\u2019s health. She has talked about her personal struggles with symptoms of menopause and the importance of raising awareness \u201cso that men can properly understand when women are struggling, whether at school or in the workplace.\u201d",
      "But her campaign was focused mainly on the economy and national defense.",
      "Takaichi is a veteran politician who has served as minister of economic security, internal affairs and gender equality. A protege of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, she advocates tougher immigration policies, the revision of Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution and higher defense spending.",
      "Japan\u2019s Nikkei stock exchange closed at an all-time high for the second day in a row Tuesday, on hopes that Takaichi\u2019s policies might help jumpstart the economy.",
      "Earlier this month Takaichi was elected leader of the LDP, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since World War II, after running unsuccessfully in 2021 and 2024. In her victory speech, she underlined her commitment to the job.",
      "\u201cI myself will throw out the term \u2018work-life balance,\u2019\u201d Takaichi said. \u201cI will work and work and work and work and work.\u201d",
      "Her ascension to prime minister was thrown into doubt, however, after a crucial partner, the centrist party Komeito, left the LDP coalition.",
      "To ensure her victory, the LDP signed a deal Monday with the Japan Innovation Party, or Ishin, a far-right party based in Osaka.",
      "Even with the alliance, Takaichi faces an uphill battle in parliament, where she falls short of a majority in both houses after the LDP suffered major losses in recent elections amid voter anger over party corruption scandals and the rising cost of living. Her premiership could thus end up being short-lived \u2014 much like that of her predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, who was in office for a year.",
      "\u201cShe emerges from this a diminished leader from the get-go,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "Takaichi also faces an early test next week with the arrival of Trump, who is making his first trip to Asia since returning to office. He is expected to visit Malaysia and Japan before continuing on to South Korea, which is hosting a major summit of Asia-Pacific economies.",
      "\u201cI will deepen the relationship of trust between us leaders through frank exchanges of views not only on bilateral issues but also on the challenges facing Japan and the United States, ranging from issues in the Indo-Pacific region to the situation in the Middle East, Europe, and Ukraine,\u201d Takaichi said at the news conference.",
      "But Kingston cautioned that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a whole lot of time to get ready for a slew of diplomatic activity,\u201d adding he thought \u201cjob one is the Japanese economy.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "PARIS \u2014 The heist cut through hushed corridors with a speed and ease that humiliated a nation. Authorities are now racing against their own clock.",
      "In the space of just seven minutes in the casual daylight of Sunday morning, four suspects stole nine pieces of France\u2019s crown jewels from the Louvre. They robbed not just the most visited museum in the world, but also the French people themselves, the government said Monday.",
      "Officials are now scrambling to reassure the public about security at key cultural sites \u2014 and find the jewels stolen from the museum before they can be broken up and melted down.",
      "The thieves used a monte-meubles \u2014 a truck mounted with a basket lift, commonly used to hoist furniture into Paris' inaccessible apartment blocks.",
      "They parked it outside the sprawling renaissance palace, rode to the balcony outside the Galerie d\u2019Apollon, and sliced through the window with cutting tools, according to officials.",
      "Their daring heist pierced the nation\u2019s self-image, too.",
      "Threatening museum staff with their angle-grinders, the otherwise unarmed thieves then smashed through two display cases, taking necklaces, tiaras and brooches from France\u2019s now dispatched royal families, officials said.",
      "This all played out just after the museum had opened, with bystanders able to video one suspect in a high-visibility vest standing at one of the glass boxes housing historical treasures.",
      "Investigators say they are puzzled why the culprits left behind the colossal, 140-carat Regent diamond, which has been valued at $60 million. Had they wandered down that opulent corridor, they would have reached the Mona Lisa \u2014 itself infamously stolen more than a century ago.",
      "As it was, they made off on two scooters, but not before they dropped two items, including the Crown of Empress Eug\u00e9nie, empress to Napoleon III in the 19th century, which was found broken near the scene, officials said.",
      "That item alone is \"worth several tens of millions of euros,\" Alexandre Giquello, president of France's leading Drouot auction house, told the Reuters news agency. \"And it's not, in my opinion, the most important item\" taken by the burglars.",
      "Some experts have said that because the items are unique they cannot be sold, and so the thieves will likely try to melt down their metals and break up their emeralds, sapphires, diamonds and pearls. That means investigators might have less than a week before the jewels are lost forever.",
      "The incident saw the Louvre shuttered Sunday and again Monday morning, with bewildered crowds evacuated from the area just after the assailants had struck.",
      "For a nation whose character is defined by proud displays of history and culture, the incident is being seen in some quarters as a national humiliation.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron called it \u201can attack on a heritage that we cherish because it is our history.\u201d He vowed to \u201crecover the works and the perpetrators will be brought to justice,\u201d adding that \u201ceverything is being done, everywhere, to achieve this.\u201d",
      "The Culture and Interior ministries held an emergency meeting Monday and agreed to ask senior officials across France \u201cto immediately assess the existing security measures already in place around cultural institutions, and to strengthen them if necessary,\u201d the Interior Ministry said, according to Reuters.",
      "Justice Minister Gerard Darmanin said the heist gave a \u201cnegative\u201d and \u201cdeplorable\u201d image of France. \u201cWhat is certain is that we failed,\u201d he told the radio station France Inter. \u201cThe French people all feel like they\u2019ve been robbed.\u201d",
      "One of Macron\u2019s main political opponents, Jordan Bardella, the far-right leader who is favorite to replace him at the next presidential election in 2027, cast the crime as another example of \u201cthe disintegration of the state\u201d under Macron, and \u201can unbearable humiliation for our country.\u201d",
      "It is not the first time the Louvre has been targeted by thieves.",
      "In 1911, a museum decorator named Vincenzo Peruggia stole the Mona Lisa. And more recently French museums have been hit with a spate of thefts, including raw gold stolen from the National Museum of Natural History and porcelain works reportedly worth around $11 million taken from the Adrien Dubouche Museum in Limoges last month.",
      "After the theft at the Louvre, the union SUD Culture blamed \"destruction of jobs dedicated to security\" and funding shortfalls for security equipment.",
      "That hints at the wider disquiet percolating in France.",
      "Macron has seen multiple governments collapse as he tries to staunch the rise of Bardella\u2019s National Rally. Meanwhile hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in protest at public spending cuts.",
      "Now, authorities have another crisis at their door.",
      "Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said on BFM TV that if the heist was commissioned by a collector, then there is a chance of getting the items back in their original condition.",
      "However, if not, the leading Dutch art detective Arthur Brand told Sky News that the police \"have a week\" before the jewels vanish forever.",
      "\"These crown jewels are so famous, you just cannot sell them,\" he said. \"The only thing they can do is melt the silver and gold down, dismantle the diamonds, try to cut them. That's the way they will probably disappear forever.\"",
      "\"It's a race against time.\"",

      "Friday\u2019s announcement came after the Mail on Sunday and the Sun on Sunday newspapers published an email, not verified by NBC News, reported to have been sent by Andrew to Epstein in 2011, after a photograph was published showing Andrew with his arm around Giuffre, accompanied by Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "The palace did not comment on the reported email, which the newspapers say told Epstein \u201cwe are in this together\u201d and concluded \u201cplay some more soon.\u201d",
      "The email was especially damaging because it appeared to contradict his previous comments in a 2019 interview with the BBC, in which he said he had stopped communicating with Epstein after visiting him in New York in 2010, the year before.",
      "\u201cThat was the real last nail in the coffin for Andrew because it makes him look, in black and white, like a liar,\u201d said NBC News royal commentator Daisy McAndrew.",

It is, in fact, exactly how this is going to have to happen when you have people who hate each other, who have been fighting against each other for a very long time. We are doing very well. We are in a very good place.\u201d",

Hovering over the news conference was a Tuesday morning Truth Social post by Trump, who wrote that Middle East allies \u201cwould welcome the opportunity, at my request, to go into GAZA with a heavy force and \u2018straighten [out] Hamas\u2019 if Hamas continues to act badly, in violation of their agreement with us.\u201d",

      "Vance added that he believed Middle East allies, including \u201cour Israeli friends,\u201d are showing a \u201ccertain amount of impatience with Hamas.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut we\u2019re going to keep on working at this process,\u201d Vance said, \u201cand we\u2019re going to keep on trying to bring the deceased hostages home, but also make sure that all Gazans are able to live in a prosperous and safe place.\u201d",

      "If the bodies returned by Hamas on Tuesday are confirmed to be  hostages, then the bodies of 13 deceased hostages still remain in Gaza.",
      "Vance was joined Tuesday by Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, and Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law. Both played key roles in negotiating the ceasefire, while Vance has been dispatched to demonstrate the administration\u2019s commitment to it.",

      "Since the ceasefire came into effect a week ago, the militant group has deployed armed police officers on streets from where Israeli forces have withdrawn, clashed with rival clans, directly fired upon and killed Israeli troops in multiple incidents, and staged at least one public execution of suspected collaborators.",
      "As Hamas continues to demonstrate its presence, Israeli security officials and experts on Gaza agree it has been badly diminished but not thoroughly destroyed, and will count on new recruits propelled to join after tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians were killed by Israeli fire.",
      "Assessments of Hamas\u2019 strength are crucial to the negotiations around the group\u2019s disarmament \u2014 an important stipulation in the American-brokered ceasefire deal that halted the war. So far, the group has refused to give up its weapons.",
      "\u201cHamas was damaged very severely in its military capabilities, but I think it will be fair to say that it wasn\u2019t crushed,\u201d said Shalom Ben Hanan, a fellow at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism at Israel\u2019s Reichman University and a nearly 30-year veteran of the Israeli Security Agency, also known as Shabak or Shin Bet. \u201cMaybe the threat isn\u2019t in the days to come or the nearest future. But their potential is still there.\u201d",
      "Hanan said the group still commands about 15,000 to 25,000 fighters \u2014 an estimate he said was based on his regular briefings from serving Israeli security officials.",
      "According to an Israeli military official, who asked for anonymity to speak openly about the Israeli military\u2019s internal assessment, about 10,000 to 20,000 commandos remain at Hamas\u2019 disposal.",
      "Giora Eiland, the former director of Israel\u2019s National Security Council and the former head of the planning department of the Israel Defense Forces, said Hamas lost about 20,000 fighters during two years of war \u2014 an estimate he also bases on conversations with serving security officials.",
      "But the group will have little trouble reconstituting its manpower, Eiland said, and security officials believe Hamas has been recruiting new fighters throughout the war even under fire.",
      "\u201cIt is easy for Hamas to regain power and it is very easy for them to recruit more and more people to replace those who were killed,\u201d Eiland said.",
      "Hamas wrested power from the more secular and internationally recognized Fatah party in 2007 after winning legislative elections the previous year. The Islamist group, which the United States, Israel and many other countries classify as a terrorist group, does not recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist and launched the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in part to stall normalization efforts in the Arab world.",
      "Israel\u2019s ensuing offensive has flattened much of the enclave, killed tens of thousands of civilians and engendered the kind of anger that could create thousands of potential recruits.",
      "\u201cAlthough we will be speaking about young people with less military experience, they still have no doubt lots of competence and enough personal weapons like small arms and RPGs,\u201d Eiland said, referring to rocket-propelled grenades.",
      "Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed and maimed in the war; a United Nations commission said in September that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Famine was officially declared in August in part of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, by the world\u2019s leading authority on hunger. The war has also inflicted significant damage on Hamas\u2019 supplies of its heaviest weapons and its weapons manufacturing capabilities, as well as on its senior leadership.",
      "The Israeli military official said that as many as 90% of the group\u2019s rockets have been destroyed, and Israel has succeeded in frustrating Hamas\u2019 ability to rebuild that lost heavy firepower.",
      "\u201cVery important is the manufacturing sites, the smuggling routes and so on,\u201d the military official said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just taking away the fish, it\u2019s taking away the rod.\u201d",
      "All of the experts agreed that Hamas\u2019 vast tunnel system remains its greatest strength and Israel\u2019s greatest challenge.",
      "Eiland estimated that 70% to 80% of Hamas\u2019 tunnels remain intact, with much of the surviving network unknown to Israel\u2019s military.",
      "In a statement last week, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said the IDF would turn its attention to destroying the remaining tunnel network as part of the process of disarming Hamas. The IDF said it had been working to dismantle a part of the tunnel network when some of its soldiers came under fire Sunday.",
      "The group\u2019s political power and popularity \u2014 key components in its ability to recruit, rebuild its weapons and suppress its rivals \u2014 have been badly damaged. Even if Gazans are enraged at Israel for killing nearly 70,000 Palestinians during the war, Hamas still takes part of the public blame.",
      "\u201cPolitically is where Hamas is really in shambles,\u201d said Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, head of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Realign for Palestine project, whose family is from the Gaza Strip. \u201cThey don\u2019t really have a political program. They don\u2019t really have a compelling agenda in Gaza.\u201d",
      "But unlike the Islamic State terrorist group, or ISIS, and Al Qaeda \u2014 two terror groups whose power has been checked by the U.S.-led war on terror over the past quarter-century \u2014 Hamas presides over a true geographic constituency.",
      "\u201cIt is not a terrorist organization that came from nowhere and managed to take control over a certain area by spreading fear and terror,\u201d Eiland said. \u201cHamas is the authentic representative of the people of Gaza.\u201d",
      "Outside Gaza, Hamas also takes credit for turning global opinion against Israel, Alkhatib said.",
      "\u201cHamas feels that this shift is something that they alone brought about,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Hamas ties that to its strategic picture on the ground.\u201d"

      "According to state-run news outlet Myanma Alinn, the army seized 30 sets of Starlink terminals and detained nearly 2,200 people in the Monday raid on the cybercrime center outside Myawaddy, a major trading town in Myanmar\u2019s Kayin state.",
      "Myanmar, where the civilian government was overthrown in a military coup in 2021, is notorious for cybercrime. The Southeast Asian nation is embroiled in a civil war with various ethnic groups fighting the military, creating an almost lawless situation in many parts of the country and allowing scam operations to thrive.",
      "Workers in the scam compounds are often trafficked from third countries, usually under the pretense of a lucrative job offer, and then forced to scam people online with investment pitches or romantic ploys.",
      "Following international pressure, particularly from neighboring Thailand and China, whose nationals have also been trafficked to work in these compounds, the junta \u2014 working alongside the same armed ethnic groups it opposes \u2014 launched a massive operation in February and released hundreds of workers.",
      "The practice is also well documented in other countries around the region such as Cambodia, where the U.S. last week seized more than $14 billion in bitcoin and formally charged the chairman of a Cambodian conglomerate over his alleged involvement in a massive cryptocurrency scam.",
      "The U.S., along with the U.K., also sanctioned the company, which was declared a transnational criminal organization by the Treasury Department.",
      "Last year, Americans lost at least $10 billion to Southeast Asia-based scams, according to the Treasury Department, a 66% increase from the year before."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Prince Andrew may have given up his titles, but the questions about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein haven\u2019t given up on him \u2014 or Britain\u2019s embattled royal family.",
      "Seemingly every day, damaging new reports emerge about Andrew, 65, his friendship with the late pedophile financier, and allegations the prince had sex with trafficked Epstein victim Virginia Roberts Giuffre when she was 17, which he denies.",
      "In her posthumous memoir, \u201cNobody\u2019s Girl,\u201d released Tuesday, Giuffre, who died by suicide in April at age 41, said Andrew acted as though having sex with her \u201cwas his birthright.\u201d",
      "Andrew, who in February 2022 reached a legal settlement with Giuffre after she filed a civil case against him in a New York court, has repeatedly denied having met her.",
      "But the rolling scandal refuses to go away, and it has the potential to inflict further damage on a monarchy whose popularity continues to dwindle after the death of the widely beloved Queen Elizabeth II in 2022.",
      "King Charles III has sought to insulate \u201cthe Firm\u201d from the cloud over his younger brother. Andrew said in a statement last week that with Charles\u2019 \u201cagreement,\u201d he would \"no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me,\u201d including Duke of York.",
      "But there are still unanswered questions about what the palace knew, and when, with calls from lawmakers and others for the royals to oust Andrew entirely.",
      "\u201cThe deep and wide support for the queen meant the family was able to better weather all the controversies that could emerge \u2014 and this is a bad one,\u201d said Craig Prescott, who teaches law at Royal Holloway, University of London and specializes on the constitutional and political role of the monarchy.",
      "\u201cThese specific allegations are, of course, extraordinarily damaging in the first place, but they also run counter to some of the causes that members of the royal family take up,\u201d he said.",
      "Friday's agreement for Andrew to relinquish his titles came after emails published in documents for a court case not involving the prince showed he had been in contact with Epstein for longer than he previously admitted.",
      "That \u201cmakes him look, in black and white, a liar,\u201d NBC News' royal contributor Daisy McAndrew told \u201cTODAY\u201d on Sunday. \u201cAnd so how can you trust anything else he says?\u201d",
      "Then Sunday, London\u2019s Metropolitan Police said it was investigating reports that Andrew had asked one of its officers to dig up dirt on Giuffre. A Buckingham Palace official told NBC News these reports should be \u201cexamined in the appropriate way.\u201d",
      "Monday brought two further revelations: First that Andrew had not paid rent on his Royal Lodge residence for 20 years, revealed in a Freedom of Information request by The Times newspaper to the Crown Estate, which handles royal finances. Neither Andrew nor Buckingham Palace have responded to the report.",
      "Then came the publication of Giuffre\u2019s posthumous memoir.",
      "She wrote that she had sex with the prince on three occasions, including an \u201corgy\u201d involving \u201ceight other young girls\u201d who \u201cappeared to be under the age of 18 and didn\u2019t really speak English.\u201d",
      "She then suffered three weeks of \u201cirregular bleeding,\u201d before waking up in a \u201cpool of blood\u201d and being taken to hospital by Epstein, she wrote.",
      "Epstein, who died by suicide in jail in 2019 shortly after he was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges, later told her she had suffered a miscarriage, and she suspected him of conspiring with the doctor to keep it quiet, Giuffre said.",
      "On seeing a photo of Andrew and Epstein walking in New York's Central Park in 2010 \u2014 after Epstein was convicted of soliciting prostitution of someone under the age of 18 \u2014 Giuffre wrote she was \u201crevolted to see two of my abusers together, out for a stroll.\u201d But \"mostly I was amazed that a member of the Royal Family would be stupid enough to appear in public with Epstein.\u201d",
      "Andrew has previously denied these allegations, saying that he has \u201cno recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.\u201d In his statement announcing the relinquishment of his titles, he said, \u201cI vigorously deny the accusations against me.\u201d",
      "The civil sex abuse lawsuit brought by Giuffre against Andrew was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.",
      "Though Buckingham Palace routinely says it does not speak for the prince, Andrew has enjoyed a prominent role at some recent royal events, including the queen's funeral.",
      "Some lawmakers are demanding that Andrew be formally stripped of his titles by an act of Parliament \u2014 a rare foray into regal matters by Britain\u2019s supposedly separate government.",
      "The last time this happened was in 1917, when Parliament used the Titles Deprivation Act to strip German members of the British royal family of their titles during World War I.",
      "That\u2019s not without risks, according to Prescott at Royal Holloway.",
      "\"If you have legislation removing the dukedom from Prince Andrew, might a cheeky MP want to table an amendment and remove the dukedom of Sussex from Prince Harry?\u201d he said.",
      "The government indicated it does not support this. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said Monday that while \u201cour thoughts have to be with the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, these \u201care matters for the royal family.\u201d",
      "The nuclear option would involve the king himself using something called \u201cLetters Patent\u201d to strip Andrew of his designation as prince.",
      "In doing so, the palace must weigh distancing itself from Andrew with ensuring the blowback from any further censure does not do even more damage to an institution that requires public buy-in.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s true that the monarchy isn\u2019t voted in,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cBut if the public mood shifted and people no longer wanted to have the monarchy, then you imagine that politics would follow.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A large chunk of suspected space debris has been found in a remote part of the Australian desert, the country\u2019s space agency confirmed Monday.",
      "The charred and smoldering object was found in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, according to the Australian Space Agency. It\u2019s not yet clear what the object is or where it came from, but officials said it\u2019s probably a spent rocket part.",
      "\u201cThe debris is likely a propellant tank or pressure vessel from a space launch vehicle,\u201d the Australian Space Agency wrote in a post on X.",
      "The agency did not provide details about the object\u2019s size or weight, but wrote that it is working with local authorities and other space agencies to investigate and determine \u201cthe exact nature of the debris and its origin.\u201d",
      "The agency did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for further information.",
      "The object was discovered Saturday on a remote access road by workers from a nearby mine, according to a report from Sky News, which said that local authorities did not think the debris posed any threat to public safety. NBC News has not independently confirmed these details. (Sky News is a division of Comcast, the parent company of NBC News.)",
      "Government space agencies and private space companies often let depleted or defunct rocket parts and satellites burn up in the atmosphere as a way to destroy them. Sometimes, however, pieces can survive the fiery process of atmospheric re-entry. Still, it\u2019s relatively rare for space debris to fall over land, given that the planet is mostly covered by oceans \u2014 and even more rare for pieces to fall over densely populated areas.",
      "In recent years, though, experts have raised concerns about the growing problem of space debris, particularly as launches into orbit have become more frequent.",
      "Last summer, a 90-pound slab of space debris was discovered on a mountain trail in North Carolina. It was later identified as part of the service module from a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule that had carried four astronauts back to Earth from the International Space Station earlier that year.",
      "In March 2024, a 1.6-pound piece of metal tore through a home in Naples, Florida. A subsequent investigation found that the metal debris came from a cargo pallet that had been intentionally released from the International Space Station to burn up in the atmosphere.",
      "Tens of thousands of pieces of space junk \u2014 and millions more smaller bits of orbital debris \u2014 are cluttered in low Earth orbit, the narrow band of space where many telecommunications and GPS satellites circle the planet. These objects fly through orbit at up to 18,000 mph, threatening functioning spacecraft and posing safety risks to astronauts on the International Space Station.",
      "For those reasons, experts have long warned against overcrowding in space. NASA and other space agencies have even funded research into and technology demonstrations of how to clean up the large amount of junk in orbit.",
      "The Australian Space Agency said on X that it \u201cis committed to the long-term sustainability of outer space activities, including debris mitigation and continues to highlight this on the international stage.\u201d"

      "People with a leading cause of blindness were able to read again thanks to a tiny wireless chip implanted in the back of the eye and specialized augmented glasses, according to study results published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "The trial involved 38 European patients, all of whom had an advanced stage of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) known as geographic atrophy.",
      "There is no cure for AMD, which is driven by changes in a part of the retina called the macula and caused by inflammation and a build-up of waste. The photoreceptor cells in the macula are responsible for producing sharp, detailed and colored vision. When the disease has progressed to the geographic atrophy stage, the cells deteriorate and die, and people lose their central vision \u2014 meaning an object straight ahead may appear blurry or covered up with a dark blotch.",
      "Roughly 22 million people in the United States have AMD, and about 1 million have geographic atrophy, according to the American Macular Degeneration Foundation.",
      "In the study, the participants, who had an average age of 79, were fitted with the \u201cPRIMA device,\u201d a system meant to replicate vision. Patients wear augmented reality glasses embedded with a camera that captures their visual field. What the camera \u201csees\u201d is transmitted to the chip implanted in the eye in the form of infrared light. The chip converts the light into an electrical current, which stimulates the remaining healthy cells in the macula in a realistic way, enabling the brain to interpret signals the cells send as vision.",
      "An image processor, which users must carry, lets patients zoom in and magnify the images they see, which appear in black and white.",
      "With the help of the PRIMA device, 80% of the 32 patients who returned for reassessments one year after the chip implantation had achieved clinically meaningful visual improvements. Patients did experience side effects, predominantly related to the surgical procedure: The study reported that 26 serious adverse events occurred in 19 of the patients, ranging from elevated blood pressure in the eye to an accumulation of blood around the retina. The majority of the adverse events resolved within two months of the implantation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first ever therapeutic approach that has led to an improvement in visual function in this group of patients,\u201d said Dr. Frank Holz, the trial\u2019s lead investigator and chair of the department of ophthalmology at the University Hospital of Bonn in Germany. \u201cLate-stage age-related macular degeneration is a dismal disease. Patients are no longer capable of reading, driving a car, watching TV or even recognizing faces. So [these results] are a game changer in my mind.\u201d",
      "One patient, Sheila Irvine, 70, who was fitted with the PRIMA device at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, said in a statement provided by the hospital that her life before she received the implant was akin to \u201chaving two black discs in my eyes, with the outside distorted.\u201d A self-described \u201cavid bookworm\u201d before she lost her vision, Irvine said she was now able to do crosswords and read prescriptions.",
      "Dr. Sunir Garg, professor of ophthalmology at the retina service of Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia, who was not involved in the study, said the results are a breakthrough for patients with geographic atrophy. All doctors have been able to offer, he said, are visual aids, like magnifiers, and emotional support.",
      "\u201cEven with new medical therapies, the best that we can do is slow it down,\u201d said Garg, who works with several drugmakers involved in treatments for AMD, including Apellis Pharmaceuticals, the maker of pegcetacoplan. The drug, which slows the progression of geographic atrophy, was recently approved in the United States and must be injected into the eye every one to two months. \u201cWe can\u2019t stop it, and we can\u2019t do anything to bring back lost vision.\u201d",
      "Dr. Demetrios Vavvas, director of the retina service at Mass Eye and Ear in Boston, who was also not involved in the study, said the PRIMA system is not without limitations.",
      "Vavvas noted that the surgery required to implant the chip in the eye requires a high level of surgical skill and is not without risk. \u201cYou have to lift the retina off its normal position to implant this device, which increases the atrophy,\u201d said Vavvas, who is a consultant to Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals, a company working on stem cell therapies for patients with other forms of vision loss.",
      "Vavvas said it was important to note that the device is not restoring normal vision, as patients were able to see only in black and white rather than color, and that the trial participants had to undergo a significant amount of training to learn how to see with the device. He also said it was not clear whether the enhancements in visual ability had significantly improved the patients\u2019 quality of life.",
      "But at the same time, Vavvas was also optimistic about its potential, describing the current iteration of PRIMA as a key steppingstone in the field of vision restoration.",
      "\u201cThink of this device as the pre-release iPhone,\u201d he said. \u201cThe limitations are clear. We shouldn\u2019t oversell that the quality of life really improved. But there were certain [visual] tasks at which the patients were clearly better. So it shows to us that there is potential in this approach. It is still, in some ways, a prototype. They\u2019re working on iterations of this device that will be better.\u201d",
      "New upgrades to the device could be coming in the next couple of years.",
      "The PRIMA system was invented by Stanford University ophthalmology professor Daniel Palanker and is being developed by the California-based neural engineering company Science Corp.",
      "Palanker said technical improvements are being made to increase the number of pixels in the chip from 400 to 10,000. The new chips have already been tested in rats, and the upgraded chips are being manufactured for future human trials. With the aid of the camera\u2019s zoom function, Palanker said, that could theoretically enable patients to achieve 20/20 visual resolution.",
      "\u201cWe are also working on next-generation software that will allow patients to perceive not just black-and-white text, but also gray-scale natural images, such as faces,\u201d Palanker said.",
      "Palanker suggested that the technology could be trialed in other retinal diseases that cause blindness, such as Stargardt disease, which has similar symptoms to age-related macular degeneration but is genetic and usually affects younger people.",
      "Garg and Vavvas are eager to see larger trials that provide more details about how the device improves patients\u2019 ability to function day to day. Vavvas suggested that future trials should include a control arm to understand the extent to which the device yields real-world benefits, for example compared with existing electronic magnifiers.",
      "\u201cIs it something that is good enough for patients to say, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve regained my independence because I can now do my credit card bills myself, stamp and address my envelopes myself, and look at grocery store labels\u2019?\u201d Garg said. \u201cThose kinds of practical things I would like to know more about.\u201d",
      "Vavvas  said: \u201cThis is a chronic disease that you will have for life, so we need more than one year of follow-up to see other risks, other problems. Does that signal of efficacy that we see at 12 months remain two years later?\u201d",
      "While Vavvas said he would not call the device a panacea for blindness, the study showed that brain-computer interfaces can represent an important approach to tackling different kinds of severe visual impairment. \u201cAs the iterations of this device become better and better, it could become a real solution for a cohort of patients,\u201d he said."

      "President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed an agreement at the White House on Monday on rare-earth minerals, which could serve as a bargaining chip as the United States fights a trade war with China.",
      "They signed the agreement at the top of the meeting, which Trump told the media had \"been negotiated over a period of four or five months.\"",
      "\"We got it done just in time for the visit,\" Trump told reporters. \"And we work together very much on rare earths, critical minerals and lots of other things, and we\u2019ve had a very good relationship. We\u2019ve been working on that for quite a while.\"",
      "Albanese said Australia has a $8.5 billion pipeline \"ready to go\" for the deal.",
      "A White House official said that under the deal, the U.S. and Australian governments plan to invest more than $3 billion together in critical mineral projects in the next six months, with recoverable resources estimated to be worth over $50 billion.",
      "Asked whether the United States plans to lift tariffs on Australia, Trump touted his general trade policies and eventually said: \"I will say this, Australia pays very low tariffs, very, very low tariffs. Australia pays among the lowest tariffs.\"",
      "The two leaders are also expected to discuss defense cooperation, Indo-Pacific stability and the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal, Albanese\u2019s office said Sunday.",
      "Albanese, whose center-left government was re-elected in May for a second term, said he looked forward to a \u201cpositive and constructive\u201d meeting with Trump.",
      "Australia, a country of about 27 million people, hasn\u2019t figured prominently in the second Trump administration so far. Unlike many U.S. trading partners, it has a large trade deficit with the United States, earning it the minimum tariff rate of 10%.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think Australia is particularly high on Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d said Emma Shortis, director of the Australia Institute\u2019s International and Security Affairs Program.",
      "But the rest of the world may be watching the meeting closely, she said, \u201cto see how Trump treats a traditional ally.\u201d",
      "For Albanese, the bar for success is that the meeting \u201cisn\u2019t a disaster,\u201d Shortis said, avoiding the kind of Oval Office dressing-downs Trump delivered to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.",
      "Resource-rich Australia has sensed an opportunity in recent U.S.-China tensions over rare-earth minerals, which are critical components of advanced electronics and defense technologies. China, which has a near-monopoly on their production and processing, has announced a series of export controls viewed as threatening the global supply.",
      "\u201cWe know that American companies desperately need critical minerals, and Australia is very well placed to service that need,\u201d Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers told reporters in Washington on Friday.",
      "There has been some uneasiness in Australia that it has taken nine months for Trump and Albanese to have an official meeting, though they met briefly last month on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.",
      "But there is also uneasiness about Albanese\u2019s meeting with Trump at all.",
      "Australia, whose population closely follows U.S. politics, is among the countries most critical of Trump, with 77% of survey respondents telling the Pew Research Center in the first months of his current term that they had \u201cno confidence\u201d in Trump to do the right thing regarding world affairs.",
      "A poll released by the Australia Institute in May found that more than 54% of respondents preferred a more independent foreign policy over a closer alliance with the United States, an increase of 10 percentage points compared with the same poll two months earlier, shortly after Trump returned to office.",
      "Though Australian support for the U.S. alliance has historically been strong, \u201cif the United States is not seen as a democracy or a nation of laws, then the alliance with the United States will come into question,\u201d said Brendon O\u2019Connor, a professor of U.S. politics and U.S. foreign relations at the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.",
      "Albanese broke with the United States last month by formally recognizing a Palestinian state. He has praised Trump over the ceasefire he brokered in the Israel-Hamas war but will be cautious not to be seen as too \u201cfawning\u201d to Trump on \u201cissues around democracy and authoritarianism and internal dissent,\u201d O\u2019Connor said.",
      "The relationship has also been tested over the future of AUKUS (which stands for Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States), a $240 billion trilateral security deal in which Australia would buy U.S. nuclear-powered submarines in 2032 and then build a new submarine class with Britain.",
      "Australian officials have expressed confidence that the deal will move forward, even though it is currently under review by the Trump administration amid concerns that the U.S. may not be able to produce enough submarines for both itself and its ally.",
      "Australian Defense Minister Pat Conroy said last week that Australia would \u201cshortly\u201d make its second of three billion-dollar payments to help accelerate U.S. nuclear submarine production.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s reasons to be pretty skeptical about whether those submarines will ever arrive,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just up to Trump. I mean, six months before delivering them in the 2030s the United States can decide it doesn\u2019t have enough submarines to sell Australia three or four.\u201d",
      "Some in Australia have suggested that Albanese could shore up Trump\u2019s support for AUKUS by offering a critical minerals deal.",
      "Shortis was skeptical, arguing that \u201cTrump\u2019s word on any issue like this is not particularly reliable and can change very quickly.\u201d",

      "After the fall of Napoleon\u2019s empire, Marie\u2011Louise passed the set, including a tiara, to a relative, and it remained in her family for generations. The Louvre bought it in 2004.",
      "Sapphire jewelry set",
      "Worn by successive members of the Orl\u00e9ans family, including the last queen of France, Marie-Am\u00e9lie, a sapphire parure, or a matching set of jewelry, was also taken in the raid.",
      "The necklace, earrings and tiara each feature natural Ceylon sapphires set in gold and surrounded by diamonds.",
      "Although the jewelry bears no hallmarks of any renowned royal jewelers, the Louvre describes this set as a \u201cprecious testimony to Parisian jewelry.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, the thieves managed to steal only one earring from this collection, leaving the other one behind in the museum."

      "Iranian director Jafar Panahi puts a lot on the line for his work.",
      "Authorities could again arrest him for speaking out against the country\u2019s hard-line regime. They could send him back to the notoriously cruel Evin Prison in Tehran, which houses many of Iran\u2019s political dissidents. He could again be placed on house arrest and barred from making films.",
      "But Panahi, now 65, has largely ignored these attempts at silencing him over the years, instead focusing on doing what he loves most: making films about his homeland.",
      "When he was imprisoned and charged with \u201cpropagandizing against the government,\u201d he went on a hunger strike until authorities released him on bail. His filmmaking ban \u2014 which was supposed to last for 20 years \u2014 ended up serving as creative inspiration, fueling critically acclaimed films such as \u201cThis Is Not a Film\u201d and \u201cTaxi.\u201d",
      "With his latest movie, \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d which was released in limited North American theaters over the weekend, Panahi once again defied the government\u2019s attempts to censor his art, though it has meant putting himself at risk.",
      "\u201cYou have to find a way around the system,\u201d Panahi said in a recent interview conducted in Farsi at a hotel in Santa Monica, California, and translated into English by NBC News. Panahi, known for the signature sunglasses that he sports at every event, was sitting in the lobby next to his translator after enjoying a smoke break outside.",
      "The filmmaker has had a busy few months traveling the world to promote his film, a buzzy Oscar contender that was picked up for distribution in North America by Neon. He has also faced several hurdles coming from Iran \u2014 including missing a New York Film Festival screening after his visa process was delayed, reportedly because of the U.S. government shutdown.",
      "While on the press tour, he has continued to champion his message of the importance of freedom of expression.",
      "\u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d a revenge drama that is sprinkled with comedic moments, follows a group of Iranians who capture a man whom they suspect was their interrogator while they were in prison. They quarrel about the man they have put in the back of their van and whether he is in fact the guard, noting both have an artificial leg that makes a squeaking noise when walking. The group also grapples with the morality behind taking vengeance, and whether that makes them just as bad as those who oppressed them.",
      "Panahi reflected on how his own time in prison shaped \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d which was the first film he directed after  spending seven months in Evin from 2022 to 2023.",
      "\u201cWhen you are imprisoned, it does not matter which group, which category and which party you are. We are all living with each other. And then when you go out, you can\u2019t separate from it. These all remain in your mind,\u201d he said. \u201cThis experience stays in your brain, and after you leave \u2026 you feel like you have to do something to express this.\u201d",
      "The filmmaker has previously spoken about his time at the prison, recalling how he was placed in solitary confinement and blindfolded during his hourslong interrogations. He drew from his own experiences, as well as from fellow political prisoners he met there, in writing the film, making it one of his most personal endeavors to date.",
      "But authorities in Iran oversee the media, so filmmakers must get their scripts approved to get film permits. While Panahi is no longer banned from filmmaking, he chose to shoot in secret, filming in Iran over the course of several weeks without official permission from the government because of the film\u2019s sensitive subject matter.",
      "The crew shot scenes in a remote desert location, in a van and in the streets of Tehran. Expecting trouble from authorities, the crew also took precautionary steps while moving around the city. Panahi told Vulture that in the summer of 2024, the crew was stopped by police during filming. They were asked to turn everything over but they handed over an empty memory card from a camera, rather than the actual footage of the film.",
      "They then waited a few weeks to resume the project and ended up editing part of the movie in France for safety reasons after the cast and crew had a run-in with authorities.",
      "\u201cIf you want to make a movie in Iran, you have to accept that is not possible through a regular path, you have to find an alternative path, and you either have to find it yourself or use other people\u2019s experience in doing so,\u201d Panahi said.",
      "Despite his years of political dissent and the personal price he has paid, Panahi is humble. He explained that it\u2019s the people of Iran who deserve praise for continuing to stand up to the government in the aftermath of the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody, which triggered huge, monthslong public protests that were labeled the Women, Life, Freedom movement.",
      "\u201cThey are more brave than I am,\u201d he said, noting that he\u2019s someone who is \u201cwell known\u201d and because of that has \u201csome protections in place.\u201d The activists \u201care not known to anyone,\u201d he said. They took to the streets, were jailed and released, and still continue to protest in their own ways.",
      "For example, there are women in Iran who now refuse to wear the mandatory hijab, instead walking around with their hair flowing freely. It\u2019s a subtle act of defiance that Panahi captured in his film, which shows its two female stars without headscarves in public in several scenes.",
      "It was important to Panahi to depict a \u201ctruthful picture of Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point in history where everything is measured by whether it happened before or after the Women, Life, Freedom movement. If it\u2019s before, and you were showing in your film that there was a woman without the headscarf covering, it would not be believable.\u201d",
      "Those who admire Panahi say his art serves as its own powerful form of activism, as he balances politics with a personal touch that helps breathe levity into heavier topics.",
      "At the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, Panahi won the prestigious Palme d\u2019Or after the film received a nearly eight-minute standing ovation.",
      "The win marked the second time an Iranian filmmaker took home the award (Abbas Kiarostami was the first, winning in 1997 for \u201cTaste of Cherry\u201d). Panahi has now received the top prize at all three major European film festivals, including Berlin\u2019s Golden Bear for \u201cTaxi\u201d in 2015 and the Golden Lion at Venice for \u201cThe Circle\u201d in 2000.",
      "Oscar-winning actor Juliette Binoche, who served as the 2025 Cannes jury president, said that \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d \u201csprings from a feeling of resistance, survival, which is absolutely necessary today.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very human and political at the same time, because he comes from a complicated country,\u201d she said at the event, according to Deadline. \u201cWhen we watched the film, it stood out.\u201d",
      "At the New York Film Festival earlier this month, Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese also praised Panahi and called on more streaming services to champion Iranian cinema.",
      "As the film continues to rack up positive reviews and vies for Oscar nods, Panahi plans to continue to promote it at events.",
      "Other Iranian filmmakers, including Panahi\u2019s friend and fellow director Mohammad Rasoulof, have fled Iran to avoid facing fierce punishment.",
      "But when asked whether he fears the Iranian government lashing out at him again, Panahi appeared undeterred.",
      "\u201cWhat are they going to do that they haven\u2019t done already?\u201d he said."
