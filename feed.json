      "MIAMI BEACH, Fla. -- The mayor of Miami Beach, Florida, wants to terminate a lease and cut financial support for an independent film theater that screened an Oscar-winning documentary about the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis.",
      "Mayor Steven Meiner introduced a resolution describing the film \u201cNo Other Land\u201d as antisemitic. City commissioners will discuss the resolution Wednesday during their next meeting.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land\u201d opened last Friday at O Cinema, located at the Miami Beach Historic City Hall. Meiner had reached out several days before the premiere to discourage O Cinema CEO Vivian Marthell from showing the film.",
      "\u201cThe City of Miami Beach has one of the highest concentrations of Jewish residents in the United States,\u201d Meiner said in his letter to Marthell. \u201cThe \u2018No Other Land\u2019 film is a one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people that is not consistent with the values of our City and residents.\u201d",
      "Marthell initially agreed not to screen the movie in a response to Meiner, but the showing went on as scheduled.",
      "\u201cMy initial reaction to Mayor Meiner\u2019s threats was made under duress,\u201d Marthell said in a email Thursday. \u201cAfter reflecting on the broader implications for free speech and O Cinema\u2019s mission, I (along with the O Cinema board and staff members) agreed it was critical to screen this acclaimed film.\u201d",
      "O Cinema has always been committed to sharing films that not only entertain, but also challenge, educate and inspire meaningful dialogue, Marthell said.",
      "\u201cWe understand the power of cinema to tell stories that matter, and we recognize that some stories \u2014 especially those rooted in real-world conflicts \u2014 can evoke strong feelings and passionate reactions. As they should,\u201d Marthell said. \u201cOur decision to screen \u2018No Other Land\u2019 is not a declaration of political alignment. It is a bold reaffirmation of our fundamental belief that every voice deserves to be heard.\u201d",
      "In December and January, the city of Miami Beach executed two grants worth about $80,000 for O Cinema, according to the mayor's proposed resolution. About half the money has already been paid, but the resolution would stop the rest. The city began leasing space to O Cinema in 2019 with the ability to terminate the contract with 180 days of notice, which is what Meiner is seeking to do.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d which was shot between 2019 and 2023 and released last year, was directed by a group of Israeli and Palestinian filmmakers: Basel Adra, Hamdan Ballal, Yuval Abraham and Rachel Szor.",
      "\u201cWhen the mayor uses the word antisemitism to silence Palestinians and Israelis who proudly oppose occupation and apartheid together, fighting for justice and equality, he is emptying it out of meaning,\u201d Abraham said in an email. \u201cI find that to be very dangerous.\u201d",
      "The film documents the destruction of Palestinian villages in the West Bank by the Israeli military. It won the Academy Award for best documentary feature as well as earlier awards.",
      "While the film has earned wide praise from film critics, it has also drawn controversy.",
      "\u201cFreedom of expression is an important value, but defamation of Israel into a tool for international promotion is not art,\u201d Israeli culture minister Miki Zohar said in a social media post."

      "A beloved reindeer in Alaska's biggest city is fighting for his life after falling mysteriously falling ill after someone tampered with his pen",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- An iconic reindeer so beloved that he has been in parades, featured on reality TV shows and visited by schoolchildren on field trips in Alaska's largest city is fighting for his life after mysteriously falling ill after someone tampered with his pen.",
      "Ever since, 8-year-old Star has had pneumonia, digestion issues and rapid weight loss. Star's owner, Albert Whitehead, has taken him to a veterinarian every other day to receive care and in hopes of finding a cause for the issues.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve done everything possible for him,\u201d Whitehead said. Veterinarian Sabrieta Holland said she the reindeer's prognosis is \u201cguarded.\u201d",
      "Star lives in a fenced-in pen attached to Whitehead\u2019s house at the edge of downtown Anchorage. It\u2019s been over 20 years since someone last tried to tamper with the enclosure where reindeer named Star have been kept for the last seven decades. Star is the seventh in a line of reindeer to carry that name.",
      "In early January, someone cut a huge hole in the fencing to gain entrance, spending about five minutes inside with Star before taking off. What the person did in the pen is unknown, but Star began having stomach issues and dropping weight shortly after.",
      "Then, on Feb. 20, Anchorage police found the friendly and trusting reindeer wandering around downtown and returned him home.",
      "When Whitehead reviewed his security cameras, he found someone had used bolt cutters to remove padlocks off Star\u2019s pen and an alley gate. Star followed the man out into the neighborhood, and the reindeer wound up alone downtown, familiar streets because that's where Whitehead walks him.",
      "The next night, the situation turned more serious.",
      "Whitehead was watching the video feed when a man wearing a scarf over his face sprayed something from two different cans into Star\u2019s pen and twice hit the reindeer in the face with an unknown substance.",
      "Whitehead rushed outside to confront the man.",
      "\u201cI yelled at him to stop, \u2018What the hell are you doing? What are you spraying on the animal? Don\u2019t do that, quit that!\u2019\u201d Whitehead said.",
      "The man replied: \u201cI\u2019m trying to help Star.\"",
      "\u201cI have no idea what he meant by that,\u201d said Whitehead, who suspects \u2014 based on the smells \u2014 that the sprays could have been a disinfectant and deodorizer.",
      "Whitehead and police believe it was the same man from the prior night. It\u2019s not known if the January tampering involved the same person.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the individual wanted to harm Star, but by his actions, he did,\u201d Whitehead said.",
      "Anchorage police posted the surveillance video on social media in hopes it would lead to the suspect\u2019s identity. So far, no viable tips have come in, spokesperson Christopher Barraza said in an email.",
      "Star's pneumonia worsened, and a cough leads Whitehead to believe Star ate something harmful, perhaps while loose.",
      "The pneumonia is likely due to him accidentally inhaling the chronic reflux or regurgitation of the contents in the largest of the reindeers\u2019 four stomachs, Holland said. The sprays possibly also contributed.",
      "It\u2019s possible there\u2019s a blockage, but the largest stomach of a reindeer is quite big and not easily obstructed, Holland said. However, ingested plastic bags causing chronic weight loss and indigestion problems are the most common foreign objects she's seen in reindeer.",
      "The next option would be surgery to look at the reindeer's abdomen and possibly remove any blockage, but it\u2019s generally a poor outcome, even in healthy deer, she said.",
      "The bond between Whitehead and Star is \u201cquite significant and precious,\" Holland said.",
      "\"Albert\u2019s daily life and reason for getting out for walks and such all are because of Star. And Star is really fond of Albert, too,\u201d Holland said in a text. \u201cIt will be quite devastating for him if he loses Star.\u201d",
      "Anchorage pioneers Oro and Ivan Stewart started the reindeer tradition, bringing the deer they received from an Alaska Native herder to Anchorage in the 1950s. Whitehead took over as caretaker from his friends in 2002.",
      "The average lifespan of a reindeer is about 15 years, but some Stars had long lives, like the first who lived to 23. Others didn't live as long, including the second Star, who was stolen, beaten to death and then butchered by a known Fairbanks meat thief. The third Star died after eating a plastic bag."

      "Holmes was first to the finish line in the Gold Rush town of Nome, on the Bering Sea coast. The race began March 3 in Fairbanks after a lack of snow forced changes to the route and starting point.",
      "That made the normally 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer) race a staggering 1,129 miles (1,817 kilometers) across the Alaska wilderness. Holmes finished in 10 days, 14 hours, 55 minutes and 41 seconds.",
      "Holmes, who was competing for the eighth time, previously finished in the top 10 five times, including third last year and in 2022. In his first Iditarod, in 2018, his seventh-place finish earned him Rookie of the Year honors.",
      "Born and raised in Alabama, Holmes left at age 18 and worked as a carpenter in Montana for three years. He arrived in Alaska in 2004 and found adventure running dogs on a remote location of the Yukon River.",
      "Holmes now lives in Nenana, where he works as a carpenter and lives a subsistence lifestyle. From 2015 through 2023, he was a cast member of \u201cLife Below Zero,\u201d a National Geographic program that documents the struggles of Alaskans living in remote parts of the state.",
      "Besides the lack of snow north of the Alaska Range that forced the change of starting point to Fairbanks, race organizers also had to make changes to the ceremonial start in Anchorage.",
      "With snow trucked in to cover streets in the state\u2019s largest city, the usual parade route there was shortened from 11 miles to under 2 miles (from about 18 kilometers to under 3.2 kilometers), and the number of dogs was reduced.",
      "Only 33 mushers started in Fairbanks, tied with 2023 for the smallest field ever. The drop in participants has raised concerns about the viability of the race, which has had to contend with inflation, climate change and pressure from animal rights groups.",
      "One dog died in this year\u2019s Iditarod: a pregnant female on the team of musher Daniel Klein, who under race rules scratched due to the death.",
      "Nearly a third of the mushers quit early, including eight who scratched and two who were withdrawn for not being competitive."

      "Authorities last week announced Hackman died at age 95 of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease as much as a week after a rare, rodent-borne disease \u2014 hantavirus pulmonary syndrome \u2014 took the life of his 65-year-old wife.",
      "Hackman\u2019s pacemaker last showed signs of activity on Feb. 18, indicating an abnormal heart rhythm on the day he likely died. The couple's bodies weren't discovered until Feb. 26 when maintenance and security workers showed up at the Santa Fe home and alerted police, leaving a mystery for law enforcement and medical investigators to unravel.",
      "Julia Peters, a representative for the estate of Hackman and Arakawa, urged a state district court in Santa Fe to seal records in the cases to protect the family's right to privacy in grief under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, emphasizing the possibly shocking nature of photographs and video in the investigation and potential for their dissemination by media.",
      "The request, filed Tuesday, also described the couple's discrete lifestyle in Santa Fe since Hackman's retirement. The state capital city is known as a refuge for celebrities, artists and authors.",
      "The couple \"lived an exemplary private life for over thirty years in Santa Fe, New Mexico and did not showcase their lifestyle,\u201d the petition said.",
      "New Mexico's open records law blocks public access to sensitive images, including depictions of people who are deceased, said Amanda Lavin, legal director at the nonprofit New Mexico Foundation for Open Government. Some medical information also is not considered public record under the state Inspection of Public Records Act.",
      "At the same time, the bulk of death investigations by law enforcement and autopsy reports by medical investigators are typically considered public records under state law in the spirit of ensuring government transparency and accountability, she said.",
      "\u201cI do think it does infringe on transparency if the court were to prohibit release of all the investigation records, including the autopsies,\u201d Lavin said Thursday. \u201cThe whole idea of those records being available is to ensure accountability in the way those investigations are done.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is also a public health concern given that hantavirus was involved,\u201d Lavin said.",
      "She said the preemptive request to prevent the release of government records on constitutional grounds is unusual.",
      "Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d \u201cHoosiers\u201d and \u201cSuperman\u201d from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s.",

      "It's been more than 50 years since Goines and his common-law wife, Shirley Sailor, were found shot to death on Oct. 21, 1974 in their flat in Highland Park, a small enclave of Detroit. Each had been shot five times. Their two young children were home at the time of the killings.",
      "Goines was 37.",
      "No arrests were made and rumors swelled. Some speculated the killings had something to do with Goines' heroin addiction. Others nodded to the theory that the fictional subjects of his novels appeared a bit too much like the real-life hustlers, pimps, drug dealers and stickup men who prowled the city's streets.",
      "\u201cThere have been at least a half-dozen, quite possibly a dozen, elements of speculation as to how Mr. Goines and the mother of his children were murdered,\u201d said Bill Proctor, a private investigator hired to find the killer or killers. \u201cBut no one has come forward with enough information to charge the persons responsible.\u201d",
      "Proctor said a $5,000 reward being offered by the producers of the documentary might help \u201cshake the trees\u201d and find \u201csomeone who might still be alive or have an understanding\u201d of the facts of the case.",
      "Goines wrote 16 books over a span of several short years. His raw, stark and undiluted writings are filled with the urban street life imagery of the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
      "\u201cDopefiend,\u201d was published in 1971. Fifteen more including \u201cStreet Players,\u201d \u201cDaddy Cool\u201d and \u201cKenyatta's Last Hit,\u201d would follow over the next three years. The titles and the content resonated with many Black readers, especially in Detroit where Goines' books often held prominence on living room coffee tables and bookshelves.",
      "\u201cWhen I read his books, I can visualize \u2014 I can picture what he\u2019s writing about,\u201d said his daughter, Donna Sailor. \u201cHe was so descriptive about what he wrote. That\u2019s kind of like how it was back then.\u201d",
      "Donna Sailor was 2 when her parents were killed. She doesn\u2019t remember anything about the shooting or her parents.",
      "\u201cWe would see friends of the family that knew my dad and my mom,\u201d Sailor, 52, told The Associated Press Thursday. \u201cThey would say she was a sweetheart, and she was funny and had a great smile.\u201d",
      "Less information about Goines was volunteered, though, she added.",
      "\u201cNo one ever went into great detail about him. They would say he was a nice guy,\u201d said Sailor.",
      "The urban lit genre dates back at least to 1967, and the release of the memoir \u201cPimp,\u201d written by Robert Maupin, who also was in jail when he began writing under the name Iceberg Slim. Maupin built a large word-of-mouth following and one of his readers was Goines. Generations later, hip-hop stars like Tupac Shakur were also inspired by the books and have referenced Goines and Iceberg Slim in their recordings. Shakur even once declared: \u201cMachiavelli was my tutor, Donald Goines my father figure.\u201d",
      "Goines' parents owned a clothes-cleaning and other businesses in Detroit and were part of the city's Black middle class. He enlisted in the Air Force and spent time in Korea and Japan during the Korean War. It was there Goines became addicted to heroin, according to various reports on his life.",
      "After his time in the military, Goines returned to Detroit in the mid-1950s. He drifted into the city's criminal underbelly, finding himself jailed for various crimes.",
      "Holloway House published Goines' novels from 1971 to 2008, according to current publisher Kensington.",
      "Under Kensington, Goines books have sold about 500,000 copies in print, alone. He consistently is one of Kensington's top reordered authors and his books have been \u201cselling at a stronger pace\u201d since it launched a reissue program in 2020, according to the company.",
      "Robert (Tape) Bailey and Craig Gore are the driving forces behind the documentary which is expected to be released by the end of the year. Both read Goines\u2019 books while incarcerated, separately.",
      "Bailey, 49, was born in Detroit and now lives in Los Angeles. He spent time in federal prison as young man for possession with intent to deliver drugs in Ohio.",
      "Goines wrote in detail about things he had witnessed firsthand, Bailey said.",
      "Gore, 51, of Los Angeles, stumbled onto Goines while serving time for burglary and theft. He says that through the $5,000 reward, they hope to bring more accuracy to the documentary.",
      "\u201cWe might find nothing. We might solve the murder,\u201d he said."

      "Since breaking out as rapper Paper Boi in the FX series \u201cAtlanta,\u201d Brian Tyree Henry's become one of the busiest actors in Hollywood",
      "If you ask Brian Tyree Henry about taking time off, he bursts out laughing.",
      "Since breaking out as rapper Paper Boi in the FX series \u201cAtlanta,\u201d he's become one of the busiest actors in Hollywood. He's worked consistently \u2014 with directors including Barry Jenkins, Steve McQueen and Chloe Zhao and big-name actors like Brad Pitt, Jennifer Lawrence, Chris Hemsworth and Melissa McCarthy. Henry's been nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards, a Tony Award and an Oscar.",
      "His latest role is in the limited series \u201cDope Thief\" for Apple TV+ premiering Friday. Henry and Wagner Moura play Ray and Manny, two longtime friends in Philadelphia who pose as federal agents, conducting fake raids to steal drugs and money. It's a series of easy scores until they rob the wrong people and become targets themselves. Soon they're hiding out from the real DEA and a drug kingpin while trying to keep their family safe.",
      "\u201cThe minute that Wagner and I met each other, it was an instant electricity... We just felt like we knew each other all our lives,\" said Henry. \"That is exactly what you needed for Ray and Manny.\u201d",
      "The first episode was directed by Ridley Scott, and the series was created and written by Peter Craig, adapted from a novel by Dennis Tafoya.",
      "Craig describes Henry's versatility as an actor as \"like a jazz musician... It\u2019s fantastic for a writer, because you can throw him all kinds of added moments, and he\u2019ll incorporate and use them all.\u201d",
      "When the opportunity to star in \u201cDope Thief\u201d came about, Henry was ready for that long-awaited break \u2014 from TV. He wrapped \u201cAtlanta\u201d and had \u201cabout two days off\u201d before going into another FX show, \u201cClass of \u201809,\u201d where he played a character\u2019s past, present and future, and he was exhausted.",
      "\u201cTelevision is hard, you know? Like, I hear myself complaining about it; I know it\u2019s a first world problem, but you get very attached when you\u2019re doing a series. You're living with the character for quite a long time.\"",
      "So, there Henry was at 3 a.m. on a night shoot of \u201cClass of \u201809,\" wearing prosthetics as his character\u2019s future self, when his manager presented him with the script for \u201cDope Thief.\u201d \u201cWithin the first 10 pages I was incredibly attracted to Ray and also the bond he has with Manny.\u201d",
      "Time off otherwise really hasn't been his thing (hence the laughter), but Henry is quick to remind that he\u2019s had two long breaks from acting. One was during the lockdown phase of the pandemic, and the other was during the Hollywood strikes.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re a person that\u2019s constantly on the move and the universe tells you to sit your (expletive) down, you kind of have to listen,\u201d said Henry. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have stopped had the universe not said stop.\u201d",
      "Production was underway on \u201cDope Thief\u201d when the Hollywood guild strikes were called in 2023. Henry opted to stay in Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t go anywhere. I made sure to be there just in case,\" said Henry, who for the first time was an executive producer on the project. He wanted to be close in proximity to his local crew. They had a cookout with bouncy castles. \u201cI would explore, or we'd go tubing and I would drive to this little town called New Hope that has a wonderful ice cream shop called Moo Hope. It was truly amazing to be present and experience that part of life for myself.\u201d",
      "Henry doesn't just bond with the crew on his sets but actors too, often walking away with new friends who happen to be very famous, like, say, Julia Roberts \u2014 whom he's currently filming a movie with in London. \u201cShe's somebody I truly cherish,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never going to stop being weird to me,\" Henry admits. \u201cThe part that is really hard for me \u2014 that I\u2019m still fighting with \u2014 is when they tell me they\u2019re fans of my stuff and I\u2019m just like, \u2018Shut up!\u2019 I literally say it to their face.\u201d",
      "The biggest revelation about working alongside these accomplished actors is that Henry is now one of them.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, now, these are my peers, these are my contemporaries, and I can\u2019t continue to act like they\u2019re not. I can\u2019t continue to act like I have to shrink myself to fit in these spaces. I no longer have to do that. And what I also love is that they\u2019ll reaffirm that for me, too ... and that's the great part.\u201d"

      "Harvey Weinstein\u2019s #MeToo retrial next month will largely be an abridged version of the original, with one big addition: a charge based on an allegation from a woman who wasn\u2019t a part of the first case",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein 's #MeToo retrial next month will largely be an abridged version of the original, with one big addition: a charge based on an allegation from a woman who was not a part of the first case.",
      "But at a key pretrial hearing Wednesday, the disgraced movie mogul\u2019s lawyers cautioned that because Weinstein\u2019s 2020 rape and sexual assault conviction was overturned, the past isn't prologue \u2014 it's almost entirely irrelevant.",
      "\u201cWe can take that transcript and all the judge\u2019s rulings and throw them in the garbage,\" Weinstein\u2019s lawyer, Arthur Aidala, argued. \u201cThat trial was declared illegal by the highest court in this state.\"",
      "New York\u2019s Court of Appeals threw out Weinstein\u2019s conviction last year, setting the stage for a retrial starting April 15 in state court in Manhattan. Prosecutors say it could take about five weeks.",
      "How the retrial will play out began to take shape Wednesday as Judge Curtis Farber ruled on a number of outstanding issues, including expert testimony and the language used to describe the accusers.",
      "Farber granted a prosecution request to call a psychologist, Dawn Hughes, as an expert witness on the psychological and traumatic effects of rape and sexual assault. Hughes previously testified for actor Amber Heard at Johnny Depp\u2019s libel trial against Heard in 2022 and as a prosecution witness in singer R. Kelly\u2019s federal sex trafficking trial in Brooklyn in 2021.",
      "The judge also granted a defense request to preclude the term \u201csurvivor\u201d from being used to describe Weinstein\u2019s accusers. He told prosecutors to instruct any police officers who testify to refer to the women as \u201ccomplaining witnesses\" instead.",
      "While Weinstein\u2019s convictions from the first trial were thrown out, his acquittals on the most serious charges \u2014 two counts of predatory sexual assault and first-degree, or forcible, rape \u2014 still stand.",
      "Given that, Farber ordered prosecutors to instruct one of the accusers testifying at the retrial not to used the word \u201cforce\u201d when describing her alleged assault.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney's office had wanted to exclude any mention of Weinstein\u2019s acquittals and vacated conviction, but Farber said he could be obligated to clue them in depending on how the accuser testifies.",
      "\u201cDoes she have to use the word force? She can describe what happened and let the jury draw its own conclusions?\u201d the judge asked. \u201cI am not asking her to change her testimony from the first trial. I am asking her to refrain from using the word force.\"",
      "Other decisions were made behind closed doors as Farber met with the prosecution and defense for more than an hour in his chambers to discuss matters still under seal.",
      "They included a prosecution request that two of the three accusers in the case be allowed to testify about other alleged encounters with Weinstein. They also discussed evidence of the accusers' sexual history, which prosecutors say should be barred under New York's Rape Shield Law.",
      "Weinstein, 72, was in court for Wednesday\u2019s proceedings, arriving from jail in a wheelchair and suit and holding a stack of documents. Before the public portion of his hearing began, the ex-studio boss watched as Farber spent a few minutes resolving another matter that had been delayed by their closed-door discussions.",
      "At his last court appearance in January, Weinstein had implored Farber to start the retrial sooner.",
      "He told the judge \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer I can hold on\u201d with cancer, heart issues and harsh conditions at New York City\u2019s Rikers Island jail complex, where he is locked up. Farber said he may hold jury selection a few days sooner if a murder trial he's overseeing wraps up ahead of schedule.",
      "Weinstein is being retried on charges that he forcibly performed oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006 and raped an aspiring actor in 2013. The additional charge, filed last September, alleges he forced oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006.",
      "Prosecutors said in court papers that the woman, who has not been identified publicly, came forward to them just days before the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial but was not part of that case. They said they did not pursue the women\u2019s allegations after Weinstein was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison, but they revisited them and secured a new indictment after his conviction was thrown out.",
      "Farber ruled in October to combine the new indictment and existing charges into one trial.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers contend that prosecutors prejudiced him by waiting nearly five years to bring the additional charge, suggesting they had elected not to include the allegation in his first trial so they could use it later if his conviction were reversed.",
      "Weinstein has denied that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone.",
      "In vacating Weinstein\u2019s conviction, the Court of Appeals ruled that the trial judge, James M. Burke, unfairly allowed testimony against him based on allegations from other women that were not part of the case. Burke is no longer on the bench and such testimony won't be part of the retrial.",
      "Weinstein was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape. His 16-year prison sentence in that case still stands, but his lawyers appealed in June, arguing he did not get a fair trial.",

      "If an algorithm designed a classic, big-screen spectacle for the small-screen age, \u201cThe Electric State\u201d probably wouldn\u2019t be too far off the mark.",
      "This is an Amblin-inspired, big-budget adventure with dystopian, science-fiction wonder, nostalgic callbacks, well-liked stars (Chris Pratt! Millie Bobby Brown! Stanley Tucci! Giancarlo Esposito! Ke Huy Quan!) and the directors ( Joe and Anthony Russo ) behind some of the highest-earning movies of all time.",
      "In theory, it should work. A kid on a dangerous, cross-country journey with a robot that may or may not be her brother whom she thought was dead? A reluctant, jaded adult companion who\u2019s quick with a one-liner? \u201cThe Electric State\u201d should be some future Spielberg\u2019s new favorite movie, the one that they\u2019ll reference in their Oscars speech as the thing that made them want to make movies. And yet it\u2019s lacking a spark and a soul that might distinguish it as memorable or special. Worse, considering everything it has going for it (including a reported budget that may have exceeded $300 million), \u201cThe Electric State\u201d is kind of dull.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State\u201d was loosely based on an illustrated novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag that was released in 2018 and quickly scooped up for movie adaptation purposes with Marvel veterans Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely writing the script. Set in the early 1990s, this is a world in which service robots have risen up and demanded rights and freedom. The humans respond by going to war.",
      "This four-year war is skimmed over in a montage at the start of the film and, by 1994, Mr. Peanut (Woody Harrelson) is signing a peace treaty with Bill Clinton and the remaining robots are exiled to rot in the desert. The human victory was attributed to the drone creations of a Steve Jobs-ian tech billionaire Ethan Skate (Tucci), who is soon hawking his \u201cNeurocasters\u201d to the public. They scoop it up and soon society is just a bleak wasteland of screen zombies content to let their avatars work while they relax and fantasize a way out of their downtrodden existence.",
      "There are shades of \u201cThe Creator,\u201d \u201cWALL-E,\u201d \u201cReady Player One\u201d and many, many more films in here. But no one gets mad that something is derivative if it\u2019s also good. It\u2019s only when the kitchen sink references are so clear and come up so short that it becomes a real problem.",
      "Brown plays Michelle, an angry, orphaned teenager who lost her entire family not in the war, but in a car wreck. The one she misses the most is her little brother Christopher (Woody Norman, giving the best, most emotionally authentic performance in the film), a reluctant child prodigy. One day, a robot of a cartoon character they used to watch together turns up at her foster home, speaking only in the character\u2019s catchphrases. But after some gestures toward a photograph, she starts to believe that this robot is, somehow, Christopher, or at least someone who can lead her to the real Christopher. And thus starts their journey across America, and into the robot \u201cexclusion zone\u201d to figure out this puzzle. They soon team up with a war veteran/smuggler Keats (Pratt) and his snarky robot sidekick (Anthony Mackie, for your Marvel bingo card) and try to evade Esposito\u2019s robot bounty hunter.",
      "The robots they find in the exclusion zone are voiced by an army of celebrities you\u2019ll go insane trying to place before angrily resorting to IMDb, including Harrelson, Hank Azaria, Brian Cox and Jenny Slate. Their designs are thoughtful and remarkable and should evoke a sense of awe in the viewer at the sheer ingenuity behind this film, where many of the most impressive shots seem to be the recreations of St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s illustrations of dismantled, decaying robots. The action, however, gets mind-numbingly repetitive by the end of the bloated runtime.",
      "Pratt and Brown, while fine individually, don\u2019t really find their groove as partners on this journey either. Pratt is kind of just doing his thing and gets the few clever one-liners in the script. Brown, meanwhile, seems a little bored by yet another teen adventure role. And both ultimately look like movie stars in '90s cosplay, which might be a metaphor for the larger failure of the movie.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State\u201d was, of course, not made by algorithm, which is an admittedly cheap shot for a Netflix original. Unfortunately, it just feels that way.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State,\u201d a Netflix release streaming Friday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csci-fi violence/action, language and some thematic material.\u201d Running time: 128 minutes. One and a half stars out of four."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's team is looking at locations for a post-administration presidential library, and Florida may take that spot",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President Donald Trump's team is already looking for locations for his presidential library, and Florida may be a top contender.",
      "A Florida legislator said Monday that the state has a \u201chigh likelihood\u201d of getting its first presidential library.",
      "Presidential libraries are significant for post-administration historical archives depicting materials from a former president's term. They require years of planning and don't use federal funding.",
      "Here are a few things to know about a potential Trump presidential library:",
      "The state Senate Rules Committee on Wednesday unanimously backed Sen. Jason Brodeur's bill that he said would \u201cprevent any municipality or county from imposing frivolous obstacles to the establishment of a presidential library within the state.\u201d",
      "Brodeur said other states that built presidential libraries had construction roadmaps created to follow state and local laws, and Florida would need the same. He also said all former presidents are welcome to put a presidential library in Florida, not just Trump.",
      "\u201cI anticipate that this will be a pretty popular attraction. It is somebody who\u2019s likely even the most famous developer in the world right now,\u201d he said.",
      "Brodeur's bill comes as Trump's team is looking at several South Florida universities \u2014 including Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University \u2014 as potential spots for a presidential library.",
      "A secretary at the FAU president\u2019s office said she had not heard of any plans for a presidential library and declined to comment further. Spokespeople for FAU and FIU, and the White House press office didn't immediately respond to messages about possible plans for a presidential library.",
      "Traditionally, such libraries are built in the state where a president was born or grew up. Trump, though, was born in New York, which voted against him in three straight presidential elections and which made him the first former president to be convicted of felonies last year.",
      "Trump now primarily lives in Florida, and he's filled his administration's ranks with politicians and others from the Sunshine State.",
      "Democrats raised concerns in committee hearings about whether local residents would bear the costs of the library's construction. Brodeur said all costs of building the library, including the planning costs, would fall to the president and library archives.",
      "In December, ABC News agreed to pay $15 million toward a Trump presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit. In the agreement, ABC News described the payment as a \u201ccharitable contribution\u201d to an escrow account being managed by Trump's attorney.",
      "That's would amount to a small fraction of the overall cost of building the library. For example, former President Barack Obama\u2019s library in Chicago was estimated to cost $830 million as of 2021.",
      "Little is known about what would be in a Trump presidential library, but materials in these libraries usually include documents, artifacts or items significant to a president\u2019s administration.",
      "Earlier this month the Justice Department returned the boxes coming from the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago home in 2022 for classified documents. Trump said in a Truth Social post that these boxes were being sent to Florida, where they \u201cwill someday be part of the Trump Presidential Library.\u201d"

      "There's a crackling patter to \u201cBlack Bag\u201d \u2014 Steven Soderbergh\u2019s marital drama cloaked as a sleek spy thriller",
      "If you\u2019re hosting a dinner for half a dozen British intelligence agents with the aim of ferreting out a mole, what should you cook?",
      "For George Woodhouse (Michael Fassbender), who's preparing for four colleagues, plus himself and his wife, Kathryn St. Jean (Cate Blanchett), who, like him, is a high-level operative, it\u2019s chana masala with a few drops of truth serum.",
      "\u201cWill there be any mess to clean up?\u201d Kathryn asks her husband as they\u2019re getting ready.",
      "\u201cWith any luck,\u201d he responds.",
      "So goes much of the crackling patter of \u201cBlack Bag,\u201d Steven Soderbergh\u2019s delicious marital drama cloaked as a sleek spy thriller. Lean and taut, the 93-minute \u201cBlack Bag\u201d is more a sizzling amuse-bouche than full-course meal, but it\u2019s simmered to perfection.",
      "George and Kathryn, as fellow agents at London\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre, don\u2019t seemingly have what you might call a traditional marriage. Each has their own secret ops, leaving large swaths of their lives off limits to the other. When George asks where Kathryn is flying off to on Wednesday, she shrugs with a smile, \u201cBlack bag.\u201d",
      "In the movie\u2019s opening scene \u2013 a slinky tracking shot that trails George into and out of a nightclub \u2013 an agent named Meacham (Gustaf Skarsgard) gives him the assignment to track down the mole, with the added wrinkle that Kathryn can\u2019t be dismissed as a possible suspect. A cyber-worm device called Severus that\u2019s capable of hacking into nuclear facilities has gone missing. The fate of the world, as it so often is, is said to be at stake.",
      "But, really, the state of George and Kathryn\u2019s marriage is what interests us. Extreme though their situation is, their union is one that, like any couple, is built on trust and devotion, even if their professional lives demand the inverse. When George, lying on top of Kathryn tells her he\u2019d do anything for her, she coos, \u201cWould you kill?\u201d It's a fair-enough test to the bounds of wedded bliss, sure, but her second question matters even more. \u201cWould you lie?\u201d",
      "Over that dinner \u2013 a scintillating set piece around a darkened dinner table inside their London town house \u2013 we can quickly gather just how much the truth means to George. He\u2019s renown for his powers with a polygraph. As a youngster, he even brought down his own father, uncovering his affair. \u201cI don\u2019t like liars,\u201d George says through clenched teeth.",
      "They\u2019re joined by Colonel James Stokes (Reg\u00e9-Jean Page); the in-house psychologist Dr. Zoe Vaughan (Naomie Harris); the carousing spy Freddie Smalls (Tom Burke); and the newest NCSC recruit, cyber specialist Clarissa (Marisa Abela). Both are paired off in clandestine relationships that quickly emerge, among other secrets. More than state secrets, infidelity dominates the conversation.",
      "Fassbender\u2019s spook is an agent of precision. He wears gleaming black-framed glasses. When only a few drops of sauce land on his cuff, he immediately withdraws to change his shirt. Hard as it would seem, Fassbender has found a character almost as dispassionate and monotone as his methodical assassin in David Fincher\u2019s \u201cThe Killer.\u201d",
      "This time, though, he's not a loner. Blanchett\u2019s Kathryn is kept more at a remove from us. She\u2019s mysterious and aloof \u2013 a femme fatale, maybe, we\u2019re led to wonder. An \u201caroma of hostility\u201d accompanies her, Zoe tells her in a psych evaluation. Is she the mole?",
      "This is an insular film, taking place mainly in crisply composed interiors, aside from the lake George occasionally fishes for bass in. There, in a fitting encapsulation of a movie full of smooth surfaces with currents twisting underneath, the camera gently rests on the water's surface.",
      "\u201cBlack Bag\u201d follows a run of agilely directed thrillers by Soderbergh made with screenwriter David Koepp ( \u201cPresence,\u201d \u201cKimi\u201d). They are both at the height of their almost-too-easy powers; the script, especially, is peppered with delectable dialogue. Their movie adopts the air of menace and suspicion of a John Le Carr\u00e9 novel, yet hinges on the sturdiness of its married couple, like a super spy version of Nick and Nora from \u201cThe Thin Man\" or a more cerebral \u201cMr. & Mrs. Smith.\u201d",
      "All of the supporting players \u2013 while they make up a fine ensemble \u2013 are ultimately playthings in their game of love. In a casting coup, a former James Bond \u2013 Pierce Brosnan \u2013 drops in late in the film as Arthur Stheiglitz, the head of NCSC. In his handful of scenes, Brosnan is rageful and ferocious, chomping into both Ikizukuri (prepared live fish) and the scenery.",
      "His presence both enlivens a movie already humming with the uber-cool chemistry of Blanchett and Fassbender while transforming \u201cBlack Bag\u201d into a twisty rejoinder to that notoriously skirt-chasing spy. Here, Mr. Bond, is how sexy monogamy can be.",
      "While directing a satellite to peer down upon his wife on some unknown mission in Europe, George explains their mystifying dynamic to Clarissa: \u201cI watch her, and she watches me. If she gets into trouble, I will do everything in my power to extricate her.\u201d",
      "In her response, Clarissa speaks for everyone: \u201cThat\u2019s so hot.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlack Bag,\u201d a Focus Features release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language including some sexual references, and some violence. Running time: 93 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four."

      "The hero at the heart of \u201cNovocaine\u201d can't feel pain",
      "Nathan Caine may not be able to feel pain, as the tagline for the new action-comedy \u201cNovocaine\u201d reads, but the same does not apply to audiences.",
      "Although he doesn\u2019t scream when his leg is impaled with an arrow or when he sticks his hand in a vat of frying oil, you might. I certainly did. Out loud. In a theater. With other people. There may have been some phrases uttered entirely involuntarily too. Were other people reacting in the same way, I wonder? I couldn\u2019t hear them over my own groans. Hooray for the communal experience, I guess?",
      "This is, in some ways, a film for people who thought John Wick wasn\u2019t stabby enough. It delights in the relentless mutilation of its hero, a regular guy (played by Jack Quaid ) with a rare condition that has rendered him immune from feeling any sort of discomfort to bodily harm. Unlike such high concept premises as \u201cCrank,\u201d congenital insensitivity to pain analgesia (or CIPA) is actually real. But it\u2019s not exactly a superpower, Nate explains. He can still die; it just might be because he hasn\u2019t emptied his bladder in many hours. Or because he's accidentally bitten his tongue off eating a sandwich. These are real concerns of his.",
      "His entire existence is devoted to preventing these kinds of crises, mostly through tried-and-true baby proofing techniques like using tennis balls on sharp corners. Like Kelly Ripa before a show, he only consumes \u201cnon-chewing food.\u201d",
      "Work is stable and dull as an assistant manager at a bank. And dating is out of the question; He spends most of his free time playing online video games. Quaid, even with his two movie star parents, is somehow believable as this cautious introvert, though everything is played with a light touch and a wink. The movie, written by Lars Jacobson and directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, even begins with the mournful R.E.M. anthem \u201cEverybody Hurts.\u201d",
      "Then Nate\u2019s life is changed one day when a pretty teller at the bank, Sherry (Amber Midthunder), asks him out to lunch, then to drinks and even spends the night. The next morning, things get even crazier: Sherry is taken hostage after a violent robbery at the bank. These guys are capital B bad (led by fellow nepo spawn Ray Nicholson) killing both the bank manager the cops outside. So what does Nate do? He steals a cop car and attempts to save her himself.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d pleads an injured cop as Nate hesitates before apprehending the car. It\u2019s hard to argue with the cop: Why not just let the professionals handle it, understaffed though they may be over the Christmas holiday? It would be a rather short and pointless movie if he did just leave it to the cops, but the impetus for this quest is a stretch to say the least. The conceit is missing some extra justification of why he felt like he was the only one who could do it, especially once he actually talks to said cops (Betty Gabriel and Matt Walsh).",
      "Like many things in \u201cNovocaine,\u201d it simply exists to open more avenues for his torture. This involves a fight in a restaurant kitchen, a visit to a tattoo parlor to get more information on one of the robbers, and a stop by a booby-trapped house. The script is self-aware enough to throw in a \u201cHome Alone\u201d reference, though not before you\u2019ve made one in your head.",
      "On the heels of some bad action comedies like \u201cLove Hurts,\u201d \u201cNovocaine\u201d is pretty enjoyable. It might have been born in the same elevator pitch incubator (what if non-stop violence!), but it\u2019s executed with some style and understanding of comedic timing. In one clever sequence, Nate persuades his psychotic captor to torture him as slowly as possible, buying time until his friend gets there as he pretends to feel the pain. \u201cNovocaine\u201d also kind of overstays its welcome, stretching on too long with too many endings. Still, it\u2019s an easy, if not entirely painless, watch.",
      "\u201cNovocaine,\u201d a Paramount Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cstrong, bloody violence, language throughout, grisly images). Running time: 110 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."

      "Under the plans, the 20-time English champion said it would build next to its iconic Old Trafford ground, likely meaning it would not need to relocate during the construction process.",
      "\u201cOur current stadium has served us brilliantly for the past 115 years, but it has fallen behind the best arenas in world sport,\u201d part owner Jim Ratcliffe said. \u201cBy building next to the existing site, we will be able to preserve the essence of Old Trafford, while creating a truly state-of-the-art stadium that transforms the fan experience only footsteps from our historic home.\u201d",

      "The possibility of redeveloping Old Trafford, one of the most iconic stadiums in soccer, was considered but an entirely new construction was the preferred option.",
      "\u201cToday marks the start of an incredibly exciting journey to the delivery of what will be the world\u2019s greatest football stadium,\u201d Ratcliffe said.",
      "United wants the venue to be part of a wider project to regenerate the surrounding Old Trafford area, which it said would be worth 7.3 billion pounds ($9.4 billion) to the U.K. economy. The U.K. government has already voiced its support for the project, although the specifics of how it would be funded are not known.",
      "Wembley is currently the biggest stadium in the U.K., with a capacity of 90,000, and is home to England\u2019s national soccer team.",
      "Twickenham, which is home to the national rugby team, holds 82,500.",
      "Old Trafford is the country\u2019s biggest dedicated soccer stadium with a capacity of just over 74,000, but is dated in comparison to the likes of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London, which regularly hosts NFL games.",

      "The announcement came days after thousands of United fans marched in protest against the club's ownership in the face of cost cuts, ticket price rises and ongoing failure on the field.",
      "United is majority owned by the American Glazer family, which also owns the NFL\u2019s Tampa Bay Buccaneers.",
      "Upon investing, Ratcliffe vowed to return the once-dominant club back to the summit of European soccer after more than a decade since it last won the Premier League.",
      "But his first year in charge of soccer operations has been turbulent. United endured its worst-ever Premier League season last year and is on course to set a new low this term, with the team currently languishing in the bottom half of the standings.",

In addition to life-saving food, the funds were spent on HIV medications, vaccines, literacy programs and jobs creation, as well as services for 1 million refugees hosted by Ethiopia.",
      "Most of these programs have been stopped. The USAID staffers who oversaw them have been placed on administrative leave and told not to work, as they face the threat of termination. The U.S. Embassy didn't respond to questions.",

      "Now, aid workers say many programs to improve nutrition have halted. Projects to deliver medicines and vaccines have stopped. Dozens of camps for displaced people have had water sources cut off.",
      "\u201cThe impact has been huge,\u201d said Ashenafi Asmelash, executive director of Mums for Mums, which has had two USAID- funded programs terminated. One helped build long-term resilience among farmers. The other helped improve the nutrition of children and new mothers.",

      "Jean Kaseya, director-general of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or Africa CDC, told reporters that Friday\u2019s meeting with African health ministers will \u201cdiscuss recent developments in global health financing\u201d and where more sustainable funding might come from.",
      "Kaseya spoke of a \u201cnew era\u201d in health financing after U.S. aid cuts that have left health systems in Africa in disarray. The aid cuts, which affect governments and their partners in the non-governmental sector, have shut down or disrupted projects tackling diseases ranging from malaria to AIDS.",
      "Much of the funding to the Africa CDC and regional governments was lost with the Trump administration\u2019s decision to terminate most foreign aid contracts and cut $60 billion in overall U.S. assistance abroad. Many of the affected programs are in fragile countries that are highly reliant on U.S. aid to support health systems, nutrition programs and stave off starvation.",
      "Kaseya cited the immediate impact in Congo, which is the epicenter mpox outbreaks in Africa and where aid cuts and insecurity in the country\u2019s east have contributed to challenges in testing for the disease as well as securing enough vaccine doses.",
      "Aid cuts have impeded the collection and transportation of samples in Congo, Kaseya said.",
      "\u201cWe know this aid cut is a difficult moment for our countries, and it came overnight,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them were not prepared for this major aid cut.\u201d",
      "The U.S. aid cuts affecting the response to outbreaks of mpox, Ebola and other diseases are the latest in a trend of declining monetary support by international partners over the years, he warned.",

      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, will testify before the Senate Finance Committee on Friday morning",
      "WASHINGTON -- Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, will testify before the Senate Finance Committee on Friday morning.",
      "The 64-year-old was a respected heart surgeon who turned into a popular TV pitchman. Now he has his sights on overseeing health insurance for about 150 million Americans enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid or Affordable Care Act coverage.",
      "Republicans, who have coalesced around Trump's nominees for the health agencies, are likely to ask Oz about his plans for Medicare and Medicaid, including the Trump administration's focus on eliminating fraud from the $1 trillion programs.",
      "Democrats, meanwhile, will question Oz's tax filings, which they say show he has used a tax code loophole to underpay taxes by thousands of dollars on Medicare, the program he'll oversee. They will also grill Oz on any cuts he would make to the health insurance coverage as well as comments on his TV show supporting privatized Medicare.",
      "The U.S. Office of Government Ethics has done an \u201cextensive review\u201d of Oz's finances, spokesman Christopher Krepich said in a statement about Oz\u2019s taxes. He added that the office has indicated \u201cany potential conflicts have been resolved and he is in compliance with the law.\u201d",
      "Oz has hawked everything from supplements to private health insurance plans on his former TV series, \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\u201d which ran for 13 seasons and helped him amass a fortune.",
      "Oz\u2019s net worth is between $98 million and $332 million, according to an analysis of the disclosure, which lists asset values in ranges but does not give precise dollar figures. His most recent disclosure shows he also holds millions of dollars worth of shares in health insurance, fertility, pharmaceutical and vitamin companies. He has promised to divest from dozens of companies that would pose conflicts for him as the CMS administrator.",
      "In the job, he could wield significant power over most health companies operating in the U.S. because he can make decisions about who and what are covered by Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "Oz's hearing comes as the Trump administration seeks to finalize leadership posts for the nation\u2019s top health agencies. On Thursday, Senate committees voted to advance the nominations of Marty Makary, poised to lead the Food and Drug Administration, and Jay Bhattacharya, set to helm the National Institutes for Health, for a full Senate vote. The nomination of Dave Weldon to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was abruptly withdrawn Thursday.",
      "Those men have all leaned into Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 's call to \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d a controversial effort to redesign the nation's food supply, reject vaccine mandates and cast doubt on some long-established scientific research.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump Administration's quest to \u201cMake America Health Again\u201d is targeting ultraprocessed foods",
      "In the Trump administration\u2019s quest to \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d there may be no bigger target than ultraprocessed foods.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation\u2019s new health secretary, has cited \u201chighly chemically processed foods\u201d as a chief culprit behind an epidemic of chronic disease in the U.S., including ailments such as obesity, diabetes and autoimmune disorders.",
      "Such foods are \u201cpoisoning\u201d people, particularly children, Kennedy said during Senate confirmation hearings. He has vowed to work to remove such foods from federal programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.",
      "\u201cI will do everything in my power to put the health of Americans back on track,\u201d he told lawmakers.",
      "Key to that goal, however, could be making sure that consumers understand basic facts about ultraprocessed foods and the role they play in daily meals.",
      "From sugary cereals at breakfast to frozen pizzas at dinner, plus in-between snacks of potato chips, sodas and ice cream, ultraprocessed foods make up about 60% of the U.S. diet. For kids and teens, it\u2019s even higher \u2014 about two-thirds of what they eat.",
      "That\u2019s concerning because ultraprocessed foods have been linked to a host of negative health effects, from obesity and diabetes to heart disease, depression, dementia and more. One recent study suggested that eating these foods may raise the risk of early death.",
      "Nutrition science is tricky, though, and most research so far has found connections, not proof, regarding the health consequences of these foods.",
      "Food manufacturers argue that processing boosts food safety and supplies and offers a cheap, convenient way to provide a diverse and nutritious diet.",
      "Even if the science were clear, it\u2019s hard to know what practical advice to give when ultraprocessed foods account for what one study estimates is more than 70% of the U.S. food supply.",
      "The Associated Press asked several nutrition experts and here\u2019s what they said:",
      "Most foods are processed, whether it\u2019s by freezing, grinding, fermentation, pasteurization or other means. In 2009, Brazilian epidemiologist Carlos Monteiro and colleagues first proposed a system that classifies foods according to the amount of processing they undergo, not by nutrient content.",
      "At the top of the four-tier scale are foods created through industrial processes and with ingredients such as additives, colors and preservatives that you couldn\u2019t duplicate in a home kitchen, said Kevin Hall, a researcher who focuses on metabolism and diet at the National Institutes of Health.",
      "\u201cThese are most, but not all, of the packaged foods you see,\u201d Hall said.",
      "Such foods are often made to be both cheap and irresistibly delicious, said Dr. Neena Prasad, director of the Bloomberg Philanthropies\u2019 Food Policy Program.",
      "\u201cThey have just the right combination of sugar, salt and fat and you just can\u2019t stop eating them,\u201d Prasad said",
      "However, the level of processing alone doesn\u2019t determine whether a food is unhealthy or not, Hall noted. Whole-grain bread, yogurt, tofu and infant formula are all highly processed, for instance, but they\u2019re also nutritious.",
      "Here\u2019s the tricky part. Many studies suggest that diets high in such foods are linked to negative health outcomes. But these kinds of studies can\u2019t say whether the foods themselves are the cause of the negative effects \u2014 or whether there\u2019s something else about the people who eat these foods that might be responsible.",
      "Ultraprocessed foods, as a group, tend to have higher amounts of sodium, saturated fat and sugar, and tend to be lower in fiber and protein. It\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019s just these nutrients that are driving the effects.",
      "Hall and his colleagues were the first to conduct a small but influential experiment that directly compared the results of eating similar diets made of ultraprocessed versus unprocessed foods.",
      "Published in 2019, the research included 20 adults who went to live at an NIH center for a month. They received diets of ultraprocessed and unprocessed foods matched for calories, sugar, fat, fiber and macronutrients for two weeks each and were told to eat as much as they liked.",
      "When participants ate the diet of ultraprocessed foods, they consumed about 500 calories per day more than when they ate unprocessed foods, researchers found \u2014 and they gained an average of about 2 pounds (1 kilogram) during the study period. When they ate only unprocessed foods for the same amount of time, they lost about 2 pounds (1 kilogram).",
      "Hall is conducting a more detailed study now, but the process is slow and costly and results aren\u2019t expected until late next year. He and others argue that such definitive research is needed to determine exactly how ultraprocessed foods affect consumption.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s better to understand the mechanisms by which they drive the deleterious health consequences, if they\u2019re driving them,\u201d he said.",
      "Some advocates, like Prasad, argue that the large body of research linking ultraprocessed foods to poor health should be more than enough to spur government and industry to change policies. She calls for actions such as increased taxes on sugary drinks, stricter sodium restrictions for manufacturers and cracking down on marketing of such foods to children.",
      "\u201cDo we want to risk our kids getting sicker while we wait for this perfect evidence to emerge?\u201d Prasad said.",
      "Last year, former FDA Commissioner Robert Califf broached the subject, telling a conference of food policy experts that ultraprocessed foods are \u201cone of the most complex things I\u2019ve ever dealt with.\u201d",
      "But, he concluded, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have the scientific basis and then we\u2019ve got to follow through.\u201d",
      "In countries like the U.S., it\u2019s hard to avoid highly processed foods \u2014 and it's not clear which ones should be targeted, said Aviva Musicus, science director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which advocates for food policies.",
      "\u201cThe range of ultraprocessed foods is just so wide,\u201d she said.",
      "Instead, it\u2019s better to be mindful of the ingredients in foods. Check the labels and make choices that align with the current dietary guidelines, she suggested.",
      "\u201cWe have really good evidence that added sugar is not great for us. We have evidence that high-sodium foods are not great for us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have great evidence that fruits and vegetables which are minimally processed are really good for us.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s important not to vilify certain foods, she added. Many consumers don\u2019t have the time or money to cook most meals from scratch.",
      "\u201cFoods should be joyous and delicious and shouldn\u2019t involve moral judgment,\u201d Musicus said.",

      "More air quality monitors are being set up to counter the issue, the report said. This year, report authors were able to incorporate data from 8,954 new locations and around a thousand new monitors as a result of efforts to better monitor air pollution.",
      "But last week, data monitoring for air pollution was dealt a blow when the U.S. State Department announced it would no longer make public its data from its embassies and consulates around the world.",
      "Breathing in polluted air over a long period of time can cause respiratory illness, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cancer, said Fatimah Ahamad, chief scientist and air pollution expert at Malaysia-based Sunway Centre for Planetary Health. The World Health Organization estimates that air pollution kills around 7 million people each year.",
      "Ahamad said much more needs to be done to cut air pollution levels. The WHO had earlier found that 99% of the world\u2019s population lives in places that do not meet recommended air quality levels.",

      "NEW YORK -- Dr. David Weldon had been out of the national spotlight for more than 15 years when he was nominated to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But many anti-vaccine advocates knew him well.",
      "\u201cHe is one of us!! Since before our movement had momentum,\u201d the co-director of Mississippi Parents for Vaccine Rights wrote on Facebook. And on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Autism Action Network credited the former congressman with introducing legislation two decades ago \u201cto stop the vaccine pedocide.\u201d",
      "Weldon, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, needs to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate before he can lead the nation\u2019s top public health agency. His confirmation hearing is to be held Thursday.",
      "The 71-year-old retired Florida congressman is considered to be closely aligned with his presumptive boss, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary who for years has been one of the nation's leading anti-vaccine activists.",
      "Department of Health and Human Services officials declined to make Weldon or Kennedy available for an Associated Press interview.",
      "When he made the nomination announcement, Trump said Weldon \u201cwill proudly restore the CDC to its true purpose, and will work to end the Chronic Disease Epidemic, and Make America Healthy Again!\u201d",
      "The CDC was created nearly 80 years ago to prevent the spread of malaria in the U.S. Its mission was later expanded, and it gradually became a global leader on infectious and chronic diseases and a go-to source of health information.",
      "Today, the Atlanta-based agency has a more than $9 billion core budget. It had about 13,000 employees when Trump took office, but more than 500 were fired as part of a dramatic \u2014 and continuing \u2014 push by the president and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk to cut staffing across federal agencies.",
      "Weldon has no experience in federal public heath, but that isn't unusual. The last few presidential administrations \u2014 both Democratic and Republican \u2014 have appointed outsiders with no CDC experience.",
      "Unlike Weldon, however, those outsiders had been public health researchers or had run state health departments. He is an Army veteran and internal medicine doctor whose main claim to fame was representing a central Florida district in Congress from 1995 to 2009.",
      "After he left Congress, Weldon practiced medicine in Florida, taught at the Florida Institute of Technology, served as board chairman for the Israel Allies Foundation and made unsuccessful runs at federal and state elected office. In a March 1 letter to HHS, Weldon said that if confirmed he will resign from the foundation and from two Florida health-care organizations. He also promised to sell his holdings in funds investing in energy, pharmaceutical and health-care companies.",
      "Weldon was a leader of a Congressional push for research into autism\u2019s causes, which began around 2000. It was fueled by a controversial \u2014 and ultimately discredited \u2014 study by British researcher Dr. Andrew Wakefield that claimed to find a link between the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism.",
      "The action in Congress was driven largely by U.S. Rep. Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican whose grandson had autism. Weldon was a prominent voice in Burton\u2019s hearings and co-sponsored a bill that would give responsibility for the nation\u2019s vaccine safety to an independent agency within HHS \u2014 an idea that not everyone in public health opposes.",
      "But Weldon also rejected studies that found no causal link between childhood vaccines and autism, and accused the CDC of short-circuiting research that might show otherwise.",
      "Meanwhile, Weldon was a friend to practitioners of fringe medicine. When Weldon invited Wakefield to testify before Congress, he also brought in Dr. James \u201cJeff\u201d Bradstreet, who used alternative medicine to try to treat autistic children. Bradstreet died in 2015, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration raided his office, of a gunshot wound that police labeled a suicide.",
      "Weldon later appeared in \u201cVaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe,\u201d a 2016 documentary directed by Wakefield and produced by Del Bigtree, an activist who later became the manager of Kennedy\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign. In the movie, Weldon repeated suspicions and accusations about CDC that he\u2019d made as a congressman.",
      "Kennedy has argued that experts who advise the CDC on vaccine policy have conflicts from working with, or receiving money from, pharmaceutical companies. Those advisers routinely disclose conflicts in public meetings, but the CDC last week launched a web tool \u201cto increase the transparency of conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "At Thursday's hearing, Democrats are likely to press Weldon on his vaccine views and his plans for the agency under a health secretary who has shown disdain for it.",
      "Dr. Anne Schuchat worked at the CDC for 33 years before retiring in 2021, and twice served as acting director. She said she doesn\u2019t know Weldon, but that agency directors gradually develop an appreciation and respect for its work.",
      "If Weldon follows a similar pattern, she said, he could be a great asset: His Capitol Hill experience could help CDC secure funding and political support.",
      "\u201cWith an optimistic view, there\u2019s lot you can build on, with what he has on paper,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a pessimistic view, if he wants the job to tear the place down, that would be disappointing \u2014 and dangerous.\u201d",

      "The Connecticut Supreme Court has upheld the murder conviction of a man found guilty of killing his wife in 2015, in a case that drew widespread attention because of evidence from the victim's Fitbit exercise activity tracker",
      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- Despite finding \u201cimproprieties\u201d were committed by a prosecutor, the Connecticut Supreme Court on Monday upheld the murder conviction of a man found guilty of killing his wife in a case that drew wide attention because the victim's Fitbit exercise tracker contradicted his statements to police.",
      "The justices ruled in a 6-0 decision that Richard Dabate was not deprived of a fair trial because of four missteps by the prosecutor they called \u201ctroubling,\u201d including referring to one of Connecticut's most notorious crimes while cross-examining the man.",
      "Dabate, 48, was convicted of murder and other charges in the fatal shooting of Connie Dabate, 39, at the couple's home in Ellington two days before Christmas in 2015 while their two young sons were in school. He's serving a 65-year prison sentence.",
      "Prosecutors said Dabate wanted his wife dead, in part, because he had a yearslong affair with another woman who was pregnant at the time of the killing and later gave birth to their child.",
      "Dabate staged a phony crime scene, including tying himself up loosely with zip ties and stabbing himself with a box cutter, and told police an unknown intruder in camouflage broke into their home, killed his wife and assaulted him, authorities said.",
      "State police said Dabate gave them a timeline of events that conflicted with data on his wife\u2019s Fitbit, which showed she was moving around for about an hour after the time Dabate said she was shot.",
      "Dabate testified in his defense and maintained his innocence, saying a large masked man with a voice like actor Vin Diesel was the killer.",
      "Part of Dabate's appeal questioned the reliability of the Fitbit evidence and whether the trial judge was wrong to have allowed it, but the Supreme Court upheld the data and its use.",
      "Dabate also accused Tolland State's Attorney Matthew Gedansky of multiple instances of impropriety, including Gedansky mentioning a notorious home invasion in Cheshire in 2007 while cross-examining Dabate. The home invaders killed a woman and her two daughters, ages 11 and 17, after terrorizing them for hours, while the woman's husband survived a vicious beating.",
      "Gedansky asked Dabate if he was trying to create a \u201clittle mini-Cheshire scene\u201d in his own home. The trial judge upheld an objection by Dabate's lawyer and asked Gedansky to rephrase the question, but Gedansky asked nearly the same exact question. The Supreme Court found Gedansky violated the judge's order to rephrase.",
      "\u201cIn referring to a \u2018mini Cheshire,\u2019 the prosecutor\u2019s question was unnecessarily inflammatory because it compared the defendant to other notorious offenders or infamous figures,\u201d Justice Joan Alexander wrote in the decision.",
      "Gedansky and Dabate's lawyer, Trent LaLima, did not immediately return email messages seeking comment Monday.",
      "The Supreme Court also found that Gedansky committed three other improprieties, including suggesting that the jury would have to be unintelligent or lazy to agree with the defense theory of the case.",
      "\u201cWe disapprove of the improprieties committed by the prosecutor during the trial of this case in strong and unqualified terms and expect our message to be taken with the utmost seriousness by prosecutors,\u201d the decision said.",
      "The court said it agreed with Dabate that \u201cthe prosecutor engaged in multiple acts of impropriety at trial that we consider troubling.\u201d",
      "Justices, however, said the state's case was very strong and Gedansky's missteps did not overshadow testimony by 130 witnesses and the 600 exhibits presented during the five-week trial."

    "story": [
      "Utah's governor intends to sign legislation making the state the first to ban fluoride in public water systems",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah will become the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, despite widespread opposition from dentists and national health organizations.",
      "Republican Gov. Spencer Cox said he would sign legislation that bars cities and communities from deciding whether to add the mineral to their water systems.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Government researchers have found that community water fluoridation prevents about 25% of tooth decay.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got tried and true evidence of the safety and efficacy of this public health initiative,\u201d said American Dental Association President Brad Kessler, of Denver. Cavities could start emerging in children within months or years of Utah stopping fluoridation, Kessler said.",
      "The ban comes weeks after federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, was sworn into office.",
      "\u201cIt's not a bill I care that much about,\u201d Cox added, \u201cbut it's a bill I will sign.\u201d",
      "Utah lawmakers who pushed for a ban said putting fluoride in water was too expensive. Its Republican sponsor, Rep. Stephanie Gricius, acknowledged fluoride has benefits, but said it was an issue of \u201cindividual choice\u201d to not have it in the water.",
      "Cox said that like many people in Utah, he grew up and raised his own children in a community that doesn\u2019t have fluoridated water \u2014 or what he called a \u201cnatural experiment.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou would think you would see drastically different outcomes with half the state not getting it. We haven\u2019t seen that,\u201d Cox said in a weekend interview with ABC4 in Salt Lake City. \u201cSo it\u2019s got to be a really high bar for me if we\u2019re going to require people to be medicated by their government.\u201d",
      "Already, some cities across the country have gotten rid of fluoride from their water, and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to kids\u2019 intellectual development.",
      "A Utah teenager who urged lawmakers to pass the bill described suffering a medical emergency when the fluoride pump in Sandy, Utah, malfunctioned in 2019, releasing an excessive amount of the mineral into the drinking water. The fluoride sickened hundreds of residents and led many in Utah to push for its removal.",
      "It\u2019s rare to find high levels of fluoridation in water, according to the National Institutes of Health. The agency said it\u2019s \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to get a toxic dose of fluoride from water with standard levels of the mineral.",
      "Kessler said the amounts of fluoride added to drinking water have been reduced over time and are below levels considered problematic.",
      "\u201cThe science proves that it is effective at reducing cavities with little to no risk of other problems,\u201d he said.",
      "He added that a ban in Utah could have a domino effect with other legislatures being encouraged to follow suit with fluoride bans in their states.",
      "Opponents warned it would disproportionately affect low-income residents who may rely on public drinking water having fluoride as their only source of preventative dental care. Low-income families may not be able to afford regular dentist visits or the fluoride tablets some people buy as a supplement in cities without fluoridation.",
      "Fluoridation is the most cost-effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale, said Lorna Koci, who chairs the Utah Oral Health Coalition.",
      "Utah in 2022 ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About two in five Utah residents served by community water systems received fluoridated water.",
      "In February, the city council in Riverton, a Salt Lake City suburb, unanimously passed a resolution to remove fluoride from the city\u2019s public water systems. Voters in Brigham City, 59 miles (95 kilometers) north of the capital city, struck down by a large margin a measure in 2023 that would have removed the mineral from its public water supply.",
      "Out of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data to the CDC in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an Associated Press analysis showed. The largest was the state\u2019s biggest city, Salt Lake City.",
      "Rodney Thornell, president of the Utah Dental Association, began practicing dentistry in a Salt Lake City suburb before the city added fluoride to its water. His adult patients who grew up locally continue to get lots of cavities but younger patients who grew up with fluoride in the water get fewer, he said.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re going to keep eating sugar, we need fluoride.\u201d Thornell said, noting that Utah residents consume more than the national average of candy and sugary drinks.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court agreed Monday in a case from Colorado to decide whether state and local governments can enforce laws banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ children.",
      "The conservative-led court is taking up the case amid actions by President Donald Trump targeting transgender people, including a ban on military service and an end to federal funding for gender-affirming care for transgender minors.",
      "The justices also have heard arguments in a Tennessee case over whether state bans on treating transgender minors violate the Constitution. But they have yet to issue a decision.",
      "Colorado is among roughly half the states that prohibit the practice of trying to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity through counseling.",
      "The issue is whether the law violates the speech rights of counselors. Defenders of such laws argue that they regulate the conduct of professionals who are licensed by the state.",
      "The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver upheld the state law. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta has struck down local local bans in Florida.",
      "In 2023, the court had turned away a similar challenge, despite a split among federal appeals courts that had weighed state bans and come to differing decisions.",
      "At the time, three justices, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas, said they would have taken on the issue. It takes four justices to grant review. The nine-member court does not typically reveal how justices vote at this stage of a case so it\u2019s unclear who might have provided the fourth vote.",
      "The case will be argued in the court\u2019s new term, which begins in October. The appeal on behalf of Kaley Chiles, a counselor in Colorado Springs, was filed by Alliance Defending Freedom, the conservative legal organization that has appeared frequently at the court in recent years in cases involving high-profile social issues.",
      "One of those cases was a 5-4 decision in 2018 in which the justices ruled that California could not force state-licensed anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers to provide information about abortion.",
      "Chiles\u2019 lawyers leaned heavily on that decision in asking the court to take up her case. They wrote that Chiles doesn\u2019t \u201cseek to \u2018cure\u2019 clients of same-sex attractions or to \u2018change\u2019 clients\u2019 sexual orientation.\u201d",
      "In arguing for the court to reject the appeal, lawyers for Colorado wrote that lawmakers acted to regulate professional conduct, \u201cbased on overwhelming evidence that efforts to change a child\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity are unsafe and ineffective.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "If you\u2019re about to go to the gym, should you eat something beforehand",
      "If you listen to some self-proclaimed exercise experts on social media, they swear that working out on an empty stomach burns more fat.",
      "But it\u2019s a common misconception that exercising in a fasted state improves performance or burns more calories, said Abby Langer, a dietitian in Toronto.",
      "\u201cThe research shows that in terms of gains, it doesn\u2019t really make much of a difference,\u201d she said.",
      "Does that mean you should load up on protein and carbs right before a workout? No, that\u2019s not true either.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at when \u2014 and how \u2014 you should eat, before, after or even during a workout. (And remember, experts say what you eat is more important than when you eat.)",
      "The calories in food literally are energy, so you need them to fuel your body for a proper workout. Eating too much too soon beforehand, though, can be problematic.",
      "Exercising diverts blood from organs including the stomach to the muscles, said Langer, author of \u201cGood Food, Bad Diet.\u201d So exercising on a full stomach affects the digestive process, which could cause cramping or even make you feel sick.",
      "That\u2019s particularly the case with meals high in fat, protein or fiber, which take longer to digest than carbohydrates. Langer recommends eating a high ratio of carbs beforehand and waiting two to three hours before intense exercise.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to eat a big steak an hour before you play hockey,\u201d she said.",
      "If you exercise first thing in the morning or before dinner, it\u2019s OK to have a carb-rich snack like a banana with peanut butter or yogurt with fruit beforehand. It will give you the energy to perform well, and you can fuel up afterward with a full meal.",
      "That steak may serve you better afterward because that\u2019s when a higher ratio of protein is easier to digest, said Krista Austin, a physiologist in Colorado Springs.",
      "Austin said if it will be an hour or longer before you can have a full meal, it\u2019s better to have a high-protein snack in the meantime to help curb your appetite. The reason has little to do with muscle recovery or nutrient absorption: Rather, people who are too hungry make poor dietary choices.",
      "\u201cA lot of people get very hungry about an hour after exercise, and you don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d said Austin, author of \u201cPerformance Nutrition: Applying the Science of Nutrient Timing.\u201d \u201cYou want to catch it early, or you go and overeat.\u201d",
      "But it\u2019s another myth that you need to grab a protein shake within minutes of finishing to build the biggest muscles, Langer said.",
      "Many exercise enthusiasts point to what\u2019s known as an \u201canabolic window\u201d of about an hour within exercising that the body is primed to repair muscle. For the average person, you have a much longer window, and nutrient timing is less important than making sure you consume some protein at every meal, Langer said. The body needs a continuous supply of amino acids like protein for muscle repair and maintenance, she said, which means about 25 to 30 grams at every meal, depending on various factors.",
      "\u201cPrioritizing that will help with goals, either muscle building, satiety, weight loss, all of that,\u201d Langer said.",
      "Most people who are eating enough throughout the day don\u2019t need anything during a workout. Langer and Austin said the threshold is about an hour of intense exercise. Longer than that \u2014 say you're training for a marathon \u2014 and you can benefit from a carb-rich snack in the middle.",
      "Instead of focusing on when to eat, Austin said to focus on what and how much. She cautioned against overcomplicating the topic and recommended following the USDA\u2019s My Plate recommendations for a balanced diet.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing we need to teach people is that nutrition is simple,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe you need to stop focusing on the concept of nutrient timing and just make sure that you\u2019re consistently eating throughout the day and focus on health.\u201d",

      "But, en route to Canada from Saudi Arabia, where he had won agreement from Ukraine for a 30-day ceasefire in the war, Rubio had dismissed suggestions that he would face an uncomfortable reception from this counterparts.",
      "Joly, however, had made it clear that Canada, at least, would not back down. Trump has arguably been most antagonistic toward Canada with persistent talk of it becoming the 51st U.S. state, additional tariffs and persistent insults against its leadership, much of which he repeated on Thursday in comments at the White House.",
      "Ahead of the talks, Joly had said she would use every meeting at the G7 to raise Trump's tariffs and coordinate a response. She also noted that Trump had continued to press \"his disrespectful 51st state rhetoric.\u201d",
      "For his part, Trump doubled down on the anti-Canada rhetoric during an Oval Office meeting on Thursday with NATO chief Mark Rutte. \u201cTo be honest with you, Canada only works as a state,\u201d Trump said before going on to say that he\u2019s not going to change his mind on the tariffs he\u2019s imposing on Canada. \u201cWe\u2019ve been ripped off for years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to bend.\"",
      "Rubio had downplayed Trump's earlier comments, saying the president was only expressing what he thought would be a good idea. The G7 \"is not a meeting about how we\u2019re going to take over Canada,\u201d he said.",
      "German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said G7 nations should avoid panic and posted a message of support for Canada on X, featuring a photo of her and EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas. \u201cWe\u2019ve got your back, @melaniejoly,\u201d she wrote. \u201c#Canada #Solidarity\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have learned altogether in these shaky geopolitical times ... especially in moments when your heart is really beating, it\u2019s important to keep calm,\u201d Baerbock told reporters. She noted that the G7 has been \u201ca powerhouse \u2026 for freedom, for our common understanding of peace.\u201d",
      "On tariffs, Rubio said G7 partners should understand that these are a \u201cpolicy decision\u201d by Trump to protect American competitiveness.",
      "\u201cI think it is quite possible that we could do these things and at the same time deal in a constructive way with our allies and friends and partners on all the other issues that we work together on,\u201d Rubio had told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I expect out of the G7 and Canada.\u201d",
      "Asked if he expected a difficult reception from his counterparts, Rubio brushed the question aside: \u201cI don\u2019t know, should I be? I mean, they\u2019ve invited us to come. We intend to go. The alternative is to not go. I think that would actually make things worse, not better.\u201d",
      "The agenda for the G7 meeting included discussions on China and the Indo-Pacific; Ukraine and Europe; stability in the Americas; the Middle East; maritime security; Africa; and China, North Korea, Iran and Russia.",
      "Rubio and Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, had been in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, earlier in the week securing a potentially huge win for the administration \u2014 a possible 30-day ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war, an issue that galvanized the G7 since even before the conflict began. Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff arrived Thursday in Russia for talks with officials on the proposal.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that he agrees in principle with the U.S. proposal but that the terms need to be worked out, emphasizing it should pave the way to lasting peace.",
      "\u201cSo the idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it,\u201d Putin said at a news conference in Moscow. \u201cBut there are issues that we need to discuss, and I think that we need to discuss it with our American colleagues and partners.\u201d",
      "There was no immediate comment from G7 officials to Putin's comments, although participants were expected to be cautiously optimistic.",
      "Still, Trump\u2019s apparent desire to draw Putin back into the fold \u2014 including saying he would like to see Russia rejoin the group to restore it to the G8 \u2014 continues to alarm G7 members. Russia was thrown out of the G8 after it seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.",
      "Among international groupings, the G7 \u2014 whose members, with the exception of Japan, are all NATO allies \u2014 had been the toughest on Russia.",

      "The agreement to integrate the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, into the Syrian government followed fierce clashes that erupted last week between government security forces and gunmen loyal to ousted leader Bashar Assad.",

      "Ahmad al-Sharaa, Syria\u2019s interim president and a former rebel, met with Hakan Fidan, Turkey\u2019s foreign minister; Yasar Guler, defense minister, and Ibrahim Kalin, head of national intelligence. They were accompanied by Turkey\u2019s ambassador to Syria, Burhan Koroglu.",

      "The ceremony, hosted by a foundation linked to Turkey\u2019s religious authority, honored Ragheed al-Tatari. Erdogan praised al-Tatari for his perseverance and gave him an award for his \u201cbenevolence.\"",
      "Al-Tatari was imprisoned under the rule of Syrian presidents Hafez al-Assad and later Bashar al-Assad. He had been detained since 1981. There are conflicting accounts for his imprisonment including refusing to bomb the city of Hama and failing to report a pilot desertion attempt.",
      "Over four decades, al-Tatari was moved among prisons notorious for housing political inmates, including Palmyra prison and Sednaya. His imprisonment, described by human rights groups as one of the longest in Syria for a political prisoner, ended in December when opposition forces freed him.",
      "In a speech on stage, Erdogan lauded al-Tatari, calling him \u201cthe brave Syrian pilot who listened to his conscience.\""

      "The raucous spring festival sees Hindus take part in a kaleidoscopic celebration of the end of winter and the triumph of good over evil. The festival is a national holiday in India, while in Nepal it's a two-day event that began Thursday. It's also observed in other South Asian countries as well as among the Indian diaspora.",
      "Holi has its origins in Hindu mythology and lore and celebrates the divine love between the Hindu god Krishna and his consort Radha, and signifies a time of rebirth and rejuvenation.",
      "Across the country, people, mostly dressed in all white clothes, celebrated the festival by hurling colored powder at each other. Children, perched on rooftops and balconies, flung water balloons filled with colored pigments at passers by.",

      "Another tradition that marks Holi is bhang, a local drink prepared with cannabis and consumed with milk or water.

Its consumption is permissible under Indian law and it is also sold at government licensed shops.",

      "Faced with a sluggish economy, Starmer announced plans on Thursday to shake up Britain\u2019s civil service, government and health system to make the \u201cflabby\u201d British state more agile and efficient.",
      "That worries trade unions, and many of Starmer\u2019s own lawmakers, who fear his aim of \u201creshaping the state\u201d will bring job losses and spending cuts.",

      "The British state is \u201cweaker than it\u2019s ever been \u2014 overstretched, unfocused, trying to do too much, doing it badly, unable to deliver the security that people need,\u201d he said.",
      "Starmer\u2019s center-left party won a landslide election victory in July, ending 14 years of Conservative government. But polls suggest support for his Labour government has plummeted since then, as public services creak under record demand and economic growth remains stubbornly low.",
      "Last month, the government said it would boost defense spending from the current 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027, a move that will cost billions. That makes it likely the government will announce tax increases or spending cuts, or both, in its spring budget statement on March 26.",
      "Part of the savings will come by trimming welfare benefits. The government says the changes, expected to be announced in detail next week, will help get more people back to work. But anti-poverty groups and advocates for the disabled worry they will cut support to some of society\u2019s most vulnerable people.",
      "Starmer also vowed to slash regulation and prune \u201cthe thicket of red tape,\u201d which he said is blocking new homes and infrastructure, and to ramp up AI use so that one in 10 civil servants is in a tech or digital role within five years.",
      "In a surprise move, he abolished NHS England, the arms-length public body that oversees the state-funded health system for England\u2019s 56 million people. Starmer said that will cut bureaucracy and make the system more efficient. It\u2019s also likely to see thousands of jobs eliminated.",
      "The media have dubbed Starmer\u2019s plans \u201cProject Chainsaw,\u201d a nickname that evokes Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Starmer\u2019s office rejected what it called \u201cthat juvenile characterization.\u201d",
      "Mike Clancy, general secretary of the Prospect union, urged the government \u201cto avoid the incendiary rhetoric and tactics we are seeing in the United States, and to be clear that reforms are about enhancing and not undermining the civil service.\u201d",
      "Soon Starmer will return to the international realm amid deep uncertainty over Ukraine\u2019s future as Washington pushes to end the war. His careful diplomacy has seen Starmer \u2014 alongside French President Emmanuel Macron \u2014 work to assemble a \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d to secure a future ceasefire, while striving to persuade Trump to maintain support for Kyiv.",
      "Starmer will convene leaders from around 25 countries for a conference call on Saturday to flesh out plans.",
      "He also said on Thursday that the futures of Ukraine and Britain were intertwined.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t secure a just peace and a lasting peace, then that insecurity which we\u2019ve already felt will continue \u2026 (with) higher prices, higher bills, the cost of living crisis going on even longer,\u201d he said."

      "The findings of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Islamic Republic of Iran come after it determined last year that the country's theocracy was responsible for the \u201cphysical violence\u201d that led to the death of Mahsa Amini. Her death led to nationwide protests against the country\u2019s mandatory hijab laws and the public disobedience against them that continues even today, despite the threat of violent arrest and imprisonment.",
      "\u201cTwo and a half years after the protests began in September 2022, women and girls in Iran continue to face systematic discrimination, in law and in practice, that permeates all aspects of their lives, particularly with respect to the enforcement of the mandatory hijab,\u201d the report said.",
      "\u201cThe state is increasingly reliant on state-sponsored vigilantism in an apparent effort to enlist businesses and private individuals in hijab compliance, portraying it as a civic responsibility.\u201d",
      "Iran's mission to the U.N. in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the findings of the 20-page report.",
      "In it, U.N. investigators outline how Iran increasingly relies on electronic surveillance. Among the efforts include Iranian officials deploying \u201caerial drone surveillance\u201d to monitor women in public places. At Tehran's Amirkabir University, authorities installed facial recognition software at its entrance gate to also find women not wearing the hijab, it said.",
      "Surveillance cameras on Iran's major roadways also are believed to be involved in searching for uncovered women. U.N. investigators said they obtained the \u201cNazer\u201d mobile phone app offered by Iranian police, which allows the public to report on uncovered women in vehicles, including ambulances, buses, metro cars and taxis.",
      "\u201cUsers may add the location, date, time and the license plate number of the vehicle in which the alleged mandatory hijab infraction occurred, which then \u2018flags\u2019 the vehicle online, alerting the police,\u201d the report said. \u201cIt then triggers a text message (in real-time) to the registered owner of the vehicle, warning them that they had been found in violation of the mandatory hijab laws, and that their vehicles would be impounded for ignoring these warnings.\u201d",
      "Those text messages have led to dangerous situations. In July 2024, police officers shot and paralyzed a woman who activists say had received such a message and was fleeing a checkpoint near the Caspian Sea.",
      "Amini\u2019s death sparked months of protests and a security crackdown that killed more than 500 people and led to the detention of more than 22,000. After the mass demonstrations, police dialed down enforcement of hijab laws, but it ramped up again in April 2024 under what authorities called the Noor \u2014 or \u201cLight\u201d \u2014 Plan. At least 618 women have been arrested under the Noor Plan, the U.N. investigators said, citing a local human rights activist group in Iran.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran executed at least 938 people last year, a threefold increase from 2021, the U.N. said. While many were convicted of drug charges, the report said the executions \u201cindicate a nexus with the overall repression of dissent in this period.\u201d",
      "As Iran continues its crackdown over the hijab, it also faces an economic crisis over U.S. sanctions due to its rapidly advancing nuclear program. While U.S. President Donald Trump has called for new negotiations, Iran has yet to respond to a letter he sent to its 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Social unrest, coupled with the economic woes, remain a concern for Iran's theocracy.",

On Wednesday night, it took control of Adi-Gudem, a town near the regional capital, Mekele. Several people in Adi-Gudem were injured when forces attempted to occupy a government building.",
      "The TPLF fought a brutal two-year war against federal forces which ended in November 2022 with the signing of a peace agreement and the formation of a TPLF-led interim government. Hundreds of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in the fighting which began in November 2020, with millions displaced and many left near famine in Africa\u2019s second-most populous country.",

      "QUETTA, Pakistan -- Pakistan\u2019s prime minister traveled to restive southwestern Balochistan province Thursday to meet survivors of a train attack and the commandos who rescued over 300 passengers from the insurgents who killed 21 civilians and four troops.",
      "The Baloch Liberation Army, an outlawed group behind multiple deadly attacks in recent months, claimed responsibility for the attack that began Tuesday and ended Wednesday when troops killed all 33 insurgents in an operation that the military said resulted in no further passenger deaths. The train was heading from the Balochistan capital, Quetta, to the northern city of Peshawar when insurgents blew up the track, forcing nine coaches and the engine of the Jafer Express train to stop partially inside a tunnel.",
      "The BLA regularly targets Pakistani security forces and has attacked trains, but had never been able to hijack any train in the past. They have also attacked outsiders such as Chinese workers, thousands of whom are involved in multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects in Balochistan.",
      "Oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan\u2019s largest and least populated province. Members of the ethnic Baloch minority say they face discrimination and exploitation by the central government.",
      "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was to visit Quetta on Thursday. Authorities said arrangements were made to transport the bodies of victims to their hometowns and people who were wounded were receiving medical treatment.",
      "In an overnight statement, the military said it had \u201cconfirmed intelligence\u201d indicating that the assault was \u201corchestrated and directed by terrorist ring leaders operating from Afghanistan, who were in direct communication with the terrorists throughout the incident.\u201d",
      "Pakistan often accuse Kabul of sheltering Pakistani Taliban and BLA, a charge the Afghan government denies.",
      "However, the military in the statement urged the Afghan Taliban government to uphold its responsibilities and deny the use of its soil for terrorist activities against Pakistan.",
      "According to a military statement, the \u201cterrorists, after blowing up the railway track, took control of the train and held the passengers hostage including women, children and elderly, using them as human shields.\"",
      "Most of the survivors said the assailants opened fire on the windows of the train, entered the cars and killed or wounded people before taking them hostage.",
      "Three soldiers who had been guarding the railroad track were also killed, according to military spokesman, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif."

      "LISBON, Portugal -- Portugal will hold an early general election on May 18, the country\u2019s president announced Thursday, two days after a minority government lost a confidence vote in parliament and stood down.",
      "President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who has no executive power but can dissolve parliament and call elections, described the government's collapse as a shock that was neither \"expected nor wanted.\u201d",
      "In a televised address to the nation, he urged voters to participate actively in the European Union country\u2019s third general election in three years, saying the continent faces stiff challenges to its security and economy that require political stability.",
      "The center-right government\u2019s fall on Tuesday amid questions about the prime minister's conduct brought the worst bout of political instability since Portugal adopted a democratic system more than 50 years ago in the wake of the 1974 Carnation Revolution, which ended a four-decade dictatorship.",
      "Portugal, which has a population of around 10.6 million people, has had a series of minority governments in recent years as the traditional rivals for power, the center-right Social Democratic Party and the center-left Socialists, lost votes to growing smaller parties.",
      "The minority governments have been unable to build compromises that might ensure an administration completes its constitutional four-year term without opposition parties teaming up to block its policy proposals and bring it down.",
      "The ballot deepens political uncertainty just as Portugal is in the process of investing more than 22 billion euros ($24 billion) in EU development funds.",
      "Voter discontent with a return to the polls could bring dividends for the right-wing populist party Chega (Enough), which has fed off frustration with the two mainstream parties. Portugal has been caught up in the rising European tide of populism, with Chega surging into third place in last year\u2019s election.",

      "Montenegro, who says he\u2019ll stand for reelection, has denied any wrongdoing. He said he placed control of the firm in the hands of his wife and children when he became Social Democratic leader in 2022 and has not been involved in its running.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration\u2019s warning last month that Europe must now take care of security in its own backyard raises troubling questions",
      "BRUSSELS -- In the year after Russia launched outright war on Ukraine, NATO leaders approved a set of military plans designed to repel an invasion of Europe. It was the biggest shake-up of the alliance\u2019s defense readiness preparations since the Cold War.",
      "The secret plans set out how Western allies would defend NATO territory from the Atlantic to the Arctic, through the Baltic region and Central Europe, down to the Mediterranean Sea. Up to 300,000 troops would move to its eastern flank within 30 days, many of them American. That would climb to 800,000 within six months.",
      "But the Trump administration warned last month that U.S. priorities lie elsewhere. Europe must take care of its own security, and those goals now seem questionable. Mustering just 30,000 European troops to police any future peace in Ukraine is proving a challenge.",
      "Billions of euros are being shifted to military budgets, but only slowly, and the Europeans are struggling to fire up production in their defense industries.",
      "Beyond funding, tens of thousands more European citizens might have to complete military service, and time is of the essence. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has warned that Russian forces could be capable of launching an attack on European territory in 2030.",
      "Concerned about Russia's intentions, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk wants to introduce large-scale military training for every adult male, and double the size of Poland's army to around 500,000 soldiers.",
      "\u201cIf Ukraine loses the war or if it accepts the terms of peace, armistice or capitulation \u2026 then, without a doubt \u2014 and we can all agree on that \u2014 Poland will find itself in a much more difficult geopolitical situation,\u201d Tusk warned lawmakers last week.",
      "The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimates that Europe, including the U.K., has almost 1.5 million active duty personnel. But many can't be deployed on a battlefield, and those who can are hard to use effectively without a centralized command system.",
      "The number of Russian troops in Ukraine at the end of 2024 was estimated to be around 700,000.",
      "NATO troops are controlled by a U.S. general, using American air transport and logistics.",
      "Analysts say that in the event of a Russian attack, NATO\u2019s top military officer would probably dispatch around 200,000 U.S. troops to Europe to build on the 100,000 U.S. military personnel already based there.",
      "With the Americans out of the picture, \u201ca realistic estimate may therefore be that an increase in European capacities equivalent to the fighting capacity of 300,000 U.S. troops is needed,\u201d the Brussels-based Bruegel think tank estimates.",
      "\u201cEurope faces a choice: either increase troop numbers significantly by more than 300,000 to make up for the fragmented nature of national militaries, or find ways to rapidly enhance military coordination,\u201d Bruegel said.",
      "The question is how.",
      "NATO is encouraging countries to build up personnel numbers, but the trans-Atlantic alliance isn't telling them how to do it. Maintaining public support for the armed forces and for Ukraine is too important to risk by dictating choices.",
      "\u201cThe way they go about it is intensely political, so we wouldn\u2019t prescribe any way of changing this \u2014 whether to go for conscription, elective conscription, bigger reserves,\u201d a senior NATO official said on the condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to brief journalists unless he remained unnamed.",
      "\u201cWe do stress the point that fighting with those regional plans means that we are in collective defense and likely in an attrition war that requires way more manpower than we currently have, or we designed our force models to deliver,\u201d he added.",
      "Eleven European countries have compulsory military service: Austria, Cyprus, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden, and non-European Union nation Norway. The length of service ranges from as little as two months in Croatia to 19 months in Norway.",
      "Poland isn't considering a return to universal military service, but rather a reserve system based on the model in Switzerland, where every man is obliged to serve in the armed forces or an alternative civilian service. Women can volunteer.",
      "Belgium\u2019s new defense minister plans to write a letter in November to around 120,000 citizens who are age 18 to try to persuade at least 500 of them to sign up for voluntary military service. Debate about the issue goes on in the U.K. and Germany.",
      "Germany\u2019s professional armed forces had 181,174 active service personnel at the end of last year \u2014 slightly lower than in 2023, according to a parliamentary report released Tuesday. That means it\u2019s no closer to reaching a Defense Ministry target of 203,000 by 2031.",
      "Last year, 20,290 people started serving in the German military, or Bundeswehr, an 8% increase, the report said. But of the 18,810 who joined in 2023, more than a quarter \u2014 5,100 or 27% of the total \u2014 left again, most at their own request during the six-month trial period.",
      "The German parliament\u2019s commissioner for the armed forces, Eva H\u00f6gl, said that army life is a hard sell.",
      "\u201cThe biggest problem is boredom,\u201d H\u00f6gl said. \u201cIf young people have nothing to do, if there isn\u2019t enough equipment and there aren\u2019t enough trainers, if the rooms aren\u2019t reasonably clean and orderly, that deters people and it makes the Bundeswehr unattractive.\u201d",
      "At the other end of the scale, tiny Luxembourg has unique demographic challenges. Of its roughly 630,000 passport holders, only 315,000 are Luxembourgers. The number of people of military service age \u2014 18 to 40 \u2014 is smaller still.",
      "Around 1,000 people are enlisted. That\u2019s small compared to some European powers, but bigger per capita than the U.K. armed forces. Recently, Luxembourg \u2014 where unemployment is low and salaries are high \u2014 has struggled to find just 200-300 military personnel.",
      "Military service comes with many challenges too, not least convincing someone to sign up when they might be sent to the front, and hastily trained conscripts can't replace a professional army. The draft also costs money. Extra staff, accommodation and trainers are needed throughout a conscript's term.",

Trump sent a letter to Khamenei in 2019 with no apparent effect on rising tensions.",
      "China and Russia are both permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, along with France and Britain, that took part in the original 2015 Iran nuclear deal preliminary framework agreement alongside Germany and the European Union. Trump withdrew America from the accord in 2018, setting in motion years of attacks and tensions in the wider Middle East.",
      "China and Russia have particularly close relations with Iran through energy deals and Iran has provided Russia with bomb-carrying drones in its war against Ukraine.",
      "They are also seen as sharing a joint interest in diminishing the role of the U.S. and other liberal democracies in determining world events in favor of their own highly authoritarian systems.",
      "Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful. However, its officials increasingly threaten to pursue a nuclear weapon. Iran now enriches uranium to near weapons-grade levels of 60%, the only country in the world without a nuclear weapons program to do so.",

The last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency on Iran\u2019s program put its stockpile at 8,294.4 kilograms (18,286 pounds) as it enriches a fraction of it to 60% purity.",
      "While Iran has maintained it won\u2019t negotiate under duress, its economy has been savaged by the U.S. sanctions. Protests over women\u2019s rights, the economy and Iran\u2019s theocracy in recent years have shaken its government.",

      "While many were happy to see an end to the Assad family\u2019s dictatorial rule of over 50 years in the war-torn country, religious and ethnic minorities have been skeptical of the new Islamist leaders and reluctant to allow Damascus under its new authorities to assert control of their areas.",
      "Abdulhamid Al-Awak, one of the seven members of the committee al-Sharaa tasked to draft the temporary constitution, told a press conference Thursday that it will maintain some previsions from the previous one, including the stipulation that the head of state has to be a Muslim, and Islamic law is the main source of jurisprudence.",

      "A key goal of the interim constitution was to give a timeline for the country\u2019s political transition out of its interim phase. In December, Al-Sharaa said it could take up to three years to rewrite Syria\u2019s constitution and up to five years to organize and hold elections.",
      "Al-Sharaa appointed a committee to draft the new constitution after Syria held a national dialogue conference last month, which called for announcing a temporary constitution and holding interim parliamentary elections. Critics said the hastily-organized conference was not inclusive of Syria's different ethnic and sectarian groups or civil society.",
      "The United States and Europe have been hesitant to lift harsh sanctions imposed on Syria during Assad's rule until they are convinced that the new leaders will create an inclusive political system and protect minorities. Al-Sharaa and regional governments have been urging them to reconsider, fearing that the country's crumbling economy could bring further instability.",

      "Troops from the three countries were sent in 2023 under the banner of the Southern African Development Community, or SADC, but public opposition to the deployment has surged since 14 South African and three Malawian peacekeepers were killed by the rebels in January.",

      "The SADC mission was part of a myriad of forces operating in the mineral-rich region plagued by decades of armed violence. They include Congolese government soldiers, foreign mercenaries, a United Nations peacekeeping force and more than 100 groups that are fighting for power, land and valuable mineral resources. Others try to defend their communities. Some armed groups have been accused of mass killings and ethnic cleansing.",
      "The M23 rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, and at times have vowed to march as far as Congo\u2019s capital, Kinshasa, over 1,000 miles away.",

      "But Duterte, his family, lawyers and friends resisted and prevented the former leader from being brought to a Gulfstream G550 executive jet, according to Torre.",
      "The standoff lasted for about 12 hours, Torre said.",

I can\u2019t do anything if I get arrested and jailed,\u201d he said in an expletives-laced speech.",

      "Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te says tougher measures are needed to counter stepped-up Chinese infiltration, spying and other efforts to weaken the island\u2019s defenses",
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te said Thursday tougher measures are needed to counter stepped-up Chinese infiltration, spying and other efforts to weaken the island's defenses and speed Beijing's goal of taking control of the self-governing island republic, a close U.S. partner.",
      "Lai cited a range of recent incidents involving China that fall into a \u201cgray area\u201d including psychological warfare short of open armed conflict.",
      "Beijing's efforts to \u201csubvert, obtain secrets, lure members of the armed forces and influence public opinion to lose confidence in our national defense require that we step up our legal safeguards to prevent and detect such incidents,\u201d Lai said at a news conference.",
      "Lai said proposed measures to counter China's moves included bringing back military trials for crimes such as spying and making it more difficult for residents from China and the Chinese territories of Hong Kong, and Macau to obtain Taiwanese identification, a task made more difficult by widespread intermarriage between Taiwanese and Chinese.",
      "Taiwan will also further limit contact with the island by individuals affiliated with the ruling Chinese Communist Party's United Front department aimed at using cultural products and personnel exchanges to push Beijing's line on unification.",
      "That followed a case last year when a student on such a delegation sponsored by a pro-unification Taiwanese group used deprecating language toward Taiwan, sparking public anger but with no legal ramifications.",
      "Lai's Democratic Progressive Party favors the island\u2019s continued de-facto independence from Beijing. China has refused almost all official contact with the DPP since Lai's predecessor, Tsai Ing-wen, was elected eight years ago.",
      "China regularly sends ships and planes into airspace and waters near the island in an effort to intimidate its 23 million people and wear down its armed forces and morale.",
      "Taiwan's government recently expelled the Chinese wife of a Taiwanese citizen after the woman repeatedly posted short clips on Chinese social media saying China would conquer Taiwan in half an hour and praising the Chinese leadership.",
      "Such acts are illegal under Taiwan's laws on aiding and abetting the enemy. The woman, who also held official Chinese titles as a consultant, can apply for residency again in five years.",
      "Other recent incidents have included Taiwanese artists and influencers living in China reposting statements from Chinese state media asserting Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan.",
      "Retired Taiwanese service members have also passed information about the island\u2019s weapons systems to Chinese agents and sought to recruit serving military personnel as spies.",
      "The Defense Ministry on Wednesday confirmed a case where a retired air force major claiming to be working for a U.S. think tank persuaded an air force air intercept controller to hand over classified files in exchange for payment. The retired major, surnamed Shih, delivered the documents to his handlers in China for about $45,000, of which he shared about $6,000 with the serving officer, surnamed Hsu.",
      "The leaked information related to Taiwan's domestically developed air-launched Hsiung Feng III anti-ship missiles and Taiwan's response to Chinese incursions into its air defense identification zone.",
      "The two sides separated by the 180-kilometer (110 mile) Taiwan Strait split amid civil war in 1949, and China continues to regard Taiwan as its own territory to be recovered by force if necessary. Lai's comments came on the 20th anniversary of China's passage of its Anti-Succession Act, which laid out conditions under which China would invade, including if the island declared formal independence or refused unification indefinitely.",
      "Taiwan's government says it is already independent for all intents and purposes, and therefore there is no need to make such a declaration, a view embraced by the vast majority of the electorate.",
      "Taiwan has been bulking up its defenses with new missiles and U.S. tanks and planes, along with self-made submarines. It also recently extended the period for mandatory national military service for all men from four months to one year."

      "There were 127,350 reported cases of measles, including 38 deaths, in Europe and Central Asia last year, marking the highest total in nearly 30 years, according to figures from UNICEF and the World Health Organization",
      "LONDON -- There were 127,350 measles cases reported in Europe and Central Asia in 2024, double the number of cases reported the previous year and the highest number since 1997, according to an analysis by the World Health Organization and UNICEF.",
      "In a report published on Thursday, U.N. health experts said Romania had the most measles infections, at more than 30,000, followed by Kazakhstan, which reported 28,147 people with measles.",
      "UNICEF said that about 40% of measles infections in Europe and Central Asia were in children under 5 and that more than half of all people sickened by measles had to be hospitalized. Measles is among the world\u2019s most infectious diseases and is spread by an airborne virus.",
      "Two doses of the measles vaccine is estimated to be 97% effective in preventing the disease, which typically infects the respiratory system and causes symptoms including fever, cough, runny nose and a rash. In serious cases, measles can cause pneumonia, encephalitis, dehydration and blindness.",
      "\u201cMeasles is back, and it\u2019s a wake-up call,\" Dr. Han Kluge, WHO\u2019s Europe director, said in a statement. \"Without high vaccination rates, there is no health security.\u201d",
      "WHO and UNICEF noted that in both Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, fewer than 70% and 50% of children in those countries respectively have been vaccinated against measles for at least the past five years. Scientists estimate that more than 95% of the population needs to be immunized to prevent outbreaks.",
      "After a drop in immunization coverage during the coronavirus pandemic, measles cases surged in 2023 and 2024, with vaccination rates in numerous countries still lower than what they were before COVID-19 hit. The U.N. said the number of measles cases across Europe made up one third of the approximately 359,521 infections last year.",
      "Concerns about the safety of the measles vaccine have persisted for decades, after British physician Dr. Andrew Wakefield and colleagues published a paper in 1998 \u2014 which has long since been retracted \u2014 linking the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine to autism. No evidence for any causal link has ever been found and Wakefield had his license to practise medicine in the U.K. revoked.",

      "BEIRUT -- After Syria\u2019s longtime autocratic ruler was toppled late last year, the man who led rebel groups to victory immediately faced a new challenge: unifying the country after more than a decade of civil war.",
      "The peril and promise of Syria under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa \u2014 the former leader of an Islamist insurgent group \u2014 were on dramatic display over the past week. After days of deadly sectarian violence, a diplomatic triumph united a powerful force in the country\u2019s northeast with the new national army.",
      "By Tuesday, it seemed as if Syria had made major steps toward quelling the tensions that erupted over the weekend. But analysts say the country still has a long way to go, and that the risks of sliding back into civil war, or partitioning the country along ethnic and sectarian lines, remain.",
      "The \u201cpath to rebuilding trust\u201d will require Syria's new leaders to do more to \u201cprotect lives and foster a sense of unity among all communities,\u201d said Ammar Kahf, executive director of Omran Center for Strategic Studies in Istanbul.",
      "Building a stable, pluralistic society is also key to convincing Western countries to lift crushing economic sanctions that were placed on Syria during the brutal rule of former President Bashar Assad.",
      "Beginning last Thursday, clashes between government security forces and armed groups loyal to Assad spiraled into sectarian revenge attacks that killed hundreds of civilians, most of them Alawites, a minority sect to which Assad belongs.",
      "Government reinforcements eventually restored order, and calm appeared to hold by late Monday. That same day, al-Sharaa had signed a landmark pact under which Kurdish-led forces in the country\u2019s northeast would be merged with the new national army.",
      "The deal marked a major step toward unifying the disparate factions that had carved up Syria into de facto mini-states during its civil war. The civil war began in 2011 after the Assad government's brutal crackdown on massive anti-government protests.",
      "Most of the armed factions that fought to unseat Assad announced in January that they would join the national army. In practice, though, they have maintained their own leadership.",
      "\u201cThis is not a professional army,\u201d said Issam al-Reis, a military adviser with Etana, a Syrian research group. \u201cIn theory, there are plans to join the factions into an army and merge everybody together under the Ministry of Defense. But so far, in reality, on the ground, everybody is still under his own umbrella.\u201d",
      "On the other side, there are thousands of former soldiers from the disbanded Assad-era army who are now unemployed and \u201cvery easy targets\" for local or international actors interested in upsetting Syria's fragile stability, al-Reis said.",
      "The sectarian violence over the weekend was difficult to contain, analysts say, because the government had to turn to a patchwork of undisciplined factions \u2014 including armed civilians -- to combat pro-Assad militants who attacked security forces along the coast. Members of some of those factions launched bloody revenge attacks on Alawite civilians.",
      "The violence only reinforced the \u201csignificant challenge to the Syrian (government's) efforts to consolidate power,\u201d said Kahf, of the Omran Center for Strategic Studies.",
      "Unexpectedly, the violence appears to have expedited the deal to bring the Kurdish-led armed group controlling most of northeastern Syria, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, under the umbrella of the national army.",
      "The agreement came about when it did because al-Sharaa \u201cneeded to achieve a diplomatic victory\" after the weekend violence damaged his image, said Ahmed Aba Zeid, a Syrian researcher. At the same time, the SDF calculated it could \u201cachieve greater gains if it gave Sharaa this gift at this time,\u201d he said.",
      "Under the agreement, border crossings, airports and oil fields in the northeast will also be brought under the central government\u2019s control by the end of the year. Many details still need to be ironed out \u2014 including who will manage prisons holding Islamic State fighters captured by SDF \u2014 but the agreement gives al-Sharaa a much-needed political boost.",
      "He appears to have eliminated \"the two most significant threats of division in the country within days,\u201d Aba Zeid said.",
      "The agreement between the SDF and the Syrian government came about with the blessing of two important international players: the United States, which has supported the SDF as a key ally in the fight against the Islamic State militant group; and Turkey, which backs Syria's new leaders.",

      "Controversial Romanian politician Diana Sosoaca, who was barred by a top court from entering last year\u2019s annulled presidential election, has filed her candidacy in an unlikely bid to enter in the May rerun",
      "BUCHAREST, Romania -- Controversial Romanian politician Diana Sosoaca, who was barred by a top court from entering last year\u2019s annulled presidential election, filed her candidacy on Thursday in an unlikely bid to enter the May rerun.",
      "The 49-year-old former lawyer and Member of the European Parliament of the far-right nationalist S.O.S. Romania party filed her candidacy at the Central Election Bureau in the capital, Bucharest. The bureau has 48 hours to register or reject. Rejections can be appealed within 24 hours.",
      "The Constitutional Court, or CCR, barred the pro-Russia politician from entering last year\u2019s race, arguing that her public discourse, including opposition to Romania \u2019s European Union and NATO memberships, made her unfit to uphold the constitutional obligations of the presidency.",
      "\u201cAfter analyzing the whole situation with our lawyers, they are no longer allowed to ban me because you cannot ban the same candidate twice for the same reasons,\u201d Sosoaca, wearing a pair of white boxing gloves, told a news conference Thursday.",
      "However, Cristi Danilet, a former Romanian judge, expects Sosoaca\u2019s second bid to be rejected. The CCR\u2019s previous ruling \u201cis already a judicial precedent. Therefore, a new candidacy of hers must be rejected,\u201d he told The Associated Press.",
      "The court\u2019s decision last year drew strong criticism from some civil rights groups and politicians, who denounced it as undermining democracy or politically motivated.",
      "The first round of the rerun is scheduled for May 4. If no candidate wins more than 50% of the ballots, a runoff will follow on May 18. The deadline for presidential candidacy applications is March 15 at midnight.",
      "Romania\u2019s president serves a five-year term and has significant decision-making powers in areas such as national security, foreign policy and judicial appointments.",
      "Sosoaca\u2019s candidacy marks the latest twist in a turbulent presidential election following the CCR\u2019s decision last year to annul the election two days before a Dec. 8 runoff. The court made that decision after allegations emerged of electoral violations and claims that Russia had run a coordinated online campaign to promote Calin Georgescu, who ran as an independent. Moscow has denied meddling in the election.",
      "It also comes two days after the same court unanimously rejected an appeal by the far-right Georgescu, who sought to overturn a ban on his candidacy to participate in the rerun after the Central Election Bureau refused to register him on Sunday.",
      "Romania\u2019s decision to annul the election, and this week\u2019s ban on Georgescu\u2019s candidacy, has been strongly criticized by U.S. Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and Moscow.",
      "Romania\u2019s far-right, which holds about a third of seats in the country's legislature, is now scrambling to replace Georgescu\u2019s candidacy.",
      "After a meeting with Georgescu, George Simion, the 38-year-old leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, and Anamaria Gavrila, the leader of the right-wing populist Party of Young People, both stated on Wednesday that they intend to file their presidential bids in the coming days.",
      "\u201cWe have to (collect) until Friday 200,000 signatures, but things are moving like never before, incredible mobilization. People are waiting in queues to sign,\u201d Simion, who came fourth in last year\u2019s first-round vote with 13.8% of the ballots, told the AP on Thursday.",
      "Simion, who is currently under criminal investigation for inciting violence during a protest after Georgescu was barred from running, says he\u2019s concerned his bid could be blocked. \u201cThe real battle is that they don\u2019t ban me like they did with Georgescu and Sosoaca,\u201d he added. He has denied any wrongdoing and claimed it is politically motivated.",
      "Gavrila said on Wednesday that if both of their candidacies are validated, one of them will step down from running. \u201cWe must give this sovereigntist movement every possible chance,\u201d she said.",
      "Elena Lasconi, leader of the Save Romania Union party, who was set to face Georgescu in the scheduled runoff last year, is also expected to stand as a candidate. She has described the current political crisis as \u201ca turning point\u201d for Romania.",
      "Victor Ponta, a former prime minister between 2012-2015 and former leader of Romania\u2019s leftist Social Democratic Party, filed his bid on Wednesday on a \u201cRomania First\u201d ticket.",
      "\u201cI feel the need for a radical change ... a new beginning is needed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's a system that failed during past years and was against the people.\u201d",
      "Two confirmed candidates include incumbent Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan, who is running as an independent under the campaign slogan \u201cHonest Romania,\u201d and Crin Antonescu, the joint presidential candidate backed by Romania\u2019s governing coalition.",
      "Several others are expected to file bids. Factoring in potential candidacy rejections and subsequent appeals, the final list of confirmed candidates will be known on March 19."

      "BEIJING -- U.S. President Donald Trump threw a curve ball at China by linking the fentanyl issue to his tariffs on imports. The Chinese government is swinging back.",
      "First it issued a report detailing its efforts to control the illegal trade in fentanyl, specifically the ingredients for the opioid that are made in China. Then, the Chinese foreign minister blasted the U.S. for responding to Beijing's goodwill with tariffs. And this week, Chinese officials expressed their indignation at a rare background briefing with journalists.",
      "\u201cIn the spirit of humanity, China assisted the U.S. in various ways,\u201d Foreign Minister Wang Yi told journalists last week in an annual appearance before the media. \"The U.S. should not meet good with evil or even impose arbitrary tariffs. No responsible major country should do that.\u201d",
      "Trump cited the fentanyl issue as the reason for imposing a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports in early February, on top of any existing duties. He doubled that to 20% earlier this month. He also has cited fentanyl, along with other reasons, for imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico.",
      "In his executive order on the first 10% tariff, Trump accused China of subsidizing chemical companies to export fentanyl and related \u201cprecursor chemicals\u201d and of providing a safe haven for Chinese criminal organizations that launder the revenues from the opioid trade.",
      "It's not unusual for the Chinese government to subsidize industries, and the precursor chemicals are also used to make legal painkillers. But some of the production finds it way to Mexican drug cartels who make fentanyl and send it to the United States.",
      "\u201cDespite multiple attempts to resolve this crisis at its root source through bilateral dialogue, PRC officials have failed to follow through with the decisive actions needed to stem the flow of precursor chemicals to known criminal cartels,\u201d the statement said, referring to China by the acronym for the People\u2019s Republic of China, its official name.",
      "The Chinese government hit back both times Trump imposed tariffs with its own duties on selected U.S. products and other measures aimed at American companies. Analysts have described the response as a measured one designed to try to avoid an escalation of the trade war, which could deal a blow to an already sluggish Chinese economy.",
      "The government's report on its fentanyl-related actions said that China and the U.S. have held multiple high-level meetings since early last year to promote cooperation, and that its Narcotics Control Bureau holds regular exchanges with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency.",
      "China is committed to cooperation, the report said, \u201cbut firmly opposes the U.S. imposition of unlawful sanctions and unreasonable pressure on China on the pretext of responding to fentanyl-related issues.\"",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, cooperation on fentanyl was relaunched in early 2024 after falling victim to geopolitics in 2022. In August of that year, a visit to Taiwan by a top U.S. legislator, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, angered China, and the government responded by cutting off talks on a range of issues including drug control.",
      "A rapprochement in late 2023, negotiated over several months, led to a meeting on fentanyl in January of last year. Drug enforcement, like climate, was held up as an area where the two countries could cooperate despite growing differences and their military, economic and technological competition.",
      "Now Trump, back in the White House after a four-year hiatus, is trying to shift the playing field in the U.S.-China relationship. So far, China has indicated it won't blink.",
      "\u201cIf the American side goes further down this wrong path, we will fight to the end,\u201d Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said last week.",

      "LONDON -- A lawyer argued Thursday that global mining giant BHP Group should be held liable for Brazil\u2019s worst environmental disaster 10 years ago when a dam collapse poured tons of toxic mining waste into a major waterway that killed 19 people and devastated villages.",
      "High Court Justice Finola O\u2019Farrell said she would rule later in the class action case in which claimants are seeking 36 billion pounds ($47 billion) in damages from Australia-based BHP. The case was filed in Britain because one of BHP\u2019s two main legal entities was based in London at the time.",
      "BHP owns 50% of Samarco, the Brazilian company that operates the iron ore mine where the tailings dam ruptured on Nov. 5, 2015. Enough mine waste to fill 13,000 Olympic-size swimming pools poured into the Doce River in southeastern Brazil.",
      "\u201cAs a result of its heavy involvement in Samarco\u2019s operations, BHP had many opportunities to avert disaster but failed to do so and instead kept allowing and encouraging the dam to be raised by constantly pushing for ever greater production by Samarco,\u201d attorney Alain Choo Choy said in his closing argument.",
      "A defense lawyer had argued that BHP did not own or operate the Fundao dam and the company was not responsible for the pollution. The company also said a deadline to bring the claims had expired before the lawsuit was filed on behalf of 600,000 Brazilians.",

      "The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell slightly last week, indicating a still-healthy U.S. labor market.",
      "U.S. jobless claims filings fell by 2,000 to 220,000 for the week ending March 8, the Labor Department said Thursday. That\u2019s fewer than the 226,000 new applications analysts forecast.",
      "It\u2019s not clear when job cuts ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency will show up in the weekly layoffs report, though some analysts expect them to surface in data in the coming weeks.",
      "Those layoffs are part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Senior U.S. officials set the government downsizing in motion weeks ago via a memo dramatically expanding President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to scale back the workforce. Thousands of probationary employees have already been fired, and now the Republican administration is turning its attention to career officials with civil service protection.",
      "Despite showing some signs of weakening during the past year, the labor market remains healthy with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs.",
      "The Labor Department reported that U.S. employers added a solid 151,000 jobs last month, with employment rising in healthcare, finance and transportation and warehousing. The unemployment rate ticked up to a still-healthy 4.1%.",
      "Overall, while layoffs remain low by historical standards, some high-profile companies have announced job cuts already this year.",
      "Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines and Facebook parent company Meta have all trimmed their workforces already in 2025.",
      "Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered a proxy for layoffs, and have remained mostly in a range between 200,000 and 250,000 for the past few years.",
      "The four-week average, which evens out some of the week-to-week swings, ticked up by 1,500 to 226,000.",
      "The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week of March 1 fell by 27,000 to 1.87 million.",

      "The decision \"not only removes a valuable resource for users, but it also provides an air of legitimacy to a popular disinformation narrative: That fact-checking is politically biased. Fact-checkers provide a valuable service by adding important context to the viral claims that mislead and misinform millions of users on Meta,\u201d said Dan Evon, lead writer for RumorGuard, the News Literacy Project\u2019s digital tool that curates fact checks and teaches people to spot viral misinformation.",
      "Meta began fact checks in December 2016, after President Donald Trump was elected to his first term, in response to criticism that \u201cfake news\u201d was spreading on its platforms.

      "Now, safety experts and family members who lost loved ones in the Jan. 29 crash are asking why no one acted in the face of what appeared to be a looming disaster.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board said airplane pilots were alerted to take evasive action to avoid hitting helicopters at least once a month from 2011 through 2024, citing data compiled by the Federal Aviation Administration, and that there were 85 near misses when aircraft were within a few hundred feet (meters) of each other during recent years.",

      "Pilots have long worried about the congested and complex airspace around the airport near the heart of the capital, where flights must maneuver around military aircraft and restricted areas. It was no secret there had been previous close calls, but the numbers found by the NTSB were alarming.",

      "\u201cIf someone was paying attention, someone was on the job, they would have seen this,\u201d Duffy said. He also announced he will move forward with banning some helicopter flights around the airport, a move that was temporarily made after the crash.",

      "But Congress has a history of directing the FAA to add slots at Reagan, even though Washington\u2019s other international airport, Dulles, has capacity to handle them. Reagan is closer to the capital and most federal departments and therefore more convenient, particularly for lawmakers.",
      "Mike McCormick, coordinator of the Air Traffic Management program at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said the congestion at Reagan National clearly contributed to the midair collision because the American Airlines jetliner, which was on a newly added route from Wichita, Kansas, was diverted to a different runway closer to the helicopter flights.",
      "\u201cIn this instance, the sole reason for doing it was because they were too busy,\u201d McCormick said. \u201cThis is something that controller has probably done thousands of times.\u201d",

Versace is in my DNA and always in my heart.\u2019\u2019",

      "A groundbreaking climate lawsuit heads to trial in Germany next week, as Peruvian farmer Sa\u00fal Luciano Lliuya challenges German energy giant RWE",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- As a crucial climate lawsuit heads to trial in Germany next week, experts say the case brought by Peruvian farmer Saul Luciano Lliuya against German energy giant RWE could set a significant precedent in the fight to hold major polluters accountable for climate change.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the first cases of its kind \u2014 a case brought by someone directly affected by climate change against a major greenhouse gas emitter \u2014 that has made it all the way to trial,\u201d said Noah Walker-Crawford, a research fellow at the London School of Economics and an adviser to the non-profit Germanwatch, which has been advising Lliuya.",
      "Lliuya\u2019s lawsuit against RWE argues that the company\u2019s historical greenhouse gas emissions have fueled global warming, accelerating glacial melt above his hometown of Huaraz, Peru. As a result, Lake Palcacocha has swelled to dangerous levels, threatening the community with the risk of catastrophic flooding.",
      "RWE, which has never operated in Peru, denies legal responsibility, arguing that climate change is a global issue caused by many contributors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very sad and painful to see the glaciers melting,\u201d Lliuya, 45, told Associated Press in a video call from Germany. \u201cThere is a lot of concern from people in my community about the future, about the issue of water, because all the rivers that come down from the mountains are used for farming.\u201d",
      "Walker-Crawford said of all these cases around the world, this is the one that\u2019s gone the furthest.",
      "\u201cIt has already set a partial precedent in that the courts found it admissible in 2017, which means that the judges said the case is solid in legal terms,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, the court is hearing evidence, and we\u2019ll see whether the company\u2019s responsibility can be proven in this specific case.\u201d",
      "Sebastien Duyck, a senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law, says the reason why the case is so significant is not the decision itself or the amount of damages sought, but the precedent it would set.",
      "\u201cIf we could use tort law to say that any fossil fuel corporation that has contributed significantly to climate change can be held liable for climate-related costs in proportion to their emissions, it could open the door for many similar cases worldwide,\u201d he said.",
      "The case could be \u201ca game changer\u201d, according to Murray Worthy, from Zero Carbon Analytics, a research group on climate change.",
      "\u201cThis case is absolutely crucial,\" Worthy said. \u201cWhile this is just one case focused on this one place in Peru, the wider implications are huge. The costs and damages from climate change could run to tens of trillions of dollars a year, and if fossil fuel companies at large are found to be responsible for those and need to pay those costs, it would completely change the finances and outlook for the entire fossil fuel industry.\u201d",
      "RWE is one of Germany\u2019s largest energy companies, historically recognized as a major producer of electricity from fossil fuels.",
      "RWE says the lawsuit is legally inadmissible and that it sets a dangerous precedent by holding individual emitters accountable for global climate change.",
      "\u201cIn our view, there is no legal basis for holding individual issuers liable for global phenomena such as climate change. Due to the large number of global emissions of greenhouse gases from both natural and human sources, as well as the complexity of the climate, it is not possible, in our opinion, to legally attribute specific effects of climate change to a single issuer,\u201d the company said in response to questions posed by AP.",
      "The company insists climate solutions should be addressed through state and international policies, not the courts.",
      "Walker-Crawford said the court is entering the evidence-gathering phase, examining whether Lliuya's home actually faces a significant risk of flooding.",

      "Discount carrier Spirit Airlines has emerged from bankruptcy protection",
      "NEW YORK -- Discount carrier Spirit Airlines has emerged from bankruptcy protection.",
      "The budget airline \u2014 known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of yellow planes \u2014 said Wednesday that its parent, Spirit Aviation Holdings, exited Chapter 11 after finalizing debt restructuring. The reorganization plan, which received the court greenlight last month, aims to bring the carrier back to profitability and boost resources to compete with rivals.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re emerging as a stronger and more focused airline,\u201d CEO Ted Christie, who will continue to lead Spirit post-bankruptcy, said in a statement.",
      "The restructuring deal allows Spirit to convert $795 million of its debt into equity. The company says it's also received a $350 million equity investment from existing investors to aid future operations.",
      "Spirit filed for bankruptcy back in November, following years of struggles and mounting debt as it failed to bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Florida carrier was particularly hit hard by rising operating expenses and stiffer competition. By the time of its Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.",
      "Whether Spirit will continue as a standalone airline has also been up in the air, although takeover attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier have proven to be unsuccessful before and during the bankruptcy process. Spirit rejected a third bid from Frontier last month.",
      "While future merger proposals may not be entirely off the table, Spirit signaled Wednesday that it would continue to focus its own growth and offerings. Christie noted that the airline would be \"moving forward with our strategy to redefine low-fare travel with our new, high-value travel options.\u201d",
      "In an evolution from its budget-exclusive roots, Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities. Last year, months before filing for Chapter 11, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks.",
      "In a message sent to Spirit customers Wednesday, Christie continued to point those four travel options from the airline, which he said \u201clet you choose how you want to fly.\"",
      "Wednesday's announcement also noted plans to trade shares publicly again, although not immediately. Shares of Spirit previously issued by Spirit Airlines Inc. was canceled upon its exit from bankruptcy \u2014 but it expects to re-list shares, newly-issued under new owners, \u201cas soon as reasonably practicable.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile \u2014 between wider economic turmoil, high-profile plane crashes and other consumer uncertainty \u2014 major airlines have issued warnings in recent days about falling demand. Carriers like Delta, Southwest, American have all recently downgraded revenue outlooks for the first quarter.",

    "story": [
      "Florida\u2019s citrus growers are struggling to survive the one-two punch of hurricanes and disease",
      "LAKE WALES, Fla. -- As Trevor Murphy pulls up to his dad's 20-acre (8-hectare) grove in one of the fastest-growing counties in the United States, he points to the cookie-cutter, one-story homes encroaching on the orange trees from all sides.",
      "\u201cAt some point, this isn't going to be an orange grove anymore,\" Murphy, a third-generation grower, says as he gazes at the rows of trees in Lake Wales, Florida. \"You look around here, and it's all houses, and that's going to happen here.\u201d",
      "Polk County, which includes Lake Wales, contains more acres of citrus than any other county in Florida. And in 2023, more people moved to Polk County than any other county in the country.",
      "Hit in recent years by hurricanes and citrus greening disease, which slowly kills the trees, many growers are making the difficult decision to sell orange groves that have been in their families for generations to developers building homes to house the growing population.",
      "Others, like Murphy, are sticking it out, hoping to survive until a bug-free tree or other options arrive to repel the disease or treat the trees.",
      "When Hurricane Irma blasted through the state's orange belt in 2017, Florida's signature crop already had been on a downward spiral for two decades because of the greening disease. Next came a major freeze and two more hurricanes in 2022, followed by two hurricanes last year. A tree that loses branches and foliage in a hurricane can take three years to recover, Murphy said.",
      "Those catastrophes contributed to a 90% decline in orange production over the past two decades. Citrus groves in Florida, which covered more than 832,00 acres (336,698 hectares) at the turn of the century, populated scarcely 275,000 acres (111,288 hectares) last year, and California has eclipsed Florida as the nation's leading citrus producer.",
      "\u201cLosing the citrus industry is not an option. This industry is ... so ingrained in Florida. Citrus is synonymous with Florida,\u201d Matt Joyner, CEO of trade association Florida Citrus Mutual told Florida lawmakers recently.",
      "Nevertheless, Alico Inc., one of Florida\u2019s biggest growers, announced this year that it plans to wind down its citrus operations on more than 53,000 acres (21,000 hectares), saying its production has declined by almost three-quarters in a decade.",
      "That decision hurts processors, including Tropicana, which rely on Alico\u2019s fruit to produce orange juice and must now operate at reduced capacity. Orange juice consumption in the U.S. has been declining for the past two decades, despite a small bump during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "A prominent growers group, the Gulf Citrus Growers Association, closed its doors last year.",
      "Pressure on citrus farming is also growing from one of the state's other biggest industries: real estate.",
      "Florida expanded by more than 467,000 people last year to 23 million people, making it the third largest state in the nation. And more homes must be built to house that ever-growing population.",
      "Some prominent, multi-generational citrus families each have been putting hundreds of acres (hectares) of groves up for sale for millions of dollars, or as much as $25,000 an acre.",
      "Murphy owns several hundred acres (hectares) of groves and says he has no plans to abandon the industry, though last year he closed a citrus grove caretaking business that managed thousands of acres for other owners.",
      "However, he also has a real estate license, which is useful given the amount of land that is changing hands. He recently sold off acres in Polk County to a home developer, and has used that money to pay off debt and develop plans to replant thousands of trees in more productive groves.",
      "\u201cI would like to think that we\u2019re at the bottom, and we\u2019re starting to climb back up that hill,\u201d Murphy says.",
      "A whole ecosystem of businesses dependent on Florida citrus is at risk if the crops fail, including 33,000 fulltime and part-time jobs and an economic impact of $6.8 billion in Florida alone. Besides growers, there are juice processors, grove caretakers, fertilizer sellers, packing houses, nurseries and candy manufacturers, all hoping for a fix for citrus greening disease.",
      "Tom Davidson, whose parents founded Davidson of Dundee Citrus Candy and Jelly Factory in Lake Wales in 1966, says the drop in citrus production has impacted what flavor jellies the business is able to produce and the prices it charges to customers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really hoping that the scientists can get this figured out so we can we can get back to what we did,\u201d Davidson says.",
      "Researchers have been working for eight years on a genetically modified tree that can kill the tiny insects responsible for citrus greening. The process involves inserting a gene into a citrus tree that produces a protein that can kill baby Asian citrus psyllids by making holes in their guts, according to Lukasz Stelinski, an entomology professor at the University of Florida/Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences' Citrus Research and Education Center.",
      "It could be at least three years before bug-resistant trees can be planted, leaving Florida growers looking for help from other technologies. They include planting trees inside protective screens and covering young trees with white bags to keep out the bugs, injecting trees with an antibiotic, and finding trees that have become resistant to greening through natural mutation and distributing them to other groves.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like being a Lions fan before the Detroit Lions started to win games,\u201d Stelinski says. \u201cI'm hoping that we are making that turnaround.\u201d",

      "The U.S. is suddenly looking less bubbly for European wines",
      "The United States is suddenly looking less bubbly for European wines.",
      "President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened a 200% tariff on European wine, Champagne and spirits if the European Union goes forward with a planned 50% tariff on American whiskey. Wine sellers and importers said a tariff of that size would essentially shut down the European wine business in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think customers are prepared to pay two to three times more for their favorite wine or Champagne,\u201d Ronnie Sanders, the CEO of Vine Street Imports in Mt. Laurel Township, New Jersey, said.",
      "Jeff Zacharia, president of fine wine retailer Zachys in Port Chester, New York, said 80% of the wine he sells is from Europe. Importers depend on European wines for a big part of their distribution system, he said, and there\u2019s not enough U.S. wine to make up for that.",
      "\u201cThis is just going to have a major negative impact on the whole U.S. wine industry in all aspects of it, including U.S. wineries,\u201d he said.",
      "Zacharia said there are so many unknowns right now he's stopped buying European wine until the picture becomes clearer.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to make preparations when as a business you don\u2019t have a clear path forward,\u201d he said. \u201cOur preparations would be very different if it\u2019s 200% compared to 100% compared to 10%.\u201d",
      "Wine and spirits from the 27-nation European Union made up 17% of the total consumed in the U.S. in 2023, according to IWSR, a global data and insight provider specializing in alcohol. Of that 17%, Italy accounted for 7% -- mostly from wine \u2013 and French wine, cognac and vodka accounted for 5%.",
      "Overall, the U.S. imports much more alcohol than it exports. The $26.6 billion worth of foreign-produced alcoholic beverages that entered the country in 2022 accounted for 14% percent of all U.S. agricultural imports, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The U.S. exported $3.9 billion worth of beer, wine and distilled spirits that year.",
      "Marten Lodewijks, president of IWSR U.S., said a 200% tariff would not be unprecedented but import duties of that size tend to be more targeted.",
      "In 2020, China imposed tariffs as high as 218% on Australian wine, which caused exports to plunge by 90%, Lodewijks said. China lifted the tariffs last year, but by then Australia's wine industry had taken a big hit. Australia's wine trade to China was worth 1.1 billion Australian dollars ($710 million) annually before the tariffs were put in place.",
      "Europe's tax on American whiskey, which was unveiled in response to the Trump administration's steel and aluminum tariffs, is expected to go into effect on April 1. Trump responded Thursday in a social media post.",
      "\"If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cThis will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.\u201d",
      "Trump was incorrect about the Champagne business. Champagne is a legally protected wine that can only come from France\u2019s Champagne region. But U.S. winemakers \u2014 including Trump Winery, a Virginia winery owned by the president's son Eric Trump \u2014 do make sparkling wine.",
      "Reaction from across the Atlantic was swift Thursday.",
      "\u201cWe must stop a dangerous escalation that is leading to a global trade war where the first victims will be U.S. citizens who will pay more for products, and with them, farmers,\u2019\u2019 Ettore Prandini, president of Italy's Coldiretti agriculture lobby, said.",
      "Italian wine exports to the U.S. \u2013 led by prosecco -- have tripled in value over the last 20 years and reached 1.9 billion euros ($2.1 billion) last year. In France, the U.S. market for wines and spirits is worth 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) annually.",
      "Gabriel Picard, who heads the French Federation of Exporters of Wines and Spirits, said 200% tariffs would be \u201ca hammer blow\u201d for France\u2019s alcohol export industry, impacting hundreds of thousands of people.",
      "\u201cNot a single bottle will continue to be expedited if 200% tariffs are applied to our products. All exports to the United States will come to a total, total, halt,\u201d Picard said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "French transporter Grain de Sail, which uses sail power to ship wines and other goods across the Atlantic, said Thursday that some winemakers had already cancelled planned shipments of wine to the U.S. because they were anticipating tariffs even before Trump's announcement.",
      "\u201cIt has more or less frozen exports. There's no point even hoping to send wine to the United States under these conditions,\u201d said Jacques Barreau, the firm\u2019s co-founder.",
      "Some U.S. wine stores saw an opportunity Thursday. In Washington, the wine bar Cork announced a tariff sale, encouraging regulars to come stock up on their favorite wines while they\u2019re still affordable.",
      "Others wondered aloud whether Trump would really go through with a 200% tariff.",
      "\u201cIt changes by the hour now, right?\" Mark O\u2019Callaghan, the founder of Exit 9 Wine & Liquor Warehouse in Clifton Park, New York, said. European wines make up around 35% of sales at his store, he said.",

      "The Trump administration\u2019s recent changes to student loans are causing frustration and confusion for some borrowers",
      "NEW YORK -- The Trump administration's recent changes to student loans are causing frustration and confusion for some borrowers.",
      "In response to a February court ruling that blocked some Biden-era programs, the Education Department has taken down online and paper applications for income-driven repayment plans.",
      "\u201cThis especially hurts anyone who\u2019s lost their jobs, including federal workers,\u201d said Natalia Abrams, founder and president of the Student Debt Crisis Center. \u201cA few months ago, they would have been able to get on a zero-dollar income-driven repayment plan.\u201d",
      "The removal of application materials also has caused confusion around the recertification process for borrowers already enrolled in repayment plans, experts say. Income-driven repayment plans take a borrower's finances and family size into account when calculating monthly payments, but borrowers must periodically demonstrate they still qualify.",
      "Adding to the uncertainty are layoffs at the Education Department, which oversees the federal loan system. The federal website for student loans and financial aid, StudentAid.gov, suffered an hours-long outage Wednesday, but the department has said it will continue to deliver on its commitments.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been wave after wave of bad news for student borrowers,\" said Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at the Student Borrower Protection Center.",
      "Here's some guidance for those with student loans.",
      "All borrowers currently enrolled in income-driven repayment plans should \u201cget a sense of when your recertification deadline is and get a sense of what options are available to you if the form is not available online to recertify your income,\" Ba\u00f1ez said.",
      "Recertification confirms a borrower's financial situation. With some forms not currently available, borrowers who are unable to complete that process could be in jeopardy.",
      "If borrowers are already on an income-driven repayment plan, they should still be allowed to remain on that repayment plan if they are able to recertify their income.",
      "Abrams said it's also a good idea to take screenshots of your account's current status on the student aid website.",
      "State-specific and state-level resources are available for student borrowers. Congress members have teams charged with helping constituents if they are having trouble with a federal agency or struggling to contact a federal student loan servicer.",
      "Borrowers may contact their representatives in Congress and open a casework file by going onto their website or calling their office.",
      "\u201cTry saying something like, \u2018I need your help to understand how to get into an affordable repayment option, which I\u2019m entitled to under the law,\u2019\u201d Ba\u00f1ez said. \u201c\u2018Even though this federal department has taken down these applications, I need your help.\u2019\u201d",
      "Despite the thinning of the Education Department and President Donald Trump's dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, loan servicers still must consider a borrower\u2019s financial situation, Ba\u00f1ez said.",
      "\u201cYou can see if you can get temporary forbearance or a deferment of payments for financial hardship,\u201d she said.",
      "State attorneys general also take inquiries from student borrowers.",
      "Jessica Fugate, a government relations manager for the city of Los Angeles, said she was a less than a year from student loan forgiveness under the Biden-era Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives outstanding loans after 120 payments.",
      "With an ongoing court challenge to her former SAVE payment plan, though, Fugate hoped to switch to an income-driven plan before Trump took office. She applied in January.",
      "\u201cIt's the most affordable option to repay my loans while living in Los Angeles working for the government on a government salary,\u201d said Fugate, 42. \u201cAnd it would mean my payments counted towards forgiveness.\u201d",
      "As of February, Fugate notified that her application was received and she had been notified of its status, but they didn't say when she would know if she was approved.",
      "\u201cAnd when I called recently, the machine said there was a four hour wait,\u201d she said.",
      "With income-driven repayment plans in limbo, Fugate isn't sure what her options are and hopes to one day have her federal loans behind her.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been working for government for almost 10 years. After that much time, you don\u2019t do it for the glory,\u201d she said. \u201cI've spent most of my career giving back to other people. I don't mind serving people. I just feel this was an agreement they made with the public, and so we're owed that. And it's a lot of us. And we're not just numbers.\u201d",
      "Debbie Breen, 56, works at an agency on healthy aging in Spokane, Washington. Breen said she has worked in the nonprofit sector for more than 10 years and that nearly all those years counted toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.",
      "Breen also was on the Biden-era SAVE plan, which means she was placed in forbearance when the court challenge to that plan was upheld. Like Fugate, she had planned to switch to an income-driven repayment plan to have her payments count towards forgiveness.",
      "\u201cI was months away from ending this nightmare,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I don\u2019t think that's going to happen. I\u2019m kind of in panic mode because I know that if they stop income-driven repayment plans, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m going to be able to afford the payments each month.\"",
      "Breen said she has two kids who also have student loans.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re dealing with the same thing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s scary. It\u2019s absolutely scary.\u201d",

      "As part of the effort to recover the megayacht, her attorneys stated in the filing that they seek documents and information related to wire transfers and other transactions involving seven people and 12 entities in the past five years.",
      "\u201cThe disappearance of millions from the sale of the Alfa Nero is just the beginning,\" said Martin De Luca, with Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, adding that the discovery seeks to uncover whether any alleged backroom deals for personal enrichment took place.",

      "The conglomerate did not immediately return a message seeking comment.",
      "Following the sale, Antigua\u2019s prime minister came under fire by opposition party members who demanded details of how the proceeds were spent. They have yet to receive any information.",
      "\u201cThe prime minister does not give information except what he wants people to know,\u201d said D. Gisele Isaac, chairperson of the opposition United Progressive Party. \u201cUp to now, he has never disclosed to us the name of the person who bought Alfa Nero.\u201d",

      "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The Tampa Bay Rays on Thursday withdrew from a $1.3 billion ballpark project, citing hurricanes and delays that likely will drive up the proposal's cost.",
      "The team issued a statement by principal owner Stuart Sternberg saying that \u201ca series of events\u201d in October, which included severe damage to the existing Tropicana Field and financing delays, led to what he called \u201cthis difficult decision.\u201d",
      "\u201cAfter careful deliberation, we have concluded we cannot move forward with the new ballpark and development project at this moment,\u201d Sternberg said.",
      "Displaced from the Trop in St. Petersburg, the Rays are set to play this season's home games across Tampa Bay at the New York Yankees' spring training home, 11,000-seat Steinbrenner Field. Meanwhile, repairs are envisioned to the Trop, including replacing its roof shredded by Hurricane Milton, that would have it ready for the 2026 season.",
      "Under their current contract with the city of St. Petersburg, the Rays would play three more seasons at their existing ballpark after it is repaired. Beyond that, the team\u2019s future in the Tampa Bay area is uncertain. MLB and the Rays could evaluate attendance and fan interest during the team's season in Tampa at Steinbrenner Field as they consider alternate sites.",
      "\u201cThe City of St. Petersburg is currently advancing plans to restore Tropicana Field for the 2026 season,\u201d Sternberg said. \u201cWe are thankful for their efforts and are excited to return to our home field next spring.\u201d",
      "The proposed 30,000-seat stadium is a signature piece of a broader $6.5 billion revitalization project known as the Historic Gas Plant District, which refers to a predominantly Black neighborhood that was forced out by construction of the Trop and an interstate highway spur.",
      "Supporters say the development would transform an 86-acre (34-hectare) tract in the city\u2019s downtown, with plans for a Black history museum, affordable housing, entertainment venues, plus office and retail space \u2014 and the promise of thousands of jobs.",
      "That broader project, counting on the Rays ballpark to be an anchor, is also in limbo with this decision.",

      "The top-ranked Blue Devils were trailing by 26-17 late in the first half when Flagg went up for a rebound and crashed to the floor after he appeared to have his left foot land on the foot of Georgia Tech\u2019s Darrion Sutton. He hobbled back to the bench in clear distress, then bent over with his hands on the seats and pounded a chair with his right fist.",
      "After sitting on the bench for a few minutes, Flagg got up and put his arms around two teammates and was taken to the locker room for observation.",
      "It\u2019s unclear if Flagg will return to the game.",

      "It's the World Series-champion Los Angeles Dodgers against the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday and Wednesday at the Tokyo Dome to start the Major League Baseball season",
      "TOKYO -- It's only two games to start the Major League Baseball season \u2014 the World Series-champion Dodgers against the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday and Wednesday at the Tokyo Dome.",
      "For the record, the MLB regular season consists of almost 2,500 games.",
      "But it's much more for Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, who was born in Japan. And for Shohei Ohtani and the four other Japanese players competing at home for the Dodgers and Cubs.",
      "Then there's MLB, which opens its regular season for the second straight year in the Asian market. A year ago it was Seoul, South Korea, where the Dodgers and San Diego Padres split two games. It was also where the betting scandal broke around Ohtani's interpreter.",
      "\u201cIt's hard to tell if this is the golden age for Japanese players in the United States,\u201d Ohtani said Friday, speaking through an interpreter, as both teams trained at the Tokyo Dome.",
      "\u201cI know there's been a lot of Japanese players that came before me,\" Ohtani added. \"But having five (Japanese players) is a big deal. It's truly a big deal.\u201d",
      "Asked what he was most looking forward to, Ohtani replied: \u201cEating good food, getting over the jetlag, and just being able to enjoy playing the game.\u201d",
      "It's a homecoming for Roberts, who was born on Japan's southern island of Okinawa to a Japanese mother and an American father. He's expecting relatives to attend from Okinawa, where last year he was honored by officials there.",
      "\u201cFor me it's personal because I get to represent my mom's side of the family,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI have a lot of relatives and family that can watch this baseball game \u2014 watch a Dodgers game at night instead of having to watch us in the morning.\u201d",
      "The time difference between Japan and the American east coast is 13 hours, and Japan is 16 hours ahead of Los Angeles.",
      "Japan is Dodgers country, swept away by Ohtani, the World Series title, and pitchers Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Roki Sasaki. They are expected to be the Dodgers starters against the Cubs",
      "\u201cI think our mission was accomplished painting the counry of Japan in Dodgers blue,\u201d Roberts said.",
      "Yamamoto and Ohtani talked about the joy of being home, as did Cubs pitcher Shota Imanaga and Seiya Suzuki, the likely DH. Imanaga is expected to start against Yamamoto in the first game.",
      "\u201cI hope my teammates are really enjoying Japan right now,\u201d Ohtani said. \"But also I hope the fans get to see my teammates enjoying Japan.\u201d",
      "Ohtani was reminded that he has not thrown a bullpen session in several weeks as he hopes to return to pitching after missing out last season following elbow surgery.",
      "\u201cI want to prioritize the hitting aspect as we're getting into the season, to give a little breather mentally and physically to the pitching side of thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is according to plan and I'm pleased with how things have been going.\u201d",
      "For Sasaki, it's different. The 23-year-old signed with the Dodgers two months ago and needs to prove himself, though many feel he's a can't-miss prospect.",
      "\u201cI literally was in Japan until a couple of months ago,\u201d he said through an interpreter. \u201cFor me it\u2019s more about being able to pitch in a different uniform on a differnt team and make sure I do perform at my best.\u201d",
      "Sasaki met Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Friday in his office and gave him an autographed Dodgers cap. He was accompanied by Dodgers owner Mark Walter.",
      "\"I\u2019m truly happy that the Dodgers are opening the season in Japan,\u201d Japanese media reported Ishiba as saying.",
      "Cubs manager Craig Counsell talked about a party thrown Thursday by Imanaga and Suzuki to welcome the other Cubs to Japan. For most it's the first visit.",
      "What impressed Counsell was a large tuna that was carved up in a ceremony at the party. Sashimi and sushi for all.",
      "\u201cWe had tuna cut open,\" Counsell said. \"Some of the players participated in that, which was scary for a second with players with knives in their hands. But other than that it was great.\u201d",
      "Counsell said the trip to Japan was about \u201ckizuna,\u201d which is the Japanese word for bonding. He's obviously been schooled by his Japanese players.",
      "\u201cThat started for our team last night with the great party and being able to be together,\u201d Counsell said.",

      "Aaron Rodgers is officially no longer a member of the New York Jets",
      "Aaron Rodgers' much-hyped but overwhelmingly disappointing two-year tenure with the New York Jets is officially over.",
      "The team released the four-time MVP, as expected, and the 41-year-old quarterback can now join another team as a free agent for the first time in his career \u2014 if he stills intends to play a 21st NFL season.",
      "While the team didn\u2019t announce the move, which was a formality, it appeared on the league's transaction wire early Thursday morning.",
      "Meanwhile, the Jets absorbed a $49 million dead money charge by cutting Rodgers, but are able to spread that over two years instead of one \u2014 $14 million this year and $35 million next year \u2014 by designating him a post-June 1 cut.",
      "The Jets' new regime of general manager Darren Mougey and coach Aaron Glenn said on Feb. 13 that they informed Rodgers they were moving on without him. New York posted on its social media platforms at that time a picture of Rodgers in a black Jets uniform, with his back to the camera. The post read: \u201cFor everything you\u2019ve given us the past two years, thank you 8.\u201d",
      "On Monday, New York agreed to terms with former Steelers and Bears quarterback Justin Fields on a two-year deal worth $40 million with $30 million guaranteed. Fields is expected to step in as the Jets\u2019 starting quarterback.",

      "Rodgers was traded to the Jets in April 2023 after 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers \u2014 looking to help the franchise end a Super Bowl drought that dates to the glory days of Joe Namath and the 1968 season.",
      "Instead, Rodgers\u2019 stint was marked by a torn Achilles tendon four snaps into his debut that cost him his first season, and a disappointing 5-12 finish last season during which both coach Robert Saleh and GM Joe Douglas were fired.",
      "Rodgers finished his Jets tenure with six wins \u2014 including the victory during which he was injured \u2014 in 18 starts. His 28 touchdown passes and 3,897 yards passing last year both rank third for a single season in franchise history. But he lacked some mobility early in his return and then dealt with a few additional leg injuries, including a significant hamstring ailment that hobbled him.",
      "Rodgers has 503 regular-season touchdown passes (fifth in NFL history), joining Tom Brady (649), Drew Brees (571), Peyton Manning (539) and Brett Favre (508) as the only players to throw at least 500. His 62,952 yards passing rank seventh in NFL history.",

      "Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton racing a Ferrari for the first time",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton racing a Ferrari for the first time. Reigning world champion Max Verstappen arriving without a lot of mileage in his Red Bull. Lando Norris helping McLaren set a benchmark with his pace in testing.",
      "Formula 1 is expecting a hyper-competitive milestone 75th anniversary season in 2025, and it starts this weekend with the Australian Grand Prix. There\u2019s no shortage of unknowns in terms of the pecking order, and the weather.",
      "Most of the headlines ahead of Sunday\u2019s Australian GP have revolved around Hamilton\u2019s move to Ferrari from Mercedes.",
      "The normally relaxed pre-event news conference at Albert Park was overflowing with journalists and photographers on Thursday to hear from a rejuvenated Hamilton about how much he\u2019s enjoying the prancing horse-ride.",
      "The 40-year-old British driver is going into his 19th season in F1 but has had a different outlook since his first day in January at the Scuderia\u2019s Maranello HQ, where he's teammates with Charles Leclerc.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really approach this role with pressure,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cI think over the years, the pressure I put on myself has always been 10 times higher than any other pressure that could be put upon me. I haven\u2019t joined this team and been made to feel any pressure.",
      "\u201cI have an expectation for myself \u2014 I know what I can bring. I know what I can deliver. And I know what it\u2019s going to take.\u201d",
      "Norris has been trying to downplay his long-run pace that impressed the paddock during pre-season testing in Bahrain last month and made McLaren an early-season favorite.",
      "\u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of expectation,\u201d Norris said. \u201cIt was just my one race run I did that kind of just made everyone believe this quite heavily. It was a good race run, but it was also in the most perfect conditions.\"",
      "He tried to temper expectations by saying McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri 's run the following day \u201cwas a lot slower.\u201d \u201cNot because he drove worse,\" Norris explained, \u201cbut simply because the conditions on the final day were considerably slower.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no denying, though, that McLaren is confident going into the opening race of the season, even if they\u2019re not quite sure of their ultimate pace.",
      "\u201cNo one really knows what to expect,\u201d said Piastri, who is aiming to become the first Aussie to win the Australian F1 Grand Prix.",
      "\u201cTesting went pretty well, but you don\u2019t know where everybody stands. I think we\u2019re pretty happy with how our test went, but Melbourne is a completely different track to Bahrain. Weather is going to be different to Bahrain and different every hour, by the look of it.\u201d",
      "Ferrari took the contest to long-time rival McLaren in the second practice as Leclerc closed out the session on top, just over one-tenth of a second ahead of Piastri and Norris",
      "Leclerc and Norris traded fastest times throughout the late afternoon run, with their pace witnessed by 125,548 people at the leafy inner-city Albert Park circuit, a record Friday crowd for the Australian Grand Prix.",
      "Hamilton had a much stronger second session for Ferrari, with the seven-time world champion finishing fifth, just over fourth-tenths behind teammate Leclerc.",
      "Red Bull\u2019s second team, Racing Bulls, shaded the main squad, with Yuki Tsunoda and Isack Hadjar showing surprising speed to end the session in fourth and sixth.",
      "World champion Max Verstappen could do no better than seventh, almost a half-second behind in the second session. Haas rookie Oliver Bearman didn't enter the second practice after his crash in the morning session.",
      "The final practice will precede Saturday qualifying, which starts at 4 p.m. local time (0500 GMT).",
      "Piastri, born and bred in Melbourne, is correct. The southern Australian city is set to deliver this weekend on the famous \u201cfour seasons in one day\u201d expression that often describes Melbourne's ever-changeable weather.",
      "The Albert Park circuit should be comfortable for F1\u2019s opening practice sessions on Friday, with a partly cloudy day expected and a top of 27 degrees Celsius (80 Fahrenheit). Temperatures are expected to rise to 37C (98F) on Saturday for qualifying and then drop again again for the race on Sunday, when there's also rain on the forecast.",
      "A wet race would certainly mix things up, with teams needing to guess on setup following two days of dry running.",
      "Verstappen, though, whose Red Bull team did the least mileage in pre-season testing, says he\u2019s prepared for any conditions.",
      "\u201cI would like it to be dry because it\u2019s just nicer, (and) also for the fans,\u201d Verstappen said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s wet, it\u2019s wet. It\u2019s fine as well.\"",
      "Piastri won\u2019t be the only Aussie on the Melbourne grid. Jack Doohan, the son of five-time motorcycle world champion Mick Doohan, is starting his first full season with Alpine \u2013 which appears to have taken a significant step forward over its 2024 pace.",
      "Although speculation through pre-season has been whether Doohan will keep that seat, with his French team bringing in former Williams driver Franco Colapinto as a reserve.",
      "\u201cI have a contract for at least this year, if not more,\u201d said Doohan, who is one of six rookies this season, the most on the F1 grid since 2001. \u201cAnd the uncertainties? You don\u2019t bother worrying about them. I think I have to perform each and every time I\u2019m in the car.\u201d",
      "Ferrari secured a 1-2 finish in Melbourne last year led by Sainz, just two weeks after an appendectomy that sidelined him in Saudi Arabia. But the 30-year-old Sainz will likely be fighting for points and not podiums this time around now that he\u2019s at Williams.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely going to do my best to score (points) as soon as possible,\u201d Sainz said.",
      "Ferrari is the most successful team in Australia with 14 GP wins, dating back to Adelaide in 1987. Hamilton is one of five drivers on the current F1 grid to have won in Melbourne, with his victories in 2008 and 2015.",
      "Sunday\u2019s season opener will be the 39th World Championship Australian Grand Prix, and the 28th in Melbourne. It starts at 3 p.m. local time (0400 GMT).",

      "Minnesota fired coach Ben Johnson after four years of repeatedly rebuilding rosters at his alma mater",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Minnesota fired coach Ben Johnson on Thursday after four years of repeatedly rebuilding rosters at his alma mater without coming close to an NCAA Tournament appearance.",
      "It was a fleeting accomplishment for a program that has fallen behind in the rugged and expanded Big Ten.",
      "Johnson had two seasons remaining on his contract, which calls for a $2.92 million buyout. His annual salary was $1.95 million, the lowest in the 18-team league.",
      "The Gophers finished 15-17 after losing to Northwestern on Wednesday in the first round of the conference tournament. Athletic director Mark Coyle announced his decision early Thursday after a late-night meeting with Johnson upon the team's return from Indianapolis. The university posted the news on its website at 1:07 a.m. local time and on social media at 1:19 a.m.",
      "\u201cI thanked him for his dedication and for guiding the program, one he cares deeply about, for the last four years. Ben is a terrific person, and we wish him well,\u201d Coyle said in a statement distributed by the school. \u201cThese decisions are difficult and are made after careful consideration and evaluation. The expectation for our program is to compete for championships, and unfortunately, we have not done that in the last four years.\u201d",
      "Coyle, who serves on the NCAA Tournament selection committee, has long desired a return to relevancy in March for both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball teams. He worked previously at Kentucky and Syracuse, two campuses with long histories of hardwood success.",
      "\u201cThis is an extremely desirable job in one of the best conferences and cities in the nation, and we fully expect to compete at the highest level on and off the court,\" Coyle said. \"We provide a world-class experience for our student-athletes, have one of the best practice facilities in the nation and play games in a historic venue. We offer everything that is needed to be successful, and we will immediately begin a nationwide search for our next men\u2019s basketball coach.\u201d",
      "Minnesota went 56-71 under Johnson, including 22-57 in league play. The only team worse during that span was Washington, which just completed its first season as one of the Big Ten\u2019s four West Coast additions.",
      "The 44-year-old Johnson, who replaced Richard Pitino after previously serving five seasons as an assistant on his staff, was hired as a first-time head coach following three years as an assistant at Xavier. Johnson saw the top seven scorers from the 2020-21 team depart, coinciding with the NCAA\u2019s new transfer rules that allowed players to switch schools without having to sit out a season. Only two of 15 players from Pitino\u2019s last squad stayed, and the Gophers went 13-17.",
      "They bottomed out at 9-22 overall and 2-17 in the Big Ten in 2022-23, before making strides in 2023-24 with a spot in the NIT and a 19-15 finish. Their 9-11 conference record, though merely tied for ninth place, was significant considering Minnesota has hit the 10-win mark in Big Ten play just once in the last 20 years.",
      "But the advent of name, image and likeness earnings for college athletes threw yet another roadblock at Johnson\u2019s attempt to establish an identity and maintain some continuity, as programs with richer collectives lured key players away.",
      "Dawson Garcia, a second team All-Big Ten pick, stayed loyal for less and produced a stellar fifth season. But Pharrel Payne, another Minnesota native who would\u2019ve given the Gophers a formidable frontcourt for 2024-25, transferred to Texas A&M. Only four of the top 12 players from the 2023-24 team returned.",
      "\u201cThe money piece? It\u2019s everything. It\u2019s the only thing. I\u2019m going to be honest about it,\u201d Johnson said this season. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve been proud of is we have been pretty smart and wise with how we\u2019ve done this. Just in terms of return on your investment, I think we have been pretty good.\u201d",
      "There were bright spots after an 0-6 start in conference play, with back-to-back road wins on the difficult West Coast trip to USC and UCLA and home upsets of ranked foes in Michigan and Oregon.",
      "But the Gophers consistently struggled to score, particularly when opponents had an effective game plan for denying Garcia the ball or the paint, and ranked last in the conference in points per game.",
      "Attendance at 97-year-old Williams Arena has waned, with the NBA\u2019s Timberwolves a much hotter ticket for hoops in the city and plenty of other competition for entertainment dollars in a place that\u2019s far more of a pro market than a college town. Minnesota had long been the only Division I program in a state that regularly produces Division I talent, but now there\u2019s also a newcomer to Division I just down the road at St. Thomas.",

      "Several of Miller's former teams announced his death on Wednesday, as did the National Basketball Retired Players Association. A cause of death was not disclosed, but Arkansas had announced during an event honoring its 1990 Final Four team that Miller had cancer, and Miller thanked the team for its video tribute to him while posting it on social media last month.",
      "Known as the \u201cThe Big O\u201d for his 6-foot-9, 280-pound frame that ballooned to well over 300 pounds during his NBA career, Miller was a standout at Arkansas from 1988-92. He averaged 12.2 points and 6.5 rebounds in four seasons, helping Naismith Hall of Fame coach Nolan Richardson's 1989-90 team reach the Final Four before losing to Duke and earning Southwest Conference Player of the Year honors in 1991.",

We love you Big O. Our thoughts are with his family.\u201d",

      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Junior Bridgeman, a basketball standout who led Louisville to a Final Four, starred for the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks and then launched an even more successful career as a businessman with stakes in restaurants, publishing and the Bucks franchise, died Tuesday. He was 71.",
      "Bridgeman was a popular fixture in Louisville after his playing days, and Mayor Craig Greenberg announced his death, saying the city had \u201clost a kind, generous and groundbreaking legend.\u201d",
      "\"He was an All-American at U of L ... and a self-made billionaire,\" Greenberg said in a statement. \u201cYet I will most remember Junior Bridgeman for his quiet, impactful assistance to others in need\u201d as well as his love for his family and his \u201cnever-ending support for our community.\u201d",
      "Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, praised his friend as a highly successful businessman and generous philanthropist who loved his alma mater and \u201cthe city he called home.\u201d",
      "According to media reports, Bridgeman suffered a medical emergency at a Louisville hotel during a fundraising event Tuesday.",
      "Tributes poured in for a man who excelled on the hardwood and in corporate boardrooms.",
      "\u201cJunior was the ultimate entrepreneur who built on his impactful 12-year NBA playing career by becoming a highly respected and successful business leader,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. \u201cHe served as a mentor to generations of NBA players and athletes across sports who were eager to learn from him about what it takes to thrive in the business world.\u201d",
      "Bridgeman, a native of East Chicago, Indiana, played for Hall of Fame coach Denny Crum at Louisville. In three seasons, he scored 1,348 points, grabbed 657 rebounds and in his senior season led the Cardinals to the 1975 Final Four, where they lost to eventual national champion UCLA in a 75-74 thriller.",
      "Bridgeman was involved in one of the biggest trades in NBA history at the start of his professional career. After the Los Angeles Lakers selected Bridgeman with the eighth pick in the 1975 draft, they sent him to Milwaukee as part of the trade that brought Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to the West Coast.",
      "Bridgeman\u2019s 711 games played for Milwaukee ranks third in franchise history, behind only Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton. His No. 2 jersey was retired by the Bucks in 1988.",
      "\u201cHis hard work and perseverance led him to become one of the nation\u2019s top business leaders and, last September, Junior\u2019s professional life came full circle when he returned to the Bucks family as an owner,\u201d the Bucks said in a statement. \u201cHis memory will always be an inspiration to the Bucks organization.\u201d",
      "The Bucks announced Bridgeman had bought a stake in the team last year at a news conference that included co-owner Jimmy Haslam, coach Doc Rivers, general manager Jon Horst and many players. Bridgeman said afterward he had a 10% stake.",
      "\u201cThe opportunity to get back involved with the team in a different way and take advantage of it was something that was kind of a dream,\u201d Bridgeman said at the time.",
      "Prior to Milwaukee's game Tuesday night, Rivers said Bridgeman was a strong role model.",
      "\u201cThink about that kid growing up, wanting to be an NBA player, probably his dream, and he turned that dream into becoming an NBA owner,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cHe is the exact model the league should use every day when they are talking to our young players.\u201d",
      "Bridgeman played for the Bucks from 1975-84 and then spent two years with the Los Angeles Clippers before coming back to Milwaukee for his final NBA season in 1986-87. He scored 11,517 points (averaging 13.6 per game) in his career. He ranks seventh in Bucks history in field goals (4,142), ninth in points (9,892) and 10th in minutes (18,054).",
      "After his playing days, Bridgeman turned that same drive into a successful business career.",
      "\u201cWhile his play on the court was exceptional, it was as a leader in the business community that Junior truly excelled,\u201d University of Louisville President Kim Schatzel said in a statement.",
      "Bridgeman was a longtime franchisee for Wendy\u2019s and Chili\u2019s restaurants, at one time operating more than 450 locations in 20 states, the university said. He became a bottler for Coca-Cola and bought Ebony and Jet magazines, the school said.",
      "\u201cI had the privilege of playing against him, and I'll never forget how he had one of the sweetest jump shots in the NBA,\u201d retired Los Angeles Lakers star Magic Johnson wrote on X. \u201cWhat people don't realize is Junior didn't make a fortune as a player, but he turned what he earned into something extraordinary, becoming a billionaire African American businessman in this country.\u201d",
      "Bridgeman was part of the foursome that owns Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville. He also served on the boards of Churchill Downs racetrack, the University of Louisville and Fifth Third Bank, among others. He and his wife, Doris, hosted a Kentucky Derby party that served as a fundraiser.",
      "\u201cHe is the blueprint to so many current and former athletes across sports that success doesn't end when you're done playing,\u201d Johnson wrote.",

      "Former Wisconsin star Baylee Marabella had to play hockey alongside boys up until high school because she couldn\u2019t find a girls team in her area",
      "MILWAUKEE -- When Baylee Marabella got interested in ice hockey while growing up in Wisconsin, she had to play alongside boys up until high school because she couldn\u2019t find a girls team in her area.",
      "That isn\u2019t as much of a problem in hockey hotbeds such as Wisconsin anymore with a steady increase in the number of girls playing the sport. That trend helped launch the coaching career of Marabella, who was known as Baylee Wellhausen when she played on three Frozen Four teams with Wisconsin from 2014-18.",
      "Marabella now coaches Milwaukee School of Engineering, which just finished its inaugural season in Division III competition. It\u2019s one of more than two dozen D-III schools to start women\u2019s hockey teams over the last decade, capitalizing on the relative lack of cost compared to doing so in Division I.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d Marabella said of the rapid growth.",
      "MSOE was one of 78 schools to play women\u2019s ice hockey this year at the Division III level, which doesn't offer athletic scholarships. That represents a 50% increase from 2015, when there were 52 schools playing the sport at this level.",
      "Marabella believes those numbers can keep going up.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be more and more girls who want to play college (hockey), so as we keep moving forward, the demand is going to be higher,\u201d Marabella said.",
      "Women\u2019s hockey in North America is on the rise and not only at the Division III level. The Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League is two months from completing its second season amid signs that attendance is up. The six-team league is drawing an average of 7,300 fans this season \u2013 up from 5,500 last year \u2013 and might expand by as many as two franchise next season.",
      "USA Hockey had 73,083 registrations among girls in 2023-24, a 47.4% increase over its 2013-14 total (49,587). Boys registrations increased by 4.8% over the same time, from 302,303 to 316,737.",
      "\u201cOverall, the skill level has gotten so much better over the years that it becomes one of those sports that was almost a no-brainer to be adding at the Division III level,\u201d said Joe Cranston, who coaches defending champion Wisconsin-River Falls, which hosts the D-III championship March 28-30. The 12-team tournament begins Saturday on campus sites.",
      "There are 44 women's hockey programs in Division I and Division II, a 12.8% rise from 2015 (39). The two divisions compete in a single national tournament, which ends this year with the Women's Frozen Four March 21-23 in Minneapolis.",
      "The modest growth at the higher level can be blamed on the bigger costs with adding a D-I program. Ice availability is a factor for any team at any level, and setting budgets is difficult for any athletic director dealing with the NCAA House settlement and name, image and likeness compensation questions.",
      "Minnesota reported operating expenses of a little over $3.6 million for women\u2019s hockey in 2023-24. Michigan released a feasibility study saying expenses would run about $4.5 million annually if it started a women\u2019s hockey program.",
      "By contrast, Wisconsin-River Falls reported $197,087 in women\u2019s hockey expenses in its 2024 Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act survey.",
      "Michelle McAteer has a unique perspective, as a new commissioner of a Division I conference (the Western Collegiate Hockey Association) who finished a 14-season run coaching Division III program Augsburg last year.",
      "\u201cHockey\u2019s an expensive sport to operate, and to operate a rink is an expensive investment,\u201d McAteer said. \u201cAt the Division III level, not everyone has their own rinks on campus. You can get by playing in community rinks and renting. The facility demands at the Division I level are quite different. The investment and infrastructure are a lot more. Everything is more. They have more significant travel. They have a more significant equipment budget, the staffing differences.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s probably enough talent nowadays to accommodate more Division I programs. The difference is apparent on the ice.",
      "\u201cTen to 12 years ago, there were a lot of teams at the Division I level that might have had one good line, a line-and-a-half, maybe two,\u201d said coach Mark Johnson, whose Badgers have been the top-ranked team in women's hockey most of the season. \u201cNow everybody\u2019s got two or three lines, maybe four lines, that can compete and play at a real high level.\u201d",
      "Because the schools in larger divisions haven\u2019t added women\u2019s hockey programs at a rate that correlates with the growth in the sport at the youth level, it\u2019s created more opportunities for Division III schools.",
      "\u201cI have kids on my team who were All-Americans 15 years ago who couldn\u2019t make my team now,\u201d Cranston said. \u201cKids who were Division I players 10 years ago who couldn\u2019t make my team now.\u201d",
      "Plattsburgh State won five titles in a six-year stretch from 2014-19, but there\u2019s been a different champion for each of the last five tournaments.",
      "Norwich won in 2018, Plattsburgh State in 2019, Middlebury in 2022, Gustavus Adolphus in 2023 and Wisconsin-River Falls last year. There were no Division III championships in 2020 or 2021 due to the pandemic.",
      "\u201cMost years there\u2019s maybe three or four teams that could win it all,\u201d Cranston said. \u201cI think this year there\u2019s probably twice that, probably seven or eight teams that could win the whole thing.\u201d",
      "SUNY Oswego athletic director Wendy McManus, the head of the NCAA Division III women\u2019s hockey committee, says smaller schools will continue adding the sport as long as youth participation stays strong.",
      "\u201cI do think eventually it will level off,\u201d McManus said. \u201cI say that because you don\u2019t see California schools or true West Coast schools playing hockey that much. We say \u2018West\u2019 is basically Minnesota, Wisconsin.\u201d",
      "That growth has provided welcome opportunities that might not have been available a decade earlier.",
      "For instance, MSOE\u2019s roster includes forward Hannah Baumann of Wausau, Wisconsin, who said she grew up idolizing Marabella and was a big Badgers fan. Baumann used to have to drive an hour to practice because of the relative lack of girls hockey teams.",
      "There now are more girls teams than ever, and some gather in the stands for MSOE\u2019s home games. That has particular meaning for forward Helen Bechthold, who grew up in the Milwaukee area playing for one of those youth programs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s cool to see they have all-girls teams playing now, because when I was playing, they didn\u2019t have all-girls teams,\u201d said Bechthold, who grew up playing with boys. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see. A lot of them were like, \u2018You played where we play\u2019 and stuff like that. That definitely makes me happy. I\u2019m happy they have that opportunity.\u201d",

      "The Penguins called Jarry back up quietly earlier this month when 23-year-old Joel Blomqvist \u2014 potentially the club's goalie of the future \u2014 had struggles of his own during a somewhat extended NHL look.",
      "Jarry returned to the lineup on Sunday in a road victory over likely playoff-bound Minnesota. Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan called Jarry \u201cspectacular\u201d while outdueling future Hall of Famer and former Penguin Marc-Andre Fleury.",
      "Sullivan saw enough to give Jarry the nod again against Pacific Division-leading Vegas, a potentially fraught assignment for a player who hasn't looked comfortable playing at home this season.",
      "Yet the jitters \u2014 particularly the early-game ones that have popped up frequently during a season in which he has allowed a first-shot goal six times \u2014 never materialized. Jarry turned aside the first puck the Golden Knights threw his way and quickly settled into the game.",
      "Vegas, which is charging toward the postseason, dominated for long stretches. Jarry responded by showcasing the athleticism that's always been there and the confidence, which admittedly hasn't.",
      "He was at his best in the third period. During one sequence Jarry turned aside a breakaway and a wraparound attempt within seconds of each other to protect a one-goal lead. When the whistle blew, the crowd that reveled in booing him in mid-winter was cheering his name instead.",
      "Though Vegas tied it late on a slap shot by Noah Hanifin, Pittsburgh prevailed in overtime to secure two points in a season in which they've been hard to come by. Jarry's uneven play is one of the major reasons the Penguins will likely miss the playoffs for a third straight year.",
      "Yet if he can find something over the next month, he could perhaps make his contract that features an average cap hit of $5 million palatable for another team to take on. Or maybe a goaltender who has been part of the problem during Pittsburgh's swoon could end up being part of the solution.",
      "\u201cHe's got a long body of work in Pittsburgh that suggests strongly that he\u2019s an NHL goaltender,\u201d Sullivan said of Jarry. \"We\u2019ve said that on many occasions ... He\u2019s made the All-Star team twice, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s coincidence. There\u2019s substance there.\u201d",
      "Jarry needs to pair that substance with consistency and maybe a dash of toughness too. He's been around long enough \u2014 Jarry made his NHL debut nearly eight years ago \u2014 to know two solid games doesn't mean he's \u201cback.\u201d Every meaningful stat, from goals against average (3.15) to save percentage (.893), ranks as the worst of his career.",
      "There's more work to be done. Probably a lot more. Yet he finds himself in a better place than he was in mid-January. He believes being sent down freed him in a way. He had nothing left to lose, so Jarry headed to the AHL with a \u201cfree mind\" that has helped pave the way for a comeback that seemed remote not long ago.",
      "\u201cI think just over my time that I\u2019ve been playing in the NHL, I\u2019ve played a lot of good hockey,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I want to continue that.\u201d",
      "Given Pittsburgh's spot in the standings and the need to get a feel once and for all whether he can reclaim the team's No. 1 goaltending spot, Jarry probably won't lack for opportunities down the stretch. What he does with them will say plenty about his future.",
      "\u201cFor whatever reason it didn\u2019t go the way any of us hoped (early in the season),\u201d Sullivan said. \"I think he\u2019s just showing what he\u2019s capable of, quite honestly.\u201d",

      "Residents shaken awake by the early-morning quake sought safety in the streets, as they did in May.",
      "The temblor, which loosened stone and cement from some facades, was centered just offshore from Pozzuoli, a seaside suburb bordering Naples.

      "Hundreds of users reported FAFSA outages to Downdetector starting midday Wednesday, saying they were having trouble completing the form, which is required for financial aid at colleges nationwide. The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, a group of people who handle colleges' financial aid awards, also received reports of users experiencing technical issues and having trouble completing the FAFSA.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to get more clarity on why it\u2019s down,\" said Allie Bidwell Arcese, a spokeswoman for NASFAA. The Education Department hadn't shared any information on the outage, she said. \u201cThe maintenance and troubleshooting may be impacted by yesterday\u2019s layoffs.\u201d",
      "The developers and IT support staff who worked on the FAFSA form were hard hit in the Education Department's layoffs Tuesday, along with staff buyouts and the termination of probationary employees. In all, the Education Department has reduced its staff by half, to roughly 2,000, since Trump took office.",
      "A list of laid-off staff obtained and verified by AP shows more than 300 people cut from Federal Student Aid \u2014 two dozen of them from Federal Student Aid's technology division. That included the entire team responsible for systems supporting the FAFSA form, a person with knowledge of the outage told The Associated Press, speaking anonymously for fear of retaliation. While laid-off staffers are still technically employed until March 21, they had limited access to their email, phones and computers, making a response to the outage difficult, the person said. At one point Wednesday, about 70 people had joined a Teams call to try to pinpoint the cause of the outage.",
      "The call continued for hours. By Wednesday evening, the website carried a banner claiming \u201cPlanned Maintenance\u201d was underway, and login access was cut off.",
      "The Education Department did not respond to a request for comment on the outage.",
      "Problems with the FAFSA had vexed the administration of former President Joe Biden, drawing rebuke from Republicans. The form was overhauled last year in an attempt to simplify it, but technical problems blocked students from submitting forms or bungled financial aid calculations.",
      "Advocates say the frustration probably led thousands of students to give up on going to college at all. Last fall, U.S. colleges saw a 5% decrease in freshmen enrollment over the previous year, and it was deeper at colleges with large numbers of low-income students, according to the National Student Clearinghouse.",

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. stock market has just dropped 10% from its high set last month, hurt by worries about the economy and a global trade war.",
      "T he fall for the S&P 500 is steep enough that Wall Street has a name for it: a \u201ccorrection.\u201d Such drops have happened regularly for more than a century, and market pros often view them as potentially healthy wipeouts of overdone euphoria, which could send stock prices too high if unchecked.",
      "But corrections are frightening in the moment, particularly for every new generation of investors that gets into the market at a time when it seems like stocks only go up.",
      "The S&P 500 is coming off two straight years with gains of more than 20%. Such stellar gains left the market looking too expensive to critics, who pointed to how prices rose faster than corporate profits.",
      "Culling too-high enthusiasm among day traders is one thing. The larger fear always accompanying a correction is that it could be a warning sign of a coming \"bear market,\" which is what Wall Street calls a drop of at least 20%.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what history shows about past corrections, and what market watchers are expecting going forward.",
      "The U.S. stock market initially jumped after President Donald Trump's election in November on hopes he'd bring lower taxes, less regulation for businesses and other policies that would drive corporate profits higher. All those gains have since disappeared, as Wall Street faces the potential downsides of Trump's White House for the economy.",
      "The president has been making announcements on tariffs at a dizzying pace, first placing them on trading partners, then exempting some and then doing it all over again. The tariffs could hit every country that trades with the United States, which would raise prices for U.S. households and businesses when high inflation has already proven stubborn to fully subdue.",
      "The fear is that tariffs could slow or even halt the solid growth the U.S. economy was showing when it ended 2024. Even if Trump ultimately goes forward with less painful tariffs, all the uncertainty around the will-he-or-won't-he rollout could prove damaging by freezing economic activity. Such concerns have shown up in the latest readings on consumer confidence, as well as companies' forecasts for future profits.",
      "Trump himself has acknowledged his plans could affect the U.S. economy's growth.",
      "All the uncertainty is also making things more complicated for the Federal Reserve, which had been cutting interest rates after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Cutting rates further would help the economy, but it could also put upward pressure on inflation.",
      "The brunt of this sell-off has also hit stocks that critics were saying looked the most expensive after running wild through the frenzy around artificial intelligence. Nvidia, for example, has already dropped roughly 14% in 2025 so far after surging more than 800% through 2023 and 2024.",
      "Most of the other big stocks in the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d that have dominated the market recently have also been lagging the rest of the S&P 500. Those seven stocks alone had accounted for more than half the S&P 500\u2019s total return last year.",
      "Every couple years, on average. Even during the historic, nearly 11-year-long bull run for U.S. stocks from March 2009 to February 2020, the S&P 500 stumbled to five corrections, according to CFRA. Worries about everything from interest rates to trade wars to a European debt crisis caused the pullbacks.",
      "The U.S. market's last correction was in 2023, when the S&P 500 dropped 10.3% from the end of July into October. At the time, high Treasury yields were undercutting stock prices as traders accepted a new normal where the Fed would keep rates high for a while. But stocks would quickly turn higher as optimism revived that cuts to rates were on the horizon.",
      "The last correction that did graduate into a bear market was in 2022. That's when the Fed first began cranking up interest rates to combat the worst inflation in generations. Worries rose that high rates would slow the economy enough to create a recession, one that ultimately never came.",
      "Through the 2022 bear market, the S&P 500 fell 25.4% from Jan. 3 to Oct. 12.",
      "Looking only at corrections since 1946 that managed to right themselves before turning into a bear market, the S&P 500 has taken an average of 133 days to hit bottom and lost an average of nearly 14% along the way, according to CFRA. The index has taken an average of 113 days to recoup its losses.",
      "For declines that become bear markets, the damage is much worse. Going back to 1929, the average bear market has taken an average of nearly 19 months to hit bottom and caused a loss of 38.5% for the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.",
      "On paper, an investor can lose most of their money. From late 1929 into the middle of 1932, the stock market fell a little more than 86%, for example.",
      "A bear market can also feel interminable: One lasted more than five years, from 1937 into 1942, where U.S. stocks lost 60%, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.",
      "In Japan, after the Nikkei 225 index set a record at the end of 1989, it sank and then took decades to fully recover. It wasn't until 2024 that it got back to that peak.",
      "The Japanese example is an outlier, though. In almost every case, investors would have made back all their losses from a downturn for U.S. stocks if they simply held on and didn't sell. That includes the 2000 dot-com bust, the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 coronavirus collapse.",
      "No one knows. Some investors on Wall Street say they expect Trump to pull back on some policies if they prove to be too damaging, while others say the uncertainty alone is creating enough pain.",
      "The economy has given signals that it's still relatively solid at the moment, including last month's jobs report, but the outlook looks cloudier than usual given all the unknowns."

      "In his first month in office, Kennedy, who vowed to \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d has delivered an inconsistent message that has the nation's top infectious diseases specialists worried that his tepid recommendations of vaccines will undermine access to long-proven remedies.",
      "During his first address to thousands of workers at the federal public health agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the Food and Drug Administration, Kennedy promised to \u201cinvestigate\u201d the childhood vaccine schedule. Days later, the CDC cancelled a public meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Panel, a group of doctors and scientists who make recommendations on vaccines. That meeting has not been rescheduled.",
      "In another case, a cancelled public meeting of vaccine advisers who make recommendations on the flu vaccine every year for the FDA also has not been given a new date. This week, the National Institutes for Health, also under Kennedy's purview, began cancelling funding for some research on vaccines.",
      "The CDC also is preparing to research autism and vaccines, planning to \"leave no stone unturned in its mission to figure out what exactly is happening,\u201d HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said in a statement. Agency officials did not comment further for this article.",
      "Numerous studies have concluded that there is no link between the two, a fact the agency states on its website.",
      "\u201cWhat he is trying to do is scare about the safety of vaccines,\u201d Dr. Paul Offit, an FDA vaccine adviser and infectious disease doctor at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said of Kennedy's first month in office. \u201cIt shouldn't surprise anybody. His agenda has always been to get vaccines off the market, or to make them less available.\u201d",
      "Offit worries that the cancellation of the FDA\u2019s flu vaccine meeting, held every March for at least 30 years, is just the beginning. The committee's June meeting to recommend the COVID-19 vaccine's formulation has also not been scheduled, he said.",
      "Democrats and Republicans pushed back when Dr. Marty Makary, the FDA nominee, wouldn\u2019t commit to rescheduling the committee's flu meeting .",
      "\u201cWhat is lost is the transparency,\u201d said Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate health committee who is also a physician.",
      "During his senate confirmation hearings earlier this year, Kennedy repeatedly rejected any notion that he would undermine vaccines. \u201cI support vaccines. I support the childhood schedule,\u201d he said. He promised Cassidy, who was unsettled about Kennedy's anti-vaccine advocacy work, that he would not change existing vaccine recommendations.",
      "But Kennedy\u2019s skeptical views of vaccines have emerged during interviews and public statements since his confirmation.",
      "He's sent \u201cmixed messages\u201d on vaccine safety, even though the U.S. has \u201cthe most elaborate vaccine adverse event surveillance system in the world,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. Serious problems, including death, are very rare and the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks, he said.",
      "\u201cA simple way to describe this to the average person is the serious adverse events generally occur at a rate of 1 to a few cases per million doses of vaccine,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a needle in a haystack.\u201d",
      "In an opinion piece on FoxNews.com earlier this month, Kennedy said the measles outbreak in West Texas that left a six-year old child dead was a \u201ccall to action\u201d but stopped short of recommending that people receive the vaccine that prevents 97% of cases. Despite the U.S. registering its first measles death in a decade, Kennedy has repeatedly downplayed this year's outbreaks, noting that when he was a child \u201ceverybody got measles.\"",
      "This year's cases \u2014 reported at 250 \u2014 are on track to far outpace last year's reports of 286 measles infections.",
      "Pediatricians are fielding more questions from confused parents in their exam rooms, said Dr. Susan Kressly. Worried about reports of cancelled vaccine meetings, they\u2019re wondering about their access to next year\u2019s flu vaccines. Others are asking if they should get doses of the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine earlier. Kressly said there\u2019s a clear message the government can send to help stop the rising case count.",
      "\u201cThe only way to stop an outbreak is increased coordinated positive messaging around vaccinating,\u201d Kressly said.",
      "The CDC has assisted with vaccination efforts in West Texas. But Kennedy himself has publicly advocated for an alternative treatment for measles: Vitamin A. Under his watch, the CDC\u2019s guidance was updated to say that Vitamin A should be given to children with severe measles and prescribed in doses under a doctor\u2019s supervision.",
      "Vitamin A supplementation has been recommended for decades to reduce pneumonia and death in malnourished children in developing countries, but the benefits in well-nourished children in countries like the U.S. are less clear.",
      "\u201cWe need to use Vitamin A for those kids who are unlucky enough to get measles,\u201d said Dr. Andy Pavia, a pediatric infectious disease expert at the University of Utah. \u201cBut it can\u2019t prevent measles and it can only provide some help in reducing the severity.\u201d",
      "When administered correctly, using Vitamin A in kids with severe measles will \u201cdo no harm,\u201d Pavia said. But if improperly done, high doses of Vitamin A can be toxic and deadly.",
      "Abrupt staffing changes have also dominated Kennedy's first weeks in office, with CDC pick Dave Weldon withdrawing from the nomination mere minutes before his hearing, Kennedy's top HHS spokesman quitting two weeks into the job and the Food and Drug Administration's newly minted chief counsel departing 48 hours into the position.",
      "Trump and Kennedy's supporters, however, have dismissed concerns about the rocky start.",
      "His newfound platform as health secretary and talk of healthier foods is already affecting change in the American diet, advisers close to Kennedy and Trump have claimed on social media.",
      "They credit Kennedy with prompting Republican legislators to introduce bills in Utah and Texas that would ban soda in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, for example. And then there's Steak \u2018n Shake\u2019s new fries.",
      "\u201cRFK Jr. just ate Steak \u2019n Shake on live TV, the fast food joint that\u2019s bravely frying everything in beef tallow,\u201d conservative podcaster Charlie Kirk said this week in a tweet. \u201cThis is the way.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, after a meeting with a handful of executives from the nation's largest food manufactures, Kennedy released a slickly-produced video that promised more change would be on the way, saying companies were taking his \u201cMAHA\" movement seriously.",
      "\u201cThey understand they have a new sheriff in town,\u201d Kennedy said.",

      "Vaccines could be a key means of suppressing bird flu and avoiding the slaughter of millions of chickens, which is blamed for egg prices averaging nearly $5 a dozen",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Vaccines could be a key means of suppressing bird flu and avoiding the slaughter of millions of chickens, which is blamed for egg prices averaging nearly $6 a dozen. But the move has been delayed in part because of concerns it could jeopardize chicken exports worth billions of dollars a year.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced plans to spend $100 million to study bird flu vaccines to fight the disease in concert with meat chicken, egg and turkey groups. That's part of a larger $1 billion effort to invest in more protections to keep the virus off farms that President Donald Trump believes will help lower egg prices.",
      "Chicken meat producers remain the most resistant to vaccines because of concerns they could harm meat exports, which totaled nearly $4.7 billion last year. Egg and turkey producers sell most of their products in the U.S. and have been hit hardest by the virus.",
      "Without a new policy including vaccines, the government will continue to slaughter every flock with a bird flu infection to limit the spread of the disease. Those deaths have totaled over 166 million birds in the U.S. since 2022.",
      "Most birds killed are egg-laying chickens, and the death of so many hens is the main reason egg prices keep rising. The average price per dozen has hit $5.90, and in some part of the country, it is far higher.",
      "Poultry veterinarian Simon Shane, who runs www.Egg-News.com, said the government is hesitant to use vaccines and change its policy of killing birds largely because of the meat chicken industry's opposition.",
      "\u201cBasically this is a political issue, and this only came to a head because eggs are at $8 to $9 a dozen, and it\u2019s embarrassing the government \u2014 embarrassing the present administration,\u201d Shane said.",
      "Before using vaccinations, the government must decide how to devise an effective system and monitor for outbreaks within vaccinated flocks that might not show any symptoms, said John Clifford, the USDA's former longtime chief veterinary officer, who now works with a poultry industry export group. Once that is figured out, the industry can negotiate with countries to minimize trade problems.",
      "\u201cWhat the industry wants is the ability to develop the strategic plan to share that with the trading partners and then find out what kind of impact that that will have on trade,\u201d Clifford said.",
      "There are fears that vaccinating could allow the virus to linger undetected in flocks and mutate in ways that could make it more of a threat to humans and allow sick birds to get into the food supply. Like with other diseases, properly cooking chicken to 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) will kill bird flu, but the industry and chicken buyers don't want it there at all.",
      "For meat chicken, known as broilers, the virus isn't as significant because those birds are slaughtered at 6 to 8 weeks old and thus have less chance of being infected compared with egg-laying hens, which live to 2 years or older. Also most broilers are raised in the Southeast, which hasn't had as many outbreaks as the Midwest and West.",
      "Another delay to vaccinating concerns distribution. Egg farmers want to administer it through chicken feed or water, saying it's not practical to give shots to millions of birds in a single barn.",
      "It can also be difficult to tell the difference between a vaccinated bird and one that has been sick with the virus. That would make other countries nervous about importing meat.",
      "\u201cPeople have talked about how expensive it would be to monitor vaccinated populations. And it would be. But where do we want to spend our money?\u201d said Dr. Carol Cardona, a bird flu expert at the University of Minnesota. \u201cWe\u2019re spending our money hand over fist right now in depopulation and to buy eggs for breakfast.\u201d",
      "China and Mexico have been vaccinating their poultry for years, but they take different approaches.",
      "In Mexico chicken are vaccinated, but Clifford said the country doesn't slaughter flocks when infections are found. That basically ensures the virus is present in poultry.",
      "China still slaughters vaccinated flocks when infections are found, which has proven more effective at limiting the spread of the virus and reigning in outbreaks.",
      "Clifford said the U.S. would need to continue culling flocks with outbreaks even after vaccinating, and it might make sense to give shots only to egg layers and turkeys, not broilers.",
      "Don't expect big relief anytime soon.",
      "The USDA, which did not respond to a request for comment for this article sent last week, clearly isn't moving to vaccinate immediately. And, regardless, it will take time to raise new hens.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to wait to replace those with new hatched chicks, and it takes 20 weeks before they even start laying,\u201d Shane said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going to get the eggs from.\u201d",
      "Prices may ease somewhat later this year after peak demand, which happens around Easter, if massive egg farms in Iowa, Ohio, California and elsewhere can avoid more outbreaks.",
      "The USDA has predicted that average egg prices will be 41% higher than the 2024 average of $3.17 per dozen. That would mean $4.47 per dozen, slightly below the current average."

      "Among the birds showing the steepest declines are Allen\u2019s hummingbirds, Florida scrub jays, golden-cheeked warblers, tricolored blackbirds and yellow-billed magpies.",
      "\u201cThese are the very real consequences if we are unable to conserve and protect the crucial habitats that birds need,\u201d said study co-author Mike Brasher, a senior scientist at the nonprofit Ducks Unlimited.",
      "For several decades, waterfowl stood out as a conservation bright spot with duck populations growing nationwide even as many other groups of birds declined in the U.S. But that trend has reversed, the new data shows.",
      "The total number of dabbling and diving ducks is down about 30% from 2017, said Brasher. Loss of grasslands habitat and a prolonged drought affecting the wetlands of the Great Plains\u2019 prairie pothole region have taken a toll. Among all waterfowl, numbers are down 20% since 2014, the report found.",
      "The latest report is a collaboration between several groups including Cornell University, Ducks Unlimited, American Bird Conservancy, National Audubon Society and the American Ornithological Society.",
      "The work draws on survey data from the U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and citizen projects such as Cornell's eBird. There are some 2,000 bird species in North America. A third of the species examined are rated as high or moderate concern for conservation due to declining numbers, habitat loss or other threats.",
      "These birds \u201cneed urgent conservation attention,\u201d said Amanda Rodewald, a study co-author from Cornell, adding that bird survey trends also reveal the health of their habitats.",
      "The report focuses on birds that must breed and feed in specific habitats such as forests, grasslands and coastal regions. Grassland birds including the Bobolink are most at risk.",
      "\u201cFor each species that we\u2019re in danger of losing, it\u2019s like pulling an individual thread out of the complex tapestry of life,\u201d said Georgetown University biologist Peter Marra, who was not involved in the new report.",

      "Roughly 1,500 school districts nationwide use Gaggle\u2019s software to track the online activity of approximately 6 million students. It\u2019s one of many companies, like GoGuardian and Securly, that promise to keep kids safe through AI-assisted web surveillance.",
      "The technology has been in high demand since the pandemic, when nearly every child received a school-issued tablet or laptop. According to a U.S. Senate investigation, over 7,000 schools or districts used GoGuardian\u2019s surveillance products in 2021.",
      "Vancouver schools apologized for releasing the documents. Still, the district emphasizes Gaggle is necessary to protect students\u2019 well-being.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we could ever put a price on protecting students,\u201d said Andy Meyer, principal of Vancouver\u2019s Skyview High School. \u201cAnytime we learn of something like that and we can intervene, we feel that is very positive.\u201d",

The latest contract Vancouver signed, in summer 2024, shows a price of $328,036 for three school years \u2014 approximately the cost of employing one extra counselor.",
      "The algorithm detects potential indicators of problems like bullying, self-harm, suicide or school violence and then sends a screenshot to human reviewers. If Gaggle employees confirm the issue might be serious, the company alerts the school. In cases of imminent danger, Gaggle calls school officials directly. In rare instances where no one answers, Gaggle may contact law enforcement for a welfare check.",
      "A Vancouver school counselor who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation said they receive three or four student Gaggle alerts per month. In about half the cases, the district contacts parents immediately.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, families don\u2019t know. We open that door for that help,\u201d the counselor said. Gaggle is \u201cgood for catching suicide and self-harm, but students find a workaround once they know they are getting flagged.\u201d",
      "Seattle Times and AP reporters saw what kind of writing set off Gaggle\u2019s alerts after requesting information about the type of content flagged. Gaggle saved screenshots of activity that set off each alert, and school officials accidentally provided links to them, not realizing they weren\u2019t protected by a password.",

      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the right number of mental health counselors, issuing more alerts is not actually going to improve suicide prevention,\u201d said report co-author Benjamin Boudreaux, an AI ethics researcher.",
      "In the screenshots released by Vancouver schools, at least six students were potentially outed to school officials after writing about being gay, transgender or struggling with gender dysphoria.",
      "LGBTQ+ students are more likely than their peers to suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts, and turn to the internet for support.",
      "\u201cWe know that gay youth, especially those in more isolated environments, absolutely use the internet as a life preserver,\u201d said Katy Pearce, a University of Washington professor who researches technology in authoritarian states.",
      "In one screenshot, a Vancouver high schooler wrote in a Google survey form they\u2019d been subject to trans slurs and racist bullying. Who created this survey is unclear, but the person behind it had falsely promised confidentiality: \u201cI am not a mandated reporter, please tell me the whole truth.\u201d",
      "When North Carolina\u2019s Durham Public Schools piloted Gaggle in 2021, surveys showed most staff members found it helpful.",
      "But community members raised concerns. An LGBTQ+ advocate reported to the Board of Education that a Gaggle alert about self-harm had led to a student being outed to their family, who were not supportive.",
      "Glenn Thompson, a Durham School of the Arts graduate, spoke up at a board meeting during his senior year. One of his teachers promised a student confidentiality for an assignment related to mental health. A classmate was then \u201cblindsided\u201d when Gaggle alerted school officials about something private they\u2019d disclosed. Thompson said no one in the class, including the teacher, knew the school was piloting Gaggle.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just (surveil) people and not tell them. That\u2019s a horrible breach of security and trust,\u201d said Thompson, now a college student, in an interview.",
      "After hearing about these experiences, the Durham Board of Education voted to stop using Gaggle in 2023. The district ultimately decided it was not worth the risk of outing students or eroding relationships with adults.",
      "The debate over privacy and security is complicated, and parents are often unaware it\u2019s even an issue. Pearce, the University of Washington professor, doesn\u2019t remember reading about Securly, the surveillance software Seattle Public Schools uses, when she signed the district\u2019s responsible use form before her son received a school laptop.",
      "Even when families learn about school surveillance, they may be unable to opt out. Owasso Public Schools in Oklahoma has used Gaggle since 2016 to monitor students outside of class.",
      "For years, Tim Reiland, the parent of two teenagers, had no idea the district was using Gaggle. He found out only after asking if his daughter could bring her personal laptop to school instead of being forced to use a district one because of privacy concerns.",
      "The district refused Reiland\u2019s request.",
      "When Reiland's daughter, Zoe, found out about Gaggle, she says she felt so \u201cfreaked out\u201d that she stopped Googling anything personal on her Chromebook, even questions about her menstrual period. She didn\u2019t want to get called into the office for \u201csearching up lady parts.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was too scared to be curious,\u201d she said.",
      "School officials say they don\u2019t track metrics measuring the technology\u2019s efficacy but believe it has saved lives.",
      "Yet technology alone doesn\u2019t create a safe space for all students. In 2024, a nonbinary teenager at Owasso High School named Nex Benedict died by suicide after relentless bullying from classmates. A subsequent U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights investigation found the district responded with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to some families\u2019 reports of sexual harassment, mainly in the form of homophobic bullying.",
      "During the 2023-24 school year, the Owasso schools received close to 1,000 Gaggle alerts, including 168 alerts for harassment and 281 for suicide.",
      "When asked why bullying remained a problem despite surveillance, Russell Thornton, the district\u2019s executive director of technology responded: \u201cThis is one tool used by administrators. Obviously, one tool is not going to solve the world\u2019s problems and bullying.\u201d",
      "Despite the risks, surveillance technology can help teachers intervene before a tragedy.",
      "A middle school student in the Seattle-area Highline School District who was potentially being trafficked used Gaggle to communicate with campus staff, said former Superintendent Susan Enfield.",
      "\u201cThey knew that the staff member was reading what they were writing,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt was, in essence, that student\u2019s way of asking for help.\u201d",
      "Still, developmental psychology research shows it is vital for teens to have private spaces online to explore their thoughts and seek support.",
      "\u201cThe idea that kids are constantly under surveillance by adults \u2014 I think that would make it hard to develop a private life, a space to make mistakes, a space to go through hard feelings without adults jumping in,\u201d said Boudreaux, the AI ethics researcher.",
      "Gaggle\u2019s Patterson says school-issued devices are not the appropriate place for unlimited self-exploration. If that exploration takes a dark turn, such as making a threat, \u201cthe school\u2019s going to be held liable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for that open free expression, it really can\u2019t happen on the school system\u2019s computers.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- A fossil of a partial face from a human ancestor is the oldest in western Europe, archaeologists reported Wednesday.",
      "The incomplete skull \u2014 a section of the left cheek bone and upper jaw \u2013 was found in northern Spain in 2022. The fossil is between 1.1 million and 1.4 million years old, according to research published in the journal Nature.",
      "\u201cThe fossil is exciting,\" said Eric Delson, a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the study. \u201cIt's the first time we have significant remains older than 1 million years old in western Europe.\u201d",
      "A collection of older fossils from early human ancestors was previously found in Georgia, near the crossroads of eastern Europe and Asia. Those are estimated to be 1.8 million years old.",
      "The Spanish fossil is the first evidence that clearly shows human ancestors \u201cwere taking excursions into Europe\u201d at that time, said Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian\u2019s Human Origins Program.",
      "But there is not yet evidence that the earliest arrivals persisted there long, he said. \u201cThey may get to a new location and then die out,\u201d said Potts, who had no role in the study.",
      "The partial skull bears many similarities to Homo erectus, but there are also some anatomical differences, said study co-author Rosa Huguet, an archaeologist at the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution in Tarragona, Spain.",
      "Homo erectus arose around 2 million years ago and moved from Africa to regions of Asia and Europe, with the last individuals dying out around 100,000 years ago, said Potts.",
      "It can be challenging to identify which group of early humans a fossil find belongs to if there's only a single fragment versus many bones that show a range of features, said University of Zurich paleoanthropologist Christoph Zollikofer, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The same cave complex in Spain's Atapuerca Mountains where the new fossil was found also previously yielded other significant clues to the ancient human past. Researchers working in the region have also found more recent fossils from Neanderthals and early Homo sapiens.",

      "Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Wednesday announced nearly three dozen deregulatory moves that he said would spur the U.S. economy by rolling back rules that have unfairly burdened industry. Many of the moves would affect landmark regulations aimed at protecting clean air and water.",
      "Industry generally applauded the proposed changes, while environmentalists worried about what would amount to historic rollbacks if they are approved. Here's a look at some of the 31 regulatory changes Zeldin announced:",
      "The Biden administration set limits on planet-warming emissions from existing gas and coal-fired power plants \u2013 a major step in the administration\u2019s effort to reduce greenhouse gases from the heavily polluting energy sector. Trump has long opposed such tough, climate-friendly limits and has instead promoted oil and gas development. Zeldin said the agency would reconsider the Biden administration standards to avoid constraining energy production.",
      "Coal plants emit toxic metals like mercury and the Biden administration issued a rule to severely limit those pollutants. Officials at the time said technology had progressed enough for these plants to do better. The EPA on Wednesday said nearly two dozen states had sued, arguing the rule was costly and a major burden, especially to coal plants. They also considering offering industry a two-year compliance extension while officials reconsider the rule.",
      "Hazardous metals like mercury and arsenic end up in the wastewater of steam-powered electric generating power plants like coal. These can have serious health effects including increasing cancer rates and lowering childhood IQ scores. The Biden administration tightened regulations of this wastewater. The EPA said it will revisit those \u201cstringent\u201d rules that are costly to industry and therefore may raise residential energy bills.",
      "Currently, treated wastewater generated from oil and gas drilling can be used in limited ways in certain western lands, such as for agriculture. Environmentalists say there can be a broad range of contaminants in the wastewater, some of which might not be known. The EPA said it will reconsider those rules and look at how the treated water could be used for other purposes like cooling data centers, fighting fires and other ecological needs. They say the current rules are costly, old and don\u2019t reflect the capabilities of modern treatment technologies.",
      "The Biden administration tightened safeguards against accidents for industrial and chemical plants that millions of people live near. The agency\u2019s risk management program added planning and reporting requirements for facilities and forced some to implement new safeguards. Accidents at these plants can be severe \u2013 a 2019 explosion at a Texas facility, for example, forced tens of thousands to evacuate, for example. Industry associations have criticized parts of the rule, such as requirements to publicly report sensitive information.",
      "Zeldin said Biden administration officials \u201cignored recommendations from national security experts on how their rule makes chemical and other sensitive facilities in America more vulnerable to attack.\u201d The EPA is reconsidering the rule.",
      "The EPA said it was reconsidering its mandatory greenhouse gas reporting program, which requires thousands of major industrial polluters to tell the agency about its emissions. Zeldin said the \u201cbureaucratic government program\u201d costs hundreds of millions of dollars and doesn\u2019t help air quality. Until now, the EPA said the data helped businesses compare their emissions to competitors and find opportunities to reduce them and lower costs.",
      "Zeldin vowed to review his agency\u2019s emissions standards for cars and trucks, calling the tightened emissions rules the \u201cfoundation for the Biden-Harris electric vehicle mandate.\u201d Nothing the Biden administration implemented required automakers to make and sell EVs or for consumers to buy them. Loosening standards would allow vehicles to emit more planet-warming greenhouse gases, but many automakers have already been investing in making their vehicles more efficient.",
      "The scientific finding, under the 2009 Clean Air Act, determined that planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. It has been at the core of the nation\u2019s action against climate change. Trump had already directed the EPA to consider the finding\u2019s \u201clegality\u201d in an executive order. Experts say the impacts of climate change on human health and the environment are already clear, and that upending the finding would be devastating.",
      "This program enforced strict rules to reduce the use of hydrofluorocarbons, highly potent and planet-warming greenhouse gases used in refrigerators, air conditioners, heat pumps and more. HFCs, as they are known, are thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide and leak through equipment that uses compressed refrigerants. Dozens of countries around the globe have pledged to slash their use and production of the chemicals.",
      "This rule was intended to limit air pollution by restricting power plant smokestack emissions, and those from other industrial sites, across 11 states. Eliminating it would especially impact downwind neighborhoods that are burdened by pollution from ground-level ozone, or smog, that is out of their control. However, the Supreme Court had already put a hold on the rule last summer, ruling that states challenging it were likely to prevail.",
      "These seats have long been politicized given how influential they can be in setting national environmental policy. The board reviews \u201cthe quality and relevance of the scientific and technical information being used by the EPA or proposed as the basis for Agency regulations\u201d and agency research programs. Congress directed the agency to establish the board to provide the Administrator science advice in 1978. The committee can give \u201cindependent advice\u201d to the agency\u2019s Administrator specific to the nation\u2019s Ambient Air Quality Standards.",
      "Power plants and industrial facilities release particulate matter, or soot, that can easily pass through a person\u2019s lungs and into their bloodstream. Last year, the Biden administration tightened standards regulating soot in response to scientific research indicating existing regulations were insufficient. At the time, the EPA estimated its stronger regulations would save thousands of lives and prevent hundreds of thousands of cases of asthma and lost workdays annually. The Trump administration\u2019s EPA says these regulations are \u201ca major obstacle\u201d for companies and that the U.S. has low levels of soot.",
      "These EPA standards apply to pollutants known or suspected to cause cancer, birth defects or other serious health problems. Industrial facilities are required to follow strict standards to monitor and limit the amount of these chemicals they release into the air. Last year, the EPA tightened standards surrounding ethylene oxide emissions, a human carcinogen commonly used as a sterilizer for medical equipment. The Trump administration said it is considering a \u201c2-year compliance exemption\u201d for facilities affected by these standards, among others.",
      "For decades, this EPA program has required states to reduce pollution that threatens scenic views in more than 150 national parks and wilderness areas, including in the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone. Zeldin said that the U.S. has made strides in improving visibility in national parks and that the program is being used as justification for shutting down industrial facilities and threatening affordable energy.",
      "The social cost of carbon is an EPA tool to weigh the economic costs and benefits of regulating polluting industries by putting a price tag on climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions \u2013 set at $190 per ton under the Biden administration\u2019s EPA. That calculation is used in cost-benefit analyses, and was intended to account for greenhouse gas emissions\u2019 impacts including natural disasters, crop damage, health problems and sea-level rise. Under the first Trump administration, carbon was pegged at around $5 per ton. An executive order Trump signed on his first day in office directs the EPA to consider eliminating this calculation entirely to advance his \u201cUnleashing American Energy\u201d policy.",
      "After coal is burned, ash filled with heavy pollutants including arsenic, lead and mercury is left behind and typically stored in giant pits under federal regulation. The EPA says it is now seeking to rapidly put regulation \u201cmore fully into state hands,\u201d which environmental groups fear could lead to weaker standards. Last year, the Biden administration closed a gap that had allowed companies to avoid responsibility for cleaning up inactive coal ash pits \u2013 a policy that environmental groups say could now be repealed.",

      "Japanese automaker Nissan says its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is stepping down",
      "TOKYO -- Japanese automaker Nissan's chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is stepping down after the company reported dismal financial results and its merger talks with Honda collapsed.",
      "Nissan Motor Corp. said in a statement Tuesday that Ivan Espinosa, who is now the company\u2019s chief planning officer, will take Uchida\u2019s place, effective April 1.",
      "Nissan stock edged up slightly at the opening but soon slipped about 1% in early Wednesday trading in Tokyo, highlighting investors' skepticism over what was announced late the previous day.",
      "Espinosa, who joined Nissan in 2003, has spent much of his Nissan career in Mexico and Southeast Asia, overseeing product planning including the drive toward electric vehicles, meaning he's an insider perhaps less willing to take drastic action.",
      "\u201cI sincerely believe that Nissan has so much more potential than what we're seeing today,\u201d Espinosa told reporters, while stressing that he needs time to come up with details for a turnaround.",
      "He stressed his love for Nissan, noting he has developed a deep understanding of what makes the company unique and valuable.",
      "Nissan said the company leadership needed to be \u201crenewed\u201d to achieve long-term growth. Uchida, who remains as a director, expressed confidence in Espinosa as \u201ca real car guy,\u201d and stressed he was handing over the baton of leadership to better unify company ranks.",
      "\u201cI am confident that Nissan will definitely make a comeback,\u201d he said, appearing at the hastily called news conference with Espinosa.",
      "Speculation about Uchida's future was rife after he called off talks last month with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co., announced late last year, to set up a joint holding company to integrate their businesses. At the time, he told reporters the focus of the talks had changed to making Nissan into a Honda subsidiary, which he denounced as unacceptable.",
      "He also said their strategic partnership to realize synergies on specific projects like electric vehicles and other research will continue.",
      "Nissan is projecting a loss of 80 billion yen ($540 million) for the full fiscal year through the end of this month.",
      "When asked about talks with Honda and other possible partnerships, Espinosa declined comment, saying he needed more time.",
      "During Uchida\u2019s more than five years at Nissan\u2019s helm, sales faltered, including in key markets like the U.S. and China. Uchida also earlier announced the company was slashing 9,000 jobs.",
      "Analysts said Nissan's future remains precarious, with little time left, but noted Nissan may need an outsider rather than an insider like Espinosa.",
      "Todd Duvick and Will Lee, auto analysts at CreditSights, believe the focus is still on a business turnaround, not the proposed integration with Honda.",
      "\u201cNot that a turnaround could not coexist with a Honda merger, but we view it as unlikely that Nissan would be open to becoming a subsidiary of Honda at this time, at least until the board has time to assess the effectiveness of Espinosa\u2019s strategy once it is unveiled and put into action,\u201d they said in a report.",
      "It\u2019s a sad turn for the maker of the Z sportscar, loved by auto buffs around the world, and the Leaf electric car, a pioneer in that sector that launched in 2010. Besides its proud legacy, Nissan also boasts solid engineering. It recently showed off its autonomous vehicle running on regular streets near its Yokohama headquarters.",
      "Uchida joined Nissan in 2003, job-hopping from major Japanese trading company Nissho Iwai, and worked with Nissan\u2019s alliance partner Renault SA of France before overseeing Nissan\u2019s China operations.",
      "Nissan was rescued from near bankruptcy by Renault in 1999. In 2018, Carlos Ghosn, the former superstar executive sent in by Renault, was arrested by Japanese authorities on various financial misconduct charges, including under-reporting his compensation. He later fled to Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.",
      "Nissan's tarnished corporate image after the Ghosn fiasco was a major challenge, Uchida said. So were the COVID-19 pandemic and broader shifts in the auto industry.",
      "Apart from Uchida's departure as chief executive, Nissan announced other sweeping managerial changes, including giving an expanded role to Guillaume Cartier, its chief performance officer, in global marketing and customer experience.",
      "Eiichi Akashi, corporate vice president of the Vehicle Planning and Vehicle Component Engineering Division, was named chief technology officer, succeeding Kunio Nakaguro.",
      "Teiji Hirata, a corporate vice president, will become chief \u201cmonozukuri\u201d officer and executive officer, responsible for manufacturing and supply chain management, replacing Hideyuki Sakamoto.",
      "Jeremy Papin, the chief financial officer, was also appointed to be an executive officer. There was no change for Stephen Ma, who serves as chairperson of Nissan's management committee in China.",

      "In less than a month, TikTok could have one or a few new owners, be banned again, or simply receive another reprieve to continue operating in the United States.",
      "Questions about the fate of the popular video sharing app have continued to linger since a law requiring its China-based parent company to divest or face a ban took effect on Jan. 19. After taking office, President Donald Trump gave TikTok a 75-day reprieve by signing an executive order that delayed enforcement of the statute until April 5.",
      "As he returned to Washington from his Florida home on Sunday, Trump told reporters that a deal could come soon. He did not offer any details on the interested buyers, but said the administration was in talks with \u201cfour different groups\u201d about TikTok.",
      "\u201cA lot of people want it and it\u2019s up to me,\u201d Trump said aboard Air Force One.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "If TikTok is not sold to an approved buyer by April 5, the original law that bans it nationwide would once again go into effect. However, the deadline for the executive order doesn't appear to be set in stone and the president has reiterated it could be extended further if needed.",
      "Trump\u2019s order came a few days after the Supreme Court unanimously upheld a federal law that required TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, to divest or be banned in January. The day after the ruling, TikTok went dark for U.S. users and came back online after Trump vowed to stall the ban.",
      "During his first term, Trump tried to ban TikTok on national security grounds, which was halted by the courts before his administration negotiated a sale of the platform that eventually failed to materialize. He changed his position on the popular app during last year's presidential election and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters.",
      "The decision to keep TikTok alive through an executive order has received some scrutiny, but it has not faced a legal challenge in court.",
      "Although it\u2019s unclear if ByteDance plans to sell TikTok, several potential bidders have come forward in the past few months.",
      "Aides for Vice President JD Vance, who was tapped to oversee a potential deal, have reached out to some parties, such as the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI, to get additional details about their bids, according to a person familiar with the matter. In January, Perplexity AI presented ByteDance with a merger proposal that would combine Perplexity\u2019s business with TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation.",
      "Other potential bidders include a consortium organized by billionaire businessman Frank McCourt, which recently recruited Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian as a strategic advisor. Investors in the consortium say they\u2019ve offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash for TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform. And if successful, they plan to redesign the popular app with blockchain technology they say will provide users with more control over their online data.",
      "Jesse Tinsley, the founder of the payroll firm Employer.com, says he too has organized a consortium, which includes the CEO of the video game platform Roblox, and is offering ByteDance more than $30 billion for TikTok.",
      "Trump said in January that Microsoft was also eyeing the popular app. Other interested parties include Trump\u2019s former Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin and Rumble, the video site popular with some conservatives and far-right groups. In a post on X last March, Rumble said it was ready to join a consortium of parties interested in purchasing TikTok and serving as a tech partner for the company.",
      "Trump has said he is looking to have the U.S. government broker a deal for 50% control of TikTok. However, the administration hasn't provided details on what exactly that would entail, or what role the U.S. government could play in the future of the short-form video app.",
      "Some potential bidders have floated proposals that would allow the U.S. to invest or own a stake in the platform. Last month, Trump himself also said the U.S. could own part of TikTok through a new government-owned investment fund.",
      "Chinese officials, who would have to approve the deal, appear to have softened their stance on the issue compared to last year when Beijing called the push for divestment a \u201crobbers\u201d act.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said in January that business operations and acquisitions \u201cshould be independently decided by companies in accordance with market principles.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it involves Chinese companies, China\u2019s laws and regulations should be observed,\u201d Mao said.",
      "If ByteDance sits down to negotiate, the company would likely need to iron out major details with the U.S. over the proprietary algorithm that populates TikTok feeds as well as the flow of content between the U.S. and the rest of the world.",

      "Explorers have discovered the sunken wreckage of one of the first steel cargo ships to travel the Great Lakes",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Twenty years before the Titanic changed maritime history, another ship touted as the next great technological feat set sail on the Great Lakes.",
      "The Western Reserve was one of the first all-steel cargo ships to traverse the lakes. Built to break speed records, the 300-foot (91.4-meter) freighter dubbed \u201cthe inland greyhound\u201d by newspapers was supposed to be one of the safest ships afloat. Owner Peter Minch was so proud of her that he brought his wife and young children aboard for a summer joyride in August 1892.",
      "Then tragedy struck. As the ship entered Lake Superior's Whitefish Bay between Michigan and Canada on Aug. 30, a gale came up. With no cargo aboard, the ship was light and floating high in the water. The storm battered it until it cracked in half. Twenty-seven people perished that night, including the Minch family. The only survivor was wheelsman Harry W. Stewart, who swam a mile (1.6 kilometers) to shore after his lifeboat capsized.",
      "For almost 132 years the lake hid the wreckage. In July, explorers from the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society pinpointed the Western Reserve off Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The society announced the discovery Saturday at the annual Ghost Ships Festival in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Executive Director Bruce Lynn called the discovery one of the society's most significant finds.",
      "\u201cThere's a number of concurrent stories that make this important,\u201d Lynn said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. \u201cMost ships were still wooden. It was a technologically advanced ship. They were kind of a famous family at the time. You have this new ship, considered one of the safest on the lake, new tech, a big, big ship. (The discovery) is another way for us to keep this history alive.\u201d",
      "Darryl Ertel, the society's marine operations director, and his brother, Dan Ertel, spent more than two years looking for the Western Reserve.",
      "Lynn said this winter the brothers outlined a search grid. On July 22 they set out on the David Boyd, the society's research vessel. Heavy ship traffic that day forced them to alter their course, though, and search an area adjacent to their original grid, Lynn said.",
      "The brothers towed a side-scanning sonar array behind their ship. Side sonar scans to starboard and port, providing a more expansive picture of the bottom than traditional sonar mounted beneath a ship. About 60 miles (97 kilometers) northwest of Whitefish Point on the Upper Peninsula, they picked up a line with a shadow behind it in 600 feet of water. They dialed up the resolution and spotted a ship broken in two with the bow resting on the stern. Each section was 150 feet (45.2 meters) long, suggesting they'd found the Western Reserve.",
      "Eight days later, the brothers returned to the site along with Lynn. They deployed a submersible drone equipped with high-intensity lighting and a high-resolution camera. The drone returned clear images of a portside running light that match the Western Reserve's starboard running light, which had washed ashore in Canada after the ship went down. That light was the only artifact recovered from the ship.",
      "\u201cThat was confirmation day,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cIt's pretty exciting.\u201d",
      "Darryl Ertel said that discovery gave him chills \u2014 and not in a good way. \u201cKnowing how the 300-foot Western Reserve was caught in a storm this far from shore made a uneasy feeling in the back of my neck,\" he said in a society news release. \"A squall can come up unexpectedly\u2026anywhere, and anytime.\u201d",
      "The Edmund Fitzgerald, a freighter that went down in a November 1975 storm that was immortalized in the Gordon Lightfoot song, \u201cThe Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\" sank off Whitefish Point within 100 miles of the Western Reserve. There were no survivors."

      "The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant\u2019s radiation levels have significantly dropped since the cataclysmic meltdown 14 years ago Tuesday",
      "OKUMA, Japan -- The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's radiation levels have significantly dropped since the cataclysmic meltdown 14 years ago Tuesday. Workers walk around in many areas wearing only surgical masks and regular clothes.",
      "It's a different story for those who enter the reactor buildings, including the three damaged in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. They must use maximum protection \u2014 full facemasks with filters, multi-layered gloves and socks, shoe covers, hooded hazmat coveralls and a waterproof jacket, and a helmet.",
      "As workers remove melted fuel debris from the reactors in a monumental nuclear cleanup effort that could take more than a century, they are facing both huge amounts of psychological stress and dangerous levels of radiation.",
      "The Associated Press, which recently visited the plant for a tour and interviews, takes a closer look.",
      "A remote-controlled extendable robot with a tong had several mishaps including equipment failures before returning in November with a tiny piece of melted fuel from inside the damaged No. 2 reactor.",
      "That first successful test run is a crucial step in what will be a daunting, decades-long decommissioning that must deal with at least 880 tons of melted nuclear fuel that has mixed with broken parts of internal structures and other debris inside the three ruined reactors.",
      "Akira Ono, chief decommissioning officer at the Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant, says even the tiny sample gives officials a lot of information about the melted fuel. More samples are needed, however, to make the work smoother when bigger efforts to remove the debris begin in the 2030s.",
      "A second sample-retrieval mission at the No. 2 reactor is expected in coming weeks.",
      "Operators hope to send the extendable robot farther into the reactor to take samples closer to the center, where overheated nuclear fuel fell from the core, utility spokesperson Masakatsu Takata said. He pointed out the target area as he stood inside the inner structure of the No. 5 reactor, which is one of two reactors that survived the tsunami. It has an identical design as No. 2.",
      "Radiation levels are still dangerously high inside the No. 2 reactor building, where the melted fuel debris is behind a thick concrete containment wall. Earlier decontamination work reduced those radiation levels to a fraction of what they used to be.",
      "In late August, small groups took turns doing their work helping the robot in 15- to 30-minute shifts to minimize radiation exposure. They have a remotely controlled robot, but it has to be manually pushed in and out.",
      "\u201cWorking under high levels of radiation (during a short) time limit made us feel nervous and rushed,\" said Yasunobu Yokokawa, a team leader for the mission. \"It was a difficult assignment.\u201d",
      "Full-face masks reduced visibility and made breathing difficult, an extra waterproof jacket made it sweaty and hard to move, and triple-layered gloves made their fingers clumsy, Yokokawa said.",
      "To eliminate unnecessary exposure, they taped around gloves and socks and carried a personal dosimeter to measure radiation. Workers also rehearsed the tasks they'd perform to minimize exposure.",
      "The mission stalled early on when workers noticed that a set of five 1.5-meter (5-foot) pipes meant to push the robot into the reactor's primary containment vessel had been arranged in the wrong order.",
      "A camera on the robot also failed because of high radioactivity and had to be replaced.",
      "The workers' highest individual radiation dose was more than the overall average but still far below anything approaching a 100-millisievert five-year dose limit.",
      "Even so, a growing number of workers are concerned about safety and radiation at the plant, said Ono, the decommissioning chief, citing an annual survey of about 5,5,00 workers.",
      "In 2023, two workers splashed with contaminated sludge at a water treatment facility suffered burns and were hospitalized, though they had no other health problems.",
      "Yokokawa and a plant colleague, Hiroshi Ide, helped in the 2011 emergency and work as team leaders today. They say they want to make the job safer as workers face high radiation in parts of the plant.",
      "On the top floor of the No. 2 reactor, workers are setting up equipment to remove spent fuel units from the cooling pool. That's set to begin within two to three years.",
      "At the No. 1 reactor, workers are putting up a giant roof to contain radioactive dust from decontamination work on the top floor ahead of the removal of spent fuel.",
      "To minimize exposure and increase efficiency, workers use a remote-controlled crane to attach pre-assembled parts, according to TEPCO. The No. 1 reactor and its surroundings are among the most contaminated parts of the plant.",
      "Workers are also removing treated radioactive wastewater. They recently started dismantling the emptied water tanks to make room to build facilities needed for the research and storage of melted fuel debris.",
      "After a series of small missions by robots to gather samples, experts will determine a larger-scale method for removing melted fuel, first at the No. 3 reactor.",
      "Experts say the hard work and huge challenges of decommissioning the plant are just beginning. There are estimations that the work could take more than a century. The government and TEPCO have an initial completion target of 2051, but the retrieval of melted fuel debris is already three years behind, and many big issues remain undecided.",
      "Ide, whose home in Namie town, northwest of the plant, is in a no-go zone because of nuclear contamination, still has to put on a hazmat suit, even for brief visits home.",
      "\u201cAs a Fukushima citizen, I would like to make sure the decommissioning work is done properly so that people can return home without worries,\u201d he said."

He spent more than a decade as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, which makes software that helps designs processors, and joined Intel's board of directors in 2022 before stepping down last August. Tan will rejoin Intel's board in addition to becoming CEO.",

      "It also means enough Democratic votes to advance a GOP funding bill.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer announced Thursday night that he plans to vote to keep the government open, signaling that there will almost certainly be enough Democratic votes to advance a House GOP funding bill before a shutdown deadline at the end of the day Friday.",
      "In remarks on the Senate floor, Schumer conceded a government shutdown is the worse outcome.",
      "\"While the Republican bill is very bad, the potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much much worse. For sure, the Republican bill is a terrible option,\" he said. \"It is not a clean CR\" or continuing resolution, he said. \"It is deeply partisan. It doesn't address far too many of this country's needs, but I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power in a government shutdown is a far worse option.\"",
      "Schumer's announcement amounted to a major break from House Democrats who voted nearly unanimously against the GOP funding bill earlier this week. Following Schumer's remarks, top House Democrats released a joint statement reiterating that they remain \"strongly opposed\" to the GOP funding bill and say instead they support a four-week spending bill that would allow lawmakers to continue negotiating.",
      "In his remarks on the Senate floor, Schumer argued Republicans are to blame for a \"Hobson's choice\" that \"brought us to the brink of disaster.\"",
      "\"Unless Congress acts, the federal government will shut down tomorrow at midnight. I have said many times there are no winners in a government shutdown. But there are certainly victims: the most vulnerable Americans who rely on federal programs to feed their families to access medical care and to stay financially afloat,\" Schumer said.",
      "A decision to shut down the government would give President Donald Donald Trump and his senior adviser Elon Musk too much power to continue their federal worker cuts without discretion, he asserted.",
      "\"A shutdown would give Donald Trump and Elon musk carte blanche to destroy vital government services at a significantly faster rate than they can right now. Under as shutdown the Trump administration would have full authority to deem whole agencies programs an personnel nonessential, furloughing staff with no promise they would ever be rehired,\" Schumer said. \"In short: a shut down would give Donald Trump Elon musk and DOGE the keys to the city state and country.\"",
      "Earlier Thursday, Schumer told his Democratic colleagues during a closed-door lunch that he would vote to clear a path for final passage of a House-GOP funding bill, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.",

      "\"Never, ever, ever, ever, ever shut the government down,\" Fetterman told reporters at the Capitol on Thursday afternoon. \"Democrat, Republican, independents, anyone. Never shut the government down. That's one of our core responsibilities.\"",
      "Fetterman called the political pressure \"spicy\" -- telling reporters that he's remaining \"consistent\" in his principled belief not to vote for a shutdown.",
      "Fetterman acknowledged that Republicans \"are daring\" Democrats to shut down the government, but the freshman Democrat worried that furloughed workers and people depending on federal services are the ones who are \"really going to hurt.\"",
      "Now that Republicans cleared their bill through the House, Fetterman said he believes the battle is over.",
      "Fetterman said the only time Democrats have leverage is if the Republicans need the votes in the House.",
      "\"The GOP delivered, and that effectively iced this out. And that forces us to say, 'Are you going to shut the government down, or you are going to vote for a flawed CR?' And now for me, I refuse to shut the government down.\"",
      "Schumer on Wednesday said Senate Democrats would not provide the votes needed for Republicans to advance the House-approved deal to fund the government through September.

Isn't that clever?\" Rep. Jim McGovern, the ranking member on the House Rules Committee, said during floor debate Tuesday.",

    "summary": "Pete Buttigieg announced that he will not run for U.S. Senate or governor in the state of Michigan, potentially clearing the way to mount a run for president in 2028.",
    "story": [
      "His announcement comes as Democrats grapple with the future of the party.",
      "Former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg announced Thursday morning that he will not run for U.S. Senate or governor in the state of Michigan, potentially clearing the way to possibly mount a run for president in 2028.",
      "\"I care deeply about who Michigan will elect as Governor and send to the U.S. Senate next year, but I have decided against competing in either race,\" Buttigieg wrote on X. \"I remain enthusiastic about helping candidates who share our values - and who understand that in this moment, leadership means not only opposing today's cruel chaos, but also presenting a vision of a better alternative.\"",
      "Buttigieg's announcement comes as Democrats grapple both with being locked out of power in Washington and the prospect of defending multiple key Senate seats in the 2026 midterms.",
      "A lot can happen between now and the next presidential race, but there is little doubt that's what the former secretary is gearing up for. A source familiar with Buttigieg's thinking said they believe this move puts him in the strongest possible position to run in 2028 and running for governor or senator in 2026 would have taken that off the table.",
      "Buttigieg was expected to potentially announce a run for the seat being vacated by incumbent Sen. Gary Peters, who announced in January that he would not run for reelection. Incumbent Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is term-limited.",
      "Buttigieg and his family had moved to Traverse City, Michigan, his husband Chasten's hometown, in 2022.",
      "In a post on Substack elaborating on his decision not to run for Senate or governor, Buttigieg wrote that he had been seriously considered running for either jobs.",
      "\"I've had long conversations with neighbors, advisors, friends, elected officials, and with Chasten about whether to run. I reflected on what I could offer in light of the exceptionally high standards of leadership and service set by Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Senator Debbie Stabenow, and Senator Gary Peters,\" Buttigieg wrote.",
      "\"I considered what I could bring to the race compared to other likely candidates, and what running and serving would mean compared to other ways I could make a difference in the years ahead.\"",
      "He said that the Democratic Party \"has a deep and talented bench here in Michigan, and I am certain that we will nominate an outstanding candidate for each office.\"",
      "Buttigieg did not mention any specific plans for the future or his own plans, he said, include talking to \"both legacy and digital media,\" talking with people around the Midwest, and \"engaging partners, allies, friends and strangers in the service of a more convincing and widespread account of American prosperity than either side has so far offered\" -- seemingly sending a dig at both the Republican Party and his own Democratic Party. He mentioned neither party by name.",
      "Without calling out President Donald Trump by name either, Buttigieg called the United States \"demonstrably less free, less secure, less democratic - and less prosperous - than it was just ten weeks ago,\" and said that people need to both show a positive vision of a \"better future\" for America and to be creative over \"where we make our case\" given that how Americans receive information has changed.",
      "Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, first rose to national prominence when he ran in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. He served in President Joe Biden's Cabinet as secretary of the Department of Transportation, becoming the first openly gay Cabinet secretary to be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "During Biden's 2024 presidential campaign -- and later, Vice President Kamala Harris's own campaign after Biden left the race -- Buttigieg served as a key campaign surrogate and was floated as a potential running mate for Harris, who ultimately chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.",
      "Buttigieg's decision comes as both the U.S. Senate and governor races in Michigan, a key battleground state, heat up.",
      "A few figures floated as potential Senate candidates have already indicated they will not run for the seat. But the field may be set to grow. Democratic Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow wrote on X on Thursday morning, \"Busy morning, huh? Thank you to everyone encouraging me to run for Senate. I'll have more to share soon.\"",
      "The Cook Political Report currently rates the 2026 Michigan U.S. Senate race as a toss up. Michigan's other Senate seat, up for election in 2024, was narrowly won by Democratic candidate Elissa Slotkin even as Harris lost the state.",
      "Separately, the Michigan gubernatorial race already includes multiple high-profile candidates, including Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan.",

      "A federal judge on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to reinstate thousands of probationary employees fired last month from a half dozen federal agencies.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup ordered the Trump administration to reinstate employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the Department of Interior and the Department of Treasury.",
      "He also prohibited the Office of Personnel Management from issuing any guidance about whether employees can be terminated.",
      "Alsup, a Clinton appointee, also ordered the immediate discovery and deposition of Office of Personnel Management senior adviser Noah Peters, who is aligned with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "The judge slammed the attorney representing the Justice Department for refusing to make OPM Acting Director Charles Ezell available for cross-examination and for withdrawing his sworn declaration, which the judge called a \"sham.\"",
      "\"The government, I believe, has tried to frustrate the judge's ability to get at the truth of what happened here, and then set forth sham declarations,\" he said. \"That's not the way it works in the U.S. District Court.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt slammed the judge in a statement Thursday afternoon vowing to \"immediately fight back against this absurd and unconstitutional order.\"",
      "\"If a federal district court judge would like executive powers, they can try and run for President themselves. The Trump Administration will immediately fight back against this absurd and unconstitutional order,\" she said in a statement.",

      "If the Trump administration wants to reduce the size of the federal government, it would need to follow the process established in federal law, Alsup said.",
      "\"The words that I give you today should not be taken as some kind of wild and crazy judge in San Francisco has said that the administration cannot engage in a reduction-in-force,\" he said.",
      "\"The reason that OPM wanted to put this 'based on performance' was, at least in my judgment, a gimmick to avoid their Reduction in Force Act because the law always allows you to fire somebody for performance,\" Alsup said, adding that the employees terminated for \"performance\" can't even get unemployment insurance.",
      "The judge also criticized the government for submitting a declaration from Ezell he believed to be false, then withdrew it and made Ezell unavailable for testimony.",
      "\"You withdrew his declaration rather than do that. Come on, that's a sham. It upsets me. I want you to know that I've been practicing or serving in this court for over 50 years. And I know how that we get at the truth, and you're not helping me get to add to the truth. You're giving me press releases -- sham documents,\" he said.",

      "The judge also ordered discovery, he said, \"to get it at the truth because the government is saying one thing, and you're saying another.\"",
      "\u201cI just want to say it is a sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that's a lie,\u201d Alsup said. \u201cThat should not have been done in our country. It was a sham in order to try to avoid statutory requirements.\u201d",

      "The White House has quietly directed the FBI to halt the background check process for dozens of President Donald Trump's top staffers, and has transferred the process to the Pentagon, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.",
      "The directive came last month after agents tasked with completing the background investigations had conducted interviews with a handful of top White House aides -- a standard part of the background check process.",
      "White House officials took the unusual step of ordering a stop to the background check investigations after they deemed the process too intrusive, sources said.",
      "The procedure typically involves extensive interviews as well as a review of financial records, foreign contacts, past employment, and any potential security risks.",
      "The White House instead decided to transfer the background check process for White House personnel to the Department of Defense for them to complete the checks, the sources said.",
      "A former FBI official told ABC News the approach was \"highly unusual.\"",
      "\"If any of this is true, and if you apply it to whatever has been historically in the remit of the FBI, then it would be breaking that historic, long-standing precedent, and highly unusual,\" a former FBI official told ABC News. \"It would be highly unusual if that was taken away from the FBI now, for whatever reason, and given over to the DOD or another agency.\"",
      "Newly installed FBI Director Kash Patel told ABC News in a statement, \"The FBI is relentlessly focused on our mission to rebuild trust, restore law and order and let good agents be good agents -- and we have full confidence DOD can address any needs in the clearance process.\"",
      "Pentagon representatives referred questions on the matter to the White House.",
      "The background check process was halted just days before Patel was confirmed by the Senate on Feb. 20, the sources said. The FBI is still conducting background investigations for positions requiring Senate confirmation, said the sources.",
      "The Pentagon\u2019s Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) carries out the bulk of background investigations for the federal government. The FBI carries out investigations for presidential appointees that require Senate confirmation as well as some other presidential appointees, including White House staff.",
      "Historically, administrations have relied on the FBI background check process to ensure that the personnel they are hiring meet stringent ethical standards and don't risk compromising national security.",
      "\"Background investigations for national security positions are conducted to gather information to determine whether you are reliable, trustworthy, of good conduct and character, and loyal to the U.S.,\" states the SF-86 form filled out by federal employees seeking security clearances and used for background investigations.",
      "However Trump and many of his allies entered the White House with a bitter distrust of the bureau over what they argued was its \"weaponization\" through the prosecutions brought against him by former special counsel Jack Smith. His top political appointees in the opening month of the administration quickly moved to purge senior ranks of the FBI and DOJ from anyone tied to the Smith prosecutions and those they believed wouldn't be politically loyal to Trump.",
      "Among Trump's first presidential actions was issuing a memorandum granting the highest level of security clearance to top White House officials who had not been fully vetted through the background check process.",
      "That list of officials, while not publicly disclosed, included dozens of high-level White House staffers, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
      "In that memorandum, Trump claimed there was a \"backlog\" in the security clearance process -- an issue he blamed on President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "However, Trump's transition team had refused for months to enter into an agreement with the Department of Justice under Biden to begin the background check process for individuals who would staff Trump's incoming administration, which has contributed in part to the staffing issues they now face."

    "story": [
      "The fate of the IRS Direct File program remains unclear as Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency cleave their way through the federal bureaucracy",
      "WASHINGTON -- Mia Francis, a 22-year-old barista from Boston, filed her taxes on her own this year for the first time, using a free government tax filing program that made it easy because it did most of the work for her.",
      "Francis said it took 45 minutes to finish her taxes with the IRS Direct File program, an electronic tax return filing system that the IRS made permanent last year and that has rolled out to 25 states.",
      "Francis is expecting a $530 refund. And because she saved cash by not using a commercial tax preparation company to file her taxes, \u201cthat money will go a long way,\u201d she said. She plans to use it for a trip to Amsterdam this year.",
      "Despite its popularity with Francis and other members of the American public, the IRS Direct File\u2019s fate remains unclear as Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency cleave their way through the federal bureaucracy. So far, the program is still available for use ahead of the April 15 tax filing deadline, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent committed during his January confirmation hearing to maintaining it, at least for this tax season.",
      "Representatives from the Internal Revenue Service and DOGE did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press on their plans for Direct File. But one Republican tax expert says the IRS never got congressional authorization to create Direct File. And Republican lawmakers and commercial tax preparation firms complain the program is a waste of money because free filing programs already exist, although they are hard to use.",
      "Direct File was rolled out as a pilot program in 2024 after the IRS was tasked with looking into how to create a \u201cdirect file\u201d system as part of the money it received from the Inflation Reduction Act signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2022. Last May, the agency announced that the program would be made permanent.",
      "The IRS accepted 140,803 returns filed by taxpayers using Direct File in the 12 states where it was available last tax season. It\u2019s been expanded to include half the country this year. It is unclear how many taxpayers have used Direct File this year.",
      "Merici Vinton, an original architect of Direct File from the U.S. Digital Service, noted the ease and accessibility of the program and called it \u201ca great example of how people should interact with the government in the 21st century.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe effectively launched a startup in the IRS,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was built by an in-house product team, in an iterative manner, and we ship updates to the software to improve user experience in real time based on feedback. If we continue to invest in it, both taxpayers and the IRS can benefit.\u201d",
      "Musk posted last month on his social media site that he had \u201cdeleted\u201d 18F, a government agency that worked on technology projects such as the IRS\u2019 Direct File program. This led to some confusion about whether Direct File is still available to taxpayers. However, conversations inside the IRS indicate that no decision has been made on whether to cut the program, two people familiar with these conversations tell the AP.",
      "Former IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel, who oversaw the rollout of the program, said Treasury officials considering the future of the program should take into account \u201cthe voice of the taxpayers.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy reflection is that taxpayers are in very different situations and have very different preferences for how they want to file,\" he said. \u201cThose whose preference is to file electronically direct with the IRS for free, it\u2019s a good option to have on the menu. But it should not replace other options.\u201d",
      "Derrick Plummer, a spokesperson for Intuit, one of the country's largest commercial tax preparation firms, said free tax preparation had been available for years before Direct File came along.",
      "\u201cIRS Direct File is a solution in search of a problem, a waste of taxpayer dollars and a drain on critical IRS resources,\u201d he said. A June 2024 Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration report estimates that the annual costs of Direct File may range from $64 million to $249 million.",
      "\u201cThe IRS should focus on its core mission including data privacy and customer service while policymakers in Washington focus on simplifying the tax code,\u201d Plummer said.",
      "However, other taxpayers, like 31 year-old Aquiel Warner in Austin, Texas, say they want to avoid using commercial tax preparation software.",
      "Warner filed her taxes with Direct File in 10 minutes using her phone and a chatbot that the IRS provides. She likes the program\u2019s convenience, that it prepopulated her tax forms and that it allowed for free filing. Although she has some concerns about data privacy in the government \u2014 DOGE is reported to have access to some of the IRS' internal systems \u2014 she feels more secure going through the IRS than commercial tax preparation services.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a product. I don\u2019t want my information sold when I file my taxes,\" she said. \"I have to file my taxes, and I don\u2019t want to be put in a situation where, in order to file my taxes, I have to pay to get the help I need because I\u2019m not a professional tax preparer.\"",
      "Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, said the IRS never got explicit permission from Congress to create the Direct File system.",
      "\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a good idea. It was done illegally,\" he said, calling on Congress and the Justice Department to look into what he says is unauthorized spending that went into the creation of Direct File.",
      "Democratic lawmakers in January asked Bessent and IRS commissioner nominee Billy Long to preserve the program. They wrote in a letter that \u201cending Direct File would hurt everyday Americans.\u201d Long has not yet received a nomination hearing.",
      "In the meantime, Musk and his cadre of computer programmers could decide to wield their tech skills to boost the program \u2014 or use the very same digital savvy to delete it.",
      "For his part, Werfel hopes that the agency will keep the program. \u201cIt\u2019s a big country with a lot of taxpayers with a lot of different preferences,\u201d he said.",
      "Francis, the Boston barista, hopes so, too.",
      "\u201dThere are a lot of young people like me who are working and figuring out how to file their taxes \u2014 this just makes it faster and easier,\" she said."

      "Williamson's attorney, Theodore O'Reilly, told The Associated Press that prosecutors reduced the charge to battery in exchange for his guilty plea and a promise to serve as a witness. O'Reilly said he wasn't sure whether Williamson would be asked to testify against others implicated in Mitchell's death.",
      "Williamson faces up to nine months behind bars when he's sentenced Sept. 3 on the battery count. He could have been sentenced to up to 15 years if convicted on the murder count.",

Turner pleaded guilty to that count last week in a deal with prosecutors. He could receive probation in exchange for testifying against the other men. His sentencing hearing is scheduled for Sept. 3 as well.",
      "Erickson is set to stand trial in August. Johnson-Carson has a plea hearing set for March 20.",

      "A beloved reindeer in Alaska's biggest city is fighting for his life after falling mysteriously falling ill after someone tampered with his pen",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- An iconic reindeer so beloved that he has been in parades, featured on reality TV shows and visited by schoolchildren on field trips in Alaska's largest city is fighting for his life after mysteriously falling ill after someone tampered with his pen.",
      "Ever since, 8-year-old Star has had pneumonia, digestion issues and rapid weight loss. Star's owner, Albert Whitehead, has taken him to a veterinarian every other day to receive care and in hopes of finding a cause for the issues.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve done everything possible for him,\u201d Whitehead said. Veterinarian Sabrieta Holland said she the reindeer's prognosis is \u201cguarded.\u201d",
      "Star lives in a fenced-in pen attached to Whitehead\u2019s house at the edge of downtown Anchorage. It\u2019s been over 20 years since someone last tried to tamper with the enclosure where reindeer named Star have been kept for the last seven decades. Star is the seventh in a line of reindeer to carry that name.",
      "In early January, someone cut a huge hole in the fencing to gain entrance, spending about five minutes inside with Star before taking off. What the person did in the pen is unknown, but Star began having stomach issues and dropping weight shortly after.",
      "Then, on Feb. 20, Anchorage police found the friendly and trusting reindeer wandering around downtown and returned him home.",
      "When Whitehead reviewed his security cameras, he found someone had used bolt cutters to remove padlocks off Star\u2019s pen and an alley gate. Star followed the man out into the neighborhood, and the reindeer wound up alone downtown, familiar streets because that's where Whitehead walks him.",
      "The next night, the situation turned more serious.",
      "Whitehead was watching the video feed when a man wearing a scarf over his face sprayed something from two different cans into Star\u2019s pen and twice hit the reindeer in the face with an unknown substance.",
      "Whitehead rushed outside to confront the man.",
      "\u201cI yelled at him to stop, \u2018What the hell are you doing? What are you spraying on the animal? Don\u2019t do that, quit that!\u2019\u201d Whitehead said.",
      "The man replied: \u201cI\u2019m trying to help Star.\"",
      "\u201cI have no idea what he meant by that,\u201d said Whitehead, who suspects \u2014 based on the smells \u2014 that the sprays could have been a disinfectant and deodorizer.",
      "Whitehead and police believe it was the same man from the prior night. It\u2019s not known if the January tampering involved the same person.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the individual wanted to harm Star, but by his actions, he did,\u201d Whitehead said.",
      "Anchorage police posted the surveillance video on social media in hopes it would lead to the suspect\u2019s identity. So far, no viable tips have come in, spokesperson Christopher Barraza said in an email.",
      "Star's pneumonia worsened, and a cough leads Whitehead to believe Star ate something harmful, perhaps while loose.",
      "The pneumonia is likely due to him accidentally inhaling the chronic reflux or regurgitation of the contents in the largest of the reindeers\u2019 four stomachs, Holland said. The sprays possibly also contributed.",
      "It\u2019s possible there\u2019s a blockage, but the largest stomach of a reindeer is quite big and not easily obstructed, Holland said. However, ingested plastic bags causing chronic weight loss and indigestion problems are the most common foreign objects she's seen in reindeer.",
      "The next option would be surgery to look at the reindeer's abdomen and possibly remove any blockage, but it\u2019s generally a poor outcome, even in healthy deer, she said.",
      "The bond between Whitehead and Star is \u201cquite significant and precious,\" Holland said.",
      "\"Albert\u2019s daily life and reason for getting out for walks and such all are because of Star. And Star is really fond of Albert, too,\u201d Holland said in a text. \u201cIt will be quite devastating for him if he loses Star.\u201d",
      "Anchorage pioneers Oro and Ivan Stewart started the reindeer tradition, bringing the deer they received from an Alaska Native herder to Anchorage in the 1950s. Whitehead took over as caretaker from his friends in 2002.",
      "The average lifespan of a reindeer is about 15 years, but some Stars had long lives, like the first who lived to 23. Others didn't live as long, including the second Star, who was stolen, beaten to death and then butchered by a known Fairbanks meat thief. The third Star died after eating a plastic bag."

      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Federal aviation investigators say a deadly 2023 Utah plane crash was likely caused by the North Dakota lawmaker piloting the aircraft who became disoriented as he took off at night without turning on the runway lights.",
      "North Dakota state Sen. Doug Larsen, his wife and their two young sons died when the small plane Larsen was piloting crashed near the desert recreation town of Moab, Utah, after a refueling stop. They were on their way home after visiting family in Scottsdale, Arizona, when the plane's landing gear struck a hill and brought the aircraft crashing down.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board said in a new report that Larsen lost his visual reference to the horizon and flew into rocky terrain.",
      "Security footage confirmed he did not turn on runway lights, which were fully operational at the time. A pilot can typically turn on runway lights easily with just a few clicks on the microphone at an uncontrolled airport like Canyonlands Airfield. Investigators did not find any mechanical problems with the single-engine Piper plane in their inspection of the wreckage.",
      "Before the flight, Larsen had received a weather briefing and logged nearly 45 hours of previous night flying experience, according to the report. It indicated that Larsen had received instrument training, a certification that allowed him to fly in low visibility conditions relying solely on aircraft instruments.",
      "The family took off from the Utah airfield at 8:23 p.m., before the moon had risen completely above the horizon in a region known for its dark skies and prime stargazing. A local operator in southeastern Utah told investigators that their company pilots do not usually depart at night from the runway Larsen used, due to the dark conditions and the lack of visual references.",
      "An autopsy of Larsen performed by the Office of the Medical Examiner and the Utah Department of Health and Human Services found that the cause of death was blunt force injuries.",
      "Larsen was a Republican first elected to the North Dakota Senate in 2020, where he chaired a panel on industry and business legislation. He and his wife, Amy, owned a home building company and hotels in Bismarck. Larsen served 29 years in the North Dakota Army National Guard and was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal, Bronze Service Star and Army Aviator Badge."

      "UNITED NATIONS -- The war in Sudan has created the world\u2019s largest and most devastating humanitarian crisis with over 30 million people needing aid this year, 16 million of them children trying to survive in dire conditions, the head of the U.N. children\u2019s agency said Thursday.",
      "With no end in sight to the nearly two-year conflict, Catherine Russell told the U.N. Security Council that children in Sudan are enduring \"unimaginable suffering and horrific violence.\u201d",
      "An estimated 1.3 million children live in places where famine is occurring, and more than 770,000 children are expected to suffer \u201csevere acute malnutrition\u201d this year \u2014 and without aid many of them will die, she said.",
      "Sudan plunged into conflict in April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions, including the vast western Darfur region.",
      "Since then, at least 20,000 people have been killed, though the number is likely far higher, and more than 14 million have been driven from their homes.",
      "The UNICEF executive director said 80% of the more than 900 grave incidents against children reported in the last six months of 2024 were killings or maimings, primarily in Darfur, Khartoum and Gezira province. \u201cSadly, we know these numbers are just a fraction of the reality,\u201d she said.",
      "Russell said sexual violence used to terrorize the Sudanese population is pervasive, with an estimated 12.1 million women and girls \u2014 and increasingly men and boys \u2014 at risk right now. She said this is an 80% increase from last year.",
      "According to data UNICEF analyzed from groups providing services in Sudan, there were 221 reported cases of rape against children in 2024 in nine provinces, she said. UNICEF estimates that 67% of rape victims were girls and 33% boys.",
      "\u201cIn 16 of the recorded cases, the children were under the age of five. Four were babies under the age of one,\u201d Russell said.",

      "Christopher Lockyear, secretary-general of Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, who was in Khartoum province six weeks ago, told the council that both sides in the conflict are compounding the suffering of civilians.",
      "Government forces have indiscriminately bombed populated areas, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and allied militias have engaged in systematic sexual violence, abductions, mass killings, the looting of humanitarian aid and occupation of medical facilities, he said.",
      "\u201cBoth sides have laid siege to towns, destroyed vital civilian infrastructure, and blocked humanitarian aid,\u201d he said.",
      "Lockyear said the Security Council has passed resolutions calling for an end to the conflict but has failed to translate its demands into action.

      "\u201cI\u2019m just standing up for my rights, and I\u2019m standing up for Mahmoud Khalil, who has been abducted illegally and taken to an undisclosed location,\" Winger told The Associated Press, referring to how Khalil's attorney didn't know his whereabouts immediately following his arrest. \"Does that sound like America to you?\u201d",

      "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is listing all the federal real estate leases it is ending, but new records obtained by The Associated Press show when those cancellations are expected to take effect",
      "Federal agencies will begin to vacate hundreds of offices across the country this summer under a frenetic and error-riddled push by Elon Musk\u2019s budget-cutting advisers to terminate leases that they say waste money.",
      "Musk's Department of Government Efficiency maintains a list of canceled real estate leases on its website, but internal documents obtained by The Associated Press contain a crucial detail: when those cancellations are expected to take effect. The documents from inside the General Services Administration, the U.S. government's real estate manager, list dozens of federal office and building leases expected to end by June 30, with hundreds more slated over the coming months.",
      "The rapid pace of cancellations has raised alarms, with some agencies and lawmakers appealing to DOGE to exempt specific buildings. Several agencies are facing 20 or more lease cancellations in all, including the IRS, the Social Security Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Many of the terminations would affect agencies that aren't as well-known but oversee services critical to many Americans.",
      "They span from a Boise, Idaho, office of the Bureau of Reclamation \u2014 which oversees water supply and deals with disputes across the often-parched American West \u2014 to a Joliet, Illinois, outpost of the Railroad Retirement Board, which provides benefits for railroad workers and their survivors.",
      "The lease terminations do not mean all the locations will close. In some cases, agencies may negotiate new leases to stay in place, downsize their existing space or relocate elsewhere.",
      "\u201cSome agencies are saying: \u2018I\u2019m not leaving. We can\u2019t leave,\u2019\" said Chad Becker, a former GSA real estate official who now represents building owners with government leases at Arco Real Estate Solutions. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be a period of pushback, a period of disbelief. And then, if necessary, they may start working on the actual execution of a move.\"",
      "DOGE says GSA has notified landlords in recent weeks that it plans to terminate 793 leases, focusing mostly on those that can be ended within months without penalty. The group estimates those moves will save roughly $500 million over the terms of the leases, which in some cases were slated to continue into the 2030s. The Bureau of Reclamation cancellation in Boise, for instance, would take effect Aug. 31 and is expected to save a total of $18.7 million through 2035.",
      "But DOGE\u2019s savings estimates \u2014 a fraction of Musk\u2019s $1 trillion cost-cutting goal \u2014 have not been verified and do not take into account the costs of moves and closures. The group has released no information about what they will mean for agencies.",
      "\u201cMy initial reaction is this is just going to cause more chaos,\u201d said Jim Simpson, an accountant in Arizona who helps low-income people file taxes and serves on an IRS panel that advocates for taxpayers. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of room to help with government efficiency, but it should be done surgically and not with a chainsaw.\u201d",
      "Simpson said he was surprised to learn that dozens of IRS offices, including local taxpayer assistance centers, were facing upcoming lease cancellations. He refers clients there to get paperwork to file returns and answer IRS inquiries, and he said losing services would \u201ccause a lot of anxiety\u201d and delay refunds.",
      "Plans to cancel the leases at several of the IRS centers and other sites were in error and have been rescinded, according to a person with direct knowledge of the changes who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity in order to avoid retaliation. Those changes are not yet reflected on DOGE\u2019s list, which only removed one and added dozens more in its latest update published Thursday.",
      "The GSA walked back the cancellation of a Geological Survey office in Anchorage, Alaska, for instance, after learning it did not have termination rights, according to the person familiar with the matter.",
      "Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said Monday that he\u2019d convinced DOGE to back off lease terminations planned for the National Weather Center in Norman, a Social Security office in Lawton and the Indian Health Services office in Oklahoma City. But all three leases remained on DOGE\u2019s list of cancellations as of Thursday.",
      "GSA's press office didn't respond to inquiries.",
      "While there was already a bipartisan push to reduce the government\u2019s real estate footprint, the mass cancellations blindsided an industry known for its stability.",
      "Landlords who had been expecting government agencies to remain tenants, for several more years in some cases under their existing leases, were stunned. Some agencies learned from building managers, not their federal partners, that their leases were being canceled, according to real estate managers.",
      "Becker, whose firm is tracking the DOGE lease cancellations, and other observers said they expect some agencies will be unable to move their personnel and property out of their spaces within such tight timelines. That may force some agencies to pay additional rent during what\u2019s known as a holdover period, undermining DOGE's stated goal of saving taxpayer money.",
      "The Building Owners and Managers Association, which represents the commercial real estate industry, told landlords in a recent advocacy alert to be prepared to seek payment from any federal government tenants who stay beyond their leases.",
      "Asked about plans for buildings with leases that will soon expire, the IRS did not respond. A Social Security Administration spokesperson downplayed the impact of its offices losing leases, saying many were \u201csmall remote hearing sites,\u201d did not serve the public, were already being consolidated elsewhere or planned for closure.",
      "Several other agencies provided little clarity \u2014 saying they were working with GSA to consider their options, in statements that were nearly identical in some cases.",
      "But a spokesperson for the Railroad Retirement Board expressed concern over the upcoming lease cancellations of its offices in Joliet, Illinois, and eight other states, saying it was working to \"maintain a public-facing office presence for the local railroad community.\u201d",
      "Government Accountability Office official David Marroni told a congressional hearing last week that the push to unload unnecessary federal real estate was \u201clong overdue,\u201d saying agencies have for too long held on to unnecessary space. But he warned the downsizing must be deliberate and carefully planned to \u201cgenerate substantial savings and mitigate the risk of mistakes and unexpected mission impacts.\u201d",
      "That process had already started before Musk\u2019s team arrived, with the federal government\u2019s real estate portfolio steadily declining over the last decade. Indeed, critics of DOGE say if it were truly interested in cost-cutting it could learn from GSA, whose mission even before Trump took office was to deliver \u201ceffective and efficient\u201d services to the American public.",
      "A law signed by former President Joe Biden before he left office in January directed agencies to measure the true occupancy rates of leased spaces by this summer. Those that did not meet a target of 60% use rate over time would be directed to dispose of their excess space.",
      "\u201dThere is a logical and orderly way to do this,\u201d Rep. Greg Stanton, an Arizona Democrat, said at last week\u2019s hearing. Instead, he said, DOGE is pursuing a reckless approach that threatens to harm the delivery of public services.",
      "Industry observers cautioned that each situation is different, and it will take months or years to understand the full impact of the lease cancellations.",
      "\u201cIt really depends on the terms. But it is a shock, there is no question, that all of a sudden, boom, in six weeks all these things have happened,\u201d said J. Reid Cummings, a professor of finance and real estate at the University of South Alabama. \u201cIt\u2019s like a blitzkrieg.\u201d",

      "Tennessee became the first state in the country a hundred years ago to ban the teaching of evolution in public school classrooms",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- They called it the \u201cmonkey trial.\u201d It was supposed to be a publicity stunt.",
      "A hundred years later, it is remembered as far more.",
      "In March 1925, Tennessee became the first state in the country to ban the teaching of evolution in public school classrooms. Strong reactions rippled across the United States. The eventual upshot: a legal battle that became one of the most renowned in the nation's history.",
      "Historians say the trial started as a tourism gambit on behalf of the small town of Dayton, Tennessee \u2014 where the landmark case unfolded. The town's leaders were eager for an economic boost and encouraged a local teacher to challenge the law. They wanted the debate over the controversial anti-evolution mandate to take place in their own backyard while the rest of the country eagerly followed along.",
      "But amid the spectacle, the arguments and tensions raised during the eight-day trial persist. The rift over evolution and creationism \u2014 particularly in classrooms \u2014 has never fully been put to rest, and questions over how students should be taught about life's origins still spark debate among educators, lawmakers, and the public.",
      "Here's a look at what you need to know about the Scopes trial:",
      "No.",
      "In 1859, British naturalist Charles Darwin published \u201cOn the Origin of Species,\u201d which explained his theory of evolution by means of natural selection. Darwin's theory was seen as a direct challenge to the biblical story of creation by many fundamentalist Christians at the time. That contention came to a head in the 1920s when state lawmakers began considering outlawing the teaching of evolution in public schools.",
      "Tennessee lawmakers were the first to take the step, passing the Butler Act on March 13, 1925, banning the teaching of any theory saying humanity descended from a \u201clower order of animal\u201d in contradiction to the biblical teaching of divine creation.",
      "In response, the American Civil Liberties Union put out an ad offering to defend and finance the legal bills for any teacher willing to be a defendant in a test case challenging the evolution ban. According to the Tennessee State Library, Dayton community leaders found 24-year-old John T. Scopes, who had just finished his first year of teaching, willing to take up the test case.",
      "Scopes was arrested on May 9 and the trial started July 10.",
      "The Scopes trial became sensational largely because it brought together two long-time adversaries and powerful speakers William Jennings Bryan and Clarence Darrow.",
      "Bryan, a former secretary of state who ran for president three times and served in Congress, lent star power to the prosecution. Meanwhile, Darrow \u2014 one of the foremost defense attorneys of his time \u2014 agreed to represent Scopes after concluding a separate high-profile case where he saved child-killers Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb from the death penalty.",
      "Together, the two faced off in a contest not only between creationism and evolution, but also religion and science. Bryan, a fundamentalist Christian, was a leading champion of the anti-evolution movement in the early 1900s. Darrow was an agnostic.",
      "According to the ACLU, roughly 1,000 people and reporters from more than 100 newspapers attended each day of the trial.",
      "Many tried to capitalize off the case by playing off the popular misconception that Darwin's theory says man descended from apes. The actual theory says man and apes have a common ancestor, but local businesses nevertheless began selling primate-themed souvenirs and novelty dollars. The Dayton Hotel installed a gorilla display in its lobby and a trained chimpanzee named Joe Mendi was brought in to entertain spectators.",
      "Bryan himself took the stand to defend the biblical account of creation. Under withering questioning from Darrow, he conceded some biblical passages should be understood \u201cillustratively\u201d rather than literally.",
      "With as much ink and attention given to the Scopes trial, the case itself only lasted eight days and the jury returned a guilty verdict after deliberating for less than 10 minutes.",
      "Scopes was fined $100 for violating the Butler Act, a punishment that was eventually overturned on a technicality by the Tennessee Supreme Court.",
      "While the jury sided with the prosecution, the case generated more attention and interest in the theory of evolution. More than 20 anti-evolution theory bills were defeated in statehouses across the U.S. shortly after the Scopes trial. But the debate didn't end there.",
      "It would take another four decades before Tennessee lawmakers agreed to repeal the Butler Act, nearly around the same time the ACLU found another case to challenge anti-evolution laws.",
      "In the 1960s, the ACLU filed an amicus brief on behalf of a zoology teacher in Arkansas, challenging a state law that banned teaching \u201cthat mankind ascended or descended from a lower order of animals.\u201d Unlike the Tennessee case, the Arkansas legal battle went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court where justices declared the anti-evolution law a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.",
      "A federal judge ruled in 2005 that a Pennsylvania public school district could not teach \u201cintelligent design\u201d \u2014 the idea life is too complex to have arisen by natural causes \u2014 because it is \u201ca religious view, a mere re-labeling of creationism, and not a scientific theory.\u201d",

      "The Oklahoma Attorney General\u2019s office says a former pastor of a Texas megachurch who resigned after a woman accused him of sexually abusing her in the 1980s has been indicted on child sexual abuse charges",
      "DALLAS -- A former pastor of a Texas megachurch who resigned after a woman accused him of sexually abusing her in the 1980s has been indicted in Oklahoma on child sexual abuse charges, that state's attorney general\u2019s office said Wednesday.",
      "Robert Preston Morris, 63, has been charged with five counts of lewd or indecent acts with a child.",
      "The alleged abuse started in 1982 when the victim, referred to in the indictment as C.C., was 12 years old and Morris was a traveling evangelist staying in Hominy, Oklahoma, with her family, according to the attorney general\u2019s office. The abuse allegedly continued for four years.",
      "Cindy Clemishire, Morris\u2019 accuser, said in a statement that she is very grateful to the authorities who have worked to make the indictment possible and is hopeful \"justice will ultimately prevail.\u201d",
      "\u201cAfter almost 43 years, the law has finally caught up with Robert Morris for the horrific crimes he committed against me as a child,\" said Clemishire, now 55. \u201cNow, it is time for the legal system to hold him accountable.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press typically does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted, but Clemishire said she would like her name included.",
      "Phone numbers associated with Morris were either disconnected or messages were not immediately returned Wednesday. It was unclear whether he has an attorney.",
      "\u201cThere can be no tolerance for those who sexually prey on children,\u201d Attorney General Gentner Drummond said in a statement. \u201cThis case is all the more despicable because the alleged perpetrator was a pastor who exploited his position. The victim in this case has waited far too many years for justice to be done.\u201d",
      "The Gateway Church, based in the Dallas suburb of Southlake, was founded by Morris in 2000. It said in a statement Wednesday that its members are praying for Clemishire and \u201call of those impacted by this terrible situation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are aware of the actions being taken by the legal authorities in Oklahoma and are grateful for the work of the justice system in holding abusers accountable for their actions,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Morris resigned last year from the church after allegations came to light on the religious watchdog blog The Wartburg Watch.",
      "Clemishire told The Dallas Morning News last year that she met Morris in 1981, when he was a traveling preacher and began preaching at her family\u2019s church in Oklahoma. She said Morris and his wife and young son became close to her family. She said he was staying at her house in 1982 when the abuse began.",
      "The church has multiple locations in the area. It is among the largest in the United States, according to the attorney general\u2019s office.",
      "Morris was known to be politically active. The church hosted President Donald Trump on its Dallas campus in 2020 for a discussion on race relations and the economy.",
      "Morris could face up to 20 years in prison for each of the five charges, according to the attorney general\u2019s office. He was not in custody as of Wednesday."

      "U.S. wholesale inflation decelerated last month, suggesting that price pressures are easing for now",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. wholesale inflation decelerated last month, suggesting that price pressures are easing for now. But the progress may not last as President Trump intensifies his trade wars.",
      "The Labor Department reported Thursday that its producer price index \u2014 which tracks inflation before it reaches consumers \u2014 was unchanged from January after rising 0.6% the month before. Compared to a year earlier, producer prices were up 3.2%, down from a year-over-year gain of 3.7% in January.",
      "Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core wholesale prices fell 0.1% last month from January, first drop since July. Core producer prices rose 3.4%, lower than the 3.8% year-over-year gain in January. The numbers were all lower than economists had expected.",
      "The readout comes as Trump ramps up his trade war with a wide range of U.S. trade partners, threatening to send inflation higher. He has effectively imposed 25% taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on foreign steel and aluminum and has plastered 20% levies on Chinese imports. In coming weeks, he is set to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and to introduce \"reciprocal tariffs'' that match higher taxes that other countries slap on U.S. products. And on Thursday the president threatened a 200% on European wine, champagne and spirits if Europe goes ahead with a tariff on U.S. whiskey.",
      "Major retailers have warned that they expect U.S. consumers to pull back spending this year in the face of higher costs, partially from from Trump's tariffs.",
      "On Wednesday, the Labor Department said that consumer price inflation slowed last month for the first time since September. The consumer price index was up 2.8% from a year ago, down from a 3% year-over-year increase in January. Core consumer prices rose 3.1% from a year earlier, smallest increase since April 2021.",
      "Wholesale gasoline prices fell 4.7% last month. Food prices rose 1.7% from January to February, led by a 28% surge in the price of eggs.",
      "After cutting its benchmark rate three times in late 2024, the Federal Reserve is expected to leave the rate unchanged at its meeting next week. \u201cThe Fed will not see any argument for pushing interest rates lower or sooner in today\u2019s figures,\u201d Carl Weinberg and Mary Chen of High Frequency Economics wrote in a commentary Thursday. \u201cThe Fed is focused now on the impact of tariffs on future food prices much more than it is focused on the impact of egg prices on prior (producer price) increases.\u2019\u2019",
      "Wholesale prices can offer an early look at where consumer inflation might be headed. Economists also watch it because some of its components, notably health care and financial services, flow into the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index. Thomas Ryan of Capital Economics noted that some of the wholesale prices that feed into the PCE measure, including hospital costs and international airfares, came in hotter than expected in February.",

Economists stress there could greater consequences on businesses and economies worldwide this time \u2014 and that higher prices will likely leave consumers footing the bill.",
      "There's also been a sense of whiplash from Trump's back-and-forth tariff threats and responding retaliation, including recently-postponed levies for some goods from Canada and Mexico that followed a 30-day pause for the auto industry. The uncertainty has roiled financial markets, lowered consumer confidence, and enveloped many businesses with questions that could delay hiring and investment.",
      "Here's a timeline of how we got here:",
      "Trump launches a trade war during his first term in office \u2014 taking particular aim at China.",
      "The two countries exchange a series of tit-for-tat levies, with Trump putting tariffs on most Chinese goods and Beijing responding with its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products ranging from fruit, soybeans and wine to aircraft, automotive and chemical imports.",
      "Separately, Trump slaps tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines. And in 2018, he escalates tensions with other trading partners by imposing taxes of 25% on imported steel and 10% on aluminum imports. He also uses the threat of more tariffs to force Canada and Mexico to renegotiate a North American trade pact, called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, in 2020.",
      "President Joe Biden largely preserves most of the tariffs Trump previously enacted against China, but his administration claims to take a more targeted approach.",
      "In October 2022, he issues sweeping new restrictions on selling semiconductors and chipmaking equipment to China. These curbs will be expanded in October 2023 and December 2024 \u2014 when China responds with a ban of U.S. exports for various high-tech materials like gallium and germanium.",
      "Biden also hikes tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, solar cells, steel, aluminum and medical equipment in May 2024. And in July, he imposes tariffs on steel and aluminum shipped from Mexico but made elsewhere in an attempt to stop China from circumventing import taxes.",
      "Trump wins the U.S. presidential election. He continues to promise steep tariff hikes in the coming weeks and months leading up to his first day back in office.",
      "Trump is sworn in. In his inaugural address, he again promises to \u201ctariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.\" And he reiterates plans to create an agency called the External Revenue Service, which has yet to be established.",

      "In response, Petro also announces a retaliatory 25% increase in Colombian tariffs on U.S. goods. But Colombia later reversed its decision and accepted the flights carrying migrants. The two countries soon signaled a halt in the trade dispute.",
      "Trump signs an executive order to impose tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada and China \u2014 10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 4. Trump invoked this power by declaring a national emergency \u2014 ostensibly over undocumented immigration and drug trafficking. The levies on Canada and Mexico threaten to blow up Trump\u2019s own USMCA trade deal, which allowed many products to cross North American borders duty free.",
      "The action prompts swift outrage from all three countries, with promises of retaliatory measures.",

      "Trump announces a plan for \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs \u2014 promising to increase U.S. tariffs to match the tax rates that other countries charge on imports \u201cfor purposes of fairness.\u201d Economists warn that the reciprocal tariffs, set to overturn decades of trade policy, could create chaos for global businesses.",
      "Beyond China, Canada and Mexico, he indicates that additional countries, such as India, won\u2019t be spared from higher tariffs. And in the following weeks, Trump suggests that European countries could face a 25% levy as part of these efforts.",
      "Trump signed an executive order instructing the Commerce Department to consider whether a tariff on imported copper is needed to protect national security. He cites the material's use in U.S. defense, infrastructure and emerging technologies.",

      "Trump\u2019s 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico go into effect, though he limits the levy to 10% on Canadian energy. He also doubles the tariff on all Chinese imports to 20%.",
      "All three countries promise retaliatory measures. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces tariffs on more than $100 billion of American goods over the course of 21 days. And Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says her country would respond with its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods without specifying the targeted products immediately, signaling hopes to de-escalate.",
      "China, meanwhile, imposes tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of key U.S. farm exports. It also expands the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen.",

      "In a wider extension, Trump postpones 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada for a month. But he still plans to impose \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs starting on April 2.",
      "Trump credited Sheinbaum with making progress on border security and drug smuggling as a reason for again pausing tariffs \u2014 and the Mexican president said in a post on X that she and Trump \u201chad an excellent and respectful call in which we agreed that our work and collaboration have yielded unprecedented results.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s actions also thawed relations with Canada somewhat, although outrage and uncertainty over the trade war remains. Still, after its initial retaliatory tariffs of $30 billion Canadian (US$21 billion) on U.S. goods, the government said it had suspended its second wave of retaliatory tariffs worth $125 billion Canadian (US$87 billion).",
      "China retaliates against Trump\u2019s tariffs by imposing additional 15% taxes on key American farm products, including chicken, pork, soybeans and beef. The escalating trade tensions push stocks lower on Monday as investors worry about the pain Trump\u2019s trade wars risk inflicting on the American economy.",
      "The Chinese tariffs were a response to Trump\u2019s decision to double the levy on Chinese imports to 20% on March 4. China\u2019s Commerce Ministry had earlier said that goods already in transit would be exempt from the retaliatory tariffs until April 12.",
      "Trump increases tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%, removing exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on the metals in addition to increasing the tariffs on aluminum from 10%.",
      "The European Union takes retaliatory trade action with new duties on U.S. industrial and farm products. The measures will cover goods from the United States worth some 26 billion euros ($28 billion), and not just steel and aluminum products, but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods. Motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans will be hit, as they were during Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Trump threatens a 200% tariff on European wine, Champagne and spirits if the European Union goes forward with a planned 50% tariff on American whiskey.",
      "The European import tax, which was unveiled in response to steel and aluminum tariffs by the U.S. administration, is expected to go into effect April 1, just ahead of separate reciprocal tariffs that Trump plans to place on the EU.."

      "ICE calls people in for appointments for several reasons, including issuing a court date. If an immigrant breaks the law during that time or a judge declines their appeal to stay in the U.S., ICE can detain and deport them.",
      "In Louisiana, ICE detained an immigrant last month who was asked to show up under the guise of being eligible for another program with less supervision, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, which declined to offer further details.",
      "ICE also has locked up some people it just recently deemed as likely to qualify for asylum and unlikely to flee authorities.",
      "John Torres, a former ICE acting director, said it\u2019s hard to comment in detail without more information about each case. But, he added, \u201cthe major reason those things take place is because something has changed in their status or something\u2019s been discovered about their background.\u201d",
      "An immigrant from Ecuador who is in his 20s is among the asylum-seekers who have been detained, according to attorney Rosa Barreca.",
      "It happened at the man's first check-in, on Feb. 3. The man had turned himself in to border agents after entering the U.S. illegally three weeks earlier. ICE officials at that time interviewed him and released him from custody, concluding he had a reasonable fear of persecution if he returned to his home country, according to Barreca.",
      "Releasing him suggested that ICE wasn\u2019t concerned he would flee. The fact that he didn't made it easier for ICE to jail him.",
      "\u201cThe family called me surprised and in a panic,\u201d said Barreca, who runs a private practice in Philadelphia, where the man's family lives. \u201cWhen I asked the reason, he just said it is based on the executive orders and didn\u2019t specify anything further.\u201d",
      "He had no criminal convictions and no contact with police during his few weeks in the U.S., Barreca said, ruling out every red flag she can imagine.",
      "Lawyers cannot advise clients to simply skip the meetings, which would lead to deportation orders. Instead, advocates and lawyers urge immigrants to prepare for appointments and the possibility of detention. They\u2019re cautioning immigrants to note sudden changes in how their check-ins are conducted \u2014 such as appointments that were always virtual instead being done in person.",
      "They are also encouraging immigrants to make emergency child care arrangements and to provide details of their cases with friends and family. That includes sharing a unique identification number that ICE uses to track people.",
      "Immigrant rights groups say people should bring someone, preferably an attorney, to ICE appointments.",
      "Advocates are also returning to a tactic from the first Trump administration by telling people to have a group of supporters walk them to their check-ins and wait outside.",
      "\u201cWhen people feel unsafe going to report, it\u2019s setting everything up for failure,\u201d said Heidi Altman, vice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center. \u201cIt undermines the trust that people need to have.\u201d",

      "The UK economy shrank unexpectedly in January, in a blow to the government ahead of its Spring Statement later this month.",
      "The economy contracted by 0.1%, which was weaker than forecast, driven mainly by a decline in the manufacturing sector.",
      "The government has made boosting growth its key priority, but a weaker economy is expected to affect Chancellor Rachel Reeves's decisions as she seeks to meet her self-imposed rules on tax and spending.",
      "Reeves said the government needed to go \"further and faster\" on the economy, but the Conservatives accused it of being a \"growth killer\".",
      "Economists had predicted the economy would grow by 0.1% in January, after 0.4% growth in December. Monthly readings can be volatile, and the ONS said the economy was estimated to have grown by 0.2% over the three months to January.",
      "But the overall picture for the UK was one of weak growth, said Liz McKeown, ONS director of economic statistics.",
      "Construction and oil and gas extraction had a weak month, she said.",
      "But this was partially offset by retail, particularly food shops, \"as people ate and drank at home more\", she said.",
      "With tax rises coming into force in April, concerns remain that economic growth will remain sluggish for sometime.",
      "Businesses have warned that paying more in National Insurance, along with minimum wages rising and business rates relief being reduced, could affect the economy's ability to grow, with employers expecting to have less cash to give pay rises and create new jobs.",
      "In addition, firms are facing new uncertainty surrounding the tariffs being imposed by US President Donald Trump, while the government is also under pressure to increase defence spending.",
      "Responding to the latest growth figures, Reeves said: \"The world has changed and across the globe we are feeling the consequences.\"",
      "She said the government was \"launching the biggest sustained increase in defence spending since the Cold War\", but this comes as public spending plans are under pressure as the chancellor seeks to meet self-imposed budget rules.",
      "Last month, the Bank of England halved its growth forecast for the UK this year. At the Spring Statement later this month, the independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility is also likely to downgrade its growth prediction.",
      "This has led to expectations that government spending will have to be reined in so that Reeves can meet her tax and spending rules.",
      "The government is expected to set out significant cuts to the welfare budget next week, as part of these cost savings.",

      "Tax changes 'will be tough'",
      "John Dipre, the owner of Ashstead Park garden centre near Epsom in Surrey, said that changes to National Insurance contributions, less help with rates, and an increased minimum wage will \"hit us hard\".",

      "Yael\u202fSelfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said predictions of \"sluggish growth\" mean Reeves will probably \"tighten purse strings\" in the Spring Statement.",
      "The recent cut to UK aid to fund an increase in defence spending \"is a preview that some departments will see their spending plans squeezed\", she added.",
      "Anna Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said a slight rise or fall in GDP for one month was not significant, but the important point was the economy overall is \"quite weak and therefore quite vulnerable\".",
      "Car manufacturers in particular have \"notable weaknesses\" with trade uncertainty from Trump tariffs, and \"chopping and changing in the targets of the adoption of electric vehicles\".",
      "She said the UK growth figures \"certainly won't help\" in the lead-up to the Spring Statement."

      "In January, McDonald's workers told us they still faced sexual harassment more than a year after its chief executive promised to clean up behaviour at the fast-food chain.",
      "McDonald's said it was \"committed\" to doing everything it can to ensure a safe working environment for all employees.",
      "It added: \"We are confident that the plan we have in place is working.\"",
      "The BBC has exclusively seen the letter from the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC).",
      "We asked one current McDonald's employee, who works for a franchise restaurant in southwest Scotland, for his reaction to it. He told us he hoped the intervention would lead to ''concrete change'' for people like him.",

      "The vast majority of McDonald's restaurants are run by franchises, which means individual operators are licensed to run the outlets and employ the staff.",
      "In February 2023, the watchdog entered into a legally binding agreement with McDonald's to prevent sexual harassment in its restaurants.",
      "Franchises were not covered by that agreement.",
      "But in its latest letter, the EHRC said all businesses in Britain, small or large, must comply with the Equality Act.",

      "The letter sets out the ''reasonable steps\" that restaurants could take to prevent sexual harassment.",
      "These include regular risk assessments, ensuring younger and more vulnerable workers are properly safeguarded and ensuring complaints are dealt with sensitively and effectively through an established procedure.",
      "It added that any franchise restaurant that does not comply with its legal duties \"may be at risk of enforcement action''.",
      "The EHRC has a range of statutory enforcement powers open to it, including the ability to launch formal investigations.",
      "If an organisation repeatedly refuses to comply, then the watchdog can take it through the courts, where an unlimited fine could be issued.",
      "'Totally and utterly unacceptable'",
      "Liam Byrne, chair of the Business and Trade Select Committee, said the BBC's investigation of abuse at McDonald's had \"exposed malpractice which was totally and utterly unacceptable\".",
      "He called for the EHRC to explain \"why it is only now writing to McDonald's restaurants about their new duty under the law, to prevent sexual harassment from taking place, when it came into effect nearly six months ago\".",
      "He said it was \"especially concerning because the regulator has known about hundreds of allegations of harassment for several years\".",
      "He added: \"Parliamentary committees have now twice found the vigour of their enforcement to be disappointing. It's now vital the public are reassured they're on top of the problem - and not behind the curve.\"",
      "EHRC head John Kirkpatrick told the BBC's Today programme that the letter was a \"starting point\".",
      "\"If it's not proving successful, we can investigate further. If we can find legal robust evidence of breaches of the law then we can impose an action plan on them and if they don't follow that, a court can impose fines on them,\" he said.",
      "\"The most effective and efficient way to make progress is through agreements but if that's not progressing adequately that's when we can take stronger and further action.\"",
      "The BBC first began investigating working conditions at McDonald's more than two years ago, after the fast-food chain signed its agreement with the EHRC.",
      "In July 2023, we published our initial investigation, which reported claims by workers, some as young as 17, of being groped and harassed almost routinely.",
      "At the time, McDonald's apologised and set up a new unit to deal with complaints.",

      "In a letter to the court, the water regulator insisted that Thames would be barred from recovering any additional interest payments from customer bills.",

      "But regardless of what happens to the company in the future, water supplies and waste services to households will continue as normal.",
      "The company's first priority, if the loan is approved, would be to reduce its huge debt pile, by requiring lenders to accept a discount in what they are owed.",

      "Its third move, which is connected to both of the above, would be to attract new investors to pump money into a business that has attracted public anger and regulatory fines.",
      "While the government, the regulator and the pension trustees are keen to avoid a collapse, there are many who think that Thames Water needs to be put out of its misery - rather than lurching from one financial and operational crisis to another.",

      "Ieva Mackeviciute lives in Kaunas, Lithuania's second-largest city, but works in the capital, Vilnius.",
      "She takes the hour-long train into her company's Vilnius office once a week, where she uses a car-sharing service to drive herself to client meetings throughout the day.",
      "Through an app, she can find where the nearest available car is, and drive off, paying by the minute - a system she finds convenient and flexible.",
      "Some providers even include parking in the price, and if she takes an electric car, it's even better, as they qualify for free parking around the city.",
      "\"The ability to move around a big city quickly, and not worry about parking, helps me have a more flexible schedule and better control of my time,\" says Ms Mackeviciute, 30, who works in communications.",
      "Yet despite being a regular car-sharing user, Ms Mackeviciute still owns a car in Kaunas, which she regularly uses for visiting family living in the countryside. And even while working in Vilnius, occasional issues with car sharing can disrupt Ms Mackeviciute's day.",
      "\"It can sometimes be hard to find a vehicle nearby. And sometimes, when you're in a rush the closest vehicle can have not one, but a few, maintenance lights on. While I do understand that fleet maintenance is a challenge, especially as a business grows, it is still disappointing,\" she says.",
      "When it comes to cars, most people feel like Ms Mackeviciute - they still want to own one.",
      "In the UK, for example, while 61% of people drive daily and 68% are worried about the rising cost of car ownership, 78% don't know what car sharing is, and fewer than 20% of Londoners would consider signing up to such a scheme, according to a report by car rental company SIXT.",
      "Despite brands like Zipcar being around since 2000, industry data shows car sharing to still be a niche service.",
      "There are just two million car sharing users in the UK, while around 35 million people still own a car.",
      "\"Consumers are still tied to exclusive access to their car. Clear scepticism about the ability for car-sharing options to provide a car to hand whenever they need it, and concerns about hassle, are the biggest issues,\" explains Felicity Latcham, associate partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants.",
      "\"This concern gets greater for families and older individuals who are particularly tied to being able to leave things in their vehicle.\"",
      "But the growing electrification of the car sharing market might be attractive to younger, eco-conscious drivers.",
      "In a 2023 McKinsey survey of 4,000 people in the UK, France and Germany, 32% of those in the Gen Z bracket said they wanted to use shared-mobility schemes more, wishing to reduce private car reliance.",
      "The survey also suggested that 50% of Gen Z also want their next car to be fully electric.",
      "The car-sharing industry is heading in that direction.",
      "Almost a quarter of European car sharing companies now offer a 100% electric fleet.",
      "A third of shared cars in the EU are electric vehicles, data from Statista shows. Meanwhile, Zipcar doubled its electric fleet in 2023 in the UK, with plans to go fully electric this year.",
      "Spark, the Lithuanian car-sharing company Ms Mackeviciute frequently uses, launched with a fully electric fleet in 2016.",
      "Its recent performance has been encouraging, with a registered user base up by 30% since 2022, and annual trip numbers up by 11%.",
      "Since July last year, users of the Bolt ride-sharing app - the Baltic states' answer to Uber - can also now book Spark vehicles.",
      "Spark founder Nerijus Dagilis is confident that the increasing availability of electric vehicles can get more people on board with car sharing, especially with the support of the city of Vilnius, which, on top of free parking for electric cars, allows them to be driven in bus lanes, too.",
      "\"Our customer pool is increasing every month, so that means we are creating a certain value for people, who prefer electric cars for sustainability reasons. It's becoming a daily habit for many people, especially families - we see more of them downsizing from two cars to one,\" says Mr Dagilis.",
      "\"The performance of electric cars is improving quickly, so while there is still some scepticism, as soon as an electric car can drive 500km on a single charge, I think people's anxiety should disappear.\"",
      "Canada's Kite is a car sharing company with a twist. Not only is it fully electric, but it partners with property developers to offer Kite cars to apartment building residents as either an included service, or for a subsidised membership fee, akin to a gym or pool.",
      "A Kite hub is installed usually on the first level of the building's underground parking, for residents to book their choice of up to 40 fully charged electric cars.",
      "In some locations, Kite users have the option of returning their car to a different building. Kite is currently live in 20 buildings across Canada, with plans to add 70 more in the next 18 months, adding properties in the US and Europe.",
      "Kite founder, Scott MacWillam, says the convenience and saving they offer to prospective residents is a draw.",
      "\"There's a growing trend of more people with a busy city life wanting a 'turnkey' lifestyle. Real estate developers see this as a sales and marketing advantage,\" says Mr MacWilliam.",
      "\"Residents can save money by kind of ditching their privately-owned car, and that cost saving means they now can afford to live in the building, or maybe they can even upgrade their apartment.\"",
      "Mr MacWilliam says Kite gives thousands of building residents the chance to try both car sharing, and an electric vehicle, without any pressure or commitment, in a package where everything is covered - from charging and maintenance to insurance.",

      "\"That should not have been done in our country,\" Judge Alsup said. \"It was a sham in order to avoid statutory requirements.\"",
      "Danielle Leonard, a lawyer representing a coalition of government employee unions, said probationary employees were targeted because they lacked the right to appeal.",

      "Judge Alsup's order was followed by a similar ruling from Baltimore, Maryland, by District Judge James Bredar, who agreed that Trump's team had broken regulations and cast doubt on the idea that the workers had been individually sacked for unsatisfactory performances.",
      "Responding to the first ruling, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Judge Alsup of singlehandedly \"attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the executive branch\".",

      "\"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many,\" he says.",
      "\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"",
      "Players who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.",
      "In November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players.",
      "Safety filters bypassed",
      "However, the BBC was able to create two fake accounts, one aged 15 and one aged 27, on unlinked devices and exchange messages between the two.",
      "While the filters caught our attempts to overtly move the conversation onto a different platform, we found easy ways to re-word requests to chat elsewhere and make suggestions about playing more adult games.",
      "When we showed the Roblox boss these findings, he argued that our example highlighted the comparative safety of Roblox: that people felt they had to take content which might breach Roblox's rules to other platforms.",
      "\"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" Mr Baszucki says.",
      "He admits there is a delicate balance between encouraging friendships between young people, and blocking opportunities for them come to harm, but says he is confident Roblox can manage both.",
      "We also put to him some Roblox game titles that the BBC has discovered were recommended by the platform to an 11 year-old recently, including:",

      "Mr Baszucki describes his younger self as \"less of a gamer, and more of an engineer\", and the pair's first company was an education software provider called Knowledge Revolution. But they soon noticed that kids weren't only using the product to do their homework.",
      "\"They wanted to play and build stuff. They were making houses or ships or scenery, and they wanted to jump in, and all of that learning was the germination of Roblox,\" he says.",
      "The name Roblox was a mash-up of the words \"robot\" and blocks\" \u2013 and it stuck. The platform grew quickly in popularity \u2013 and there were also early warning signs of its future issues.",
      "Mr Cassel noticed some players \"starting to act out\" and not always behaving in a \"civilised\" way a couple of months after it launched, recalls Mr Baszucki.",
      "He says the roots of building a \"trust and safety system\" therefore began \"very, very early\" and that in those earlier days there were four people acting as safety moderators.",
      "\"It kind of is what launched this safety civility foundation,\" he adds.",
      "But despite attracting decent numbers, it was a year later, when the firm launched its digital currency Robux, that it really started to make money.",
      "Players buy Robux and use it to purchase accessories and unlock content. Content creators now get 70% of the fee, and the store operates on dynamic pricing, meaning popular items cost more.",
      "Mr Baszucki says there was some initial resistance among the leadership team about Roblox becoming more than a hobby for its players, with the introduction of a digital economy.",

      "Its share price has fluctuated since it went public in 2021, but overall Roblox shares are worth about one third more than they were six months ago, at the time of writing. Like many big tech firms its value peaked during Covid, when lockdowns meant millions of people were indoors.",

      "Mr Nagel called Trump's tariff policy \"economics from the past\" and \"definitely not a good idea\".",
      "A global trade war is one of the concerns from tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, he said, but added it was a \"necessity\" for the EU to react \"because if something is working against you, you can't accept a policy like this\".",

      "\"But nevertheless, when you are exposed to an export-oriented model, then you are more exposed in a situation when tariffs are going up and there are so many uncertainties, so many unknowns,\" he added.",

      "Commenting on recent unprecedented changes in Germany's economic policy, which were altered allow the country to borrow more to spend on defence and infrastructure, Mr Nagel said it was an \"extraordinary measure\" for an \"extraordinary time\".",
      "\"The whole world is facing tectonic changes which makes the current situation very different from those seen in the past, hence the fiscal change,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Despite the government's hopes, the UK has not, in the end, been exempted from President Trump's 25% steel and aluminium tariffs.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said the UK will \"keep all options on the table\", but has not announced immediate retaliation.",
      "BBC Verify looks at how big the impact on the UK could be and what might happen next.",
      "Starmer says 'all options on table' on US tariffs",
      "Metal products",
      "The value of the UK's raw steel and aluminium exports to the US in 2024 was around \u00a3470m.",
      "But it's important to note that these latest US tariffs - taxes on imports - also cover products made with steel and aluminium, which covers everything from gym equipment, to furniture, to machinery.",
      "It's estimated by the Global Trade Alert think tank that the UK's exports of these products to the US in 2024 was around \u00a32.2bn.",
      "So the total annual value of UK exports affected would be around \u00a32.7bn.",
      "For context, the UK exported around \u00a358bn of goods to the US on an annual basis in 2024 - so the share of goods hit by these new Trump tariffs represents just under 5%.",
      "The UK hopes to conclude a free trade deal with the Trump administration, which could mean these tariffs being removed.",
      "But we have no way of knowing if - or how soon - such an agreement could be concluded.",
      "Trump has also threatened to impose reciprocal tariffs on all the United States' trading partners, including the UK, from next month.",
      "These are taxes on imports to the US which are set at a similar rate to taxes other countries put on goods they import from the US.",
      "And the White House has said that, in deciding what level to set them, it will take into account countries' Value Added Tax rates.",
      "The US government regards VAT as a tax that discriminates against US imports - even though it applies equally to imports and domestically-produced goods.",
      "The UK has a 20% standard VAT rate, which could potentially mean the UK being hit by a substantial reciprocal tariff from the US.",
      "While the UK is not yet retaliating, the European Union has already confirmed it plans to impose tariffs on 26bn euros (\u00a322bn) a year worth of goods imported from America.",
      "And the EU is targeting US goods including Bourbon whiskey, jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which are considered to be politically sensitive in America because of their iconic status and because of which US states some of them are  produced in.",
      "Notwithstanding the hope for a free trade deal, in the wake of any reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US, which are perceived to be unfair and punitive, the UK government could find itself under growing pressure to retaliate in a similar way to the EU.",
      "Why is Trump imposing tariffs?",
      "The US President has a long - and often shifting - list of justifications for imposing these import taxes.",
      "One is that he claims to want to restore fairness to America's trading relations with the rest of the world.",
      "Trump complains that some other countries have higher tariffs on the goods they import from the US, than the other way round.",
      "The US had an average external tariff of 3.3% in 2023.",
      "That was slightly lower than the UK's average tariff of 3.8%.",
      "It was also below the European Union's average tariff of 5% and China's average tariff of 7.5%.",
      "However, America's average tariff was considerably lower than those of some of its other trading partners such as India (17%) and South Korea (13.4%).",
      "Broadly speaking, it is legitimate for Trump to point out that some countries have a higher average tariff on imports than America does.",
      "Replacing income tax?",
      "Another justification for tariffs from the president is raising more tax revenue for the US government. At one stage during the presidential election campaign in 2024, he suggested that tariff revenue could entirely replace the federal income tax.",
      "This is not only implausible given the $3 trillion a year value of US imports and the $2 trillion a year raised by income tax - but it needs to be seen in the context of the fact that tariffs would push up US consumer prices.",
      "Trump also wants to put pressure on other countries to change some of their policies. This has been the explicit rationale for US tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with the White House saying it wants to pressure those countries to stamp out cross-border Fentanyl smuggling.",
      "Another key goal articulated by the president is wanting to encourage multinational manufacturing companies to invest and produce more in America to create domestic jobs.",
      "Some of these justifications are inconsistent.",
      "Tariffs cannot be a both a major permanent tax revenue raiser as well as a way to bring manufacturing back to America on a large scale as the latter implies imports - and therefore tariff revenues - slumping.",
      "Moreover, the vast majority of economists are also extremely sceptical about the likelihood of tariffs achieving many of these goals.",

    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer has been urged to protect disabled people claiming welfare payments from expected cuts to the benefits system.",
      "The health and disability-related benefits bill is now \u00a365bn a year and projected to increase to \u00a3100bn over the next four years, with research suggesting rising levels of mental ill health are behind the figures.",
      "The government is identifying cuts to the welfare budget ahead of the Spring Statement, with the PM working to rally MPs to support the move.",
      "Sir Keir was challenged at PMQs by Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey and Labour's Richard Burgon, who said disabled people were \"frightened\" and suggested \"the moral thing to do\" would be to introduce a wealth tax.",
      "Starmer says benefit system unfair and indefensible",
      "Work coaches to focus on long-term unemployed",
      "How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall?",
      "Expected cuts could fall on Personal Independent Payments (PIP), which provides help with extra living costs to those with a long-term physical or mental health condition, and cuts to incapacity benefits for people unable to work and receiving Universal Credit (UC).",
      "Speaking at PMQs, Sir Ed asked the prime minister to confirm that disability benefits for people who cannot work would not be cut.",
      "Sir Keir said: \"We will of course support those who need support, but help those who can work into work. They'll be the guiding principles.\"",
      "Later, Labour MP Burgon said that when disabled people \"hear the language of tough choices... it means the easy option of of making the poor and vulnerable people pay\", and said the \"courageous\" thing to do would be to introduce a wealth tax.",
      "Sir Keir responded that the Conservatives had \"locked millions out of work\" and there was \"a moral imperative\" to \"help those who want to work to get back into work\".",
      "On a wealth tax, he added: \"We have raised money, the energy profits levy, taxing non-doms, and air passenger duty on private jets, but this isn't a bottomless pit and must kickstart growth to get the economic stability that we need.\"",
      "Labour MPs have been called in to 10 Downing Street to discuss the changes,",
      "Bassetlaw MP Jo White, who represents the so-called Red Wall MPs, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was \"a moral duty to change people's lives\".",
      "\"It's a generational thing \u2013 if families are out of work they tend to bring up their children to exist on the benefits system,\" she said.",
      "\"People slide along on that low level of income, perhaps dipping into the black market, but their aspirations are so low and the communities do not change.\"",
      "Tackling this issue through changing the welfare system \"is absolutely critical\", White argued, because in order to \" lift people out of poverty... they need to be in work\".",
      "But significant numbers of Labour colleagues are unhappy. Nottingham East MP Nadia Whittome told the BBC her party was \"getting it badly wrong on this\".",
      "\"We cannot go back\" to the \"narrative of strivers versus skivers\", she said.",
      "Asked if she would rebel over the issue, Whittome said: \"I was on these benefits - my mum had to stop work when I was a teenager to care for me.",
      "\"I represent disabled people, all of us do, and we all hear their stories every day and just how scared they are about this and what a difference these payments make to their lives.",
      "\"I can't look my constituents in the eye, I can't look my mum in the eye, and support this.\"",
      "Many Labour MPs who spoke to the BBC have said they agreed many people currently on disability benefits could work and should.",
      "But they worried the government's rumoured plans, such as freezing Personal Independence Payments, would punish all those on disability benefits, including those with severe disabilities who could never work.",
      "That would be \"unforgivable\", one MP told the BBC.",
      "Another said making it more difficult to access disability payments was \"not what the Labour party ought to be about\".",
      "\"It's our very DNA that Labour was created to lift people out of difficult circumstances,\" they said.",
      "\"The government needs to stop talking about everyone who is on disability benefits as if they are all the same because they are not,\" said another.",
      "In the UK 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions \u2013 44% of all claimants, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found.",
      "Exploring the reasons behind the rise, which has \"accelerated\" since the pandemic,  researchers said the UK was an outlier compared to other countries, none of which have seen the same level of post-pandemic increases in health-related benefit claims.",
      "More than half of the rise in 16 to 64-year-olds claiming disability benefits since the pandemic is for claims relating to mental health or behavioural conditions, according to a report from the IFS.",
      "Researchers found particularly fast growth in new disability benefit claims for learning disability and autism spectrum claims.",
      "There was also evidence of increasing levels of severe mental health problems.",
      "There is a heightened rate of mortality among working age people, due to \"deaths of despair\"- either by suicide, alcohol or drug misuse - and such deaths are much more likely if someone has a mental health illness.",
      "Trades Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Paul Nowak said slashing welfare for disabled people would \"only make the current challenges worse\".",
      "He urged Labour not to cut PIP, which he said enables many disabled people to access work rather than relying on benefits, but he backed reforms to a \"one-size-fits all approach\" towards one that provides tailored employment support.",
      "\"Trade unions share the government's ambitions to improve the nation's health and to help more people into good quality work,\" he said.",
      "\"A major lesson from the Tory years is that austerity damaged the nation's health - we must not make the same mistake again.\"",

      "The tariffs apply to steel and aluminium imported to the US, as well as to some other products from Mexico, Canada and China - prompting counter-measures from the latter two countries and the European Union.",
      "Economists have warned the US tariffs - and those introduced in response by other countries - could put prices up for American consumers.",
      "That's because the tax is paid by the domestic company importing the goods, which may choose to pass the cost on to customers, or to reduce imports, meaning fewer products are available.",
      "So which things could become more expensive?",
      "Cars",
      "Some cars are among the products given a temporary reprieve by Trump from a new 25% import tax imposed on Canada and Mexico.",
      "When this ends, cars are expected to go up in price - by about $3,000 (\u00a32,300) according to TD Economics.",

      "The picture is more complicated when it comes to spirits, which have been largely free of tariffs since the 1990s.",
      "Industry bodies from the US, Canada and Mexico issued a joint statement in advance of the tariffs being announced saying they were \"deeply concerned\".",

      "Findings are due towards the end of 2025.",
      "Maple syrup",
      "The \"most obvious\" household impact of a trade war with Canada would be on the price of Canadian maple syrup, according to Thomas Sampson from the London School of Economics.",
      "Canada's billion-dollar industry accounts for 75% of the world's entire maple syrup production.",
      "The majority of the sweet staple - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.",
      "\"That maple syrup is going to become more expensive. And that's a direct price increase that households will face,\" Mr Sampson said.",
      "\"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but [which use] inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up,\" he added.",

      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil.",
      "According to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November 2024 came from Canada.",
      "While the US has introduced a 25% tariff on most goods imported from Canada, Canadian energy faces a lower rate of 10%.",

    "summary": "Stock market falls, tariffs and other changes are reigniting fear of economic downturn in the US.",
    "story": [
      "During his election campaign last year, Donald Trump promised Americans he would usher in a new era of prosperity.",
      "Now two months into his presidency, he's painting a slightly different picture.",
      "He has warned that it will be hard to bring down prices and the public should be prepared for a \"little disturbance\" before he can bring back wealth to the US.",
      "Meanwhile, even as the latest figures indicate inflation is easing, analysts say the odds of a downturn are increasing, pointing to his policies.",
      "So is Trump about to trigger a recession in the world's largest economy?",
      "Markets fall and recession risks rise",
      "In the US, a recession is defined as a prolonged and widespread decline in economic activity typically characterised by a jump in unemployment and fall in incomes.",
      "A chorus of economic analysts have warned in recent days that the risks of such a scenario are rising.",
      "A JP Morgan report put the chance of recession at 40%, up from 30% at the start of the year, warning that US policy was \"tilting away from growth\", while Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, upped the odds from 15% to 35%, citing tariffs.",
      "The forecasts came as the S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest companies in the US sank sharply. It has now fallen to its lowest level since September in a sign of fears about the future.",
      "The market turmoil is being driven partly by concerns about new taxes on imports, called tariffs, which Trump has introduced since he took office.",
      "He has hit products from America's three biggest trade partners with the new duties, and threatened them more widely in moves that analysts believe will increase prices and curb growth.",
      "The latest official inflation figures in the US showed the rate of price increases cooling in February, however.",
      "Prices were up 2.8% over the 12 months to February, down from 3% in January, the Labor Department said.",
      "Still, Trump and his economic advisers have been warning the public to be prepared for some economic pain, while appearing to dismiss the market concerns - a marked change from his first term, when he frequently cited the stock market as a measure of his own success.",
      "\"There will always be changes and adjustments,\" he said last week, in response to pleas from businesses for more certainty.",
      "The posture has increased investor worries about his plans.",
      "Goldman Sachs last week raised its recession bets from 15% to 20%, saying it saw policy changes as \"the key risk\" to the economy. But it noted that the White House still had \"the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious\".",
      "\"If the White House remained committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data, recession risk would rise further,\" the firm's analysts warned.",
      "Tariffs, uncertainty and slowing growth",
      "For many firms, the biggest question mark is tariffs, which raise costs for US businesses by putting taxes on imports. As Trump unveils tariff plans, many companies are now facing lower profit margins, while holding off on investments and hiring as they try to figure out what the future will look like.",
      "Investors are also worried about big cuts to the government workforce and government spending.",
      "Brian Gardner, chief of Washington policy strategy at the investment bank Stifel, said businesses and investors had thought Trump intended tariffs as a negotiating tool.",
      "\"But what the president and his cabinet are signalling is actually a bigger deal. It's a restructuring of the American economy,\" he said. \"And that's what's been driving markets in the last couple of weeks.\"",
      "The US economy was already undergoing a slowdown, engineered in part by the central bank, which has kept interest rates higher to try to cool activity and stabilise prices.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?Six things that could get more expensive",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Six things that could get more expensive",
      "In recent weeks, some data suggests a more rapid weakening.",
      "Retail sales fell in February, confidence - which had popped after Trump's election on several surveys of consumers and businesses - has fallen, and companies including major airlines, retailers such as Walmart and Target, and manufacturers are warning of a pullback.",
      "Some analysts are worried a drop in the stock market could trigger a further clampdown in spending, especially among higher income households.",
      "That could deliver a major hit to the US economy, which is driven by consumer spending and has grown increasingly dependent on those richer households, as lower income families face pressure from inflation.",
      "The head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, offered assurances in a speech last week, noting that sentiment had not been a good indicator of behaviour in recent years.",
      "\"Despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the US economy continues to be in a good place,\" he said.",
      "But the US economy is currently deeply linked to the rest of the world, warned Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.",
      "\"The fact that tariffs could disrupt that at the same time that there were signs that the US economy was weakening anyway ... is really fuelling recession fears,\" she says.",
      "Stock market in tech ripe for correction",
      "The unease in the stock market isn't all about Trump.",
      "Investors were already jittery about the possibility of a correction, after big gains over the last two years, driven by the sharp run-up in tech stocks fuelled by investor optimism about artificial intelligence (AI).",
      "Chipmaker Nvidia, for example, saw its share price jump from less than $15 at the start of 2023 to nearly $150 in November of last year.",
      "That type of rise had stirred debate about an \"AI bubble\" - with investors on high alert for signs of it bursting, which would have a big impact on the stock market, regardless of the dynamics in the wider economy.",
      "Now, with views of the US economy darkening, optimism about AI is getting even harder to sustain.",
      "Tech analyst Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management wrote on social media this week that his optimism had \"taken a step back\" as the chance of a recession increased \"measurably\" over the past month.",
      "\"The bottom line is that if we enter a recession, it will be extremely difficult for the AI trade to continue,\" he said.",

      "At the shamrock presentation ceremony on Wednesday evening, Martin referenced the US intervention during in the Troubles in Northern Ireland, and its role in the creation of the Good Friday Agreement.",
      "\"The story of peace in Ireland is one that we wrote together,\" the taoiseach said.",
      "\"We know that building peace is a difficult and painstaking task but when the mighty United States of America puts its shoulder to the wheel, there is no mountain it cannot move.\"",
      "Martin also praised Trump's \"unrelenting focus and energy\" in bringing peace to Ukraine and the Middle East.",
      "\"In my view, there is nothing more noble than the pursuit of peace and this is what you are doing,\" he added.",

      "Martin told President Trump that foreign investment is a two-way street, adding that Ireland is \"investing a lot more in America now\".",
      "The EU's move is in retaliation to President Trump's 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports into the US, which came into effect overnight.",
      "Trump said it had caused \"ill will\".",
      "\"The European Union's been very tough, and it's our turn too. We get a turn at that also,\" he said.",

      "\"We don't want to do anything to hurt Ireland, but we do want fairness and [Martin] understands that,\" he added.",
      "However, Martin said the pharmaceutical companies \"are doing very well in Ireland\", and that there was room to discuss a deal.",
      "\"I think there's room for those companies to grow in America and many of them, by the way, have already announced fairly significant manufacturing investments now [in the US],\" the taoiseach added.",

      "Housing answer stirs controversy",
      "The president said Ireland's housing crisis was caused by the country \"doing so well\".",
      "Housing availability and cost is a major political and social issue in Ireland, with reports stating thousands of new homes every year are needed to keep up with demand.",
      "\"You know why they have a housing crisis? Because they're doing so well, they can't produce houses fast enough,\" Trump said.",
      "Martin added it was a \"good answer\".",
      "However the remark has drawn criticism from opposition parties, with Sinn F\u00e9in stating that joking about the housing crisis is \"never a good answer\".",

      "Demonstrators have targeted Tesla showrooms in recent weeks in protest against Musk's cost-cutting role in Trump's administration.",
      "Trump said they were \"harming a great American company\", and anyone using violence against the electric carmaker would \"go through hell\".",
      "The president described the shiny red Model-S, one of a number of Teslas lined up on the White House drive, as \"beautiful\" but said he was no longer allowed to drive and so would keep the car for the use of White House staff. Current and former presidents are not allowed to drive for security reasons.",
      "He also said he would not want to buy a self-driving model, which Musk said would reach the market next year.",
      "The showcase for Tesla's cars outside the White House came after Tesla's market value halved since its all-time peak in December, sliding 15% in a single day on Monday, before recovering slightly on Tuesday.",
      "Trump said he had told Musk, \"You know, Elon, I don't like what's happening to you, and Tesla's a great company.\"",
      "Musk, Trump's top donor in the election campaign, has been tasked with radically cutting government spending through his Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "He has instigated sweeping cuts to federal workforce, cancelled international aid programmes, and has voiced support for far-right politics.",

      "However, stock analysts said the main reason for the poor performance of the shares was fear about Tesla meeting production targets and a drop in sales over the past year.",

      "Lindsay James, an investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said that although there was \"an element\" of Elon Musk's politics having a \"brand impact\", there were other reasons for the share price fall.",
      "Ultimately the drop came down to \"hard numbers\", she said.",
      "\"When we look at new orders, for example in Europe and China, you can see that they've effectively halved over the last year,\" she said.",

      "Then Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China, and overnight Deena found herself paying a 25% surcharge on every cable and component she imported \u2013 up from zero previously.",
      "She was forced to absorb the costs and for a while thought she would go bust.",
      "\"I literally thought I am going to start and end a business in less than a year,\" she says. \"I had spent all this time, money and effort, and to have something like this blindside you was shocking.\"",
      "The firm pulled through, but like numerous other US businesses it now finds itself in a strikingly similar situation.",
      "Since returning to office in January, Mr Trump has raised tariffs on all goods imported from China by 20%, and put taxes of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay some of them until April.",
      "The president says he wants to force these countries to do more to stop flows of illegal drugs and migrants into America, to bring more manufacturing back to the US, and to address what he sees as unfair trade imbalances.",
      "But the duties are much broader in scope than last time, when they were phased in gradually and many products were granted exemptions.",
      "Goods like smartphones, desktop computers and tablets are now incurring tariffs for the first time, while taxes on others have climbed higher.",
      "\"US importers have to pay these taxes not the exporters,\" says Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), a North American trade body that represents more than 1,200 tech firms.",
      "\"It's American businesses and consumers who will suffer.\"",
      "Businesses like Ms Ghazarian's are particularly exposed. China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (\u00a3112bn) in 2023, according to official data.",
      "Meanwhile, 87% of US video game console imports came from China that year, 78% of smartphones, 79% of laptops and tablets, and two-thirds of monitors, says the CTA.",

      "'I will have to raise prices by 10%' - toymakers warn of tariff pain",
      "China retaliates against US tariffs - but it also wants to talk",
      "While many American companies like Austere have diversified their supply chains away from China since Mr Trump's first term, countries such as Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam still do not offer the same manufacturing capabilities and expertise.",
      "At the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.",
      "\"Yes, Apple now makes some iPhones in India and [the Taiwanese chipmaker] TSMC has been diversifying to Arizona,\" says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC.",
      "\"But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop.\"",
      "Research suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.",
      "In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she may have to raise her prices this year, but worries it could backfire. \"There is a price point where the customer is satisfied with the value of goods provided.",
      "\"The moment I shift above that I start to lose customers. High inflation has squeezed Americans.\"",
      "During Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.",
      "Insiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020.",
      "Fears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.",
      "For the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute.",
      "He plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.",
      "There is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she is worried but at least she's prepared this time. Like many other US business-owners she bulk-ordered extra inventory before Mr Trump took office, and is storing it in her east coast warehouse.",
      "She hopes that will get the company through the next year until it can \"pivot\" again.",
      "\"That might mean finding a more cost-effective way to produce the product or doing something completely different. It's frustrating I have to focus on survival rather than growing my business.\"",

      "Mr Kaziukonis says the information is also available to scammers. \"It's the Wild West out there,\" he says.",

      "\"Don't share your home address anywhere, for example, accidently filming a video with a laptop in the background that has sensitive information on, and when you go online shopping don't add all details to every random website, for example, your date of birth,\" says Mr Kaziukonis.",

    "summary": "The controversial cafe chain is expanding outside London but locals often have mixed feelings.",
    "story": [
      "There is a cheerful red awning and a newly painted cream wooden shopfront on the market square in Macclesfield.",
      "A new bakery cafe has just opened, offering ciabatta and sourdough loaves as well as hot cross buns, syrupy cakes, vegetable quiches and of course coffee.",
      "Like towns around the UK, Macclesfield has struggled with retailers closing, leaving empty stores, so there is a buzz around the new arrival.",
      "But Gail's, a brand that started in London more than 20 years ago, is controversial. It draws crowds and inspires social media memes, but attracts fierce criticism too.",
      "A recent spate of national media coverage has even asked why some people \"hate\" Gail's so much, focusing on everything from who owns it to what it does with unsold pastries.",
      "Its arrival isn't universally popular here either.",
      "\"We don't need another coffee shop,\" says Linda Willdig. She is out shopping with her friend Nicola Tomlinson, who agrees. \"There are too many,\" says Nicola.",
      "In fact, from a table outside the new Gail's you could easily throw a cinnamon bun and hit both a Caffe Nero and a Costa. Greggs is just around the corner too.",
      "So something different might have been better, says Jane Kent, a community nurse.",
      "\"People will be larding out on all the bakery stuff,\" she says. \"We don't need more pastries.\"",
      "At heart, though, the objections to Gail's are not about what it sells, but that it doesn't really belong, that it will push up prices and put independent cafes out of business.",
      "But Stephanie Lamb, a teacher on maternity leave, is more welcoming.",
      "\"I don't know Gail's, so it's not necessarily a chain to me,\" she says. \"I'm just happy to have something extra in town.\"",
      "She likes a latte and a croissant and somewhere she can read a book for an hour.",
      "At Gail's prices that would set her back \u00a36.50. Yes, it's pricey, she says, but she is still planning to \"give it a whirl\".",
      "Gail's - a name that suggests a traditional, single-owner, cafe - favours attractive old buildings, often ones vacated as bank branches close, especially if it is a corner site that means it's more visible to passers by.",
      "It has 170 outlets mostly clustered in London and the south east. But this year it plans to open around 40 more, including Ely, Cambridgeshire later this month, Bath in April, and Buxton, Derbyshire in May.",
      "At Friday's opening in Macclesfield there was a flurry of interest in the new place on the square.",
      "Even in the wake of the cost of living crisis, we are increasingly choosing a coffee out as a treat. Nearly two-thirds of people said they went to a coffee shop more than once a week, according to World Coffee Portal, spending more than \u00a36 per visit on average.",
      "So coffee shops are weathering the tough economic climate better than most businesses. There are now 11,450 branded chain outlets across the UK, up from 9,800 five years ago.",
      "Speciality chains like Black Sheep Coffee, Coffee#1 and Blank Street are springing up in city centres, while the giants like Costa and Starbucks are opening drive-throughs and outlets in retail parks.",
      "Caffe Nero has bought up several smaller chains, in different parts of the country, and is retaining their independent branding so it can make the most of local loyalties.",
      "With enthusiasm for coffee so strong it's something of a mystery to Gail's chief executive Tom Molnar why people object to his chain. He feels misunderstood.",
      "Mr Molnar - a joint owner with private equity backing - has been working on expanding the brand since he joined in 2003, but says it's not just about coffee. Its role as a neighbourhood bakery - baking fresh in-store and in regional bakery hubs every day - is key.",
      "He's hoping to roll Gail's out to many more neighbourhoods, including less affluent ones.",
      "\"It's not supposed to be posh,\" he insists.",
      "But for now they pick very carefully where to open, using an algorithm to help select the most promising postcodes.",
      "It flags up things like whether there is a local butcher, bookshops, a park, schools, churches or a farmers' market.",
      "\"I prefer a place that's evolving and growing rather than some place that's too established,\" he says.",
      "If the algorithm homes in on a particular High Street it is a vote of confidence in that town's future.",
      "But retail experts warn that the very nature of the places that Gail's is picking means there are likely to be accusations of gentrification, increasing prices and rents for existing businesses and residents.",
      "\"Gail's is moving into areas with strong local identities. And when that happens, there will always be a reaction,\" says Kate Hardcastle, founder of Insight with Passion.",
      "\"It's not just about a bakery opening, I think it's also about what it represents.",
      "\"Some will see it as a sign of investment and revitalisation, while others worry it's another step back to our High Streets looking like carbon copies of each other,\" she says.",
      "In Flour, Water, Salt - a direct rival to Gail's selling sourdough bread, bagels, coffee-iced buns and sausage rolls - that is just yards from the new shop, some loyal customers are adamantly opposed to the newcomer.",
      "\"Gail's isn't welcome here,\" says Karen Pearson, a businesswoman who lives just outside Macclesfield. She and her friends are worried that the arrival of Gail's means the town is \"on the up\", when in fact they would rather it \"stayed like it is\".",
      "They're not keen on big corporations coming into the town, concerned they might squeeze out independents.",
      "But firefighter and local councillor Anthony Harrison, reckons Gail's is no match for a place like Flour, Water, Salt. \"It's just a posh Greggs,\" he says.",
      "Independents may not be as under threat as people fear, says Graham Soult, a retail consultant from the north of England.",
      "Local owners can offer a more personal touch, respond to local tastes and demands,  he says, while it can be hard for chains to deviate from their given formula.",
      "\"I think a lot of independents are really adept at navigating all the things that are thrown at them,\" he says.",
      "Despite difficult times, the number of independent coffee shops has risen over the last five years from 11,700 to around 12,400 now.",
      "Flour, Water, Salt's manager Toby Johnstone isn't worried. It could mean more footfall, with more people trying his shop too.",
      "\"We are happy there's something else opening and keeping the town centre going,\" he says. \"It's good to have competition.\""

      "The site, which is the most popular in the UK among young gamers aged eight to 12, has been dogged by claims of some children being exposed to explicit or harmful content through its games, alongside multiple reported allegations of bullying and grooming.",
      "But its co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki insisted that the company is vigilant in protecting its users and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on the site.",
      "When asked what his message is to parents who don't want their children on the platform, Mr Baszucki said: \"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox.\"",
      "\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" he told BBC News in an exclusive interview.",

      "In the UK the Online Safety Act, which comes in to force in April, has strict laws for all tech firms specifically aimed at protecting children from online harms.",
      "But Mr Baszucki says he remains confident in Roblox's safety tools and insists the firm goes above and beyond to keep its users safe.",
      "\"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many,\" he says.",
      "\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"",
      "Players who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.",
      "In November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players.",

      "While the filters caught our attempts to overtly move the conversation onto a different platform, we found easy ways to re-word requests to chat elsewhere and make suggestions about playing more adult games.",
      "When we showed the Roblox boss these findings, he argued that our example highlighted the comparative safety of Roblox: that people felt they had to take content which might breach Roblox's rules to other platforms.",
      "\"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" Mr Baszucki says.",

      "The European premiere was held on Wednesday at a castle in Northern Spain, instead of a more traditional and high-profile location such as London's Leicester Square.",
      "Dwarfism debate",
      "The debate around the film began making headlines in January 2022, when Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage, an actor with Dwarfism, described the decision to retell the story of \"seven dwarfs living in a cave\" as \"backward\".",
      "Disney has used computer-generated dwarfs in the remake and said it would \"avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film\".",
      "But this week, other actors with Dwarfism have said they would have liked the opportunity to play the roles.",
      "Speaking to the Daily Mail, performer Choon Tan said the decision to use CGI was \"absolutely absurd and discriminating in a sense\".",

      "Halle Bailey, a black actress, was cast in another recent Disney live-action movie, The Little Mermaid. Both actresses faced abuse online after their casting was announced.",
      "Zegler also made headlines after she made critical comments about some elements of the previous animated film.",
      "\"The original cartoon came out in 1937, and very evidently so,\" Zegler said in 2022. \"There's a big focus [in the original] on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! So we didn't do that this time.\"",
      "Zegler also called the original film \"extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power,\" adding: \"People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is - because it needed that.\"",
      "Elsewhere, fans have speculated that there may have been a behind-the-scenes rift between Zegler and Gadot, who plays the wicked stepmother, because the actresses have opposing views on the Israel-Palestine conflict.",

      "\"It's not a victimless crime. Somebody always pays the price for it down the line. And for us, it's the staff in here,\" she adds.",
      "Dooley also explains how shoplifting is being documented on social media. \"We've seen shop assistants be, you know, verbally abused, physically abused,\" she says.",
      "Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, adds that while an incident can be \"over in a matter of seconds\", it can have \"life-long consequences\" on those who experience it, making them think twice about visiting their local high streets.",
      "When speaking to shoplifters, Dooley says some of them \"don't even see it as a crime, necessarily\".",

    "story": [
      "Spotify paid the music industry $10bn (\u00a37.7bn) in 2024, which the streaming service said was the highest annual payment from any single retailer in history.",
      "But the figures come as a heated debate continues about how much money artists and songwriters receive in royalties.",
      "Earlier this year, several Grammy-nominated songwriters boycotted an awards event hosted by Spotify in a row about their streaming earnings.",
      "As the new figures were published, a spokesperson for Spotify said the responsibility for distributing the money it pays lay with record labels and publishers.",
      "The company said it pays royalties to rights holders, adding that it does not have \"visibility\" on where the money ultimately goes because earnings are based on artists' individual contracts with their labels.",
      "A spokesperson said: \"Spotify does not pay artists or songwriters directly. We pay rights-holders, these are typically record labels, music publishers, collection societies.",
      "\"These rights-holders then pay artists and songwriters based on their individual agreements.\"",
      "The amount of money earned by artists will vary, but the BPI noted the average royalty rate for UK artists signed to major labels was around 26%, according to a 2021 study from the Competition and Markets Authority.",
      "As a result, the performer ultimately earns about 16% of a stream's overall value.",
      "However, Spotify is not the only streaming service to generate revenue for artists, and many pop stars make more money from other income streams such as live tours.",
      "Spotify said more than two-thirds of all music revenue goes \"straight to the recording and publishing rights-holders\", and added that, like other streamers, Spotify does not pay on a per-stream basis.",
      "The annual figures were published in Spotify's Loud and Clear report - part of the company's aim to provide transparency on how it pays the music industry.",
      "The amount Spotify paid this year was an increase on the more than $9bn (\u00a37bn) it handed over in 2023.",
      "The report highlighted that the number of artists generating annual royalties between $1,000 (\u00a3770) and $10m had tripled since 2017.",
      "Taylor Swift was named Spotify's top artist globally with more than 26 billion streams, in the year she released her double-length album The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology.",
      "Swift herself was part of the debate about streaming royalties in 2014, when she removed her music from Spotify as part of a boycott, eventually re-joining the platform in 2017.",
      "More recent artist boycotts have generally been prompted by other factors, such as Neil Young and Joni Mitchell removing their music over the streamer's employment of podcast host Joe Rogan. Both artists returned to the platform last year.",

      "Lockdown project",

      "\"I started working on a model of the Grand Opera House as part of the heritage exhibition and through doing that got interested in looking at all the other theatres that aren't about anymore.\"",
      "The models are \"mostly made of different types of cardboard, like mounting card or coloured paper and then they're glued together\".",
      "\"The Hippodrome was the most complicated and detailed one I've made, it took me around six weeks to make.\"",
      "He said he mostly works from old photographs, but it can be hard to get enough accurate detail because \"with a black and white photograph that you can't move around, it's basically static\".",

      "The Alhambra - 'quite a rowdy place'",
      "Opening in the early 1870s, the Alhambra was Belfast's first music hall and was a \"real spit on the floor type joint\", according to Mr Marshall.",
      "\"In the early days, the Alhambra was more of a variety house, and I've heard that it wasn't the most enticing establishment, quite a rowdy place.",
      "\"The Alhambra didn't cater for the more refined clientele,\" he added.",

      "\"I've seen other things listed, which were more overtly racist, but that was kind of the way at the time,\" he added.",
      "To adapt to the evolution of mass entertainment, the Alhambra converted to a full time cinema house in 1936.",
      "Between the late 1800s and it's closure in 1959, the Alhambra suffered four separate fires.",
      "The Theatre Royal - 'higher class establishment'",
      "The Theatre Royal was Belfast's original high-end theatre, opening in the late 1700s with a capacity of just over 1,000.",
      "The building was demolished and rebuilt a number of times.",
      "\"As these places go, they kept getting burnt down or demolished and rebuilt again - there's always a renewal aspect to them.\"",
      "The Theatre Royal was to be Belfast's \"higher class establishment\", which in the end became \"a mixed-use building of shops and place called the 'boom boom room', which was like a dance hall upstairs, which then became the starlight ballroom upstairs\".",
      "\"Now,  there's a little Starbucks in the corner where the building stood,\" he added.",
      "The Empire - 'stayed true to theatre'",
      "Not to be mistaken with the pub and music hall on Botanic Avenue, The Empire Theatre was situated on Victoria Square and opened to the public in 1894.",
      "According to Mr Marshall, the Empire \"operated at a similar time to the Alhambra from the 1890s up until the early 1960s, and then it was it was knocked down.",
      "\"It was eventually replaced by a Little Woods department store, which has been redeveloped again and again, until finally becoming Victoria Square shopping centre.\"",
      "While it did adapt to the growing popularity of cinema, The Empire \"stayed true to theatre for all of its life\", Mr Marshall said.",
      "The Hippodrome - 'Cinema in mind'",
      "The Hippodrome was \"more fiddly [model to make] than some of the other ones\".",
      "Mr Marshall describes how there aren't too many quality photographs of the Hippodrome, so he \"had to use his judgement\" when designing the model in terms of colour scheme and scale.",
      "Coming quite late, the \"Hippodrome was was built in 1907 originally with a cinema in mind\" as to take full advantage of the advent of modern cinema and growing popularity of picture shows.",
      "The Ritz - 'The Stones, The Beatles...'",
      "\"And then there was the Ritz...\" which opened in 1938.",
      "The Ritz was, according to Mr Marshall, \"a giant cinema more or less, but it called itself the Ritz Theatre\". However, it did produce shows as part of the night's entertainment.",
      "\"They would have a brass band, dancers or a ballet, and then a film at the end.\"",
      "\"It also did huge concerts, people like the Stones, The Beatles and Billy Connolly all performed at the Ritz during their time,\" he added.",
      "It was the biggest in Northern Ireland at the time, with just over 2,000 capacity.",
      "The Ritz was damaged by bombs hidden in the seats and the theatres interior and roof was destroyed in 1977.",

      "\"I've had a brilliant life.\"",
      "As Jasper Carrott celebrates his 80th birthday on Friday, the Birmingham comedian admits comedy is hard work but he still enjoys entertaining crowds.",
      "\"I don't do as many shows as I used to,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"These days I do it because I just really love it, really enjoy it.",
      "\"Of course I get the sympathy vote from the audience - 'oh the poor old devil, let's go and see, it's probably the last chance we'll get to see him'.\"",
      "As a performer, he first came to prominence in the 1970s with anecdotes about Midlands life delivered in a Brummie accent - and his novelty single Funky Moped, a surprise top five hit in 1975.",
      "He went on to host shows including Carrott's Lib, Carrott's Commercial Breakdown, the game show Golden Balls and he was in the comedy show The Detectives with Robert Powell.",
      "Born Robert Davis on 14 March 1945, the comedian said former ELO drummer Bev Bevan played a part in his stage name.",
      "\"It is his fault\", he said, reflecting on when they were on a golf course in Swanshurst Park in Birmingham.",
      "\"We'd finished playing silly golf and a bloke came up...Bev said 'oh this is Jasper' and this guy said 'Jasper who?'",
      "\"No-one had ever asked me 'Jasper who?'... I just said 'carrot'. I don't know why.",
      "\"The Bevan thought it was the funniest thing he'd ever heard so he immediately went and told everybody 'oh, it's Jasper Carrott'.\"",
      "The comedian explained school teachers had called him Jasper but his wife went out with him for six months before \"she realised it wasn't my real name\".",
      "\"It was only when I took her to meet my mum and my mum said 'oh hello Bobby'.",
      "\"I said 'well, that's my name, that's my real name, Robert - Robert Davis' and she couldn't get her breath.\"",
      "Carrott was doing a few folk clubs when he started his career and had to call himself \"Jasper Carrott - because that's what everybody knew me as\".",
      "Asked what his wife called him now, he replied: \"Pain.\"",
      "The comedian also said \"the most impressive person\" he had ever met was Diana, Princess of Wales.",
      "At a charity night in Birmingham, a banquet was held afterwards and Carrott, who was asked to do a raffle, was in the VIP room.",
      "\"I'd got my back to the door and suddenly in the room there was this electricity,\" he said.",
      "\"I do not exaggerate... and I thought 'that's the princess' and turned round and sure enough she'd come in.",
      "\"She saw me, she came through all these people, she walked up and she said: 'Hello Jasper, how are you?'",
      "\"I curtsied. Why did I? I don't know... but we got on like a house on fire.\"",
      "Eight years ago, the comedian had major heart surgery - initially for a triple bypass, which ended up being a quadruple.",
      "Now as he reflects on comedy, he said: \"There's an element of gift about it.",
      "\"There are... comedians like Peter Kay. As soon as he walks on, you laugh because he's got funny bones.",
      "\"I've always had to win an audience over but that was to my advantage as well, so I could slowly draw people in.\"",
      "He said he had had an \"absolutely brilliant life\", adding he was married to \"one of the best women in the world\" and mentioning family and friends.",
      "\"It feels the same as when I was eight,\" he said. \"You wake up in the morning and you get on with the day. Long may it continue.\"",

    "summary": "The actor may not have known his wife was dead inside the home he was living in because of the disease.",
    "story": [
      "Actor Gene Hackman was alone.",
      "The two-time Academy Award winner didn't make any calls and missed meals.",
      "Medical experts say it's possible the 95-year-old, who was in declining health and suffering from advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, did not even realise his wife of more than 30 years was dead in the home where he was living.",
      "If he did, experts told the BBC, he likely went through various stages of confusion and grief, trying to wake her up before the disease caused him to become distracted or too overwhelmed to act - a process that likely repeated for days before he, too, died.",
      "Officials in New Mexico say Betsy Arakawa, 65, died of a rare virus about seven days before Hackman perished on 18 February of natural causes.",
      "The pair - and one of their dogs - were found dead in their Santa Fe home after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through a window.",
      "Authorities, at first, said the grim discovery was \"suspicious enough\" to launch an investigation.",
      "Their remains were discovered in advanced stages of decomposition. Arakawa was found in a bathroom with scattered pills nearby. Hackman was found near the kitchen with a cane and sunglasses. One of their three dogs was found dead in a crate.",
      "But a police investigation found no foul play.",
      "Instead, the case has shed light on the grim realities of Alzheimer's disease, which damages and destroys cells in one's brain over time - taking away memory and other important mental functions.",
      "\"It's like he was living in a reel,\" Catherine V Piersol, PhD, an occupational therapist with decades of experience in dementia care, told the BBC of how Hackman may have experienced the repeated loss of his wife.",
      "She noted patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease like the actor live in the present and are unable to both look back at moments in the past or look forward and act.",
      "\"I imagine he would be trying to wake her up and not being successful. But then [he] could have been distracted in another room because of one of the dogs or something,\" she described.",
      "Then later, he'd again notice his wife on the ground and would \"live through it again\", she said.",
      "Though no one knows how Hackman spent his last days alive, the grim nature of the possibilities were discussed by authorities and the area's medical examiner.",
      "At a press conference last week, Dr Heather Jarrell, New Mexico's chief medical examiner, said Arakawa died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. Hackman's death was the result of significant heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor.",
      "Given Hackman's advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, it is \"quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased\", Dr Jarrell said.",
      "His autopsy indicated he had not eaten recently, though he showed no signs of dehydration. Officials found no evidence that he had communicated with anyone after his wife's death and could not determine whether he was able to care for himself.",
      "Ms Piersol said patients with advanced Alzheimer's aren't able to pick up on environmental cues like light and darkness, making it harder to determine when he should eat, sleep or bathe.",
      "\"Those [cues] are oftentimes just, no longer available to people at this stage of dementia,\" she said.",
      "Dr Brendan Kelley, a neurologist who specialises in memory and cognition at UT Southwestern Medical Center, explained why Hackman may also not have been able to call authorities for help. He said Alzheimer's disease can leave patients caught between emotional discomfort and the inability to act on it.",
      "\"A person might feel worried or frightened, but at the same time they might not be capable to take the actions that you or I might normally think to do in order to alleviate that worry or concern, such as calling somebody else, or going to speak to a neighbour.\"",
      "Dr Kelley says Alzheimer's patients experience emotions like pain and sadness, and experience physical needs like hunger and thirst, it's just harder for them to identify what they are feeling.",
      "He said missing meals could also increase levels of confusion and agitation.",
      "The couple's deaths and the startling details of Hackman living in the home for a week after his wife's passing has shocked the Santa Fe area, where the couple had lived for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's just absolutely devastating,\" says Jeffery Gomez, a long-time resident of the city, who remembers seeing Hackman around town in his different cars, always with a smile on his face.",
      "His partner, Linda, said the details were triggering, explaining she cared for her elderly mother with dementia. \"Even when you have help, it's a lot,\" she said.",
      "\"We know Gene and his wife were very private people and she was probably trying to shield him from the public,\" she added, \"but the thought of doing that alone? It's a lot to shoulder.\"",
      "Laura N Gitlin, PhD, a behavioural scientist who researches ways to support caregivers told the BBC, this is becoming a common problem among caregivers.",
      "\"With the aging of a population, we also simultaneously have a shrinking of the number of people in the family, number of children, or relatives who live nearby,\" she explained.",
      "Ms Gitlin noted along with there being fewer caregivers, there is less support for these individuals on making big decisions - such as when it's time to place a loved one in a home instead of caring for them by yourself.",
      "Jeffery Gomez said he couldn't understand how no one checked in on the couple for such a long while.",

    "summary": "The Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni feud has shone a light on a part of the entertainment industry that many of those within it would rather remain invisible.",
    "story": [
      "The lawsuits between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni have shed light on a secretive group of people in Hollywood who operate behind the scenes to keep a lid on fallouts and scandals. But in recent years their role has shifted - and their challenges multiplied",
      "Listen to Steven read this article.",
      "\"She's a phony, but I guess the public likes that\u2026\" This is the line that actress Joan Crawford is said to have declared about film star Bette Davis.",
      "The back-and-forth sniping between the pair played out in public in the 1930s and 40s. \"Bette is a survivor... She survived herself,\" Crawford also apparently remarked.",
      "Their tempestuous relationship was so notorious that in 2017 it was made into an Emmy award-winning TV series, Feud.",
      "Hollywood rivalries are of course nothing new \u2013 yet conflicts today rarely play out so publicly. That might be why the dispute between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, which spilled out into the open in December 2024, is still in the headlines three months on.",
      "The subsequent legal battle brought to light a fallout during production of the film It Ends With Us. After the promotional and cinematic run had ended, the pair \u2013 who didn't appear on the red carpet together at the premiere in New York \u2013 filed lawsuits against each other.",
      "Lively has accused Baldoni and others of carrying out a smear campaign against her after she complained about alleged sexual harassment on set. Baldoni, meanwhile, has accused Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds and their publicist of carrying out a smear campaign against him, and claims that she tried to take over control of the film. Both sides deny all allegations.",
      "What emerged as this all played out is that crisis PR managers had been employed. Legal representatives for Lively obtained numerous text messages between Baldoni's publicist Jennifer Abel and the crisis team he retained, led by Melissa Nathan, whose previous clients include Johnny Depp and Drake. Ms Nathan was alleged to have texted Ms Abel, \"You know we can bury anyone.\"",
      "Lively has now reportedly taken on the CIA's former deputy chief of staff Nick Shapiro to advise on her legal communications strategy.",
      "While the outcomes of the lawsuits remain to be seen, the feud has cast the spotlight on an industry that would ordinarily remain largely invisible: that is, the publicity machine at work behind the scenes in Hollywood.",
      "\"On every set, there are fights, liaisons\u2026 there are all sorts of things that go on,\" explains Richard Rushfield, founder and columnist at Hollywood newsletter The Ankler. \"Hollywood is a world full of very messy people coming together for these giant projects, where they put together teams quickly to make these things and disband immediately after.",
      "\"Between all that a lot of stuff goes on, and they deal with it quietly \u2013 they're very obsessive about controlling the narrative. When this stuff explodes into the public, beyond control, it makes everyone very nervous.\"",
      "But the world of the Hollywood PR has shifted in recent years, partly because of the growth of social media, which has changed the relationship between celebrities and fans, bringing them into direct contact and removing some of the mystique.",
      "So, what does that mean for the people whose job it is to keep a lid on the industry's messy reality?",
      "From Tom Hardy to Sarah Jessica Parker",
      "Few fallouts have spilled out into the open in recent years \u2013 and those that did were picked over simply because they're so rare. Actor Dwayne Johnson revealed \"a fundamental difference in philosophies on how we approach moviemaking and collaborating\" with his Fast & Furious co-star Vin Diesel, in a 2018 interview.",
      "The stars of another action film, Mad Max: Fury Road, Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy, are reported to have filmed many of their scenes separately.",
      "And then there were the alleged tensions between Kim Cattrall and Sarah Jessica Parker, who were co-stars of Sex and the City, which ran for six years. In 2018, after Parker offered condolences for Cattrall's brother's death, Cattrall responded on social media, calling Parker a \"hypocrite\" and stating, \"You are not my family. You are not my friend.\"",
      "But behind the scenes, hundreds of other spats will never see the light of day. \"Some of a publicist's best work may never be seen,\" says Daniel Bee, a publicist and brand consultant based in Los Angeles, \"because it stopped something that was wrong, or re-crafted something to a different narrative, or pointed the light in a different direction.",
      "\"The most interesting stuff I've ever done as a publicist is the stuff nobody will ever know about.\"",
      "'Powerful forces at play'",
      "Since Daniel Bee started out as an entertainment publicist in 1997, he has observed a shift in the wider industry. \"I started my career in the British media, there were 11 national newspapers competing with each other. It was a bear pit, hard work, and it was getting to know individuals via relationships.",
      "\"Now, you're up against an anonymous algorithm and accounts where you don't know who you're up against. It's harder to control than ever before.\"",
      "Certainly, social media has posed challenges for those attempting to control narratives around major films and their stars \u2013 while also heralding new forms of \"dark arts\" through which publicists can attempt to shape opinion.",
      "Dating apps could be in trouble \u2013 here's what might take their place",
      "Nasa needs saving from itself \u2013 but is this billionaire right for that job?",
      "Sneaky Britain? How our moral compasses are changing",
      "\"There has always been an army of advisors and consultants doing PR voodoo,\" says Eriq Gardner, entertainment law expert and founding partner of Puck News. \"While I'd love to say the public is media-literate and savvy enough to read between the lines to see the spin, the truth is there are a lot of powerful forces at play and sometimes a large amount of misinformation.\"",
      "So-called PR voodoo is different now that a celebrity \u2013 or their fans \u2013 can access an audience of millions with a click.",
      "While the publicists of previous eras might only have had to worry about print and broadcast platforms, smartphones and social media mean today's digital landscape is a wild west where anyone can shape their own narrative. A badly judged post or comment can damage an actor's career.",
      "But the flipside is a whole new medium in which PRs can practise their \"voodoo\".",
      "Astroturfing and ways to 'cause mischief'",
      "One of the tactics is \"astroturfing\" \u2013 or disguising an orchestrated campaign as a spontaneous up-swelling of public opinion.",
      "This works by manipulating public opinion and creating a false impression of grassroots support (hence the name) or opposition, often coordinated through social media accounts in a way that seems organic.",
      "The practice isn't new, but has been given new life with the advent of social media algorithms.",
      "\"It's deliberately planting disinformation, or twisted versions of the truth, in certain sections of social media,\" says Carla Speight, founder of the PR Mastery app. \"The aim is the halfway point of influential where they will get a bit of traction, but so that it's not too obvious \u2013 you wouldn't hire a Kardashian to do it.",
      "\"It's built up in layers,\" she continues. \"It's like playing a very sinister game of chess. You're putting all the pieces in the right places, just the right amount of mixed-up information, and then you just watch it explode.\"",
      "Although the posts might appear to be genuine public opinion, in fact it's a faked crowd \u2013 whether that's made up of bots or real people, who can be paid to coordinate their posts.",
      "\"All it takes is one or two people to create a meme and put it with the right people,\" says Ms Speight. \"It needs to appear as a trend, and then it's gone. Something is dripped here, something else over there, and when it's done well\u2026 it causes a bit of mischief.\"",
      "Reinventing an age-old tactic?",
      "But all of this is simply a new platform for an age-old trend that has been going on long before the advent of social media, according to Mr Bee. \"Undetected smear campaigns have always been a thing,\" he points out.",
      "\"Previously it would have been a publicist whispering to a diarist of a national newspaper. The issue with digital media is it's anonymous and untraceable.\"",
      "What has changed, he continues, is that audiences have become savvier. \"Whereas before, a quite subservient audience would just take what was given to them in the media, with natural scepticism, curiosity, and a greater level of information, I think people use more critical thinking.\"",
      "Eriq Gardner is less convinced: \"I'm not sure the public approaches what they read with enough scepticism.\"",
      "And yet those in the industry are often alert to it. According to Ms Speight, \"Usually, there's a distinct sort of tell, and it may be the PR thing where we have 'spidey senses' and we can sort of see it, but you're asking, 'Where has that come from? Who started that?' And when there's never a specific place to point it to, that's usually a tell-tale sign.\"",
      "The Hollywood ecosystem",
      "What's clear, though, is that, with studios providing some publications with significant advertising revenue, as well as supplying talent for special events and front covers, revelations often emerge elsewhere in the media.",
      "\"When [scandals] come out, it's usually from places outside of Hollywood,\" argues Mr Rushfield. \"The Harvey Weinstein story was broken by The New York Times and the New Yorker.\"",
      "It was The New York Times that first reported Lively's legal complaint in December. \"It's one of the few places that can afford to do that, and then everyone else jumped in so nobody was sticking their neck out.\" Baldoni filed a $250 million lawsuit against the New York Times in December, although a federal judge indicated this week that it might be dismissed.",
      "Even when bigger outlets break news about Hollywood disputes, the growing dominance of social media means that stories might not have the same cut-through they had previously.",
      "Doreen St Felix, a writer who was previously an editor on Lena Dunham's newsletter, recently wrote in The New Yorker that stories of harassment and abuse, for example, now receive a \"curdled, cynical, and exhausted reception\" \u2013 this, less than a decade after the emergence of the MeToo movement.",
      "She went on to claim that: \"The late 2010s genre of #MeToo reportage cannot thrive on today's volatile internet. Information is misinformation and vice versa. Victims are offenders and offenders are victims.\"",
      "Sometimes, however, the best way for publicists to prevent stories being amplified is by bypassing social media entirely when reacting to a scandal.",
      "\"If you give it to the press first, they don't quote as many of the comments on social media,\" says Ms Speight. \"You control the narrative completely, because the comments come afterwards.\"",
      "Mr Rushfield points out that very little of the revelations in the entertainment press comes out because someone \"uncovered\" something. \"Almost everything you read is there because somebody placed it there \u2013 somebody is dictating a story.\"",
      "What viewers want",
      "None of this industry would exist if the appetite weren't there and if the viewing public didn't want to unpick details about their lives \u2013 and rifts. And yet attitudes towards celebrity have undoubtedly changed since the advent of social media.",
      "\"It's now a two-way communication, which it never was before,\" points out Mr Bee. \"It was generally celebrities, or lawyer or government or whatever, just saying something that gets reported, and that message is conveyed. Now, you have to be prepared for a two-way conversation.\"",
      "But he thinks there are different attitudes to the media today than in the era of celebrity gossip magazines. Nodding to the UK, he continues: \"We had the Leveson Inquiry, we're about to get an ITV drama about phone hacking \u2013 it's as if the curtain has been lifted.\"",
      "As for the Lively and Baldoni lawsuits, it's not clear how these will play out \u2013 but the very fact that it has so unusually spilled into the public domain is a reminder of how well-oiled the Hollywood publicity machine is the rest of the time. And that is unlikely to change soon.",

      "At the Brit Awards last week, big winner Charli XCX went full brat as she wore a sheer black dress, prompting hundreds of complaints to media watchdog Ofcom.",
      "She used one of her acceptance speeches to address the controversy of her outfit. \"I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples,\" she said. \"I feel like we're in the era of 'free the nipple' though, right?\"",
      "The nearly naked look has been a talking point at other award ceremonies - including last Sunday's Oscars and the Grammys in February, when Kanye West's wife Bianca Censori dropped her coat on the red carpet to reveal an almost entirely invisible dress.",
      "The love for transparent textiles has continued at London and Paris fashion weeks, with many of the celebrities watching on also getting the memo.",
      "At Stella McCartney's Paris show, US actress and Michael Jackson's daughter Paris Jackson wore a translucent black off-the-shoulder maxi dress with only a nude-coloured thong underneath.",
      "Rapper Ice Spice sported a black lace catsuit with a feathered coat at the show.",
      "Naked dressing was a key trend in some designers' spring/summer collections, and the theme has continued in autumn/winter looks too.",
      "As Vogue wrote in January: \"For a period of time, sheerness was few and far between, but nowadays, 'naked dressing' is commonplace every season.\"",
      "Dior's latest collection embraced see-through material and presented it in an ethereal way, with intricate detailing and gender-fluid silhouettes.",
      "Creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri described her collection as \"demonstrating how clothing is a receptacle that affirms cultural, aesthetic and social codes\".",
      "The trend divides opinion but is certainly part of a wider movement - last summer Charli XCX's definition of being a brat included wearing \"a strappy white top with no bra\".",
      "Sheer dressing is a nod to the minimalist looks of the 1990s - think transparent blouses and Kate Moss wearing a thin slip dress - and with our love for nostalgia fashion, it's no wonder it is taking off again.",
      "The trend also had a resurgence a decade ago. The \"free the nipple\" movement was everywhere in the early 2010s, with Rihanna stirring up headlines with her sheer crystal-embellished dress at the CFDA awards in 2014.",
      "Charli XCX's Brits outfit was praised by some on social media. \"Stop policing women's bodies,\" one person wrote, while another said she looked comfortable in her outfit so \"why is society judging?\"",
      "But many found it too risque for prime-time TV. Ofcom received 825 complaints  about the Brits ceremony, the majority relating to Charli's outfit and Sabrina Carpenter's eye-opening pre-watershed performance.",
      "\"Maybe think about putting this on at a time when kids ain't gonna be watching,\" one person wrote on social media.",
      "'Challenging fashion norms'",
      "Fashion stylist and CEO of clothing brand Mermaid Way, Julia Pukhalskaia, calls the choice to wear revealing dresses a \"provocative statement\", but says it's a \"way to reclaim the right to govern one's body\".",
      "The controversy around it feeds into a wider dialogue about women's rights and double standards when it comes to dress codes, she adds.",
      "Abhi Madan, creative director of fashion brand Amarra, believes the trend \"is about embracing freedom and boldness in fashion\".",
      "The idea of freeing the nipple \"isn't just about exposure - it's a movement towards body positivity and challenging conventional fashion norms\", he argues.",
      "\"Designers are now integrating sheer elements not just for shock value but to create a refined and elegant silhouette that empowers wearers.\"",
      "It seems many Hollywood stars this year were feeling empowered as chiffon, lace and tulle were in plentiful supply at the Oscars.",
      "Shock value is surely a factor for some, too, though.",
      "At Vanity Fair's Oscars afterparty, Julia Fox wore a mesh dress with only long wavy hair to cover some of her modesty.",
      "There were other interpretations of the naked dress - Megan Thee Stallion wore a green dress with strategically placed foliage and nipple coverings, while Zoe Kravitz opted to cover up the front but expose the back as a beaded mesh panel revealed her buttocks in her Saint Laurent dress.",
      "\"This year, naked dressing seemed to particularly thrive at the event,\" the New York Times noted.",
      "However, not everyone is on board. The Times fashion director Anna Murphy wrote that she's over the trend because \"it's only women who do this\".",
      "\"It is not an equal opportunities endeavour. It is, rather, a manifestation of the kind of thing that keeps this world unequal. That women's bodies are for public consumption and men's, usually, aren't,\" she wrote.",
      "Some men have been embracing the nearly naked trend, though. In 2022, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet wore striking a backless red top at Venice Film Festival, and at the 2023 Grammys Harry Styles freed the nipple in a plunge harlequin jumpsuit.",
      "It's the women who will continue to cause more of a stir on runways and red carpets - and society will still be split on whether it's redefining conventional notions of modesty in fashion, a product of misogyny, or simply seeking attention.",

    "story": [
      "NHS England will be abolished and brought under \"democratic control\" in an attempt to cut bureaucracy and duplication, Sir Keir Starmer has announced.",
      "The organisation, which oversees the country's health service, will be brought into the Department of Health, and the PM said the move would free up money for frontline services.",
      "The government said it expected around 50% of the jobs at NHS England, which as of December had 14,400 staff, and the Department of Health, which has 3,500 staff, to go.",
      "In a speech in Hull, Sir Keir said for too long politicians had \"chosen to hide behind vast arrays of quangos\" - organisations funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled by the government.",
      "The government said work would begin immediately to return many of NHS England's current functions to the Department of Health and Social Care, with the aim of completing the process in two years.",
      "The significant move gives the government more control and accountability over one of their key pledges - to cut NHS waiting times.",
      "NHS England - which the government dubbed \"the world's largest quango\" - oversees the health service, working with government to agree funding and priorities, as well as monitoring the performance of local NHS services.",
      "It was given autonomy by the then-Conservative Health Secretary Andrew Lansley in 2012, with the aim of freeing the organisation from interference by politicians.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the changes would \"liberate\" frontline workers from excessive and \"competing directions\".",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, he said the result would be \"better value for taxpayers and better outcomes for patients because the hundreds of millions of pounds we can save will be redeployed to the front line delivering better care\".",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch welcomed the move to bring the management of the health service back under ministerial control, but warned Labour \"cannot hide if things go wrong\".",
      "She did not have \"high hopes\" because Labour already ran the NHS in Wales and that was \"doing a lot worse than the rest of the country\", she said.",
      "Liberal Democrat  leader Sir Ed Davey backed the plans, but argued they were not the main issue for the NHS.",
      "To fix it, the government needed to focus on \"getting more GPs, more NHS dentists, more community pharmacists, making sure that social care actually works\", he said.",
      "The Health Foundation think tank warned the reorganisation would distract senior leaders.",
      "And Sharon Graham, head of the Unite union, said: \"Taking an axe to these jobs is an ill-thought-out strategy that could end up meaning frontline healthcare staff struggle to do their jobs effectively if they aren't paid on time, don't have basic medical supplies or are forced to do additional administrative work rather than treat patients.\"",
      "The news comes after senior NHS England figures including chief executive Amanda Pritchard and medical director Sir Stephen Powis announced they were stepping down.",
      "Live updates: Starmer to scrap NHS England and bring health service back under 'democratic control'",
      "NHS England: Why world's biggest quango is being axed",
      "Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?",
      "The announcement came as part of a wider speech on reforming the state, which Sir Keir described as \"overstretched\" and \"unfocused\".",
      "\"Over a number of years politicians have chosen to hide behind vast arrays of quangos, arm's length bodies, regulators, reviews,\" the prime minister said.",
      "\"A sort of cottage industry of checkers and blockers using taxpayer money to stop the government delivering on taxpayer priorities.\"",
      "The number of quangos has fallen by more than half since 2010 but there are still more than 300 across the UK.",
      "They include regulators, cultural institutions and advisory bodies, ranging from large organisations like NHS England, to smaller ones like the Gambling Commission and the British Film Institute.",
      "The water regulator Ofwat could be among other government quangos in line to be scrapped.",
      "Ofwat's role - along with the Environment Agency, the Drinking Water Inspectorate and Natural Resources Wales - is among the organisations already being looked at in a review of the whole water system in England and Wales, by an Independent Water Commission established last year.",
      "Government sources would not pre-empt the outcome of the review but all options for regulating water are understood to be on the table, except nationalising water companies.",
      "The new Labour government has set up more than 20 new quangos since winning power.",
      "These include Great British Energy, which will invest in renewable energy to help meet the government's clean power goals, and Skills England, which aims to support people to find jobs.",
      "The government has also suggested it wants to cut the size of the Civil Service, which has a headcount of more than 500,000.",
      "Civil servants are politically impartial officials employed by the government, covering areas including policy development and services like benefits and prisons.",
      "In his speech, Sir Keir linked the need to reshape government to global instability which has pushed up bills at home, saying the state needs to be operating at \"maximum strength\".",
      "He promised to cut the costs of regulation for businesses by 25% to boost economic growth.",
      "His plan also includes greater use of artificial intelligence, underpinned by the mantra that civil servants should not be spending time on tasks where digital or AI can do it better and quicker.",
      "Earlier this year, Sir Keir faced a backlash saying \"too many people in Whitehall are comfortable in the tepid bath of managed decline\".",
      "In his speech he was keen to stress his criticism was not aimed at individuals but the system as a whole.",
      "Having spent the last few weeks focused on diplomatic wrangling over Ukraine, the speech saw the prime minister return to domestic challenges - specifically a feeling that services in the country do not work well enough.",
      "It also reflected growing concern in Downing Street that there are too many organisations that ministers can not directly control.",
      "For the public, the key question will be whether these changes result in any perceptible improvement.",
      "Former head of the Civil Service Lord [Gus] O'Donnell told the BBC the government's messaging to civil servants was \"nothing short of disastrous\".",
      "Speaking on Radio 4's PM programme, he referenced Sir Keir's \"tepid bath\" comment and a government briefing to the Guardian on Wednesday saying \"they wanted to do 'project chainsaw'. Trying to be a mini Elon Musk?\".",
      "He described these remarks as \"absolutely ridiculous\" and \"really damaging\" for the prime minister and what he wanted to achieve.",
      "Mike Clancy, head of the Prospect trade union, which represents civil servants, agreed reform was needed but added: \"The government must recognise that there is a fine line between cutting back bureaucracy and undermining the essential functions of the state.\"",
      "\"Civil servants in agencies such as HSE [Health and Safety Executive] and the Environment Agency are at the frontline of delivering on the government's missions - writing them off as 'blockers' is a profound mistake.\"",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93nvvw1x20o",
    "published": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 15:39:07 GMT",
    "summary": "There are three main reasons body is going - money, bureaucracy and control, says Nick Triggle",
    "story": [
      "The body responsible for the day-to-day running of the health service in England is being scrapped.",
      "The government plans to abolish NHS England and bring it into the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) in a radical overhaul of the management structure of the NHS.",
      "Why? The government argues it will save money, cut red-tape and give ministers more control. But the move is not without risk.",
      "With more than 14,000 staff, NHS England is around four times the size of the DHSC itself.",
      "But that is only because in recent years NHS England has absorbed Health Education England, which oversees staff training, and NHS Digital, which is responsible for data collection and technology.",
      "NHS England also plays a role in organising some key frontline services, including GPs and specialist hospital care, while overseeing the day-to-day running of the health service alongside distributing the money made available by ministers.",
      "Much of this will now fall under the control of the health department. But not all. Expect some to be devolved down to regional health boards.",
      "Nonetheless, it is expected to lead to half of the jobs at the two organisations going \u2013 around 9,000 roles.",
      "That is expected to save at least \u00a3500m a year. While the sum sounds a lot, it is around 0.25% of the health budget. The respected King's Fund think-tank has called it a \"drop in the ocean\" that will not go very far on the frontline.",
      "Bureaucratic monster",
      "But this is also about reducing bureaucracy \u2013 something that can't really be measured in numbers.",
      "In his address to the House of Commons, Streeting cited one organisation that was having to fill in 250 forms in one month to satisfy both the health department and NHS England.",
      "Reacting to the announcement on Thursday, former health secretary Jeremy Hunt told the BBC NHS England has become a \"bureaucratic monster\" that stifles innovation.",
      "Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?",
      "And talk to those doing the work in hospitals and other frontline services, one of the most common complaints is that NHS England was incredibly controlling, even requesting individual NHS trusts ask for permission for something as mundane as granting media interviews.",
      "But make no mistake this is also about control. It was a point made clear by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer when he set out the plan, which could take two years to fully implement.",
      "He said it was only right that a democratically-elected government was in charge of day-to-day running of the health service.",
      "Significant risk",
      "Quangos - \"quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations\" - are set up by government to oversee regulations and operate independently from politicians.",
      "NHS England was created as part of the 2012 reforms introduced under former Tory health secretary Andrew Lansley.",
      "The idea was to free the health service from political meddling \u2013 with ministers instead setting the wider strategy, but stepping back from getting involved on a daily basis.",
      "In the years afterwards NHS England has exercised that independence. This was  most notable under the leadership of Sir Simon Stevens, who challenged and pressed the Theresa May government into increasing funding.",
      "In the late 2010s, after Lansley had left government, Conservative health ministers privately expressed frustration that the single-biggest part of their brief was outside of their control.",
      "As soon as Streeting took charge at the DHSC last summer, it was clear he felt the same and NHS England was on borrowed time.",
      "On Monday it was announced half of the roles at NHS England would go \u2013 and that came after the current chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, and a number of her top managers announced they would be stepping down.",
      "But given Labour, in opposition, was critical of the Tories messing around with NHS structures, embarking on its own reorganisation comes with significant risk. Hospital bosses are already warning this will cause disruption.",
      "And the public are understandably asking what difference this will make to the care they receive. The government says it will help it improve services and reduce waiting times \u2013 and, given that is one of its top priorities, there will be no hiding place now."

    "summary": "As part of Your Voice, Your BBC, we answer questions from you on government plans to scrap NHS England.",
    "story": [
      "The government has announced NHS England will be abolished to \"cut bureaucracy\" and reform how the National Health Service is run.",
      "The changes will not impact anyone's access to the NHS - it will still be free at the point of use and cover all the services it does already.",
      "Around 9,000 administrative roles are being cut at NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care as part of the changes - amounting to roughly half of all roles at the two organisations.",
      "As part of Your Voice Your BBC, we asked for your questions on the plans and what they could mean for you - below we have answered them for you.",
      "What does NHS England do?",
      "NHS England is the administrative body which manages how health services up and down the country are run. It is made up primarily of managers and officials, not the doctors and nurses providing care in hospitals.",
      "The government provides it with money and tells it what its priorities are for the health service - for example, that might be cutting waiting times or improving cancer survival rates.",
      "NHS England's role is to funnel the money it is given into different parts of the health service and work out how to juggle resources in order to bring about the change the government wants to see.",
      "In 2012, NHS England was given more independence by the Conservative-led government. They said doing so would prevent politicians from interfering too much in how front line services are run - but critics say that change has made it harder to carry out reform or drive improvement.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer believes that overhauling management structures will put NHS in England \"back into democratic control\" and free up money for front-line services.",
      "NHS England is also responsible for other functions like overseeing training and collecting data, as well as managing GP services.",
      "There are separate organisations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, so these changes only impact England.",
      "Did this decision come out of the blue?",
      "Within the NHS and Westminster, the writing has been on the wall for NHS England for some months.",
      "Even in the latter years of the Tory government, health ministers expressed frustration that they were not in charge of the day-to-day running of the health service.",
      "When Labour came into power, it was clear Health Secretary Wes Streeting wanted more control of the NHS and saw a lot of duplication and bureaucracy.",
      "NHS England's chief executive Amanda Pritchard recently said she would step down at the end of the March and a number of her senior leadership team have followed suit.",
      "In that respect, it was clear there was going to be significant reform - but this is as big a change as you could possibly get at the heart of the NHS management structure.",
      "What is a 'quango' - and why do ministers think 'bureaucracy' is a problem?",
      "These are two words we have heard the government use a lot when setting out why it is scrapping NHS England and bringing the health service under closer government control.",
      "In this context, bureaucracy is a stand-in word for a system that is particularly complicated, or requires excessive amounts of administration, paperwork, regulations or layers of management.",
      "Starmer made it clear he thinks this sort of admin is getting in the way of delivering health services.",
      "We also heard him describe NHS England as the \"world's largest quango\" - a term that stands for Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation.",
      "Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?",
      "In short, quangos are bodies like regulators and advisory groups, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled by central government. They do things on behalf of the government, but are not directly controlled by ministers.",
      "They range from big organisations like NHS England, Network Rail and the Environment Agency to smaller ones like the British Film Institute and Gambling Commission.",
      "Their numbers have fallen by more than half since 2010 because David Cameron's coalition government abolished nearly 300 - but there are still more than 300 across the UK.",
      "Labour has set up more than 20 since winning the election last July, including Great British Energy and Skills England.",
      "The total budget for quangos in 2022/23 - when the latest figures were published - was \u00a3353bn.",
      "Will there be more control over decision-making and budgets locally?",
      "We do not yet know all of the detail about how health services in England will be managed in the future but it is likely that some of the responsibilities NHS England currently holds will be devolved down to regional bodies.",
      "One of the arguments being made about NHS reform is that if you move decision-making down to a local level and nearer to patients, it will be health leaders who are more attuned to the needs of patients in the area making those calls.",
      "They will know what local populations need and where the weaknesses are - and that, in theory, could improve services for patients in different parts of the country.",
      "Will this mean an increase in funding to the NHS and better access to medicines?",
      "Thursday's announcement was not about funding - that is expected in the summer.",
      "We already know NHS is getting an uplift of about 3-4% next year and we do not yet know what spending will look like beyond that.",
      "But government sources believe scrapping NHS England will save the government \u00a3500m a year.",
      "On access to medicines, it is the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence - which is separate from NHS England - which sets the guidelines on what treatments are judged affordable and cost effective.",
      "When a new drug is produced by the pharmaceutical industry, the institute will decide if the NHS can afford it and whether it is better than other drugs that are used.",

      "This includes treatments such as hormonal contraceptives and intrauterine delivery systems.",
      "Helen Knight, director of medicines evaluation at NICE, said it marked \"a potential step-change in how we manage endometriosis, putting control back in patients' hands while ensuring value for the taxpayer\".",

    "summary": "The at-home light therapy treatment is increasingly being seen as a must-have skincare accessory.",
    "story": [
      "LED technology has been used to address a number of skin issues, such as eczema, mild to moderate acne, psoriasis and sun damage in a medical setting.",
      "But the at-home LED market is on the verge of becoming a massive industry - with masks and other devices retailing for anything from \u00a340 to \u00a31,500.",
      "The technology harnesses the power of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which then stimulate skin cells when they are exposed to the skin repeatedly.",
      "Mask developers make big claims that at-home LED masks can be used to treat acne scars, sun damage and fine lines - but does this stand up to scrutiny?",
      "The LED market is set to be worth \u00a3600m globally by 2032 - which is nearly double what airflow technology like the Dyson Airwrap will be worth at the same point.",
      "According to consultant dermatologist Dr Jonathan Kentley, LED technology works by causing the skin to absorb light energy, which then triggers cellular changes in a process known as photobiomodulation (PBM).",
      "\"This allows new blood vessels and skin cells to be formed, along with more collagen and elastin,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"PBM has also been used to treat acne as it has anti-inflammatory effects and reduces the amount of oil in the skin,\" he adds.",
      "A recent comprehensive study of PBM stated that more clinical trials on humans need to take place to fully understand how it actually works.",
      "US space agency Nasa first began studying the effect of LEDs in the 1990s to see if it could help in cell regeneration.",
      "Since then, medical-grade devices have been used by dermatologists \"for many years\", according to Dr Kentley.",
      "But at-home masks have only been on the retail market for about five years and cost a fraction of the medical devices.",
      "The main differences between medical devices and High Street masks are the strength of the LEDs, the number of bulbs on the device and how close they sit to the skin's surface when being used.",
      "LED therapy masks are 'visually interesting'",
      "Dr Justine Kluk, who runs her own dermatology clinic and specialises in treating acne, believes that while at-home masks \"sound promising\", mask wholesale manufacturers are \"speculating\" about their benefits.",
      "\"I don't believe anyone has run clinical trials of the LED mask at home to see if it is the same dose as a device you would use in a clinic or hospital,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"No-one is testing these devices in big enough sample sizes for long enough periods of time for us to feel really confident.",
      "\"So I believe the benefits from using one of these masks is probably very modest,\" she adds.",
      "Skincare makes up nearly half of all global sales in the beauty industry - and is set to continue to grow more than the likes of haircare, make-up and fragrance in the next year.",
      "This is being boosted by Generation Z (those born between 1995 and 2009) and even Generation Alpha (born 2010 to now) whose skincare fascination is said to be fuelled by social media trends.",
      "Dr Kluk says she has noticed \"that people's interest in at-home skin care and treatments has increased hugely since Covid\" and believes the \"visually interesting\" element of the at-home LED mask makes it such an eye-catching product to sell online.",
      "\"People sitting watching TV wearing a red LED mask increases people's curiosity.",
      "\"Every other consultation I've had for the last six months, has involved people asking me about LED masks,\" she adds.",
      "When you search LED masks on social media platforms such as TikTok, you will be met with hundreds of videos with users showing off their results after using one of these at-home devices.",
      "Natalie O'Neill, 29, tells the BBC she started to use a mask \"out of curiosity to see if I would notice any difference\" and did not use it to treat an existing skin condition like acne.",
      "The skincare content creator says:  \"I noticed a change in my skin after a couple of weeks and felt it prevented breakouts really well.\"",
      "She adds that the mask has helped to \"keep my skin tone looking more even\" and faded marks on her face more quickly.",
      "O'Neill was not paid to promote a particular mask and caveats all her content on this technology by saying she uses it alongside a consistent skincare routine.",
      "\"Getting red light or LED therapy in a clinic is not immediately transferable to a mask, which a lot of consumers don't realise - I'm OK with that because I have the right expectations,\" she adds.",
      "Part of the appeal of LED masks is that they are easy to use and therefore have a low barrier to entry for potential buyers.",
      "Laurence Newman is the chief executive of CurrentBody, whose at-home LED mask is one of the world's best sellers.",
      "He started selling professional equipment to clinics more than 25 years ago and began developing an at-home LED mask in 2009, bringing out the company's first device just under 10 years later.",
      "\"We see that people use it for 10 minutes and get an instant glow afterwards,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Newman says that women in particular \"are moving towards totally non-invasive skincare\" and looking for ways to improve their skin without botox and fillers.",
      "Newman says the masks his company sells have been developed using the same technology as medical devices, which have a minimum requirement light wavelengths.",
      "He emphasises that the at-home LED mask market and indeed at-home beauty technology market are in their infancy, with \"a real movement of education\" growing.",
      "'This is a lot of money to spend'",
      "Dr Kentley concludes that \"PBM is mostly considered safe, even at high levels\" so using any form of LED technology is unlikely to \"cause damage to cells\", however more research into how exactly PBM works is needed to understand what it can do.",
      "\"There have been many experimental and clinical studies into the use of PBM for various dermatologic conditions, however they have varied in the parameters of the device and treatment protocols,\" he adds.",
      "\"Many of these studies were small and unstandardised and often paid for by the manufacturers so it is difficult to draw concrete conclusions\".",
      "He says if someone is keen to buy a device they should make sure they choose one that has EU safety certifications and a high density of LED bulbs on the mask to ensure enough energy is being delivered to the skin.",
      "Dr Kluk also says that she does not \"want to discourage anyone\" who is intrigued by the technology but wants \"them to understand that this is a lot of money to spend on a device, which could potentially support a good skincare routine, or if it's severe like acne, a good prescription regimen and some lifestyle measures - but it's unlikely to do enough on its own.\"",

      "A report by drugs firm GSK - seen by the BBC - shows it learned in 2003 of a link between the medicines, known as dopamine agonist drugs, and what it described as \"deviant\" sexual behaviour. It cited a case of a man who had sexually assaulted a child while taking the drug for Parkinson's.",
      "While there is no explicit reference to this side effect in patient leaflets, the UK medicines regulator told us there was a general warning about increased libido and harmful behaviour. GSK says a risk of \"altered\" sexual interest is also referred to in the leaflets.",
      "Some of the women who described being drawn to risky sexual behaviour told us they had no idea of what was causing it. Others said they felt compelled to gamble or shop with no history of such activities. One accumulated debts of more than \u00a3150,000.",
      "Like many women, Claire first developed RLS during her pregnancies. The relentless need to move was often accompanied by sleeplessness and a crawling sensation under her skin.",
      "The condition persisted after giving birth and she was prescribed the dopamine agonist drug Ropinirole. She says she was not warned by doctors of any side effects. It initially worked wonders for her RLS, she says, but after a year or so she began feeling unprecedented sexual urges.",
      "\"The only way I could describe it is it was just deviant,\" she tells us - using that word without any knowledge of the GSK research which had established a link with such behaviour.",
      "Claire says she began leaving her house in the early hours of the morning to cruise for sex. Wearing a see-through top and jacket, she would flash her chest at any man she could find. She did this regularly, she says, and in increasingly dangerous locations, despite having a partner.",
      "\"There remains an element in your head that knows what you're doing is wrong, but it affects you to the point that you don't know you're doing it.\"",

      "Impulsive behaviours, including gambling and increased sex drive, have long been listed as side effects in medicine leaflets for dopamine agonist drugs - and are thought to affect between 6% to 17% of RLS patients taking them, according to health guidance body NICE. A \"common\" side effect of any medicine can be considered to only affect as few as 1% of people who take it, according to the NHS.",
      "The drugs work by mimicking the behaviour of dopamine, a natural chemical in our brains which helps regulate movement. It is known as the \"happy hormone\" because it is activated when something is pleasurable or we feel rewarded.",
      "But agonist drugs can over-stimulate these feelings and under-stimulate the appreciation of consequences - leading to impulsive behaviour, according to academics.",
      "The cases of what the GSK report from 2003 described as \"deviant behaviour\"  involved two men who were prescribed Ropinirole for Parkinson's disease. In one, a 63-year-old-man sexually assaulted a seven-year-old girl, leading to a custodial sentence.",
      "The documents said the perpetrator's libido had increased significantly from the start of his treatment with Ropinirole and his \"libido problem subsequently resolved\" after his dose was reduced.",
      "In the second case, a 45-year-old man carried out \"uncontrolled acts of exhibitionism and indecent behaviour\". His sex drive was reported to have increased prior to being prescribed Ropinirole but his urges \"intensified\" after the treatment.",
      "Prevalence rates of what GSK calls \"deviant\" sexual behaviours caused by the drugs are unknown and tend to be under-reported by those who experience them, according to Valerie Voon, a professor of neuropsychiatry at the University of Cambridge.",
      "\"There's a lot of stigma and shame attached to it, and people don't realise that it's associated with a medication,\" she says.",
      "Prof Voon believes risky sexual behaviours - beyond a purely increased libido - should be specifically warned about and screened by the NHS, because their impact can be \"devastating\".",
      "RLS is believed to affect about one in 20 adults - and women are about twice as likely to suffer as men.",

      "On 16 March 2020, the government launched the 'Ventilator Challenge' - a drive to encourage domestic UK suppliers to develop new machines or modify existing designs.",
      "The project was overseen by cabinet office officials and involved the MHRA, which helped draw up initial specifications and squeezed an approval process that would usually take 18-24 months into just weeks.",
      "A number of major companies were involved, including the carmakers Ford and McLaren, and the electronics giant Dyson.",
      "At the time, the company's founder Sir James Dyson held a number of telephone conversations with government officials, including the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson.",

      "Minutes later ex health secretary Matt Hancock replied, \"I have also received the same. I will talk to Dyson and Michael [Gove] and sort it.\"",
      "Asked about the deal at the inquiry, the government's then chief commercial officer, Sir Gareth Rhys Williams, said it was the only example he could recall in the pandemic where he was asked to put a contract in place \"against commercial guidance\".",

      "A provisional \u00a3100,000 order was then placed for the Dyson prototypes, and an email from Michael Gove's private office set out a number of actions that needed be taken quickly including: \"The MHRA and Sir Gareth Rhys Williams to ensure by the end of Friday, [that] the Dyson product has been tested and approved by MHRA\u2026 [and] the final product has started to be manufactured.\"",
      "The following day Graeme Tunbridge, the director of devices for the MHRA, wrote to colleagues warning that Michael Gove was \"keen to press forward with Dyson's proposal to a timescale that is totally unrealistic.\"",
      "He added that Mr Gove \"did not appreciate the level of risk involved in the manufacture and use of ventilators\" and \"wanted to circumvent the expedited regulatory process that has been put in place\".",
      "\"MHRA are doing everything we can to support this but absolutely will not cut any corners when it comes to the issues of critical patient safety,\" he wrote.",
      "Giving evidence to the inquiry, Mr Gove denied he had tried to pressure the MHRA in any way, or that the focus on Dyson meant resources could not be devoted to bids from other companies.",
      "\"Just imagine the situation, if you will, a minister \u2013 Matt Hancock, I, Boris Johnson \u2013 says we want to have a potentially lethal machine in hospitals deliberately so that we can meet an arbitrary deadline. It's inconceivable,\" he said.",
      "The former minister said that the Dyson prototype ultimately \"did not get through testing\" and \"whenever confronted with brute facts about safety or otherwise, I would always accept them.\"",
      "He denied that his private office was instructing the regulator to approve the device saying the language used was simply \"shorthand for 'we would hope that it had been tested and if tested satisfactorily [then] approved by the MHRA to that timescale'\".",

      "Asked earlier this week if the government was planning another \"bonfire of the quangos\", Downing Street said the PM wanted to see a more \"active and agile state\", rather than \"outsourcing\" decisions to other bodies.",

      "The total budget for quangos in 2022/23 - the latest published figures - was \u00a3353.3bn.",

      "Paul Miner, head of planning and policy at CPRE, the countryside charity, said the group supported the use of CPOs to build genuinely affordable homes on previously developed land.",
      "But he added: \"Compulsory purchase shouldn't be used to enable the development of valued countryside and local green spaces.\"",
      "New homes fall again in government's first six months",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Labour would build on green belt to boost housing",
      "Responding to such fears, Pennycook told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was \"somewhat mystified\" by this interpretation, saying CPOs would be used \"far more often\" for regenerating brownfield - or previously developed - land.",
      "\"We think it's right these powers are more widely used and it will be for local authorities to make the decisions about what land is appropriate for those powers to be used on,\" he added.",
      "A requirement for the secretary of state to sign off on CPOs will be removed \"in certain instances\", he said, adding that the legislation would be \"transformative\" in unlocking construction for new homes, roads, rail and renewable energy projects.",
      "The bill also aims streamline the planning process, with more decisions made directly by officers rather than councillors.",
      "However, councils have raised concerns this could mean they will be shut out of the democratic planning process.",
      "Richard Clewer, housing and planning spokesperson at the Country Councils Network, said he welcomed changes to CPOs as a \"useful tool\".",
      "However, he said changes to the planning process could \"dilute and bypass the role of councillors\", particularly with rural developments where a few new homes could make a significant impact.",
      "Defending the plans, Pennycook said \"expert planning officers\" would support elected councillors with technical detail and allow councillors to focus on larger, more controversial applications.",
      "The government has promised to build 1.5 million new homes in England over the next five years, with the pledge key to boosting economic growth.",
      "However, the number of new homes continued to fall during the first six months that Labour was in power, with the construction industry warning the country does not have enough workers to deliver on the target.",
      "Pennycook said the inheritance from the previous Conservative government was \"dire\" but there were \"very positive signs\" and \"green shoots coming forward\" in the number of planning applications being submitted.",
      "Other measures in the bill include:",

      "Labour MP Sarah Owen, who chairs the Women and Equalities Committee, has been calling for this right to be extended in cases where miscarriages take place before 24 weeks.",
      "Speaking in the House of Commons, Madders said: \"Bereavement is not an illness, it's not a holiday and it does need its own special category.\"",
      "He added: \"I am grateful to the work of the Women and Equalities Committee for raising the important issue of miscarriage leave.",
      "\"The loss of a baby at any stage is an incredibly difficult personal experience and the inquiry they conducted demonstrated a clear gap in support for those who experience pregnancy loss and need time to recover and grieve.\"",
      "He said Owen had shown \"great bravery\" in speaking about her own experience of having a miscarriage.",
      "In 2021, Owen told MPs that after her own miscarriage she felt physically better in a few days but had \"all the classic signs\" of grieving.",
      "\"I could not eat, I could not sleep. I really did not hold much hope that life would ever get brighter,\" she said.",
      "Owen and her committee have proposed changes to the Employment Rights Bill which would ensure parents bereaved as a result of a pregnancy loss are entitled to two weeks of leave.",
      "During a debate on the bill on Tuesday, Madders said: \"We fully accept the principle of bereavement leave for pregnancy loss, as raised in the amendments, and we look forward to further discussions with [Owen] and [peers] as the Bill moves on to its next stages in the Lords.\"",
      "Owen said she was \"so pleased\" to hear the minister's commitment.",
      "Introducing a legal right to miscarriage bereavement leave would be \"a leading light in a world which seems to be taking a backward step in women's rights,\" she added.",
      "Vicki Robinson, CEO of the Miscarriage Association, said: \"We are extremely pleased to see, that for the first time ever, those experiencing pre-24-week pregnancy loss will be officially recognised in bereavement leave legislation.",
      "\"While we had been seeking paid leave, and the present commitment appears to be for unpaid leave, it nevertheless represents a significant step forward and provides long-overdue validation that this type of loss can be experienced as a bereavement like any other.\"",
      "Paid leave for bereaved parents is 'crucial'",
      "'I went back after 3 days': Calls for miscarriage bereavement leave",
      "How will the changes to workers' rights  affect you?",
      "The bill aims to strengthen workers' rights in areas including unfair dismissals, flexible working and sick pay.",
      "Opening the debate, Madders said it was a \"landmark bill\" that would \"tackle low pay, poor working conditions and poor job security\".",
      "Greg Smith, the Conservative shadow business minister, said he backed the government on bereavement leave for pregnancy loss but added that in the \"vast majority\" of the bill the government had got the balance between the rights employees and employers \"wrong\".",

      "Stella Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, is trying to amend the bill to provide greater protections for paternity or parental partner leave.",
      "The bill currently gives workers the right to paternity leave from day one of their employment, instead of the current 26 weeks.",
      "Creasy's amendment would compel the government to review and consult on the period of protected paternity and parental partner leave, which currently stands at two weeks.",
      "She said that was not long enough, adding that the UK had \"the worst\" paternity leave entitlement in the whole of the EU.",
      "Madders said the government would be holding a review of the parental leave system, which would be separate from the bill.",

      "The prime minister spoke to his top team ahead of a speech on Thursday, when he is expected to announce an overhaul of how the government works.",
      "In the meeting, Sir Keir did not give examples of decisions made by regulators instead of ministers.",

      "Some - such as the Environment Agency, or the broadcasting regulator Ofcom - have powers to make decisions without ministerial input.",

      "The spokesperson said regulators had \"not been focused enough on growth\" and that would be a theme of the prime minister's speech on Thursday.",

      "But Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie, who drafted the bill, said the decision \"flies in the face of the climate ambitions that this government is supposed to have\".",
      "Ms Martin said she would introduce a bill only when she could be satisfied it would both decarbonise houses and decrease fuel poverty.",
      "Climate change legislation passed by MSPs",
      "Heat pumps needed at 'much faster rate' - watchdog",

      "Heating homes, largely through gas boilers, is responsible for about 18.5% of Scotland's planet warming greenhouse gas emissions.",

      "But Martin said: \"I'm going to introduce a Heat in Buildings Bill when I can be satisfied that those interventions within it will decrease fuel poverty at the same time as decarbonising houses.\"",
      "The minister said she felt the drafting of the bill didn't take that \"significantly into consideration\" and added there were \"so many moving parts\".",
      "Martin said: \"I am going to craft a bill that is going to simultaneously reduce carbon and tackle fuel poverty.",
      "\"And until I can do that I'm afraid there will not be a bill put forward in its current drafted form because at the moment it will make people poorer.\"",

      "He added: \"This is yet another example of the SNP's climate delays, which have grown more and more worrying over the last year.",
      "\"It will also delay the huge benefit households need to see from ending their reliance on fossil fuels and their volatile prices.\"",
      "WWF Scotland also criticised the move and questioned the logic behind it.",
      "Io Hadjicosta, the charity's climate and energy policy manager, said: \"This announcement is deeply concerning and is yet another case of the Scottish government flip flopping when it comes to tackling the climate emergency.",
      "\"Reducing emissions from Scotland's housing stock by improving insulation and fitting renewable heat pumps would lift people out of fuel poverty - not increase it.",
      "\"By delaying the introduction of the Heat in Buildings Bill further all the government is doing is condemning the poorest in our society to increasingly high fossil fuel costs and damp, unhealthy homes.\"",
      "Douglas Lumsden, the Scottish Conservatives' spokesperson on net zero and energy, said the plans were \"completely unrealistic\".",

      "In a statement to the Scottish parliament, Energy Secretary Mairi McAllan accepted that the target of cutting emissions by 75% by 2030 was out of reach.",
      "But she told MSPs the government must act to chart a course reach net zero by 2045 at a pace and scale which was feasible, fair and just.",
      "The Heat in Buildings Bill was once described to me as \"game changing\" legislation designed to reduce the massive carbon footprint that comes from heating our homes.",
      "Our gas boilers are the main culprit; lots of individual devices inefficiently burning fossil fuels to create the heat.",
      "At least a million of them needed to be replaced by 2030 to meet the Scottish government's now abandoned interim climate change targets.",
      "The legislation would have meant anyone buying a home would have had to change to a green heating system \u2013 like a heat pump \u2013 within, say, two years of the sale being completed. The exact time frame had not been decided.",
      "But with the 2030 target now scrapped, and a much delayed energy strategy still not forthcoming, the pressure is off.",

      "Neither are the first to grumble about the machinery of government.",
      "More than 20 years ago, Sir Tony Blair gave a speech much of which Sir Keir could give today.",
      "\"Sometimes we can be so frightened of the process of accountability, we opt for inertia,\" Sir Tony said in 2004, adding that too often the civil service had acted as \"a shock absorber in order to maintain the status quo\".",
      "So claims about a lack of nimbleness and pace are not new.",

      "Sir Keir Starmer says the state has become \"overcautious\" and \"flabby\" and government has become bigger, but weaker.",
      "By weaker, he means a growing inability to make stuff happen and a big reason for that, he reckons, is the proliferation of arm's length bodies \u2013 taxpayer funded organisations with independence from the government and considerable power.",

      "The recent row about the Sentencing Council in England and Wales is seen as a case in point.",
      "And now, scrapping NHS England is, ministers will argue, the ultimate case study in scrapping unaccountable bureaucracy.",
      "Scale of challenge",
      "So what did Liz Truss argue after her time in government?",
      "She talked of the \"tyranny of the technocracy\", the \"power of the administrative state\" and argued that \"there is something rather undemocratic about this\".",
      "She said that \"Blair and Brown had imposed a web of legalistic architecture that added process and put more power in the hands of technocrats\", which granted is a point where you might think Truss and Starmer would depart and no doubt do in many instances.",
      "But strikingly, given that recent row about the Sentencing Council, when was it set up?",
      "In April 2010, when Gordon Brown was prime minister.",
      "\"For any challenge faced, for too long the answer has been more arm's length bodies, quangos and regulators which end up blocking the government,\" Sir Keir writes in the Daily Telegraph, without reference to any particular such body.",
      "It is also true that this new-ish government has itself created new arms-length bodies, such as GB Energy and Skills England.",
      "Perhaps it is human nature - that your own arm's length bodies don't feel as pernicious as ones dreamt up by a predecessor.",
      "Beyond the comparisons, the reason all this matters is the government is up against a pervasive sense that nothing works any more.",
      "Think the 8am scramble for an appointment with the doctor and the waiting lists for an operation for a start.",
      "Some senior Labour figures fret privately that their talk of \"missions\" and a \"Plan for Change\" might seem puny to many in comparison with the scale of that challenge.",
      "The prime minister said: \"Every pound that we spend, every regulation, every decision must deliver for working people. And I don't just mean efficiency...I mean something else which is allowing the state, the government, to operate what I call maximum power.\"",

      "Despite the government's hopes, the UK has not, in the end, been exempted from President Trump's 25% steel and aluminium tariffs.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said the UK will \"keep all options on the table\", but has not announced immediate retaliation.",
      "BBC Verify looks at how big the impact on the UK could be and what might happen next.",
      "Starmer says 'all options on table' on US tariffs",
      "Metal products",
      "The value of the UK's raw steel and aluminium exports to the US in 2024 was around \u00a3470m.",
      "But it's important to note that these latest US tariffs - taxes on imports - also cover products made with steel and aluminium, which covers everything from gym equipment, to furniture, to machinery.",
      "It's estimated by the Global Trade Alert think tank that the UK's exports of these products to the US in 2024 was around \u00a32.2bn.",
      "So the total annual value of UK exports affected would be around \u00a32.7bn.",
      "For context, the UK exported around \u00a358bn of goods to the US on an annual basis in 2024 - so the share of goods hit by these new Trump tariffs represents just under 5%.",
      "The UK hopes to conclude a free trade deal with the Trump administration, which could mean these tariffs being removed.",
      "But we have no way of knowing if - or how soon - such an agreement could be concluded.",
      "Trump has also threatened to impose reciprocal tariffs on all the United States' trading partners, including the UK, from next month.",
      "These are taxes on imports to the US which are set at a similar rate to taxes other countries put on goods they import from the US.",
      "And the White House has said that, in deciding what level to set them, it will take into account countries' Value Added Tax rates.",
      "The US government regards VAT as a tax that discriminates against US imports - even though it applies equally to imports and domestically-produced goods.",
      "The UK has a 20% standard VAT rate, which could potentially mean the UK being hit by a substantial reciprocal tariff from the US.",
      "While the UK is not yet retaliating, the European Union has already confirmed it plans to impose tariffs on 26bn euros (\u00a322bn) a year worth of goods imported from America.",
      "And the EU is targeting US goods including Bourbon whiskey, jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which are considered to be politically sensitive in America because of their iconic status and because of which US states some of them are  produced in.",
      "Notwithstanding the hope for a free trade deal, in the wake of any reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US, which are perceived to be unfair and punitive, the UK government could find itself under growing pressure to retaliate in a similar way to the EU.",
      "Why is Trump imposing tariffs?",
      "The US President has a long - and often shifting - list of justifications for imposing these import taxes.",
      "One is that he claims to want to restore fairness to America's trading relations with the rest of the world.",
      "Trump complains that some other countries have higher tariffs on the goods they import from the US, than the other way round.",
      "The US had an average external tariff of 3.3% in 2023.",
      "That was slightly lower than the UK's average tariff of 3.8%.",
      "It was also below the European Union's average tariff of 5% and China's average tariff of 7.5%.",
      "However, America's average tariff was considerably lower than those of some of its other trading partners such as India (17%) and South Korea (13.4%).",
      "Broadly speaking, it is legitimate for Trump to point out that some countries have a higher average tariff on imports than America does.",
      "Replacing income tax?",
      "Another justification for tariffs from the president is raising more tax revenue for the US government. At one stage during the presidential election campaign in 2024, he suggested that tariff revenue could entirely replace the federal income tax.",
      "This is not only implausible given the $3 trillion a year value of US imports and the $2 trillion a year raised by income tax - but it needs to be seen in the context of the fact that tariffs would push up US consumer prices.",
      "Trump also wants to put pressure on other countries to change some of their policies. This has been the explicit rationale for US tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with the White House saying it wants to pressure those countries to stamp out cross-border Fentanyl smuggling.",
      "Another key goal articulated by the president is wanting to encourage multinational manufacturing companies to invest and produce more in America to create domestic jobs.",
      "Some of these justifications are inconsistent.",
      "Tariffs cannot be a both a major permanent tax revenue raiser as well as a way to bring manufacturing back to America on a large scale as the latter implies imports - and therefore tariff revenues - slumping.",
      "Moreover, the vast majority of economists are also extremely sceptical about the likelihood of tariffs achieving many of these goals.",

      "Nicola Sturgeon remains the biggest name in Scottish politics.",
      "She was a player in UK politics in a way that neither of her successors could expect to be.",
      "That was partly drawn from her mandate - an extraordinary run of election wins that made her leader of the third placed party at Westminster.",
      "That gave her a voice in debates about Brexit and offered the UK media a political contrast with a succession of Conservative prime ministers, including Boris Johnson.",
      "She was also seen as a persistent threat to the continuation of the UK state, pushing the boundaries of devolution in pursuit of her ambition to hold another independence referendum.",
      "In the end, neither the forces of her personality or argument were able to bring that about.",
      "Her strategy collapsed when the UK Supreme Court ruled that any future vote must be agreed with the UK government.",
      "Subsequent talk of using a UK general election as a substitute referendum lacked credibility.",
      "This was a significant factor in what brought her leadership to a close, as was her focus on the politics of switching gender identity - ironically the subject of an opposition debate at Holyrood today.",
      "There were also the divisions in the SNP and the wider independence movement caused by the spectacular fallout Sturgeon had with her predecessor, Alex Salmond, when the Scottish government mishandled harassment complaints against him.",
      "Then there was her attempt to realign Scottish politics by forming a power-sharing partnership with the Greens to achieve political stability for the Scottish government.",
      "That controversial arrangement was discontinued by her immediate successor Humza Yousaf.",
      "What will be her legacy?",
      "She was the first minister who expanded early learning and childcare and used new welfare powers to introduce a weekly child payment unique to Scotland - policies she would regard as significant achievements.",
      "While opposition parties say they would maintain these benefits, financial watchdogs warn that the extent of health and social welfare spending in Scotland is unsustainable.",
      "All of this is part of the Sturgeon legacy to be debated as she counts down to her departure from the Scottish Parliament in just over a year.",
      "Nicola Sturgeon famously made decisions in a very tight circle and according to one adviser her decision-making group became ever smaller.",
      "By the end, this source said she was operating in \"a circle of one\".",
      "It was ultimately her decision to leave high office just as it is now hers to leave frontline politics altogether.",
      "As she has noted herself in the past, Nicola Sturgeon is a public figure loved and loathed in almost equal measure but there can be few who would doubt that politics will be a duller place without her presence."

      "Rachel Reeves has previously ruled out further tax rises, but faces difficult choices because of the performance of the UK economy and world events.",
      "What is the Spring Statement and when is it?",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors the government's spending plans and performance, will publish its forecast on the UK economy on Wednesday 26 March.",
      "It will also provide estimates on the cost of living for households and whether it thinks the government will stick to its self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending.",
      "Reeves will present the watchdog's main findings to Parliament, and alongside this will make her Spring Statement on the economy.",
      "After she has spoken, the opposition, likely to be either Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch or shadow chancellor Mel Stride, will respond.",
      "What is the chancellor expected to announce?",
      "Reeves has committed to one major economic event - the Budget - each year, to \"give families and businesses stability and certainty on tax and spending changes\".",
      "That means no big policy announcements are expected on 26 March, but that's not stopping them being made beforehand.",
      "With the economy seen to be underperforming and global factors, such as US trade tariffs, indirectly impacting the UK, there is growing speculation over whether the chancellor will break her self-imposed rules on borrowing.",
      "The OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the \u00a39.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029-30 financial year has been wiped out.",
      "Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\". Her two main rules are:",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spendingTo get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending",
      "To get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Ahead of the Spring Statement, the Treasury has drafted plans for several billion pounds of spending cuts.",
      "It is understood welfare spending is in the firing line, but other government departments will also see budgets pruned.",

      "Possible other announcements that are being reported include:",
      "Reducing the \u00a320,000 tax-free annual limit in cash ISAs, to encourage more people to invest their savings in stocks and shares Confirming details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the prime minister's announcement that UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",

      "Government sources have been keen to state that this event is not a major one because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "A debateable tax hiking policy could be announced, however, if Reeves decides to extend the freeze on the thresholds at which people start to pay different rates of income tax.",
      "The policy is known as a hidden tax rise or stealth tax, as it takes effect over time as people are dragged into paying more tax as their pay goes up, without the tax rate rising at all.",
      "Thresholds were frozen by the previous Conservative government until April 2028, but the chancellor could decide to extend the freeze beyond this to raise about \u00a37bn a year, according to consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics and investment bank Citi.",
      "Reeves decided not to extend the threshold freeze in her first Budget, arguing that doing so \"would hurt working people\" and \"take more money out of their payslips\".",
      "Whether any other spending cuts are announced in the Spring Statement or in the Spending Review in June, or even delayed until the next Budget, remains to be seen.",
      "How is the UK economy doing?",
      "Recent figures show UK economic growth has been sluggish - not shrinking, but not growing as desired.",
      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, according to the latest official figures.",
      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target, and is forecast to go higher. Inflation could dictate whether interest rates are lowered further from their current 4.5%.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump further in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "Pressure has also increased on the chancellor's tax and spending plans after a surplus in government finances missed official forecasts, prompting speculation from economists that she could break her fiscal rules as things stand.",
      "Borrowing costs for the UK surged in January in part due to concerns over the UK's economic outlook, threatening Reeves's economic plans. The costs have since fallen back but remain higher than this time last year.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, despite tariffs not directly targeting the UK, would lower growth and raise inflation."

    "summary": "The PM seizes the spotlight as Trump upends the world order - but he faces serious challenges in the UK.",
    "story": [
      "\"Trump may be the best thing to happen to Starmer,\" says a diplomat, suggesting the brash property tycoon busy upending the world order might be just what the strait-laced prime minister - who's been dragging in the polls - needs.",
      "One of Labour's business backers calls it \"the PM's finest hour\" - a Remainer leader putting Britain at the heart of international action as Trump rattles the Western world's cage.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer has certainly been incredibly visible \u2013 in the White House, leading a European summit at Lancaster House last weekend, hugging Zelensky, plotting a peacekeeping path with Macron.",
      "It's hard for the Conservatives and other opponents to compete with the prime minister's international moves dominating the news.",
      "Moments of crisis like the one we're living through are often when the public tunes into politics and looks to their leaders. With a shaky global situation, does No 10 look more solid than before?",
      "Some of his colleagues are certain. One government source tells me all the international activity is \"almost Blair-esque\", or even a moment like Thatcher and the Falklands which enabled the 80s Conservative prime minister to burnish her reputation and win successive election victories.",
      "Another minister suggests other leaders \"get their knickers in a twist\" publicly reacting to Trump's unpredictable comments and actions - \"but Keir has spent his whole career dealing with extreme circumstances. What he is able to do is get people to focus on the things that really matter.\"",
      "But impressive-looking diplomacy doesn't mean the UK is getting what it wants \u2013 missiles are still falling, overnight again in Donetsk and Kharkhiv. Donald Trump's commitment to guaranteeing Ukraine's security, even NATO's future, is shaky too.",
      "So let's take a calm look. Polling suggests there has been a nudge upwards for Sir Keir's personal ratings and for Labour, after a dreadful start in office and a steep, fast drop in the polls.",
      "His government would not be the first to be swept away by the intensity and glamour of global diplomacy which, however difficult or worthy, doesn't necessarily translate into significant brownie points at home.",
      "Perhaps in these wild times, we're seeing the prime minister carve out a role as \"reassurer in chief\". In political circles it's long been common to find criticisms of Sir Keir Starmer for, frankly, being a bit dull, and not willing to play the minute-by-minute political game. But with Trump in the White House stoking drama the PM's colleagues believe his steadiness has become an asset.",
      "And he's shown willingness to take action \u2013 increasing defence spending, albeit after months of pressure, getting European leaders together and drawing up military plans for after a peace deal. A senior government source says: \"The global crisis means people looking at us again, and the government has been making an argument that people are responding to: that we have got their backs.\"",
      "But aligning yourself with an American president doesn't always work out. Tony Blair's chinos weren't the only thing that became uncomfortable about his relationship with George W Bush.",
      "So while there's evidence the public are looking at Sir Keir a touch more favourably since his White House trip, as one union leader warns, \"for it to count he has to show the same mojo at home\".",
      "Take the row over sentencing this week. Or forthcoming arguments over cutting welfare, which ministers have been falling over themselves to soften the ground for.",
      "But overshadowing everything, priority number one: the grisly state of the economy and getting it to grow.",
      "In around a fortnight Rachel Reeves will be on her feet in Parliament, probably announcing cuts to public spending running to billions. Government sources point to some better statistics on wages, and cuts to interest rates, but Reeves is under enormous pressure to explain how the economy is going to escape the doldrums it has been stuck in for ages.",
      "All the Kodak moments, and grip and grins with international leaders in the world won't change that. The PM \"can walk and talk at the same\" time, one ally says. But there are, they acknowledge, \"only so many hours in the day\".",
      "Helping Ukraine against Putin's Russia has a clear moral story the prime minister finds easy to tell, and compelling to try to shape. In contrast, \"how do you bring prosperity to the regions? That's a real puzzle.\"",
      "In the next few days, starting with the PM's right-hand man Pat McFadden in the studio tomorrow, you will see the government try to kick up the pace of what is happening at home. First up - perhaps not a box-office hit - they'll be looking at making the Whitehall machine work better, including making it easier to get rid of civil servants.",
      "Ministers tell me Downing Street is being run more effectively than before Christmas and has a clearer sense of direction, after early embarrassment over being far less prepared than promised.",
      "Sir Keir chairs regular meetings with individual cabinet ministers in charge of the government's \"missions\". I'm told he \"cross-examines\" them and their officials - and if their answers aren't up to snuff, they get called in for another meeting. \"He is a very nice man, but he is a hard man too,\" one of them confides.",
      "As well as slimming down parts of the civil service, there'll be more on the government's plans to cut billions off the welfare bill. Labour will argue it's for good reason, to help people stuck on benefits - while critics will say it's a way for the government to save money off the backs of some of the most vulnerable people in the country.",
      "On Thursday, the prime minister is expected to make his own speech in an attempt to weave it all together into a grand narrative about safety abroad and at home. One government source said the last few weeks had galvanised Sir Keir's thinking on this: when things are uncertain on the international stage, \"everything feels a bit wobbly\" and domestic security is amplified: you look around and feel your job isn't secure, your street isn't safe.",
      "This thinking has been a long time coming. \"Security\" was a word and concept used by Reeves and Sir Keir in opposition - but recently he's been making a more ideological argument than those close to him are used to hearing.",
      "As well as making the case that what happens around the world is inextricably linked to what happens at home, he holds that the old international consensus among Western leaders has failed for millions of voters.",
      "That argument was crystallised into a long memo he sent to his cabinet ministers and political team in the middle of February. In it he wrote: \"The government's challenge was to shape this new era. Not to defend institutions that are broken or old ideas that have failed, but to be the voice of working people who more than anything want security in their lives, and a country that is on the up again.\"",
      "He wrote that politicians were wrong to think markets had solutions for almost everything. \"We were cowed by the market - we came to act as if it always knew best and the state should sit it out.\"",
      "He also said governments had failed on immigration, failed to understand the public's concerns and also - to tell the truth. \"We ended up treating all immigration as an untrammelled good. Somehow, politics ended up being too scared to say what is obvious - that some people are genuine refugees and some aren't; that people coming here to work can be a positive, but that an island nation needs to control its borders.\"",
      "Some extracts from the letter have been revealed before. But what is notable, reading the whole document, is the prime minister closes his letter to colleagues with a call to provide \"security\" for the country, alongside renewing public services. He writes: \"Now is our moment to be bigger and bolder - to put pedal on metal on wholescale reform and change our politics and our country. Security and renewal are our twin tasks - we must now deliver them.\"",
      "You'll hear more of that argument from ministers in the coming days - we had a glimpse of it in the studio last Sunday morning too.",
      "The profound uncertainty Donald Trump's arrival in the White House has given the prime minister a moment to step into the spotlight on the world stage.",
      "And his government is now much more overtly weaving an argument that working to establish security round the world is fundamentally connected to sorting out security at home.",
      "There is a reason why, fresh from all the diplomatic handshakes, Sir Keir was back in the more familiar hi-vis and hard hat announcing defence jobs in Belfast.",
      "No 10 wants you to see and believe that crisis abroad can mean opportunity at home. This spasm in global security has given a prime minister sometimes accused of being a blank page a clearer story to tell.",
      "But in the end, for any prime minister, it is what happens on home turf, not foreign adventures that matter the most. A sceptical public will take a lot of convincing to believe government can improve their situation \u2013 make it easier to manage the bills, buy a house, or for their kids to find a decent job.",
      "As as a senior figure in the Labour movement concludes, \"he likes the statesman role but the bottom line is, change in people's lives will be the decider.\"",

    "story": [
      "Early-rising UK stargazers are in for a celestial treat on Friday as a lunar eclipse takes place just before dawn.",
      "For most of the UK the eclipse will be partial as the Earth's shadow will not cover all of the Moon. For some far western regions, and across the Americas, the eclipse will be total, weather permitting",
      "As the Moon moves into Earth's shadow, it will gradually darken before turning a dusky red, resulting in a stunning \"blood moon\".",
      "The last total lunar eclipse in the UK occurred in 2022.",
      "When is the lunar eclipse?",
      "The penumbral phase (when the Moon first enters Earth's outer shadow) began at 03:57 on Friday.",
      "The partial eclipse - when the Moon starts moving into the darker part of Earth's shadow - began at 05:09.",
      "Lunar eclipses are visible from anywhere on Earth where the Moon is above the horizon at the time.",
      "At 06:58 the eclipse will reach its true maximum; however, in almost all of the UK, the Moon will have already set below the horizon, so we won't be able to see this.",
      "Very western areas like the Scottish highlands, west Cornwall and the very western parts of Northern Ireland may get a brief glimpse of total eclipse.",
      "For those in North America, most of South America, and western Greenland, the eclipse will be total.",
      "\"Even if you have to get up super early to see it, I would definitely recommend that you try because seeing it in real life is really, really cool,\" says Imo Bell, astronomer at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.",
      "What is a lunar eclipse and a blood moon?",
      "A lunar eclipse happens when Earth moves directly between the Sun and the Moon, blocking sunlight and casting a shadow on the Moon's surface.",
      "There are three main types:",
      "Total lunar eclipse \u2013 The entire Moon moves into Earth's shadow and turns red.",
      "Total lunar eclipse \u2013 The entire Moon moves into Earth's shadow and turns red.",

      "Penumbral lunar eclipse \u2013 A subtle event where the Moon passes through Earth's outer shadow, causing a slight dimming.",
      "People sometimes refer to a lunar eclipse as a \"blood moon\" because of the way the Moon can turn a deep, coppery red during the eclipse.",
      "This is caused by a process known as \"Rayleigh scattering\" which also makes the sky blue and our sunsets red. It scatters more of the shorter blue wavelength light, allowing the longer red wavelength light to remain visible.",
      "During a lunar eclipse, all of the light shining onto the Moon has come through Earth's atmosphere. It's as if every sunrise and sunset in the world is projected onto the lunar surface.",
      "How to see it?",
      "To get the best view of the eclipse, head to a clear, dark location.",
      "\"My top tip would be to make sure you have a good view of the western horizon, because the Moon will be in the west and it will be setting towards the western horizon,\" advises Imo Bell of the Royal Observatory.",
      "Another top tip from Imo: it'll be dark so bring a light to help get around, but use a red torch if you can get hold of one. It helps keep your eyes adjusted to the dark.",
      "Also, of course, check the weather forecast.",
      "\"Even though some people might say it's not that unusual to get a lunar eclipse, as we can see one every few years, next time it comes around, it might be cloudy. So, if you can, definitely do get out and try and have a look,\" said Imo.",
      "The next lunar eclipse visible in the UK will be on 7 September 2025.",
      "Will the skies be clear enough to see it?",
      "We've seen a change to colder more unsettled weather and northerly winds over recent days.",
      "A weather front sank south overnight on Thursday into the early hours of Friday, bringing cloud, rain or hill snow to northern parts of the UK and obscuring the view of the sky for some.",
      "However, there is a chance of the skies being clear enough to view the partial eclipse early on Friday, especially in the north of Northern Ireland and Scotland as well as the south of England and Wales.",

      "Farmers may turn their backs on environmental work for more intensive food production after the government suddenly closed a green funding scheme, the National Farmers' Union (NFU) has warned.",
      "The Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI), which pays farmers in England to manage land to protect soil, restore hedgerows and boost nature recovery, was a key part of the post-Brexit payment scheme that replaced EU subsidies.",
      "The government said SFI had been a success, with 37,000 funding agreements agreed, but it would not accept any new applications. No replacement has been announced.",
      "Tom Bradshaw, NFU president, said that it was \"another shattering blow to English farms\".",
      "Mr Bradshaw said the sudden closure would force farmers to decide \"whether to turn their backs on environmental work and just farm as hard as they can to survive\".",
      "Organic arable farmer Anna Biesty, who has a 300-hectare farm on the north Norfolk coast, said she was planning to apply for SFI funding and its closure means she now faces a \u00a3140,000 shortfall in her future income.",

      "The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) announced the closure of SFI, which was launched in 2022, with little warning.",

      "The 37,000 agreements signed for SFI funding had meant all the scheme's budget had been allocated and no more new applications could be accepted.",
      "In total, under the SFI scheme, \u00a31.05bn has been paid out or is contractually committed to farmers in current agreements or applications for funding since 2024.",
      "SFI is the largest part of Elms, which is the system of farm payments set up to replace EU subsidies with the idea that \"public goods\", like restoring and creating wildlife habitats, would be delivered by farmers in return for public money.",
      "The government said it was still committed to paying \u00a35bn over two years for such sustainable farming and nature recovery work.",
      "'Biggest budget'",
      "It added that a \"new and improved\" SFI, which will have a capped budget, will be set up but its details will not be announced until later in the year.",
      "Daniel Zeichner, minister for food security and rural affairs, said: \"This government is proud to have set the biggest budget for sustainable food produce in history.",
      "\"More farmers are now in schemes and more money is being spent through them than ever before. That is true today and will remain true tomorrow.\"",
      "But Mr Bradshaw said the closure of the current SFI scheme had \"slammed shut\" the door for funding for thousands of farmers.",
      "He said the closure was \"delivered yet again with no warning, no understanding of the industry and a complete lack of compassion or care\".",
      "Victoria Vyvyan, the president of the Country Land and Business Association (CLA), which represents thousands of rural landowners, said that closing the scheme was the \"most cruel\" betrayal.",
      "She added that the decision \"actively harms nature. It actively harms the environment. And, with war once again raging in Europe, to actively harm our food production is reckless beyond belief\".",
      "Martin Lines, chief executive of the Nature Friendly Farming Network (NFFN), said the gap before a new SFI scheme is in place would leave some farmers \"in a really difficult financial position\".",

      "Prof Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds said: \"The priority, I imagine, for the crews trying to contain the damage, will be to extinguish the fires and keep vessels afloat. This will reduce the quantity of chemicals entering the water and the risk for wildlife downstream.\"",
      "The fire that broke out following the crash will have helped to burn off some of the jet fuel but testing kits are being set to the site to confirm there is no residue remaining.",
      "Frode Vikeb\u00f8, research manager at the Institute of Marine Research said that the UK government will be modelling the spread of any contaminants at sea, considering ocean circulation and weather conditions, as part of \"standard procedure\".",
      "In terms of mitigation, Dr Karen Purnell, former director of ITOPF - which advises governments on maritime pollution, said the first approach would be to let the jet fuel \"dissipate naturally where possible and avoiding deliberate containment.\"",
      "If any jet fuel did make it to shore, she said: \"Flushing the shoreline to remobilise the fuel and perhaps directing it into absorbent booms or mats for later disposal could be an option.\" But she said the approach would differ depending on the different types of environment, for example whether there were wetlands.",

    "title": "The unexpected knock-on effect of Trump's minerals 'deal of the century'",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30mjedjzgpo",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Mar 2025 01:26:54 GMT",
    "summary": "The president once derided attempts to develop new green technology as a \"green new scam\" - but his deal could help boost the US's potential in the sector",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump's return to the White House is a \"major blow to global climate action\". So said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief, after he was elected in November.",
      "Since taking office, Trump has withdrawn the US from what is considered the most important global climate pact, the Paris Climate Agreement. He has also reportedly prevented US scientists from participating in international climate research and removed national electric vehicle targets.",
      "Plus, he derided his predecessor's attempts to develop new green technology a \"green new scam\".",
      "And yet despite his history on the issue of climate, Trump has been eager to make a deal with the Ukrainian president on critical minerals. He has also taken a strong interest in Greenland and Canada \u2013 both nations rich in critical minerals.",
      "Critical mineral procurement has been a major focus for Trump since he took office. These minerals are crucial in industries including aerospace and defence, but intriguingly, they have another major use too - to manufacture green technology.",
      "So, could Trump's focus on obtaining these minerals have a knock-on effect, and help unlock the US's potential in the green technology sector?",
      "The Elon Musk effect?",
      "Trump's right-hand man understands more than most the importance of critical minerals in the green transition. Space X and Tesla \u2013 the companies Elon Musk leads - rely heavily on critical minerals like graphite (in electric vehicles), lithium (in batteries) and nickel (in rockets).",
      "Elizabeth Holley, an associate professor of mining engineering at Colorado School of Mines, explains that each nation has its own list of critical minerals, but they are generally made up of rare earths and other metals like lithium.",
      "She says demand is booming - in 2023, demand for lithium grew by 30%. This is being driven mostly by the rapid growth in the clean energy and electric vehicle sectors.",
      "Within two decades, they will make up almost 90% of the demand for lithium, 70% of the demand for cobalt, and 40% for rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Such has been Musk's concern with getting hold of some of these minerals that three years ago he tweeted: \"Price of lithium has gone to insane levels! Tesla might actually have to get into the mining & refining directly at scale, unless costs improve.\"",
      "He went on to write that there is no shortage of the element, but the pace of extraction is slow.",
      "The US position in the global race",
      "The weakness of the US position in rare earths and critical minerals (such as cobalt and nickel) was addressed in a report published by a US Government Select Committee in December 2023. It said: \"The United States must rethink its policy approach to critical mineral and rare earth element supply chains because of the risks posed by our current dependence on the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Failure to do so, it warned, could cause \"defense production to grind to a halt and choke off manufacturing of other advanced technologies\".",
      "China's dominance in the market has come from its early recognition of the economic opportunities that green technology offers.",
      "\"China made a decision about 10 years ago about where the trend was going and has strategically pursued the development of not just renewables but also electric vehicles and now dominates the market,\" says Bob Ward, policy director at The London School of Economics (LSE) Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.",
      "Daisy Jennings-Gray, head of prices at price reporting agency Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, explains that they are critical minerals because they are geologically restricted. \"You cannot guarantee you will have economically recoverable reserves in every country.\"",
      "Some minerals like lithium are abundant on Earth, but often they are located in difficult to reach places, so the logistics of a mining project can be very expensive. In other cases, there is dependency on one country that produces a large share of global supply \u2013 like cobalt from the the Democratic Republic of Congo. This means that if there is a natural disaster or political unrest it has an impact on the price, says Ms Jennings-Gray.",
      "China has managed to shore up supply by investing heavily in Africa and South America, but where it really has a stronghold on the market is in processing (or the separation of the mineral from other elements in the rock).",
      "\"China accounts for 60% of global rare earth production but processes nearly 90% - [it] is dominant on this stage,\" says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC.",
      "She says the country understands how important this is in economic trade - a few days after Trump introduced tariffs on China its government hit back by imposing export controls on more than 20 critical minerals including graphite and tungsten.",
      "What is motivating Trump is a fear of being at a disadvantage, argues Christopher Knittel, a professor of applied economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).",
      "\"I think what is driving this is because China is the dominant player on the processing side,\" he says. \"It is that processing stage, which is the high-margin stage of the business, so China is making a lot of money.\"",
      "As he puts it, it is a \"happy coincidence\" that this could end up supporting green technology.",
      "The key question, though, is whether the US is too late to fully capitalise on the sector.",
      "A stark warning for the US",
      "In the early days, the green transition was \"framed as a burden\" for countries, according to LSE's Bob Ward.",
      "The Biden administration was highly supportive of green technology industries through its introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022, which offers tax credits, loans and other incentives to technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, from battery technologies for electric vehicles to solar panels.",
      "By August 2024, it was estimated to have brought $493bn (\u00a3382bn) of investment to US green industry, according to the think tank Clean Investment Monitor.",
      "And yet little work was done to support upstream processes like obtaining critical minerals, says Ms Gray from Benchmark Intelligence. Instead, the Biden administration focused heavily on downstream manufacturing - the process of getting products from the manufacturer to the end consumer.",
      "But Trump's recent moves to procure these critical minerals suggest a focus on the upstream process may now be happening.",
      "\"The IRA put a lot of legislation in places to limit trade and supply only from friendly nations,\" explains Ms Gray.",
      "\"Trump is changing tack and looking at securing critical minerals agreements that owes something to the US.\"",
      "Whispers of another executive order",
      "There could be further moves from Trump coming down the line. Those working in the sector say whispers in the corridors of the White House suggest that he may be about to pass a \"Critical Minerals Executive Order\", which could funnel further investment into this objective.",
      "The exact details that may be included in the executive order remain unclear, but experts knowledgeable with the issue have said it may include measures to accelerate mining in the US, including fast tracking permits and investment to construct processing plants.",
      "Although work may now be under way to secure these minerals, Prof Willy Shih of Harvard Business School thinks that the US administration lacks understanding of the technical complexity of establishing mineral supply chains, and emphasises the time commitment required. \"If you want to build a new mine and processing facility, it might take you 10 years.\"",
      "As a policy of his predecessor, and one that is so obviously pro-climate action, Trump has been vocally opposed to maintaining the IRA. But its success in red states mean that many Republican senators have been trying to convince him to keep it in some form in his proposed \"big, beautiful bill\" - the plan to pile all of Trump's main policy goals into one mega-bill - due to be revealed later this month.",
      "Analysis by the Clean Investment Monitor shows in the last 18 months Republican-held states had received 77% of the investment.",
      "MIT's Dr Knittel says for states like Georgia, which has become part of what is now known as the \"battery belt\" following a boom in battery production following IRA support, these tax credits are crucial for these industries to survive.",
      "He adds that failure to do so poses a real political threat for US representatives who are up for re-election in less than two years.",
      "If Trump loses even just one seat to the Democrats in the 2026 mid-terms, then he loses the house majority - limiting his ability to pass key pieces of legislation.",
      "Carl Fleming was an advisor to former President Biden's Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Advisory Committee and is a partner at law firm McDermott, Will & Emery, advising clients in the clean tech and energy space. He says that despite the uncertainty, investors remain confident. \"In the last month, my practice has been busier than ever, and this is since quadrupling last year following the IRA.\"",
      "He also believes that there is a recognition of the need to maintain parts of the IRA \u2013 although this may be alongside expansion of some fossil fuels. \"If you are really trying to be 'America First' and energy secure, you want to pull on all your levers. Keep solar and keep battery storage going and add more natural gas to release America's energy prowess.\"",
      "But the uncertainty of the US position is little consolation for its absence on the international climate stage, says LSE's Bob Ward. \"When the Americans are on the ball it helps to move people in the right direction and that's how we got the Paris Climate Agreement.\"",
      "For those in the climate space, Trump is certainly not an environmentalist. What's clear is he is not concerned with making his legacy an environmental one but an economic one - though he could achieve the former if he can be convinced it will boost the economy.",

      "The site, which is the most popular in the UK among young gamers aged eight to 12, has been dogged by claims of some children being exposed to explicit or harmful content through its games, alongside multiple reported allegations of bullying and grooming.",

      "When asked what his message is to parents who don't want their children on the platform, Mr Baszucki said: \"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox.\"",
      "\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" he told BBC News in an exclusive interview.",
      "Responding to the interview, Mumsnet boss Justine Roberts said parents on the forum had spoken of how they struggled to manage their children's use of Roblox.",

      "When we showed the Roblox boss these findings, he argued that our example highlighted the comparative safety of Roblox: that people felt they had to take content which might breach Roblox's rules to other platforms.",
      "\"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" Mr Baszucki says.",
      "He admits there is a delicate balance between encouraging friendships between young people, and blocking opportunities for them come to harm, but says he is confident Roblox can manage both.",
      "We also put to him some Roblox game titles that the BBC has discovered were recommended by the platform to an 11 year-old recently, including:",
      "'Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP''Special Forces Simulator'''Squid Game''Shoot down planes\u2026because why not?'",
      "'Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP'",

      "\"One thing that's really important for the way we do things here, is it's not just on the title of the experience, it's literally on the content of the experience as well,\" he says.",

      "How can you keep your child safe online?",
      "Plan to make phone use safer for teens watered down",
      "Mr Baszucki founded the platform with Eric Cassel in 2004 and released it to the public in 2006 \u2013 a year before the first Apple iPhone appeared, heralding the start of the smartphone era.",
      "Mr Baszucki describes his younger self as \"less of a gamer, and more of an engineer\", and the pair's first company was an education software provider called Knowledge Revolution. But they soon noticed that kids weren't only using the product to do their homework.",
      "\"They wanted to play and build stuff. They were making houses or ships or scenery, and they wanted to jump in, and all of that learning was the germination of Roblox,\" he says.",
      "The name Roblox was a mash-up of the words \"robot\" and blocks\" \u2013 and it stuck. The platform grew quickly in popularity \u2013 and there were also early warning signs of its future issues.",
      "Mr Cassel noticed some players \"starting to act out\" and not always behaving in a \"civilised\" way a couple of months after it launched, recalls Mr Baszucki.",
      "He says the roots of building a \"trust and safety system\" therefore began \"very, very early\" and that in those earlier days there were four people acting as safety moderators.",
      "\"It kind of is what launched this safety civility foundation,\" he adds.",
      "But despite attracting decent numbers, it was a year later, when the firm launched its digital currency Robux, that it really started to make money.",
      "Players buy Robux and use it to purchase accessories and unlock content. Content creators now get 70% of the fee, and the store operates on dynamic pricing, meaning popular items cost more.",
      "Mr Baszucki says there was some initial resistance among the leadership team about Roblox becoming more than a hobby for its players, with the introduction of a digital economy.",
      "Robux stayed, and the firm is now worth $41bn (\u00a331bn).",
      "Its share price has fluctuated since it went public in 2021, but overall Roblox shares are worth about one third more than they were six months ago, at the time of writing. Like many big tech firms its value peaked during Covid, when lockdowns meant millions of people were indoors.",
      "Mr Baszucki compares his experience of building Roblox with how Walt Disney may have felt about his creations.",
      "He describes his job as \"a little like having the opportunity he had a long time ago when he was designing the Magic Kingdom\", and is focused on Roblox's ongoing evolution into a Metaverse-style experience where people go about their daily lives in a virtual world, in avatar form.",
      "They have also been public in their ambitions to eventually attract 10% of the world's gamers.",
      "Asked to describe Roblox in three words, he replies: \"The future of communication.\"",

      "Deena Ghazarian had only been in business for a year when the trade policies of President Donald Trump's first term of office sent her company into a tailspin.",
      "It was 2019 and her California-based firm, Austere, had just agreed to supply several big US retailers with its high-end audio and video accessories that are largely manufactured in China.",
      "Then Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China, and overnight Deena found herself paying a 25% surcharge on every cable and component she imported \u2013 up from zero previously.",
      "She was forced to absorb the costs and for a while thought she would go bust.",
      "\"I literally thought I am going to start and end a business in less than a year,\" she says. \"I had spent all this time, money and effort, and to have something like this blindside you was shocking.\"",
      "The firm pulled through, but like numerous other US businesses it now finds itself in a strikingly similar situation.",
      "Since returning to office in January, Mr Trump has raised tariffs on all goods imported from China by 20%, and put taxes of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay some of them until April.",
      "The president says he wants to force these countries to do more to stop flows of illegal drugs and migrants into America, to bring more manufacturing back to the US, and to address what he sees as unfair trade imbalances.",
      "But the duties are much broader in scope than last time, when they were phased in gradually and many products were granted exemptions.",
      "Goods like smartphones, desktop computers and tablets are now incurring tariffs for the first time, while taxes on others have climbed higher.",
      "\"US importers have to pay these taxes not the exporters,\" says Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), a North American trade body that represents more than 1,200 tech firms.",
      "\"It's American businesses and consumers who will suffer.\"",
      "Businesses like Ms Ghazarian's are particularly exposed. China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (\u00a3112bn) in 2023, according to official data.",
      "Meanwhile, 87% of US video game console imports came from China that year, 78% of smartphones, 79% of laptops and tablets, and two-thirds of monitors, says the CTA.",
      "Stocks slide as Trump warns of US economy 'transition'",
      "'I will have to raise prices by 10%' - toymakers warn of tariff pain",
      "China retaliates against US tariffs - but it also wants to talk",
      "While many American companies like Austere have diversified their supply chains away from China since Mr Trump's first term, countries such as Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam still do not offer the same manufacturing capabilities and expertise.",
      "At the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.",
      "\"Yes, Apple now makes some iPhones in India and [the Taiwanese chipmaker] TSMC has been diversifying to Arizona,\" says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC.",
      "\"But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop.\"",
      "Research suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.",
      "In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she may have to raise her prices this year, but worries it could backfire. \"There is a price point where the customer is satisfied with the value of goods provided.",
      "\"The moment I shift above that I start to lose customers. High inflation has squeezed Americans.\"",
      "During Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.",
      "Insiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020.",
      "Fears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.",
      "For the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute.",
      "He plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.",
      "There is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she is worried but at least she's prepared this time. Like many other US business-owners she bulk-ordered extra inventory before Mr Trump took office, and is storing it in her east coast warehouse.",
      "She hopes that will get the company through the next year until it can \"pivot\" again.",
      "\"That might mean finding a more cost-effective way to produce the product or doing something completely different. It's frustrating I have to focus on survival rather than growing my business.\"",

      "\"As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products, and we never will,\" a spokesperson told the BBC.",
      "Later in February the row escalated, as Apple announced it was pulling ADP in the UK.",
      "Shortly after that, the BBC learnt Apple was taking legal action by appealing to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal to try to overturn the government's demand.",
      "On its website, the Tribunal lists a hearing to be held before its president Lord Justice Singh on Friday afternoon.",
      "The listing makes no mention of Apple or the government, nor has the Tribunal confirmed if they are the parties involved - however a source familiar with the matter has indicated that is the case, as was first reported by Computer Weekly.",
      "In the statement it issued in February, Apple said it regretted the action it felt it had been forced to take.",
      "\"Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end-encryption is more urgent than ever before,\" it said.",
      "\"Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in future in the UK.\"",
      "In a previous statement, a Home Office spokesperson said: \"The UK has a longstanding position of protecting our citizens from the very worst crimes, such as child sex abuse and terrorism, at the same time as protecting people's privacy.",
      "\"The UK has robust safeguards and independent oversight to protect privacy and privacy is only impacted on an exceptional basis, in relation to the most serious crimes and only when it is necessary and proportionate to do so.\""

      "Shipments of Apple Watches fell by 19% in that period, Counterpoint says.",
      "It blames the slump on a lack of new features in Apple's latest devices, and the fact a rumoured high-end Ultra 3 model never materialised.",
      "\"The biggest driver of the decline was North America, where the absence of the Ultra 3 and minimal feature upgrades in the S10 lineup led consumers to hold back purchases,\" said Counterpoint senior research analyst Anshika Jain.",
      "Apple was also hit with sales and import bans in the US in late 2023 and early 2024 over a disputed patent regarding blood oxygen level monitoring - which Ms Jain says also contributed to lower sales figures in the first half of 2024.",
      "It retained 22% of market share in the final three months of 2024, down from 25% a year earlier.",
      "\"We've been through a period where the smartwatch has gone from being a new and exciting gadget, to something now that's stabilising - the feature set isn't changing very dramatically year over year,\" said Leo Gebbie, principal analyst at CCS Insight.",

      "Sales in China also grew from 19% of the market to 25% in the year from the last quarter of 2023.",
      "This was the first time it recorded more smartwatch sales than India or North America, according to Counterpoint.",
      "The Chinese manufacturers also appeared to tap into another trend - the growing popularity of smartwatches for children, the only segment of the market to grow in 2024.",
      "Imoo, known in China as \"Little Genius\", specialises in children's smart watches and saw a 22% rise in shipments.",
      "\"The kids' smart watch segment is gaining traction as parents are concerned for their children's safety, and they desire to track and stay constantly connected with their children,\" Counterpoint's Balbir Singh said.",

      "Its Smart Band activity trackers sell for a fraction of the price of rivals made by Apple and Samsung.",
      "\"We're seeing the large consumer electronics players like Apple and Samsung really just look to drive a way higher margin and not engage in the price war,\" said Mr Gebbie.",
      "\"Xiaomi has done a really good job of selling devices, particularly in regions like southern and eastern Europe where that greater affordability tends to resonate a lot more strongly with customers.\"",
      "Another large contributor to the global sales drop was India, which fell from 30% of the market to 23%.",
      "He said this was partly because of a \"bubble\" in ultra-cheap devices from Indian manufacturers which has now burst.",
      "\"We read and saw a lot in terms of complaints about the quality of devices, with people being unhappy with them,\" he said.",

      "So the engineering challenge is how to make more, for less. \"This was our Mission Impossible,\" Mr Tang said. His company found that the robotic arm used to move chess pieces was hugely expensive to produce and would drive the price up to around $40,000.",
      "So, they tried using AI to help do the work of engineers and enhance the manufacturing process. Mr Tang claims that has driven the cost down to $1,000.",
      "\"This is innovation,\" he says. \"Artificial engineering is now integrated into the manufacturing process.\"",

    "story": [
      "Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa has signed a constitutional declaration covering a five-year transitional period, three months after his Islamist group led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad.",
      "The document says Islam is the religion of the president, as the previous constitution did, and Islamic jurisprudence is \"the main source of legislation\", rather than \"a main source\", according to the drafting committee.",
      "It also enshrines separation of powers and judicial independence, and guarantees women's rights, freedom of expression and media freedom.",
      "\"We hope it will be a new history for Syria, where we replace oppression with justice,\" Sharaa said.",
      "UN special envoy Geir Pedersen said he welcomed the \"moves towards restoring the rule of law\" and noted that \"this development potentially fills an important legal vacuum\".",
      "But the Kurdish-led administration in north-eastern Syria criticised the constitutional declaration, saying it \"contradicts the reality of Syria and its diversity\".",
      "Whole families dead in recent Syria violence, says UN",
      "Kurdish-led SDF agrees to integrate with Syrian government forces",
      "Syrian bloodshed heaps pressure on Sharaa and exposes deep fractures",
      "In January, rebel military commanders named Sharaa president for the transitional period, cancelled the Assad-era 2012 constitution, and dissolved the former regime's parliament, army and security agencies.",
      "Only 10 days ago, Sharaa announced the formation of the seven-member committee to draft the constitutional declaration, which he said would serve as \"the legal framework regulating the transitional phase\".",
      "A member of the committee, Abdul Hamid al-Awak, a constitutional law expert who teaches at a Turkish university, told a news conference on Thursday that the declaration aimed to \"create a balance between a security society and rights and freedoms\".",
      "He said it stipulated \"absolute separation of powers\", pointing to Assad's \"encroachment\" on other branches of government during his 24-year rule.",
      "The president would have executive authority during the transitional period, he said, but would have only one \"exceptional power\" \u2013 the ability to declare a state of emergency.",
      "A new People's Assembly will have full responsibility for legislation. Two thirds of its members will be appointed by a committee selected by the president and one third chosen by the president himself.",
      "A committee will also be formed to draft a new permanent constitution.",
      "Sharaa has promised an inclusive government that will run the country until the new constitution is finalised and free and fair elections are held.",
      "However, he faces significant challenges following a devastating civil war that erupted when Assad ordered a brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protests 14 years ago.",
      "Last week, gunmen supporting Sharaa's Sunni Islamist-led government were accused of carrying out revenge killings against members of Assad's minority Alawite sect in the western coastal region following a deadly ambush on a security patrol by gunmen loyal to the former regime. One monitoring group has said almost 1,500 civilians were killed.",
      "Sharaa has pledged to hold the perpetrators to account and ordered the formation of a committee aimed at preserving civil peace.",
      "However, many Alawites and members of other religious and ethnic minorities are wary of his intentions because of his past as the leader of al-Qaeda's former Syrian affiliate.",
      "UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said on Thursday that nothing could justify the killing of civilians and warned that Syria's \"much-deserved brighter future hangs in the balance\".",

      "Duda will not criticise Trump nor accept that his actions and words have cast a doubt on the US commitment to Article 5, the mutual defence clause of the North Atlantic Treaty.",

      "The ICC is a court of last resort designed to hold the most powerful to account when domestic courts are unable or unwilling to do so. But this case is a reminder of the extent to which it depends on state co-operation in order to fulfil its mandate - it effectively has no power to arrest people without the co-operation of the countries they are in, which is most often refused.",

      "Many people in and around the Italian city of Naples have spent the night on the streets and in their cars after an earthquake shook buildings and brought rubble crashing down.",

      "The quake was felt across Naples and power supplies were disrupted in parts of the city.",
      "Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said that there was \"no evidence\" that an eruption of the nearby Campi Flegrei volcanic crater was imminent.",

      "Thursday's earthquake was felt in several areas of the Campania region.",
      "The scale of the tremor was as big as a quake in May 2024, and it was the biggest in the Campi Flegrei (Phlegraean Fields) for 40 years.",
      "It was followed by as many as six weaker aftershocks.",
      "People left their homes and gathered on the streets of Naples, fearing more tremors.",
      "The bell tower of a local church was damaged and several cars had their windscreens smashed.",
      "In Pozzuoli, one resident told Italian TV that residents were concerned that the tremors of the past two years marked a \"different phenomenon from what has happened in the past\".",

      "Although 15 Western countries have tentatively offered peacekeeping troops, they would only come in the event of a final peace deal, not a ceasefire.",
      "Not that Russia would allow that arrangement anyway.",
      "Given all these \"nuances\", Putin appeared to be sceptical of how a ceasefire could benefit Russia, especially when his troops were on the front foot. His entire outlook was \"based on how the situation on the ground develops\".",

    "story": [
      "Freddy Mukuza's final moments were witnessed by a friend, who stood helpless, 50m (160 ft) away.",
      "When he heard that Freddy had been shot - by M23 rebels he was told - he and others rushed to the scene in Goma, in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.",
      "\"When we arrived, we found Freddy still breathing, and wanted to take him away, but the M23 did not allow us,\" says the friend, who we are calling Justin.",
      "\"When we insisted, they fired bullets into the ground as if to say: 'If you dare cross this perimeter, we will kill you as well.'\"",
      "So they had to keep their distance, as Freddy, 31, took his last breath. Only then did the M23 allow them to approach and take away his body.",
      "Shortly before the killing, three pick-up trucks full of rebel fighters had come to Freddy's neighbourhood - Kasika.",
      "It was around 15:00 on Saturday 22 February - almost a month after the rebel group had captured Goma in a rapid advance through the east of the country.",
      "Within an hour or so, between 17 and 22 people had been killed, mostly young men, according to our sources.",
      "We have gathered detailed accounts from residents, who cannot be identified, for their own protection.",
      "We asked the M23 for a response to the allegation that they carried out a mass killing in the neighbourhood. They did not reply.",
      "O\ufb03cials in Kasika have not released a death toll, and there is little or no prospect of an independent criminal investigation into what residents are calling a massacre.",
      "But locals insist the M23 is the only armed group which can operate freely, and shoot to kill in broad daylight in Goma.",
      "Since taking the city at the end of January, the rebels have been in complete control. During the 18 days we spent on the ground, their authority was absolute.",
      "They have been accused in the past of carrying out atrocities in other areas.",
      "The heavily armed rebels do not act alone. They are backed by neighbouring Rwanda, according to the UN and the US. Rwanda denies this, though it no longer denies having its own troops in DR Congo, saying they are there in self-defence.",
      "It is believed the M23 targeted Kasika because of a former Congolese army base in the area.",
      "The Katindo camp is now closed but some of the soldiers and their families remain in the district.",
      "\"Not all the soldiers were able to run away,\" a local resident explains. \"Some threw away their guns and stayed about the neighbourhood.\"",
      "But Freddy Mukuza was a civilian - a married father of two, struggling to get by. When hard times came, he earned a living by taking passengers on his motorbike.",
      "He was also an activist and songwriter who rapped about the many problems in his homeland - a country rich in minerals whose people are amongst the poorest in the world.",
      "DR Congo is known as a place of corruption and instability - and of conflict, stretching back 30 years. That is if the country and its suffering are remembered at all.",
      "Sexual violence is endemic. The government is weak, at best.",
      "There was plenty for Freddy to rap about.",
      "One of his songs is called Au Secours (Help in French), the lyrics full of questions that have gone unanswered:",
      "\"Who will come to the aid of these people? Who will come to the aid of these raped women? Who will come to the aid of these unemployed men?... The people are in danger, they don't have enough to eat. They [the authorities] buy jeeps.\"",
      "On the day of his death, Freddy was moving to a new rented home in Kasika. His brother-in-law was helping him put a tarpaulin over the roof.",
      "His sister-in-law was there too, getting the house ready for Freddy's family. When they heard the shooting, they were inside and rushed to shut the door, but they were seen by the M23.",
      "The rebels shot and killed Freddy's two in-laws, according to his friend Justin.",
      "Since then, Justin has barely left home, not even to earn money. His family is surviving on vegetables and fruit. Tea is now a luxury they cannot afford.",
      "He has stopped his children going to school, for fear they might be taken from their classrooms by the M23 and forcibly recruited.",
      "\"We believe it is more important that they stay alive,\" he says.",
      "His world has shrunk to his own four walls. There is the constant nagging fear that the rebels could return hunting for young men.",
      "Just the sight of one of their pick-up trucks in the street sends locals running, he says.",
      "These days it is rare to find a group of young people talking together, he tells us, and neighbours no long share gripes about the authorities as they did before the rebel takeover.",
      "\"Before, there was bad governance, but we were free,\" he says. \"There was embezzlement. There was mismanagement and we spoke out about that. We had the chance to go to court. Today, there is bad governance, but we live in terror and silence.\"",

      "Then he ran. One of his friends takes up the story. We are calling him John.",

      "That was the doughnut seller.",
      "Despite his age, he was still in secondary school, in his final year. He was a keen student who had a late start because his family could not afford to educate him.",
      "But John says: \"Like all young people, he had a dream.\" In his case, it was to be an engineer.",
      "John says the rebels did not care who they killed.",
      "\"There was no inquiry before shooting,\" he tells us. \"They just shot at everyone who was present, and at people who ran away, in two different directions.\"",
      "When the M23 captured Goma, they announced they had no prisons. John says no further explanation was needed: \"That meant whoever is presumed to be a government soldier, or a thief, or whoever makes a mistake, will be killed - immediately.\"",
      "Weeks on, few have dared to speak out. \"No-one wants to be next,\" John says.",
      "Bereaved families have held small hasty burials - without the usual mourning at home.",
      "\"The rebels didn't want any funerals,\" says one resident, who we are calling Deborah. \"They didn't even want people to cry. We thought they were coming to bring peace, but instead they came to exterminate us. They took everyone they found on the street.\"",
      "As the men were being rounded up, she tried to step outside. The rebels ordered her back in, at gunpoint.",
      "Denis Baeni was on his way home when the rebels arrived in Kasika. He dashed into a small shop to hide with a few others, our sources say.",
      "The primary school teacher got his ID card out of a pocket. He may have thought that would save him, by proving he was a civilian.",
      "A neighbour - with knowledge of the events - tells us what happened. We are calling her Rebecca.",
      "\"They heard a voice from outside asking: 'Are there any soldiers?'\" Rebecca says. \"They said no but the M23 took them out of the shop.\"",
      "The men were told to walk a short distance to a half-built house where they were \"assembled for execution\".",
      "\"There was so much gunfire,\" she says. \"It was so close. There were 21 people killed all at once from our neighbourhood. Many were just passing by.\"",
      "Rebecca insists they were all civilians. \"Not one was a soldier,\" she says.",
      "Denis leaves behind two children, who he was raising alone.",
      "Death is not the only danger here. Locals also face the risk of being recruited to fight - willingly or otherwise.",

      "Human rights groups paint a very different picture.",

    "story": [
      "Almost a decade since world powers sealed a historic deal to limit the Iranian nuclear programme, this is a crunch moment for Iran and the international community.",
      "The country is now closer than ever to being able to make a nuclear bomb.",
      "And the agreement - designed to prevent Iran developing a nuclear weapon - expires later this year.",
      "\"It's a real fork in the road moment,\" says Dr Sanam Vakil of the London-based think tank Chatham House. \"Without meaningful and successful diplomacy we could see Iran weaponise or we could see a military strike against the Islamic Republic.\"",
      "The deal, painstakingly negotiated over nearly two years under Barack Obama's presidency, imposed restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities in return for relief from sanctions that crippled the country's economy.",
      "But after Donald Trump pulled out of the agreement in 2018 during his first presidency and reinstated US sanctions, Iran gradually stopped complying with its commitments.",
      "It has accelerated its enrichment of uranium - used to make reactor fuel but also potentially nuclear bombs - to close to weapons-grade.",
      "Experts say it would now take Iran less than a week to enrich enough material to make a single nuclear weapon.",
      "Hence a flurry of urgent diplomatic activity by the US and the five other parties to the deal \u2013 the UK, China, France, Germany and Russia.",
      "A closed-door meeting of the UN Security Council discussed Iran's nuclear programme on Wednesday.",
      "And China is hosting talks with Iran and Russia on Friday in search of a \"diplomatic\" resolution.",
      "\"In the current situation, we believe that all parties should maintain calm and restraint to avoid escalating the Iran nuclear situation, or even walking towards confrontation and conflict,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said this week.",
      "On Wednesday, a letter from President Trump was delivered in Tehran by a senior diplomat from the United Arab Emirates.",
      "The contents have not been made public.",
      "But President Trump, after imposing new sanctions on Iran as part of a \"maximum pressure\" campaign, last week issued a televised ultimatum to Iran: make a deal or else.",
      "\"I've written them a letter saying, 'I hope you're going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing,'\" he said.",
      "Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, appeared to reject the idea of talks with a \"bullying\" US.",
      "So too - publicly - has President Masoud Pezeshkian, who had previously supported a resurrection of the nuclear deal, in return for an end to sanctions.",

    "summary": "Zimbabwe's leader faces a backlash from key allies over efforts to extend his time in office.",
    "story": [
      "A long convoy of armoured personnel tanks rolling through a Harare neighbourhood sparked concerns - for a brief moment - that a military coup was afoot in Zimbabwe.",
      "\"What's going on in Zimbabwe?\" one person posted on social media. Another said: \"The last time this happened there was a coup.\"",
      "Government spokesman Nick Mangwana was quick to allay the public's fears, explaining the tanks were in the capital that mid-February morning as part of a scheduled exercise to test equipment and were \"nothing to be concerned about\".",
      "Yet the chatter and speculation continued, revealing much about the state of the country.",
      "Ahead of the routine military drill, President Emmerson Mnangagwa had, for the first time since becoming president in 2017, faced harsh criticism about his leadership from within his Zanu-PF party with calls for him to step down.",
      "The accusations evoked memories of the lead-up to the coup that toppled his predecessor, long-time leader Robert Mugabe.",
      "He had come to power in 1980 as the revolutionary hero who ended decades of white-minority rule. But his demise was heralded when veterans of the 1970s war of independence withdrew their support for him.",
      "It was a war veteran and senior Zanu-PF member named Blessed Geza, also known as \"Bombshell\", who launched a verbal offensive against Mnangagwa.",
      "He became angered when some within the party began pushing to change the country's laws to allow for the president to seek a third term.",
      "In a series of often expletive-laden press conferences, gritty-voiced and with a furrowed forehead, he repeatedly called on the 82-year-old president to go or face being removed.",
      "\"I must apologise for helping him come into office,\" said Geza in one press conference aired on social media about the president, who goes by the nickname \"The Crocodile\".",
      "\"As soon as he [Mnangagwa] had the taste of power, he escalated corruption, forgot the people and only remembered his family,\" said the outspoken war veteran, who was then a member of Zanu-PF's powerful central committee.",
      "\"Mnangagwa has also surrendered state power to his wife and children. We sadly see history repeating itself. We can't allow that to happen.\"",
      "Zanu-PF was outraged by his \"disloyal\" remarks - later described as \"amounting to treason\" - forcing Bombshell into hiding from where, through his representatives, he continues to make taunts via social media, hinting at protests.",
      "He is wanted by the police on four charges, including vehicle theft, undermining the authority of the president and inciting public violence.",
      "Blessed Mhlanga, the journalist who first interviewed Bombshell back in November, has also been arrested on charges of transmitting a message that incites violence.",
      "Trouble began brewing over Mnangagwa's ambitions to stay in office during Zanu-PF rallies last year. The president is currently serving his second and final term, which expires in 2028.",
      "The slogan \"2030 he will still be the leader\" began to be uttered by his supporters despite Zimbabwe's constitution limiting presidential terms to two five-year terms.",
      "They argued that he would need to remain in office to complete his \"Agenda 2030\" development programme as he was doing such great work.",
      "A motion was then adopted unanimously at Zanu-PF's conference in December that did not explicitly speak of a third term but sought to extend Mnangagwa's existing term until 2030.",
      "Despite a recent assurance from Mnangagwa that he did intend to step down in three years, the influential Roman Catholic bishops have become involved.",
      "In a pastoral letter last week, Zimbabwe's Catholic Bishops Conference warned that the 2030 debate was a distraction from the things that truly mattered - business closures, high unemployment, rampant corruption and economic policies that favour the wealthy at the expense of ordinary Zimbabweans.",
      "Presidential spokesman George Charamba expressed his disappointment about the clerics' pronouncement, telling the state-run Herald newspaper the matter was now \"dead and buried\".",
      "Nonetheless, Bombshell's message seems to have landed. It has resulted in a purge in Zanu-PF, with the expulsion of Geza and some of his allies.",
      "Yet political analyst Takura Zhangazha says Geza's outburst is unlikely to galvanise crowds to his cause.",
      "These days people are less interested in such political spectacles, he says, unlike at the time of Mugabe's downfall when Zimbabweans, including opposition party supporters, turned out en masse to support the coup - thanking the military and the war veterans.",
      "\"Even that attempt by Geza to talk about corruption and the plight of the workers - it's not going to get people riled up, organising, mobilising. They don't have that capacity or interest any more,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"I can promise you there's no repeat of 2017 before 2028,\" he said, adding that Zimbabweans feel they were used in the ousting of Mugabe  and would not be brought out on the streets again for Zanu-PF's internal battles.",
      "This is also because there are splits across the political landscape, including a weak opposition.",
      "Even the war veterans do not represent a united front, Mr Zhangazha says.",
      "Geza has previously voiced support in the succession debate for Vice-President Constantine Chiwenga, the 68-year-old former army chief, but other war veterans are known to back the 2030 agenda.",
      "Political analyst Alexander Rusero says it is important to understand the war veterans' influential role in both Zimbabwe and Zanu-PF.",
      "\"They see themselves as caretakers, so you can't wish away their sentiments,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "However, he believes that the current grievances aired by the likes of Bombshell are prompted more by self-regard than public interest.",
      "\"They feel as if they are excluded from the cake that they should otherwise be enjoying,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Mr Zhangazha agrees that those who show loyalty within the governing party are likely to benefit from things like tenders, government contracts, access to housing, land and agricultural inputs such as fertiliser and seeds.",
      "For Jameson Timba, the leader of a faction of the main opposition party, the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), it all sums up the state of politics in Zimbabwe.",
      "\"You have a country where the economic situation is deteriorating. People can hardly afford more than one meal a day,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"We have major supermarket chains which are literally closing down,\" he said, referencing the economic woes facing OK Zimbabwe, one of the country's biggest retailers that has been forced to close several big branches with empty shelves in others.",
      "Mr Zhangazha noted the forecast for the fragile economy looks even more grim thanks to the fallout from the recent suspension of USAID.",
      "Timba is still recovering from a five-month stint in jail, spending most of his incarceration sitting on a concrete floor, sharing a cell and toilet with 80 people.",
      "He was arrested in June, along with more than 70 others, for hosting an \"unlawful meeting\" at his private residence when he held a barbeque to mark the International Day of the African Child.",
      "His treatment - and those of his fellow detainees - reflected how opposition politics was being criminalised, he told the BBC.",
      "\"The country is facing challenges. Any leader or government worth his salt would actually call for an early election, to check and determine whether they still have the mandate of the people,\" he said.",
      "\"To do the opposite represents a joke essentially [when] you're talking about extending a term of office.\"",
      "However, there is little chance of an early vote.",
      "For now, Bombshell remains in hiding and the elections are years away - but the succession debate will keep cooking.",

      "Deena Ghazarian had only been in business for a year when the trade policies of President Donald Trump's first term of office sent her company into a tailspin.",
      "It was 2019 and her California-based firm, Austere, had just agreed to supply several big US retailers with its high-end audio and video accessories that are largely manufactured in China.",
      "Then Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China, and overnight Deena found herself paying a 25% surcharge on every cable and component she imported \u2013 up from zero previously.",
      "She was forced to absorb the costs and for a while thought she would go bust.",
      "\"I literally thought I am going to start and end a business in less than a year,\" she says. \"I had spent all this time, money and effort, and to have something like this blindside you was shocking.\"",
      "The firm pulled through, but like numerous other US businesses it now finds itself in a strikingly similar situation.",
      "Since returning to office in January, Mr Trump has raised tariffs on all goods imported from China by 20%, and put taxes of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay some of them until April.",
      "The president says he wants to force these countries to do more to stop flows of illegal drugs and migrants into America, to bring more manufacturing back to the US, and to address what he sees as unfair trade imbalances.",
      "But the duties are much broader in scope than last time, when they were phased in gradually and many products were granted exemptions.",
      "Goods like smartphones, desktop computers and tablets are now incurring tariffs for the first time, while taxes on others have climbed higher.",
      "\"US importers have to pay these taxes not the exporters,\" says Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), a North American trade body that represents more than 1,200 tech firms.",
      "\"It's American businesses and consumers who will suffer.\"",
      "Businesses like Ms Ghazarian's are particularly exposed. China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (\u00a3112bn) in 2023, according to official data.",
      "Meanwhile, 87% of US video game console imports came from China that year, 78% of smartphones, 79% of laptops and tablets, and two-thirds of monitors, says the CTA.",

      "'I will have to raise prices by 10%' - toymakers warn of tariff pain",
      "China retaliates against US tariffs - but it also wants to talk",
      "While many American companies like Austere have diversified their supply chains away from China since Mr Trump's first term, countries such as Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam still do not offer the same manufacturing capabilities and expertise.",
      "At the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.",
      "\"Yes, Apple now makes some iPhones in India and [the Taiwanese chipmaker] TSMC has been diversifying to Arizona,\" says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC.",
      "\"But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop.\"",
      "Research suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.",
      "In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she may have to raise her prices this year, but worries it could backfire. \"There is a price point where the customer is satisfied with the value of goods provided.",
      "\"The moment I shift above that I start to lose customers. High inflation has squeezed Americans.\"",
      "During Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.",
      "Insiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020.",
      "Fears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.",
      "For the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute.",
      "He plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.",
      "There is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she is worried but at least she's prepared this time. Like many other US business-owners she bulk-ordered extra inventory before Mr Trump took office, and is storing it in her east coast warehouse.",
      "She hopes that will get the company through the next year until it can \"pivot\" again.",

    "summary": "As the president tries to force Mexico to stop the flow of drugs, cartel members tell Quentin Sommerville they will not be deterred.",
    "story": [
      "The fentanyl dealer from Los Angeles stands to the side watching carefully as a Mexican drugs cartel operative prepares his latest shipment. The synthetic opioid drug is wrapped in foil, sealed in plastic, then dropped with an oily splash into the petrol tank of the trafficker's nondescript car.",
      "Jay, not his real name, had crossed earlier from the US to this cartel-run safe house on the Mexican side of the border. The house looks like any other in this neighbourhood. We are told to drive in quickly and an iron gate closes firmly behind us. They don't cook the drug here, but still they are wary of attracting attention. The men all speak in hushed voices and work quickly.",
      "Their lethal business has become the centre of a global economic dispute. The White House has used fentanyl smuggling through US borders as a key justification for raising tariffs on other nations. US President Donald Trump has also vowed to \"wage war\" on the drug cartels.",
      "The BBC gained rare access to a cartel's operation along the border and travelled to the US to meet their ultimate customers, to see if the international row was doing anything to halt the illegal flow of narcotics.",
      "The men we meet at the safe house are foot-soldiers of a well-known cartel. Two of them loading the car admit to fleeting moments of remorse. But when I ask the man packing the drugs into the fuel tank if he feels guilty about the deaths the pills cause, he sniggers. \"We have family too, of course we feel guilty. But if I stop, it's going to continue. It's not my problem,\" he tells me with a shrug.",
      "The men keep their faces covered while they remove the back seat of the car to gain access to the tank, taking care not to spill petrol. The smell inside the car could alert customs officers on the other side of the border that the fuel tank has been tampered with.",
      "The light green pills, 5,000 in total and marked with an M, are packed tightly - a fraction of what Jay says he sells every week in LA and across the American northwest.",
      "\"I try to get 100,000 pills a week, every week,\" the softly spoken dealer tells me. \"I don't send them in one vehicle. I try to spread it in different cars. That way I minimise my risk of losing all my pills.\"",
      "A 25% tariff on all goods from Mexico was introduced in response to what President Donald Trump said was the unacceptable flow of illegal drugs and illegal immigrants into the US. Some of those tariffs have since been delayed until 2 April.",
      "Defeating the fentanyl trade is one of President Trump's top policy goals, but Jay doesn't rate his chances.",
      "\"Last time he was in office, he tried to do the same thing, and it never happened. There's always going to be a demand. And where's the biggest demand? United States, lucky for us. We're here in the border,\" says Jay with a smile.",
      "There is so much of the drug flowing into the US, most of it coming from Mexico, that according to Jay the price he sells it for in LA has fallen from about $5 or $6 per pill a year ago, to $1.50 now (\u00a31.16).",
      "Mexican police say cartels switched in a big way to fentanyl, which is 50 times more potent than heroin, because unlike other opiates - which are made from the opium poppy - it is completely synthetic and much easier to make and transport.",
      "Fentanyl's strength and addictiveness has left a deep scar on American society: drug overdoses kill more people in the US than guns or car crashes. Fatalities have started to decline, perhaps due in part to the greater availability of Naloxone, a drug that reverses the effects of overdoses of opioids. But the latest figures are still stark: 87,000 overdose deaths (mostly from opioids) from October 2023 to September 2024, down from 114,000 the year before.",
      "In an attempt to stave off punitive tariffs from the White House, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has pledged to send 10,000 National Guard troops to the border. The government has made more than 900 arrests since October in Sinaloa, a major drug trafficking hub. Back in December, Mexico announced its biggest ever fentanyl seizure in the state: more than a tonne of pills. In fact, the country has seized more fentanyl in the past five months than it did in the previous year.",
      "Mexico has also made it harder to import a key ingredient of fentanyl from China, prompting cartels to reduce the strength of each pill - and, in the process, making them less deadly.",
      "And at the end of February, 29 senior drug cartel figures were handed over to the United States, including members of five of the six Mexican crime syndicates that President Trump's administration recently designated as terrorist organisations.",
      "President Sheinbaum also said she had agreed to the CIA increasing surveillance drone operations over Mexican territory in search of fentanyl drugs labs, after the media revealed the covert missions.",
      "Jay acknowledges the dangers of his trade to himself and his customers, but is untroubled.",
      "\"They always try to blame us, that we are the ones that are poisoning American citizens. But they're the biggest users.\"",
      "He coolly insulates himself from responsibility and guilt for the deaths his drugs cause. He claims not to know anyone who has died using his product. \"I only deal with other suppliers,\" he tells me.",
      "The cartels mostly use American citizens to courier their drugs across the border, as they are less likely to be stopped by US Customs and Border Protection. The driver, who goes by the name Charlie, has a US passport. He, too, is mostly indifferent to the suffering the fentanyl epidemic has caused.",
      "\"I need the money,\" he says. When I ask him how many times he has made the drugs run, he replies: \"Too many.\" (I later learn that the 5,000 pills in the fuel tank made it across the border without incident.)",
      "President Sheinbaum has also recently emphasised the demand side of the crisis, saying the US fentanyl crisis began with the legal but \"irresponsible approval\" of painkillers, such as OxyContin, starting in the late 1990s. \"The US government should take responsibility for the opioid-consumption crisis that has caused so many deaths,\" she said at a daily news conference.",
      "On the other side of the border is Derek Maltz, who has spent a lifetime in US drug enforcement. He has been made the interim leader of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and spoke to me just before his appointment.",
      "\"The Mexican cartels need to know that we're coming down there,\" he tells me. \"We're going to have aggressive operations to go after you and your business because you are killing our American kids at record levels and it's not going to be tolerated.\"",
      "Mr Maltz agrees, though, that targeting the cartels alone will not solve the opioid crisis. \"The cartels are very bad guys,\" he tells me. \"They're transnational criminals. They're narco-terrorists. However, there is a bad demand problem in America, we have to address why our population is turning to drugs for help.\"",
      "In Philadelphia's Kensington neighbourhood - dubbed the largest open-air drugs market on the US east coast - Rosalind Pichardo of Operation Save Our City is on to her second Bible. She records in the book's back pages the number of times she has reversed an opioid overdose using the quick-acting drug Naloxone.",
      "For the past six years, the figure totals 2,931. She flicks through the pages and that number written in red comes alive with the memories of the individuals she saved, and the ones she lost.",
      "She begins to list: \"Male in his 60s\u2026 male 30s\u2026 female in her 30s, very thin, no hair.\" Beside each name in this roll-call of fentanyl victims, is the number of doses of Naloxone - sold under the name Narcan - she used to attempt to revive people.",
      "Ms Pichardo, who runs a drop-in centre called Sunshine House, operates what she calls a \"no-judgement zone\". She bristles at the terms like \"addict\", \"junkie\" or \"zombie\", which have been used to describe the people of her neighbourhood. Instead, she calls everyone \"sunshine\".",
      "Some she doesn't remember; others she will never forget.",
      "\"Look at this one, seven years old, two Narcans,\" she points out. Ms Pichardo had been called to a neighbour's house where a woman was holding in her arms a child who had turned blue. Ms Pichardo went inside and the girl was placed on the floor, but as she entered the child's father ran upstairs carrying a bag. \"I'm thinking if that was my child, I'd be running to help the child,\" she recalls.",
      "At first, she thought it might be epilepsy, but she spotted drug scales and plastic baggies on a nearby table. The kid's dad was a drug dealer; the seven-year-old had been poisoned by his stash and overdosed. \"I was livid,\" she says.",
      "Those two doses of Narcan were enough to save the child's life.",
      "On another page, a woman, six months pregnant, two doses of Narcan. She also survived.",
      "In Kensington, drugs are cheap and plentiful, and people shoot up in the open. As she walks the neighbourhood, Ms Pichardo finds people passed out on the pavement, a woman in a stupor with her trousers down, a man lying prone next to a metro turnstile, another man in a wheelchair, his eyes closed and money in his hands.",
      "He, like a growing number of opioid users, has had a limb amputated. A new drug on the street, the animal tranquilliser Xylazine, is being mixed with fentanyl. It leads to open wounds which become infected. The air is rank in places.",
      "John White is 56 years old, and for 40 of those years he has struggled with addiction. At Sunshine House, Ms Pichardo serves him a bowl of homemade soup.",
      "\"I've been in this city all my life,\" he says. \"The fentanyl and opioid epidemic is the worst I've ever seen. Fentanyl will get you so hooked that you have to get more. So they put it in everything.\"",
      "Mr White had a fentanyl overdose after smoking a joint laced with the drug: it is being added to all kinds of illicit drugs, including heroin, cocaine and marijuana.",
      "Ms Pichardo holds out little hope that even if the fentanyl trade is cut off from Mexico, it will improve people's lives in Kensington.",
      "\"The problem that we have with the war on drugs is - it didn't work then [and] I don't believe it's going to work now,\" she explains.",
      "When the supply of one drug is cut off, another replaces it, she says. \"Once there was heroin, now there's no more. Now there's fentanyl. When there's no fentanyl, now it's going to be Xylazine. So it's like they'll find a way to keep people addicted so that people can make money off of people, off the suffering of people,\" says Ms Pichardo.",
      "Directly across from Sunshine House, a young woman is found collapsed on the pavement, her body splayed across the concrete: she's unresponsive. Ms Pichardo is quickly on the scene, her medical kit by her side, yet again administering Naloxone. The woman is eventually revived - she will survive.",
      "Roz Pichardo returns to Sunshine House, another life saved and another digit to be added to the back pages of her tattered Bible.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 08:34:22 GMT",
    "summary": "The finance minister's decision to push ahead with tax hikes puts him at odds with coalition partners.",
    "story": [
      "South Africa has entered uncharted waters following deep divisions in the coalition government over the national budget that has finally been tabled after a month-long delay.",
      "This is the view of analysts after Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana's budget drew a backlash from various quarters, including key partners in the coalition government rejecting his proposals for a second time.",
      "The African National Congress (ANC) formed a government of national unity (GNU) with nine other parties after losing its parliamentary majority in elections last year.",
      "And, without the support of its biggest coalition partner, the Democratic Alliance (DA), it will fail to pass the budget unless it rethinks its contentious policies or gets the backing of the biggest opposition parties.",
      "Godongwana was forced to postpone his budget presentation last month after fierce resistance to his plan to raise value-added-tax (VAT), which would have seen the prices of goods go up at a time when South Africans are hard-hit by the cost-of-living crisis.",
      "This delay sent shockwaves through South Africa at the time, as it was the first time this had happened since the end of white-minority rule in 1994.",
      "US cuts send South Africa's HIV treatment 'off a cliff'",
      "Coalition is a landmark moment for a humbled ANC",
      "Is it checkmate for South Africa after Trump threats?",
      "Following a series of meetings between the parties in government, Godongwana returned on Wednesday to present what he called a \"bold and pragmatic\" budget.",
      "In his revised budget, the minister tried to appease his GNU partners by announcing a reduced VAT increase, to be implemented over a two-year period.",
      "Godongwana had initially proposed increasing VAT from15% to 17%, but has now suggested raising it to 16% in two stages.",
      "The minister says that increasing taxes is necessary to tackle \"persistent spending pressures in health, education, transport and security\".",
      "\"They [other parties] have to make a choice - do we close schools, hospitals or clinics? They have to make that choice. Do we fire people? That is the choice we have to make and that is not a good choice to make,\" Godongwana said.",
      "The minister added that he had opted to target VAT rather than personal and corporate taxes, as the latter two would generate less revenue while \"potentially harming investment, job creation and economic growth\".",
      "Godongwana's revised budget has the support of his party, the ANC, but has failed to appease the DA, which said it would not \"support any increase in taxes, unless those increases were temporary and the ANC agreed to a series of major reforms\" that would grow the economy, reduce waste and create jobs within the next three years.",
      "The impasse has tarnished President Cyril Ramaphosa's much-vaunted reputation as a deal-maker, with only one of his coalition partners - the small Patriotic Alliance (PA) - supporting the budget.",
      "The latest tussle highlights deepening divisions in the fragile coalition government, as the two biggest parties have locked horns over key issues since its formation.",
      "This includes a controversial land law, which allows for private property to be seized by the government in certain cases, without any compensation offered to owners.",
      "The DA is challenging the law in court, arguing that it is unconstitutional and threatens property rights in South Africa.",
      "The two biggest opposition parties - former President Jacob Zuma's Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) and Julius Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) - have also rejected the budget, saying the proposed tax hikes would hit the poor the hardest.",
      "This leaves the ANC in a difficult situation, at it needs the support of at least one of the three other biggest parties to pass the budget.",
      "An analyst at South Africa's Wits University, Thokozile Madonko, says the deadlock over the budget has left South Africa in \"uncharted waters\".",
      "She tells the BBC that the role of parliament will now be \"absolutely critical\" as it either accepted, changed or rejected the budget.",
      "And while in the past the ANC could always push through its policies, this is no longer the case.",
      "This will force it to strike a deal with other parties or risk seeing the budget being voted down - something that could result in the collapse of the coalition government.",
      "Ms Madonko criticised Godongwana's decision to take the \"laziest option\" by proposing an increase in VAT, which will affect the entire population, rather than targeting the richest section of the population by introducing a \"wealth tax\" on them.",
      "Another expert, Adrian Saville, said the budget was a \"folly\" as the minister repeated many old promises to promote economic growth and create jobs in a country where unemployment is standing at more than 30%.",
      "\"Those are words. Give us the numbers [and] tell us what you intend to do so that when we meet again in a year's time, we know whether you've been successful or if you've fallen short,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Godongwana has long been seen as a steady pair of hands, commanding the respect of both the business sector and the trade union movement.",
      "But his credibility has taken a knock following the crisis over the budget. He now faces the challenge of salvaging his reputation by steering the budget through parliament - or people would increasingly question his suitability for the post.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y42125239o",
    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 14:18:41 GMT",
    "summary": "The US is expected to present a 30-day ceasefire proposal to Russia in the coming days.",
    "story": [
      "Hours of talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday ended with a joint US-Ukraine statement backing an American-proposed 30-day ceasefire in the war with Russia.",
      "Trump administration officials see this as a major breakthrough towards the foreign policy goals of a leader who campaigned on a promise to end the war.",
      "For Ukraine, the joint announcement amounts to a critical reprieve for President Volodymyr Zelensky after a humiliating attack in the Oval Office a fortnight ago by Trump and Vice-President JD Vance.",
      "For Moscow, it shifts the onus to them, while the war itself intensifies.",
      "But so far only one side in the war - the one dependent on the Americans - has signed up. And the proposal is only eight paragraphs long, with meagre details beyond the desire to rapidly press ahead.",
      "So does it make a ceasefire plausible? And if so, can it end the war after Russia's full-scale invasion three years ago in a just and sustainable way, and on terms that keep the region and the world safe?",
      "Statement: \"Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the U.S. proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation. The United States will communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace.\"",
      "Analysis: The key word here is \"immediate,\" which doesn't leave any doubt: Trump wants the guns to fall silent now. His sense of urgency, however, has often led to concerns in Europe.",
      "Many fear that rushing the desired outcome without first working out the terms takes the military pressure off Moscow as the invading power and could lead to a truce being exploited.",
      "They argue it empowers the occupying force.",
      "The fear is of ultimately leading Ukraine into an effective surrender. The theory is that Russia - the bigger, more populous and militarily more self-sufficient power - could use a truce without first establishing concessions to consolidate its forces, string out a negotiation process and wait to see what happens politically for Trump during his term while it holds on to everything it seized; and even then try to take more ground, building on its current occupation and potentially using a fracture in the Western alliance to threaten more of Europe.",
      "The process of negotiating terms before a ceasefire in conflicts can be important to ensure the sides convert current military threats into meaningful strategic gains.",
      "Zelensky has previously tried to persuade the Americans that Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot be trusted, evidenced by the fact he broke the European-backed Minsk agreements after seizing Ukrainian territory in 2014.",
      "Trump dismisses these concerns, saying there will be security for Ukraine, but without saying how this will be assured. He has said Putin will be deterred and is in a difficult position with \"no choice\" but to make a deal for reasons that \"only I know\".",
      "Rubio said on Tuesday the US delegation had substantive discussions with the Ukrainians on a permanent end to the war, including \"what type of guarantees they're going to have for their long-term security and prosperity\", but again didn't elaborate.",
      "Statement: \"The United States will immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine.\"",
      "Analysis: This is the big win for Zelensky in this agreement and sees US weapons supplies being delivered at a rate of around $2bn (\u00a31.5bn)-worth a month, restored.",
      "Critically, it also means Washington will once again share its intelligence data and satellite pictures with Kyiv, which helps it target Russian positions. The White House said it suspended this aid because it felt Zelensky wasn't \"committed\" to Trump's peace plan.",
      "The Ukrainian leader had tried to voice his concerns based on some of the reasons above when he was ejected from the Oval Office. His reservations are likely being set aside while he welcomes the agreement in this form - a necessary price to pay to restore US security assistance.",
      "Ukraine ceasefire plan live updatesUS set to present 30-day ceasefire offer to Russia",
      "Ukraine ceasefire plan live updates",
      "US set to present 30-day ceasefire offer to Russia",
      "Statement: \"Both delegations agreed to name their negotiating teams and immediately begin negotiations toward an enduring peace that provides for Ukraine's long-term security. The United States committed to discussing these specific proposals with representatives from Russia. The Ukrainian delegation reiterated that European partners shall be involved in the peace process.\"",
      "Analysis: This paragraph is confusing because it's unclear whether it refers to negotiations between Ukraine and the US on establishing any security guarantees for Ukraine, or if it refers to negotiations between Ukraine and Russia to permanently end the war once a ceasefire is under way.",
      "If it is the former, it appears to suggest that Washington and Kyiv will hammer out any decisions on how to back up Ukraine's security and deter Russian breaches of a truce, and the US will then discuss these with Moscow.",
      "But it is all a far cry from the kind of security guarantee Zelensky ultimately wanted, which was membership of Nato, which Trump has said won't happen - a major long-term concession to Moscow's demands.",
      "The paragraph also contains a vague and lukewarm reference to the idea of European peacekeepers, which have been pitched by the UK and France, with the line attributed only to the Ukrainian delegation.",
      "It's notable that the US appears not to be putting its name to this part after Moscow categorically rejected the idea.",
      "Statement: \"\u2026both countries' presidents agreed to conclude as soon as possible a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine's critical mineral resources to expand Ukraine's economy and guarantee Ukraine's long-term prosperity and security.\"",
      "Analysis: This was the agreement that never got signed after Zelensky was told to leave the White House last month.",
      "It would give the US a future stake in some of Ukraine's state-owned mineral deposits, as well as oil and gas revenues.",
      "Trump sees it as an effective security guarantee for Ukraine, arguing it would deter Russian re-invasion because American companies would be on the ground.",
      "Opponents point out this is meaningless because US economic presence in Ukraine didn't deter Putin in 2014 or 2022.",
      "Statement: \"The Ukrainian delegation reiterated the Ukrainian people's strong gratitude to President Trump\u2026\"",
      "Analysis: This is a key line that might help explain Zelenky's rehabilitation in the eyes of the White House.",
      "Vance had castigated him in the Oval Office for not thanking Trump, even though the Ukrainian leader has thanked the US dozens of times for its military support.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 14:48:29 -0400",
    "summary": "Ruth Marcus, a longtime op-ed writer for the Washington Post, quit on Monday after, she said, her column criticizing owner Jeff Bezos was killed by publisher.",
    "story": [
      "A columnist who has worked at The Washington Post for four decades resigned on Monday after she said the newspaper's management decided not to run her commentary critical of owner Jeff Bezos' new editorial policy.",
      "\"It breaks my heart to conclude that I must leave,\" Ruth Marcus, who has\u00a0worked\u00a0at the newspaper since 1984, wrote in a resignation letter.",
      "Her exit is the latest fallout from the billionaire owner's directive that the Post narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. The newspaper's opinions editor, David Shipley, had already resigned because of the shift.",
      "The storied newspaper has been in a free fall, financially and editorially, over the past year. Marcus, who worked in the news and opinion departments during her career, is \"the bedrock of The Washington Post, embodying the history of the place as well as the talent and accomplishments of its journalists,\" said Paul Farhi, a former media reporter there.",
      "Marcus, who was a finalist for the\u00a0Pulitzer Prize for Commentary\u00a0in 2007, said that the Post's publisher, Will Lewis, declined to run her column, which she described as \"respectfully dissenting\" from Bezos' edict. It was the first time in nearly 20 years of writing columns that she's had one killed, she said.",
      "The decision \"underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded,\" she wrote. Her resignation letter was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "A Post spokesperson said Monday that \"we're grateful for Ruth's significant contributions to The Washington Post over the past 40 years. We respect her decision to leave and wish her the best.\"",
      "While Bezos and Lewis have the right to make such decisions \u2014 they're the bosses \u2014 \"that has not been the tradition,\" Farhi said. He likened it to how the Justice Department, while technically under White House control, has generally operated independently. Editorial writers and columnists, paid to give their opinions, usually decide what to write, he said.",
      "The danger is that a decision by the publisher not to allow a column to go forward can make readers question whether the viewpoints of writers are truly their own, he said. Worse yet, it could taint the news department, which by most accounts is aggressively covering the new administration.",
      "Shortly after the editorial page decision was announced nearly two weeks ago, another Post story on the issue, by media columnist Erik Wemple, was scrapped, according to the Gene Pool, a blog written by former Post writer Gene Weingarten. Wemple declined comment on Monday.",
      "In January, editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after her work depicting Bezos and other billionaires genuflecting before a statue of President Donald Trump was rejected, a decision Shipley explained at the time was because it was repetitive of other opinion pieces.",
      "Under executive editor Matt Murray, the Post has also said it would refrain from having its journalists write about issues involving the newspaper, a decision Wemple said in a chat with readers in January that \"I couldn't possibly dissent (from) more strongly.\"",
      "The Post's opinion section on Monday included an editorial opposing Mexico's $10 billion lawsuit against firearms manufacturers, a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Columnists Max Boot wrote about Trump and Russia, Perry Bacon Jr. about Democratic resistance to Trump centering in the states, Phillip Bump on whether Trump would pay a political price for unpopular policies and Jim Geraghty about violence in Syria.",
      "The Post, which made money during the first Trump administration, has been losing money in recent years and its internal strife largely began last June, when Sally Buzbee resigned as executive editor rather than accept a newsroom reorganization. Several prominent Post journalists \u2014 among them Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, Philip Rucker, Matea Gold, Jackie Alemany, Michael Scherer and Will Sommer \u2014 have left for other jobs.",
      "Bezos' decision last fall that the Post would not endorse a presidential candidate \u2014 after the editorial staff had prepared to support Democrat Kamala Harris \u2014 led to an exodus of subscribers that the newspaper is fighting to recover from.",
      "Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor when Bezos bought the paper in 2013, wrote last week in the Atlantic that Bezos \"handled his ownership admirably for more than a decade. But his courage failed him when he needed it the most.\"",
      "Marcus' resignation on Monday overshadowed a newsroom reorganization plan introduced by Murray, including separating workflows for the Post's digital and print products.",

      "\"When you live in this perfect environment, you don't want to have to admit to yourself that something is wrong,\" Winfrey said.",
      "Griffin described how her children helped her recognize she needed to address her past, recalling her daughter saying, \"Mom, you are here, but you're not really here.\"",

    "story": [
      "Discussion Questions",
      "1. Amy Griffin spent much of her adult life determined to move forward, never letting herself stop to look back. What do you think eventually motivated her to want to revisit her past and then to tell her story? Talk about the courage it takes to confront one's past\u2014and to share it with the world. Have you ever decided to divulge something about yourself that you once felt was impossible to share?",
      "2. Amy was a star student in her small Texas town, and she became a high-achieving businesswoman after arriving in New York. Talk about ambition as a trauma response. Do you think Amy believed she could outwork (and outrun) her past? How can \"The Tell\" serve as a reminder that people who appear to \"have it all\" are not always as they seem?",
      "3. A physical therapist tells Amy: \"There's something your body is telling you that you don't want to hear.\" How did her body's message manifest? What messages has your body sent you over the years? What makes it hard for you to listen to the messages your body sends?",
      "4. John supports Amy's decision to try therapy with Olivia and he works to keep the family's life afloat at home while she takes time to process what she's uncovered. But John also understands his own limits, telling Amy when she needs to find outside support so he can just be her husband. How does he know when to place this boundary? How does Amy react to this? Have you ever had to place a difficult boundary to preserve a relationship?",
      "5. Would you try psychedelic-assisted therapy? Why or why not?",
      "6. \"I needed to find the evidence that would confirm my memories,\" Amy writes in her journal. Why do you think Amy needs others to confirm what she knows to be true?",
      "7. What did you learn from \"The Tell\" and from Amy's sessions with Lauren about how memory works? Consider the distinction between memory storage and memory recall, for instance. What did you find most surprising?",
      "8. \"My daughters were asking me to participate in life, and in our relationship, in a way that I could not.\" How do Amy's children both trigger her memories\u2014and help her heal?",
      "9. For years, Amy remembers so many details around the abuse, but not the abuse itself. She saw clues, but not the full picture of her trauma. How did \"The Tell\" make you consider\u2014or reconsider\u2014your own life events and memories? Is there anything you might be unable or unwilling to remember? Have you ever surprised yourself by \"unlocking\" an unexpected memory?",
      "10. Amy begins to feel that justice will bring her closure. How was Paul's story both a helpful\u2014and unfortunately rare\u2014example for Amy? How does it affect her when she realizes her own story might not have such a tidy or satisfying outcome?",
      "11. What was it like for her to tell her parents? Have you ever had to have a difficult conversation with your parents about your childhood? What did you learn through that conversation\u2014about yourself or about them?",
      "12. Amy was raised in a traditional patriarchal Texas culture. Children were expected to both respect and obey their elders. How do the environments of our childhoods\u2014and the cultures in which we are raised\u2014inform our adult choices? How can our backgrounds influence what we can and cannot face in our personal histories?",
      "13. Amy recognizes the resources and time she was able to devote to both her healing and pursuing her legal case. How are situations of abuse and survival different for those without the same resources? In what ways might financial and class privileges insulate you from pain, or not?",
      "14. At the beginning of her journey, Amy can't \"tell\" her secret to herself. By the end, she's realized \"the telling is the medicine.\" How does telling her story help Amy heal?",
      "15. How does Amy give herself the closure she needs?",
      "16. Who do you think wrote the postcard? Does the writer's identity matter?",
      "17. What was your biggest takeaway from \"The Tell\"?",

The Broadway version is a stand-in for the city's corroded grandeur, and for the studio where, in 1996, a group of old, mostly forgotten Cuban musicians recorded the album.",
      "Justin Cunningham, as Juan de Marcos: \"What follows is the story of a band. Not ours, though we will do our best. Some of what follows is true. Some of it only feels true.\"",
      "The true part: the real person this actor is playing, Juan de Marcos Gonzalez, had already located and brought together the old musicians before music producers Ry Cooder and Nick Gold showed up in Havana. When their plan to make an album pairing Cuban and West African performers fell through, they went with Plan B, and recorded with the group Juan de Marcos had assembled.",
      "\"I was so happy, because they were my idols,\" Juan said. \"You know, I grew up with, you know, listening to their music. And then suddenly, I was the bandleader.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did any of the people involved, including you, have any idea that what became 'Buena Vista Social Club' would be something big?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"They became pop stars. It was like an unbelievable thing.\"",
      "The unexpected and irresistible phenomenon that resulted is the subject of the Oscar-nominated 1999 Wim Wenders documentary.",
      "\"It was just ubiquitous; I mean, you would hear this music everywhere,\" said music journalist and Substack contributor Judy Cantor-Navas, the author of \"Cuba on Record.\" \"To say that, 'Yes, we're listening to this old Cuban music that is suddenly selling millions of albums,' seemed like something that was very unlikely.\"",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think people loved the music so much?\"",
      "\"Cuban music has really appealed to so many different kinds of people,\" said Cantor-Navas. \"They say that it has, you know, the perfect combination of the Afro-Cuban rhythms and the Spanish melodies that came together in Cuba. It's just this very infectious music that, like, gets in your soul.\"",
      "It wasn't just the music they loved. It was who the musicians were \u2013 the improbable last act of their careers. The album won a Grammy, and has sold more than 8 million copies worldwide.",
      "\"And they were so happy, you know, because they came back to the stage,\" said Juan de Marcos. \"Because if you are a musician, and you are an artist, you are always an artist, you know? And even when you're retired, you have this small candle in your heart.\"",
      "Singer-dancer Omara Portuondo was 67; singer Ibrahim Ferrer was 70. Other band members were as old as 90. They began touring the world, even singing to me for a \"Sunday Morning\" story 25 years ago. \"I still have to pinch myself to make sure I'm not asleep and dreaming,\" Ferrer said then. \"I never thought I'd have so much success.\"",
      "From the archives: Buena Vista Social Club on its U.S. tour (2000)",
      "The play tells the imagined origin story of the musicians, their careers, and their personal struggles, with hints of romance, decades before their fame late in life.",
      "Marco Ramirez wrote the Broadway show. \"I'm Cuban American. I was born and raised in Miami, but my parents and my family's Cuban,\" he said. \"And so, for me what brought me to this was the music. It was music that I was raised around my entire life.",
      "He was 14 when the album came out: \"This was a moment of intense pride, of us realizing that the world cared about our music, and that these songs that I was used to hearing on my grandfather's little yellow Sony boom box above the washing machine, these were songs that suddenly the whole world cared about. That meant everything to me.\"",
      "Saheem Ali, the director of the show, grew up in Kenya. His father, an airline pilot, brought the album home. He became obsessed with it. \"I kept listening to it on repeat,\" he said. \"Something about the lyrics spoke to me. I learned the lyrics without knowing what I was talking about, 'cause Swahili's my first language.",
      "\"I knew nothing about their stories, absolutely nothing. The first time I knew about the stories was reading Marco's script. That's what excited me about this musical. People are gonna know about them now in a way that young people like me never had a chance to.\"",
      "Brought to life on a Broadway stage, the old songs as they were played in the 1940s and '50s at the actual Buena Vista Social Club, a members-only Havana nightclub for working class Black Cubans. It was shut down after Fidel Castro came to power in 1959. The events of the Cuban Revolution lurk at the edges of the show.",
      "Playing yesterday's Cuban music on Broadway are some of today's finest Cuban musicians, most of whom now live outside Cuba, because making a living there is tough.",
      "Juan de Marcos said, \"The people going to see the real Cuba, they are going to get a piece of our country when they attend the musical. We have nothing in our country. We don't have oil, we don't have gold, but we have the music, beautiful ladies, good coffee, the best cigars, and the best rum. And the music, which is the most important thing, like food for us.\"",

      "In 2023, Mulvaney joined celebrities partnering with Bud Light for a social media campaign. Her content was singled out by conservatives, leading to widespread backlash and\u00a0boycotts. Bud Light's parent company, Anheuser-Busch, saw its revenue fall by more than 10% after the campaign was released.",
      "\"It took a lot to not feel guilty about that experience because I felt like it was my fault. And that me taking this one brand deal was affecting trans people globally,\" Mulvaney said. \"I think extremists and transphobic media needed a poster child, but I would've never done anything or taken any deal that I thought could negatively impact me or the community.\"",
      "The experience affected her mental health, she said.",
      "\"It resulted in a lot of suicidal ideation and dissociation,\" Mulvaney said. \"I'm still battling with some of that guilt and that shame, and that dysphoria that was projected onto me during that time.\"",
      "Her new book comes amid renewed debate over transgender rights in the U.S. Last month, a group of transgender people filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump's executive order that halted gender marker changes on passports.",
      "For Mulvaney, the executive order doesn't change how she feels.",
      "\"I'm a woman no matter what my passport says. We are not hurting anyone,\" she said. \"We're less than 1% of the population. And the way that they speak about us so often is as if we're taking over cities like Godzilla.\"",
      "\"I am now realizing that this is life or death for a lot of people,\" she added. \"I want every trans person in this country to have the opportunity to thrive. And unfortunately, we're living in a time where it is very hard to do so.\"",

Mulaney would often change the script at the last second to throw Hader off, like during this Halloween skit:",
      "Stefon: \"Have you heard of Blacula, the Black Dracula? Well, they have a Jewish Dracula.\"Seth Meyers: \"Oh, what's his name?\"Stefon: \"Sidney Applebaum!\"",
      "Seems like this was the thing John Mulaney was born to do. Raised in Chicago, Mulaney says he grew up feeling that comedy was his destiny. Asked if he has a memory of when he realized that he was funny, Mulaney said, \"Always interesting in these things, 'cause you don't want to sound egotistical, but I don't remember a time when I didn't think I was funny.\"",
      "Not long after graduating from Georgetown, he joined \"SNL,\" and a career was launched. He made his mark in New York, but he's fascinated with Southern California, where he now lives year-round.",
      "He took us record shopping at one of his favorite places, the legendary Amoeba Music in Hollywood.",
      "I asked, \"When you come out to places like this, do people come up to you? Or do they leave you alone?\"",
      "\"A little bit,\" he said. \"My joke is that I'm like Louis Farrakhan: I mean a lot to a small group of people.\"",
      "Truth is, Mulaney is a lot bigger than he'll admit. In his most recent special, \"Baby J,\" he played to a sold-out crowd and focused on his drug addiction, and recovery. He describes a 2020 intervention on his behalf staged by friends like Seth Meyers and Fred Armisen: \"Let me just call this out now, I don't mean to be weird, it was a star-studded intervention.\"",
      "It's funny now, of course: Mulaney says he's been clean for more than four years.",
      "Asked if sobriety is something he thinks about every day, Mulaney replied, \"Well, that's a good question. I don't think about cocaine, opioids, and benzodiazeprine every day. I'll acknowledge that I understand the vigilance I need. I do not think about it every day. I just don't. I do think about the ways that I can lead my life to perhaps never feel the kind of strain that got me there. So, yeah, sobriety maybe being, like, a bigger term than just abstaining from the chemicals, I definitely think about it every day.\"",
      "Mulaney credits his wife, actress Olivia Munn, with helping him navigate his recovery. You might remember her from Aaron Sorkin's \"The Newsroom,\" or \"X-Men: Apocalypse,\" in which she played Psylocke. But she's a bit of a superhero in real life as well; she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2023, and has shared her whole journey online, from the initial test to a double mastectomy. Other women have since credited her with saving their lives.",
      "Mulaney said, \"There's this lifetime risk assessment test that is really the only reason her cancer was discovered. And seeing so many women publicly and privately come to her that [say] they discovered how high their risk was from that, it's astonishing.\"",
      "She's also mom to their two young children, Malcom and Mei. \"I have this feeling a lot of times, I go, 'I can't believe I know this person, let alone am married to her,'\" he said.",
      "Fatherhood has given him not only new material, but also a whole new outlook on life.",
      "From his November 2024 monologue on \"Saturday Night Live\":",
      "\"My wife and I just welcomed a baby girl into our family. \u2026 My wife takes care of the five-week-old, and I take the two-year-old out. And that's not fair. That's not an equal distribution of labor at all. Saying, 'You have a five-week-old, I'll take a two-year-old,' that's like saying, 'I'll transport this convict across state lines. You hold a potato.'\"",
      "John Mulaney has made a good life making people laugh. Now, as a husband and father of two, he says he has something to live for.",
      "Asked how fatherhood has changed how he looks at the world, Mulaney replied, \"I'm in the world now that I'm a father. My head was my only home before that. When my son was born, the first thought I had was, I went, 'Oh, there you are.' And when my daughter was born, I had this \u2013 not to sound 'woo-woo' or anything \u2013 but when she was born, I went, 'Oh!' My thought was like, 'Oh, we've met before. I've collided with you some other time.' So, it's like these people came in that just, I don't know, make me like the world a lot more.\"",

    "title": "Lindsey Vonn on skiing the comeback trail",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lindsey-vonn-on-skiing-the-comeback-trail/",
    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 09:58:42 -0400",
    "summary": "In the world of alpine skiing, few have been more decorated. Fast, fearless and resilient, Lindsey Vonn fought her way back after every crash, until she retired at 34. But now, with a titanium knee replacement, she is eyeing one more trip to the Olympics.",
    "story": [
      "For Lindsey Vonn, it was a reluctant farewell \u2013 the last run of her stellar career, at the Alpine World Ski Championships in Are, Sweden, in 2019. In the world of alpine skiing, few have been more decorated. She's won almost every major title, from World Cup Championships to Olympic medals, as the trophy case in her home proves.",
      "She says when she's racing, she doesn't think about the achievements: \"I think you just have a different perspective. You're focused on the next one, racing and performance, and you never really get to look back and say, 'Hey, good job,' you know?\"",
      "She was fast, reaching speeds of up to 85 mph. She was also fearless, and resilient. Crash after terrible crash, she always fought her way back. But 2013 was one of her hardest seasons. Vonn's right knee bore the brunt of a crash in the World Cup Super-G, and it was never the same. Flash forward almost six years, on the day of her last race \u2013 bum knee and all \u2013 she still managed to take home the bronze.",
      "At 34, Lindsey Vonn was retired.",
      "\"Skiing was always my sun, and everything in my life revolved around it: What time I woke up, what I ate, when I went to bed. It was all dictated around what's best for my skiing career,\" she said. \"And then, I woke up one day and my sun is gone.\"",
      "Ski racing is all Vonn ever wanted. Her dad, a former alpine skier himself, moved the family from Minnesota to Vail, Colorado, just so that Lindsey could train for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Those same slopes she now sees from her home in Park City, Utah.",
      "\"This is kind of just where I go to, you know, re-group and recharge my batteries,\" she said. \"And the dogs love it.\"",
      "In retirement, Vonn has kept many of her corporate sponsors, which helped her buy homes in Miami and Beverly Hills. She continued to wow red carpets, and not racing gave her more time to pour into her foundation, helping under-served girls achieve their own athletic dreams.",
      "But that knee kept getting worse. \"I just couldn't do the things I love to do anymore,\" she said. \"It was really bad. I couldn't straighten it all the way. I couldn't flex it all the way. And so, I was just stuck in this half-state that ended up causing hip pain, back pain, neck pain. It wasn't just my knee, unfortunately. It was kind of everything. It's like you get to the end of your rope and you gotta make a decision. So, I did.\"",
      "A knee replacement \u2013 the outer portion of her right knee is now titanium.",
      "But she didn't do it just to get back into skiing. \"I don't need to ski,\" she said. \"I am Lindsey. I am not a skier; I'm a person that loves to ski. And that's a really big distinction for me, in my mind, in my heart.\"",
      "I asked, \"How soon afterwards did you wonder how far you could push it?\"",
      "\"It was pretty quickly after!\" she laughed.",
      "Only four months, in fact. She took her coaches to New Zealand to acquaint her new knee with her old sport. \"It just was such a drastic difference that I thought, well, if I can do all of these things that used to hurt me before, where would that take me? And my mind starts to wander, and here we are.\"",
      "And where she is, is back on the U.S. ski team, hoping to qualify for one more trip to the Olympics: Italy 2026.",
      "\"I will be at a disadvantage,\" Vonn said. \"I am 40, and at that time next year I will be 41. But I know my skiing is there. I think I'm actually skiing better now than I was last few years of my career.\"",
      "She admits there has been some good-natured ribbing: \"For sure. There's one girl that calls me Grandma, which I don't exactly appreciate! But there's definitely some jokes around the team that, you know, I raced in my first Olympics before one of the girls was born.\"",
      "She knew there would be some raised eyebrows, but she got more than that, with some critics going so far as to question her sanity. \"These past few weeks have been tough,\" she posted on Instagram last month. \"I know they are only a few voices out of many\u2026 But it still hurts.\"",
      "A post shared by L I N D S E Y  \u2022  V O N N (@lindseyvonn)",
      "She told us, \"What I didn't expect was people to criticize me as a person and why I'm doing it, and that I can't handle life outside of ski racing.\"",
      "She dismisses most of it, choosing to concentrate on training smarter, not harder. \"It's not like I'm preparing for another ten years of my skiing career,\" she said. \"I'm just preparing for one year, for literally two races.\"",
      "She's put the rest of her life on hold for the moment \u2013 a single goal does require a singularity of focus, much like making her banana bread does. And there's a purpose to that: \"I need to put on weight, man,\" she said. \"I'm about 20 pounds less than when I was racing before.\"",
      "That brand of determination, she says, came from her mom, Lindy Lund. \"She would have given anything to play tennis, to play squash, to ride a bike, and she couldn't,\" Vonn said.",
      "Her mom suffered a stroke while pregnant with Lindsey in 1984. It was debilitating, but she soldiered on without complaint. When she was diagnosed with ALS (once known as Lou Gehrig's Disease), she \u2013 like her daughter \u2013 wasn't about to give up. \"She thought that she could beat the odds, and she could be the one that would live 20 more years, and she lasted one,\" Vonn said. \"Man, it was hard. I still got her number in my phone. I still message her.\"",
      "She said her mom would want her to be flying high once again, even though winning another downhill will be an uphill battle. In a sport measured in hundredths of a second, the difference between first and last can be miniscule. But on this second go-around, Lindsey Vonn is taking time to savor the view just as much as the chase.",
      "\"The fact that I'm even talking about going to the Olympics right now is something I never thought I would ever do,\" she said. \"So, I'm already winning!\"",

      "Daffodils",
      "Sprouting in beautiful shades of yellow, orange, peach, white, cream, and even pink, daffodils\u2014known by their botanical name Narcissus\u2014are an early sign that spring has sprung.",
      "Some tried-and-true cultivars are the 'Golden Ducat', 'Rip Van Winkle', and 'Petit Four'\u2014all examples of the double daffodil, featuring one or more flowers to a stem. Another common variety is the trumpet daffodil, which has a center that is as long or longer than its petals. Large-cupped daffodils are defined by their prominent cups, while small-cup iterations have short cups that are less than one-third the length of the petals.",
      "Don't worry about recognizing all the different varieties; just choose what you like from your local garden center or online resource. Because no matter the type, daffodils (and other small bulbs) are so rewarding. The blooms last for two or three weeks in the garden and bring such color to your landscape. They are also low maintenance.",
      "Here are some tips to help you make the most of these perennial crowd-pleasers.",
      "Daffodils are winter-hardy in zones 3 through 8 and will return to bloom again year after year so long as they are planted in full or partial sun and in any soil that's not soggy.If your goal is to have drifts of daffodils, include varieties recommended for naturalizing and forming carpets on lawns and into woodlands. That way, the 100 bulbs you plant this fall will gradually multiply to 300, then 600, then 1,000, and so on.When planting en masse, it helps to create a planting \"map\" in advance on paper that can be transferred onto the ground with granular lime, as Martha does (see photo).Daffodil bulbs should be planted about two to three times as deep as the bulbs are high, so if you have one that's 2 inches tall, plant it 4 to 6 inches below the top of the soil.When harvesting for arrangements, grasp the stem at the base and pull rather than cutting, as viruses in bulbs can be passed along to other plants when using pruners to trim stems.Don't cut back daffodils too soon. Once the flowers bloom and fade, allow the whole plant to die back to the ground to create food for the bulbs so they can multiply.After removing spent foliage, apply a balanced 10-10-10 fertilizer over the entire area, and then add a layer of mulch. Fertilize the area again in the fall.",

      "Harp Oletsky's First Memory",
      "It is nowhere you chose to be, and yet here you are. Papa steers your shoulders into the heart of the jack drive. Hundreds of rabbits stare at you through the wire around the fence posts. It feels like looking into the mirror. They do not want to be in this story either. Men have been working since dawn to herd the wild jacks into this pen. The town has gathered to solve the problem of the rabbits, who chew through rangeland and cropland, who eat the golden wheat your papa turns into money. Worse than the locusts, says Papa. Every hide brings a penny bounty. So many turnipy sweating bodies and a festive feeling in the air like a penny rubbed between two fingers, like blood shocked into a socket. A smell that reminds you of the room where babies are born. When you try to turn and run away, Papa grabs you. There's Mr. O'Malley, Mr. Waldowko, Mr. Zalewski, Mrs. Haage. You can't remember any more names. A hundred jointed arms come swinging into the pen that is alive with jackrabbits, the place of no escape. Now there is only madness. Terror of cudgels, terror of ax handles and hammers, terror of being trampled. \"Papa! Help! Stop!\" Rabbits run over your feet. \"Settle down, Harp\u2014\u00ad \" Papa is angry. He pours your name over your head like scalding water. The rabbits are angry. The rabbits are crying and dying, the clubs coming down, down, down. \"If you ain't gonna help, stay clear of us, boy\u2014\u00ad \" You are six today. Your family will have a party after supper. The cake was cooling when you left for town. You feel sick thinking about it. Cherries come slopping out of the rabbits. Gray skins are splitting, slipping under bootheels and wooden bats. Papa shows you what to target: the skulls and the spines of the screaming jacks. It's the fastest way to stop their screaming. There is another way, a voice cries out inside you. Smash it flat. You watch Papa click into his rhythm and begin to kill alongside the rest of the men.",
      "You meet your baby sister's gaze through the fan of her clean fingers. Lada is sitting on your mother's lap. Three girls you know are watching from outside the fence. The girls are allowed to squeal and shield their faces. You wish you were a girl with them. Down, down, down come the clubs and the planks. Your stomach bulges and flattens. You are screaming with the rabbits. Your birthday wish is to get to the end of this sound. Quiet comes at last. The men's arms rest against their sides like tools in a shed. Women are hanging the dead jacks to dry by their long ears. Every twitching rabbit's foot has stilled. Inside of you, the screaming continues. It goes on and on and on. Papa finds you where you have hidden your eyes behind your hands, your tears inside your palms. \"We can't let the jacks overrun the whole prairie. No one likes it, Son.\" This is a lie. Many had liked it. You shut your eyes along with the dead rabbits, because you did not want to see whose faces were smiling.",
      "\"Here,\" says Papa. \"One is still living. You cannot be softhearted, Harp.\"",
      "Your father puts the club in your hands. And after that, you are always afraid.",

    "story": [
      "Former heart surgeon and television host Dr. Mehmet Oz is set to face questions Friday from the Senate's finance committee over his nomination to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Trump.",
      "After Friday's hearing, the GOP-led finance committee will schedule a vote on whether to send Oz's nomination to the full Senate, where he is likely to be approved given the Republican majority. If confirmed, Oz would be the administrator charged with overseeing the nearly $1.5 trillion spent by the federal government on Medicare and Medicaid. The two health insurance programs for seniors and poor Americans make up more than a third of the budget.",
      "Medicare covers around 65 million people, through programs run directly by the federal government or contracted out to private insurers. Medicaid supports around 85 million, through programs administered primarily by state governments overseen by CMS.",
      "It will be up to Oz to finalize or abandon some major changes to Medicare and Medicaid sought by the Biden administration, like a pricey proposal in November to expand coverage to drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy and Ozempic.",
      "Oz is also expected to face questions over the significant authority he would wield over private health insurance as CMS administrator.",
      "On Monday, CMS proposed making several moves to reverse Biden administration expansions to the insurance marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, like shortening the open enrollment period and excluding DACA recipients from coverage. In 2022, Oz said that the law \"caused havoc on our health care system\" and that he \"wouldn't have voted for it.\"",
      "Oz will be the fourth of Trump's health official picks to face questioning from senators. It comes a day after a hearing for Dr. David Weldon was abruptly canceled, after the White House withdrew his nomination to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "A majority of senators on the Senate's health committee advanced Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the president's nominee to head the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Marty Makary, the pick to head the Food and Drug Administration, on Thursday.",
      "Oz's potential new supervisor, Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was narrowly confirmed by the Senate a month ago.",
      "In social media posts last month, Oz has touted \"great conversations\" with key Republicans he would need to win over for his nomination.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the Republican chair of the Senate's health committee, was among those to sit down with Oz last month. Cassidy is one of four medical doctors in the Senate.",
      "\"Great meeting with Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Trump's nominee to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. It will be great to have a doctor in charge,\" Cassidy posted on Feb. 5.",
      "The president's pick to head CMS has earned criticism from some Senate Democrats, who have cited Oz's past embrace of \"alarming pseudoscience,\" record of anti-abortion statements and worries over conflicts of interest.",
      "Oz previously worked as a professor of cardiac surgery at Columbia University and host of \"The Dr. Oz Show\" until 2022, when he stopped taping new television episodes to run for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania.",
      "He lost that Senate race to Democrat John Fetterman, in a narrow contest where abortion had ranked as a top issue for voters.",
      "As part of an ethics agreement published last month, Oz said he will resign from positions at several companies, including the nutritional supplement company iHerb and the drugmaker Housey Pharma. He also pledged to divest from several healthcare companies, including insurance giant UnitedHealth Group.",
      "After the Senate race, Oz had been advertised as iHerb's global advisor. He continued to promote iHerb's supplements on social media after his nomination.",
      "He has also continued to republish past excerpts from his show in recent years after the Senate race, like a clip he shared on Sept. 4 from a sponsored interview about Medicare Advantage coverage. In 2020, Oz would later propose that Medicare Advantage should be expanded to all Americans.",
      "In the clip, Oz said that enrollment in Medicare Advantage had grown 70% since he started his show. Just over half of seniors have opted for these plans, according to the latest federal data, instead of \"original Medicare\" coverage.",
      "\"I want to nudge you. I don't want to shove you. But think about this, because a 70% increase since I started the show means a lot to me,\" he said.",

      "An administration official who was asked about why Weldon's nomination was withdrawn responded, \"It was clear he did not have the votes in the Senate.\"",
      "Weldon, a vaccine critic, was set to appear before the Senate's health committee on Thursday for his confirmation hearing, and news of the withdrawal of his nomination came less than an hour before the hearing was to begin. Axios first reported news of Weldon's nomination being pulled.",
      "The committee was expected to question him about his long record of criticizing vaccines and the agency he was nominated to lead. Weldon is a physician and a former Republican member of Congress.",
      "In a statement obtained by CBS News, Weldon said that Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0was \"very upset\" at his nomination being pulled. Weldon said he had received a call from the White House 12 hours before the scheduled hearing, informing him that the nomination would be withdrawn.",
      "\"Bobby Kennedy is a good man who really is passionate about improving the health of the American people,\" Weldon said. \"President Trump did a good thing in making him secretary of HHS.  Hopefully they can find someone for CDC who can survive the confirmation process and get past pharma and find some answers.\"",
      "Weldon said that Maine Sen. Susan Collins had told Kennedy she had reservations about his nomination and said the Republican senator's staff had been \"very hostile\" in a meeting with him.",
      "Collins' staff repeatedly accused him of being against vaccines, Weldon said, \"even though I reminded them that I actually give hundreds of vaccines every year in my medical practice.\"",
      "Speaking with reporters Thursday, Collins said Weldon's withdrawal came as a surprise to her and that she had planned to give him a chance to respond at the hearing.",
      "\"I did not express concerns to the White House. I had some reservations, but I certainly had not reached a final judgment,\" Collins said.",
      "Multiple people familiar with Weldon's Senate meetings said Republicans had been concerned over his answers when asked about his priorities for the agency. Weldon wanted to detail his priorities for the CDC after being confirmed and learning more about the agency as director.",
      "Weldon was unfamiliar with the CDC's current budget and workforce, telling congressional staffers he was busy with his medical practice and did not want to waste time reading up on an agency he might not be confirmed to lead, they said.",
      "Two people said Collins' staff had only asked Weldon how he would address the perception that he was against vaccines, but denied accusing him of being \"anti-vaccine.\"",
      "Weldon said that over 20 years ago, while in Congress, he raised concerns about childhood vaccine safety, and \"for some reason Collins staff suddenly couldn't get over that.\"",
      "He also claimed that another senator, Louisiana Republican Dr. Bill Cassidy, had also said he was anti-vaccine and had once asked for his nomination to be withdrawn.",
      "A spokesperson for Cassidy denied that he had asked the White House for Weldon's nomination to be withdrawn. Cassidy had been \"looking forward\" to Thursday's hearing with Weldon, the spokesperson said.",
      "The CDC has faced mounting questions from senators in recent weeks over moves to reopen studies into whether vaccines are linked to autism and also over an abruptly canceled meeting of the agency's outside immunization advisers, which has yet to be rescheduled.",
      "Kennedy has also faced criticism this week for inflating the risks of measles vaccines when discussing the\u00a0record outbreak\u00a0in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Kennedy, whose department oversees the CDC, also has a history of\u00a0criticizing vaccines.",
      "After a meeting with Sen. Patty Murray last month, the Washington Democrat said she was \"deeply disturbed to hear Dr. Weldon repeat debunked claims about vaccines.\"",
      "\"As we face one of the worst measles outbreaks in years thanks to President Trump, a vaccine skeptic who spent years spreading lies about safe and proven vaccines should never have even been under consideration to lead the foremost agency charged with protecting public health,\" Murray said in a statement Thursday.",

    "summary": "Federal agencies will begin to vacate hundreds of offices nationwide this summer under a frenetic and error-prone push by DOGE to scrap leases it says waste money.",
    "story": [
      "Federal agencies will begin to vacate hundreds of offices across the country this summer under a frenetic and error-riddled push by Elon Musk's budget-cutting advisers to terminate leases that they say waste money.",
      "The White House's Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk heads, maintains a list of canceled real estate leases on its website, but internal documents obtained by The Associated Press contain a crucial detail: when those cancellations are expected to take effect. The documents from inside the General Services Administration, the U.S. government's real estate manager, list dozens of federal office and building leases expected to end by June 30, with hundreds more slated over the coming months.",
      "The rapid pace of cancellations has raised alarms, with some agencies and lawmakers appealing to DOGE to exempt specific buildings. Several agencies are facing 20 or more lease cancellations in all, including the IRS, the Social Security Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Many of the terminations would affect agencies that aren't as well-known but oversee services critical to many Americans.",
      "They span from a Boise, Idaho, office of the Bureau of Reclamation - which oversees water supply and deals with disputes across the often-parched American West, to a Joliet, Illinois, outpost of the Railroad Retirement Board, which provides benefits for railroad workers and their survivors.",
      "The lease terminations don't mean all the locations will close. In some cases, agencies may negotiate new leases to stay in place, downsize their existing space or relocate elsewhere.",
      "\"Some agencies are saying: 'I'm not leaving. We can't leave,'\" said Chad Becker, a former GSA real estate official who now represents building owners with government leases at Arco Real Estate Solutions. \"I think there's going to be a period of pushback, a period of disbelief. And then, if necessary, they may start working on the actual execution of a move.\"",
      "DOGE says GSA has notified landlords in recent weeks that it plans to terminate 793 leases, focusing mostly on those that can be ended within months without penalty. The group estimates those moves will save roughly $500 million over the terms of the leases, which in some cases were slated to continue into the 2030s. The Bureau of Reclamation cancellation in Boise, for instance, would take effect Aug. 31 and is expected to save a total of $18.7 million through 2035.",
      "But DOGE's savings estimates - a fraction of Musk's $1 trillion cost-cutting goal - haven't been verified and don't take into account the costs of moves and closures. The group hasn't released any information about what they would mean for agencies.",
      "\"My initial reaction is this is just going to cause more chaos,\" said Jim Simpson, an accountant in Arizona who helps low-income people file taxes and serves on an IRS panel that advocates for taxpayers. \"There's a lot of room to help with government efficiency, but it should be done surgically and not with a chainsaw.\"",
      "Simpson said he was surprised to learn that dozens of IRS offices, including local taxpayer assistance centers, were facing upcoming lease cancellations. He refers clients there to get paperwork to file returns and answer IRS inquiries, and he said losing services would \"cause a lot of anxiety\" and delay refunds.",
      "DOGE scrapping some lease cancelations due to mistakes",
      "Plans to cancel the leases at several of the IRS centers and other sites were in error and have been rescinded, according to a person with direct knowledge of the changes who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity in order to avoid retaliation. Those changes aren't reflected yet on DOGE's list, which only removed one and added dozens more in its latest update published Thursday.",
      "The GSA walked back the cancellation of a Geological Survey office in Anchorage, Alaska, for instance, after learning it didn't have termination rights, according to the person familiar with the matter.",
      "Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said Monday that he'd convinced DOGE to back off lease terminations planned for the National Weather Center in Norman, a Social Security office in Lawton and the Indian Health Services office in Oklahoma City. But all three leases remained on DOGE's list of cancellations as of Thursday.",
      "GSA's press office didn't respond to inquiries.",
      "DOGE push took many by surprise",
      "While there was already a bipartisan push to reduce the government's real estate footprint, the mass cancellations blindsided an industry known for its stability.",
      "Landlords who'd been expecting government agencies to remain tenants \u2014 for several more years in some cases under their existing leases \u2014 were stunned. Some agencies learned from building managers, not their federal partners, that their leases were being canceled, according to real estate managers.",
      "Some cancelations could incur extra costs",
      "Becker, whose firm is tracking the DOGE lease cancellations, and other observers said they expect some agencies will be unable to move their personnel and property out of their spaces within such tight timelines. That may force some agencies to pay additional rent during what's known as a holdover period, undermining DOGE's stated goal of saving taxpayer money.",
      "The Building Owners and Managers Association, which represents the commercial real estate industry, told landlords in a recent advocacy alert to be prepared to seek payment from any federal government tenants who stay beyond their leases.",
      "Asked about plans for buildings with leases that will soon expire, the IRS didn't respond. A Social Security Administration spokesperson downplayed the impact of its offices losing leases, saying many were \"small remote hearing sites,\" didn't serve the public, were already being consolidated elsewhere or planned for closure.",
      "Several other agencies provided little clarity - saying they were working with GSA to consider their options, in statements that were nearly identical in some cases.",
      "But a spokesperson for the Railroad Retirement Board expressed concern over the upcoming lease cancellations of its offices in Joliet, Illinois, and eight other states, saying it was working to \"maintain a public-facing office presence for the local railroad community.\"",
      "Trimming federal real estate was already underway",
      "Government Accountability Office official David Marroni told a congressional hearing last week that the push to unload unnecessary federal real estate was \"long overdue,\" saying agencies have for too long held onto unnecessary space. But he warned the downsizing must be deliberate and carefully planned to \"generate substantial savings and mitigate the risk of mistakes and unexpected mission impacts.\"",
      "That process had already started before Musk's team arrived, with the federal government's real estate portfolio steadily declining over the last decade. Indeed, critics of DOGE say if it were truly interested in cost-cutting it could learn from GSA, whose mission even before Mr. Trump took office was to deliver \"effective and efficient\" services to the American public.",
      "A law signed by former President Joe Biden before he left office in January directed agencies to measure the true occupancy rates of leased spaces by this summer. Those that didn't meet a target of 60% use rate over time would be directed to dispose of their excess space.",
      "\"There is a logical and orderly way to do this,\" Rep. Greg Stanton, an Arizona Democrat, said at last week's hearing. Instead, he said, DOGE is pursuing a reckless approach that threatens to harm the delivery of public services.",
      "Industry observers cautioned that each situation is different and it will take months or years to understand the full impact of the lease cancellations.",
      "\"It really depends on the terms. But it is a shock, there is no question, that all of a sudden, boom, in six weeks all these things have happened,\" said J. Reid Cummings, a professor of finance and real estate at the University of South Alabama. \"It's like a blitzkrieg.\""

Led by billionaire Elon Musk, DOGE has\u00a0abruptly terminated thousands of federal workers\u00a0over the last three weeks, causing turmoil across multiple departments.",
      "The deadline for SSA workers to accept the \"voluntary separation incentive payments\"\u00a0is Friday, March 14. Those who opt in must leave the agency by April 19.",
      "Last month, the agency said it aims to cut the size of its workforce by 7,000 people, focusing on workers and jobs that don't \"provide mission critical services.\"",
      "Former SSA Commissioner Martin O'Malley, who led the agency under the Biden administration from December 2023 to November 2024, expects the actual number to be closer to 10,000 workers. The agency currently employs roughly 57,000 people.",
      "\"Everybody who can is going to take that early out, but I think that 7,000 number is conservative,\" O'Malley said Thursday at a panel discussion on recent changes at the agency and how they could affect customer service, held by the National Academy of Social Insurance (NASI), a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization.",
      "\"They are all going to take it,\" he said, adding that employees who choose to stay, will risk losing their jobs without a bonus.",

      "The amount of the SSA incentive payments being offered individual workers depends on the employee's classification, or where they stand on the federal payscale. The highest-tier worker would receive a maximum of $25,000.",

      "\"If this tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% tariff on all wines, champagnes, & alcoholic products coming out of France and other E.U. represented countries,\" he wrote. \"This will be great for the wine and champagne businesses in the U.S.\"",
      "Mr. Trump accused the EU of being \"one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the world.\"",
      "Since returning to office, the president has threatened tariffs, and imposed the levies, on a host of major U.S. trading partners. On Wednesday, he increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%, prompting retaliatory action from the EU.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement Wednesday that the countermeasures from the EU are worth 26 billion euros, or $28 billion. The tariffs, set to take effect April 1, target a range of U.S. exports, including beef, poultry, bourbon, jeans and peanut butter.",
      "\"We deeply regret this measure,\" von der Leyen said. \"Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business, and worse for consumers. They are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy. Jobs are at stake. Prices will go up.\"",
      "The U.S. exported $1.2 billion in wine and related products in 2024, including more than $167 million to the EU, according to the Department of Agriculture. It is the top importer of wine, bringing in nearly $4.9 billion worth in 2023. France and Italy were the top partners for importing both wine and Champagne into the U.S.",
      "Champagne is a sparkling wine from the Champagne region in northeast France. If it is made outside of that region, it is called sparkling wine.",
      "Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council, a trade group representing the U.S. spirits industry, called the EU's announcement to reimpose heightened tariffs on American whiskey \"deeply disappointing\"",
      "\"Reimposing these debilitating tariffs at a time when the spirits industry continues to face a slowdown in U.S. marketplace will further curtail growth and negatively impact distillers and farmers in states across the country,\" Swonger said in a statement. \"We urge the U.S. and EU governments to come to a resolution that gets our spirits industry back to zero-for-zero tariffs.\"",
      "According to the Distilled Spirits Council, a retaliatory tariff imposed in 2018 during Mr. Trump's first term, caused exports of U.S.-made whiskey to drop 20%. But over the last three years, exports to the EU grew nearly 60% from $439 million in 2021 to $699 million in 2024, the trade group said.",
      "Since returning to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has made tariffs a key area of his economic agenda, though the levies have sparked concerns of a recession and roiled the stock market. The president declined to rule out the possibility of an economic downturn, telling Fox News in an interview that aired Sunday that \"there is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday that Mr. Trump's economic policies are \"the most important thing America has ever had\" when asked whether they would be worth it if they lead to a recession. \"It's worth it.\"",
      "Lutnick added, \"The only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here.\"",
      "The president's trade war escalated this month with 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tax on goods imported from China, taking effect last week. Beijing imposed retaliatory measures that went into force Monday that target U.S. farmers with levies of 15% on chicken, wheat and corn, and 10% on soybeans, pork, beef and fruit.",
      "The president, however, swiftly reversed course on the levies on imports from Mexico and Canada, pausing the tariffs covered under a 2020 trade deal negotiated during his first administration until April 2. That agreement, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, covers the majority of goods imported from Mexico. Those that are not subject to the deal, however, still face tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump has also exempted other products from his planned tariffs, including providing a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers that were bracing to be hit hard\u00a0by the levies on vehicle parts and components imported from Canada, Mexico and China.",

      "\"I think it's a lot of uncertainty at the moment,\" Martin said in an interview with CBS News on Thursday. \"Overall, tariffs are damaging to trade, damaging to businesses, but also damaging to consumers, because they will lead to an increase in prices for consumers. I don't think that's good, either way. So, we would hope that in the fullness of time that these things will settle down and that there would be negotiation, trade negotiations, to arrive at a landing zone that people can cope with and can accommodate.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has imposed steep tariffs on Canadian goods, citing trade imbalances and drug trafficking. But many of his claims exaggerate or misrepresent the facts.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has made a number of inaccurate claims about Canada in the past week as he imposed new tariff hikes on the country and touted his plans for more.",
      "On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump imposed a blanket 25% tariff on foreign steel and aluminum, significantly impacting Canada, the largest foreign supplier of these metals to the U.S. An additional 25% tariff on most Canadian goods is set to go into effect on April 2.",
      "Experts warn these hikes could lead to increases in consumer prices, but Mr. Trump has justified them in part by saying he's protecting American manufacturers and incentivizing Canada to crack down on drug crime.",
      "However, in interviews and social media posts, Mr. Trump has exaggerated the size of the U.S.trade deficit with Canada and the amount of fentanyl coming over the northern border. The president also misrepresented Canada's tariffs on U.S. dairy and lumber products.",
      "Here's a breakdown of some of these claims:",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has tariffs above 200% on U.S. dairy products",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"In Canada, we find that they're charging us over 200% for dairy products\u2026 And when I left, we had that well taken care of, but under Biden they just kept raising it.\"",
      "Details: President Trump has suggested Canada unfairly put tariffs of over 200% on American dairy products during President Biden's term, but the level has been unchanged since before Biden took office.",
      "The over 200% tariffs on U.S. dairy products are only triggered if U.S. dairy exports exceed certain yearly duty-free limits, and U.S. dairy manufacturers say they have never been close to exceeding these limits.",
      "Additionally, these tariffs were negotiated during the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Mr. Trump signed during his first term. Canada's published tariff lists for 2020 and 2025 show tariffs on U.S. dairy products have remained unchanged from the end of his first term through the end of President Biden's term. For example, both lists show the same tariff rate of 245.5% for any cheese products above the duty-free limit.",
      "Canadian Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman told told CBS News the dairy tariffs are in place to \"protect our farmers and families.\" Canada is the second-largest importer of U.S. dairy, purchasing about $1.1 billion worth in 2024.",
      "The U.S. sold roughly double the amount of dairy to Canada as Canada sold to the U.S. last year, according to trade data from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has a \"tremendously high tariff\" on lumber while the U.S. charges \"a tiny fraction of that\"",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"They have a tremendously high tariff, give you the exact numbers in a little while coming out, on lumber. So, they sell us lumber, they have a tremendous tariff. They make it impossible for us to sell lumber or dairy products into Canada, but our numbers are a tiny fraction of that, almost non-existent.\"",
      "Details: On March 4, Canada imposed a tariff of 25% on softwood lumber from the U.S., a rate that is high compared to recent history.",
      "But Mr. Trump did not mention these tariffs are part of Canada's response to the 25% levies on most Canadian goods, including lumber, that the Trump administration initially announced in early March, which are now expected to take effect on April 2.",
      "Before this trade escalation, Canada had imposed zero tariffs on U.S. softwood lumber for years, according to Dustin Jalbert, a senior economist at Fastmarkets who covers wood products.",
      "\"It's certainly true that right now there are tariffs in place, but that was not the case before the kickoff of the trade war. These are retaliatory to what the U.S. instigated, if you will, in early March,\" Jalbert said.",
      "The U.S. had previously placed duties on imported softwood lumber, with tariffs on Canadian lumber rising from 8% to 14.5% in 2024.",
      "Trump's false claim that the U.S. has a $200 billion trade deficit with Canada",
      "President Trump\u00a0said\u00a0March 13:\u00a0\"In the case of Canada, we're spending $200 billion a year to subsidize Canada.\"\u00a0And on Feb. 26 he said: \"The tariffs will make it impossible for them to sell lumber or anything else into the United States. And all I'm asking to do is break even or lose a little bit, but not lose $200 billion.\"",
      "Details: Mr. Trump has repeatedly exaggerated the U.S.-Canada trade deficit, claiming it's as large as $200 billion.",
      "In fact, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services with Canada in 2024 was closer to $35.7 billion, according to the latest trade data released from the U.S. Census Bureau on March 6.\u00a0 That trade deficit narrowed from $40.6 billion in 2023.",
      "For goods alone, the U.S. bought $70.6 billion more in goods from Canada than it sold in 2024, down from $72.3 billion in 2023.",
      "The overwhelming driver of the deficit with Canada is that the U.S. buys a lot of unrefined oil from the country, according to Julian Karaguesian, a lecturer at the department of economics at McGill University.",
      "\"A lot of Canadian economists say if you take out energy, Canada is running a small deficit with the United States,\" Karaguesian said.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that large amounts of fentanyl come from Canada",
      "President Trump said in his address to Congress\u00a0March 4: \"Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. But even more importantly, they have allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.\"",
      "Details: Mr. Trump has cited Canada's failure to halt the flow of illicit drugs as a reason for imposing tariffs, saying that fentanyl has been coming from the country \"at levels never seen before.\" He claimed, \"The fentanyl coming through Canada is massive.\"",
      "However, Mr. Trump overstates the amount of fentanyl coming across the northern border. In 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the U.S.-Canada border, accounting for roughly 0.2% of all fentanyl seized by CBP that year. By contrast, approximately 21,100 pounds \u2014 about 96.6% of the total \u2014 was seized at the southern border.",

The company at the time added that it would also end all personalized discounts and discount partnerships for groups including teachers, military personnel and health care workers.",

In other words, the court decides if the retailer may continue to honor gift cards through a given date.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture is cutting two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers, part of what the agency said was a decision to \"return to long-term, fiscally responsible initiatives.\"",
      "The move cancels about $660 million in funding this year for the Local Food for Schools program, which is active in 40 U.S. states, as well as about $420 million for a second program called the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement, which helps food banks and other local groups provide food to their communities.",

      "The decision comes as the Trump administration and Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, say they are slashing federal spending to reduce government waste. The USDA programs were funded through the agency's Commodity Credit Corporation, a Depression-era fund created to buy products directly from farmers.",
      "\"Unlike the Biden Administration, which funneled billions in [Commodity Credit Corporation] funds into short-term programs with no plan for longevity, USDA is prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact,\" a USDA spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In recent days, schools were alerted that they were set to lose $660 million in federal funding for the current year, according to Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations for the School Nutrition Association, which represents thousands of school meal employees. The withdrawal of funding will affect schools across the U.S. at a time when they're already grappling with high food costs, she said.",
      "\"It's a pretty big hit\"",
      "One of those school districts said the USDA's decision will wipe out $100,000 in funding that it had planned to spend on local beef and produce for students' school meals.",
      "\"It's a pretty big hit, and that's mostly fresh fruits and vegetables,\" said Patti Bilbrey, director of nutrition services at the Scottsdale Unified School District in Arizona. \"It wasn't just about keeping food costs low \u2014 it meant supporting your community and your local farmers in your state.\"",
      "While the $100,000 represents about 2% of the school district's roughly $6 million in annual spending on food, Bilbrey noted that it allowed the district to buy food ffrom small farmers and introduce produce like microgreens to their students. She added that the funding loss comes as her district, like many others, are struggling to keep school meals affordable amid rising food and labor costs.",
      "The Local Food for Schools program \"was a godsend to us,\" Bilbrey said. \"It keeps our meal costs down, and we're helping our community, which improves the perception of school meals.\"",
      "One farmer in Massachusetts told CBS News Boston that she was concerned the funding cut could hurt her business. Katie Carlson, president of Carlson Orchards in Harvard, Massachusetts, said the Worcester Regional Food Hub, which connects school districts with food from local farmers through the USDA program, had been a reliable customer.",
      "\"We know that this time of year we can count on the Worcester Food Hub,\" Carlson said. \"They may not be huge orders every week, but we know that they're coming to take something every week, so if that were to all of a sudden drop off [...] It's just not, not good.\"",

      "When the judge asked if the agency's challenges were due to recent cuts in the federal government, Cohen said it was, adding that some employees chose to leave the FTC following the \"Fork in the road\" email sent by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency in January. Staff members who resigned for other reasons also have not been replaced due to a government hiring freeze, he said.",
      "The Amazon trial had been scheduled to start in September. The FTC is seeking to relax some of the deadlines in the case and a delay akin to a two-month continuance. The agency does not want to \"move the trial back more than a couple of months,\" Cohen said.",
      "Currently, the agency's legal team is \"racing at considerable cost\" to meet a late April deadline for discovery while at the same time dealing with restrictive rules on purchasing court documents and travel, Cohen explained.",
      "Other factors could hamper staffers' preparations for the trial, he said. In April, FTC employees will have to spend time packing up and vacating their office building so they can potentially move into \"an abandoned USAID facility,\" Cohen said.",
      "Chun, the judge, asked how \"things are going to be different in two months\" with the issues the agency is experiencing.",

      "Even in the case of staff turnover, the government still lacks the grounds to seek a delay since changes in legal teams happen often, Hueston argued. Amazon executives and trial lawyers already cleared their schedules for a September trial, and the company has wanted to clear its name for more than two years, he said.",

Attorneys for that case, which is scheduled to go to trial in October 2026, presented economic arguments in court last week.",
      "Like other tech companies, Amazon has been attempting to forge friendlier ties with President Donald Trump, who repeatedly criticized the company during his first term.",

      "By the numbers",
      "The Consumer Price Index was forecast to rise 2.9% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "February's data comes after inflation accelerated in January, when it rose 3% on an annual basis.",
      "What economists say",
      "The report shows \"further signs of progress on underlying inflation, with the pace of price increases moderating after January's strong release,\" said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "Despite the lower-than-expected inflation, the Federal Reserve is still likely to hold off on cutting rates at its March 19 meeting, Haigh noted. \"[The] combination of easing inflationary pressures and rising downside risks to growth suggest that the Fed is moving closer to continuing its easing cycle,\" Haigh said.",
      "Grocery prices are continuing to rise, with groceries increasing 2.6% in February from a year earlier, the CPI report said. The ongoing rise of food costs is creating a financial pinch for many households, economists note.",
      "Egg prices were a driver of last month's grocery inflation, with the cost of eggs jumping 58.8% from a year earlier, the report said. Coffee rose 6% on an annual basis, while restaurant meals jumped 3.7% from a year ago.",
      "Food inflation has been \"gradually accelerating since mid-2024, reaching almost 5% on a 3-month annualized basis\" in January, according to Morgan Stanley economists in a March 6 research note.",
      "Other items that saw price hikes in February include car insurance, which rose 11.1% on an annual basis, and medical care, which rose 3% from a year ago. Meanwhile, President Trump's tariff barrage has the potential to boost prices for many products, from food imports to automobiles, adding to an uncertain outlook for inflation, economists say.",
      "\"Good news on inflation, but good news pre-tariffs,\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. \"Unfortunately, three main pain points for consumer budgets \u2014 shelter, medical care and car insurance \u2014 had substantial increases.\"",
      "What it means for your money",
      "Even though the inflation data came in lighter than expected, price increases are still pacing well above the Fed's 2% annual goal. Because of that, economists say it's unlikely the Fed will cut rates at its meeting next week.",
      "That means consumers and businesses will continue to face higher borrowing costs for longer, while still grappling with elevated price hikes, economists say.",
      "\"The Federal Reserve will remain firmly planted on the sidelines at next week's meeting,\" Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride said on Wednesday. \"Inflation readings still need to show sustained progress toward 2%, and the recent economic uncertainty will make them ever more data-dependent in the coming weeks and months.\"",

    "summary": "Here are some of the products that are likely to cost more under President Trump's 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports.",
    "story": [
      "Sweeping 25% tariffs on all U.S. steel and aluminum imports\u00a0could cause prices on a range of consumers foods, including cars and washing machines, to rise. Components used in manufacturing and for construction such as nails, could also become more expensive.",
      "Anything that's made with metal, from homes and cars to canned foods and beverages could soon get a new and higher price tag.",
      "\"All manufacturing that uses steel or aluminum, or uses something that uses steel and aluminum will be affected,\" international trade expert Christine McDaniel, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Dr. Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow and director at the Pacific Research Institute, a right-leaning think tank, called the forthcoming tariff impact \"a barn burner,\" leading to higher prices and an economic slowdown.",
      "He added that all \"broad-based core commodities\" are vulnerable to price hikes as a result of the levies. In addition to automobiles and electronics, which rely heavily on metals, that includes less obvious goods like canned goods, whose prices could rise if packaging costs jump.",
      "\"We are going to see it in places you don't expect it,\" Winegarden said.",
      "American consumers likely to see higher prices on cars and more",
      "Car, truck, bus and tractor parts were the largest import category by volume last year, that will be covered under the tariffs, according to the United States International Trade Commission.",
      "American Automotive Policy Council, which represents Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, said the new tariffs \"will add significant costs for automakers, suppliers and consumers\" in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Inevitably, some of those added costs will be passed along to consumers.",
      "\"It is not easy for American companies that use steel and aluminum in production to find it elsewhere, so we'll see increases in prices. Makers of vehicles will face higher costs, which will be passed on to consumers,\" Layna Mosley, politics and international affairs professor at Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Metal parts on doors, window frames and other hardware used in the construction of housing will also be subject to the levies, leading to growing costs for homebuilders.",
      "Jim Tobin, CEO of the National Association of Home Builders, pointed to estimates showing that the metal tariffs could add up to $10,000 to the cost of a home, although he noted it is likely to take months for the impact to become clear. \"Those costs are going to be passed on to the ultimate homeowner or renter,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Machine parts, including steel wires, screws and more are also likely to be hit, raising the price of a broad range of appliances from dishwashers and dryers to garbage disposals and air conditioners.",
      "\"Just look around the house. Anything that has steel or aluminum in it will be exposed to tariffs,\" McDaniel said.",
      "Gym and sports equipment will also be tariffed, though manufacturers may have stockpiled some materials in anticipation of the tariffs going into effect, enabling them to head off price hikes for a short period, Mosley noted.",
      "Higher price for aluminum cans",
      "In addition to automakers, construction projects and possibly defense contractors, the tariffs would also increase costs to \"food processing and packaging including can manufacturers,\" Satyam Panday, chief economist, U.S. and Canada, S&P Global Ratings, said in a recent report.",
      "Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said in an earnings call last month said that the company imports aluminum for its cans, and that if tariffs make them more expensive, it could start selling more beverages in plastic bottles.",
      "\"As it relates to our strategies around ensuring affordability and ensuring consumer demand, if one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,\" Quincey said. \"For example, if aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET [plastic] bottles, et cetera.\"",
      "\"Tariffs and non-tariff barriers tend to disproportionately burden the small and midsize businesses,\" added Panday. \"Profits are likely to be squeezed at the margin. To the extent businesses can pass on the rising cost, consumers would also eventually see their prices increase. Overall, pressure on inflation would rise just as markets and consumers are appearing to be sensitive to inflationary expectations.\"",
      "For Brooklyn-based brewery Talea, the tariffs on aluminum, which the company uses for its beer cans, could lead to higher operating costs, co-founder LeAnn Darland recently told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady. Darland said she hopes to share any increased costs with suppliers, because she's not sure consumers will be willing to swallow any price hikes.",
      "Even without the tariffs, said Darland, \"Sometimes we get complaints that our beer is too expensive.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:31:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Consumers, businesses and investors are increasingly jittery about the risks of a protracted slump. So what exactly is a recession?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump sparked concerns this week when he declined to rule out the possibility of a U.S. recession this year. Asked on Fox news if he expects such a slump, Mr. Trump said, \"I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big.\"",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also seemed to leave open the possibility of a downturn, telling CBS News in an interview on Tuesday that Mr. Trump's economic policies are \"worth it\" even if they lead to a recession.",
      "While it is notoriously hard to predict a recession, there are definitive criteria that must be met in order for a business cycle to be considered recessionary. Here's what to know.",
      "What is a recession, and who decides if we're in one?",
      "A recession is generally defined as a broad-based, persistent decline in economic activity. The more popular metric is that a recession is two straight quarters of negative economic growth, although in fact there's more to it than.",
      "Recessions are identified by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a non-profit, nonpartisan research group that dates U.S. business cycles. To determine if the economy has entered a recession, NBER evaluates six key indicators: real personal income; non-farm payroll employment; employment as measured by the household survey; personal consumption; manufacturing and trade sales; and industrial production.",
      "More specifically, NBER looks at the depth of the changes in these indicators, how broadly a slump is affecting different industries and how long a downturn lasts. The upshot: In a recession, the decline in economic activity must be significant, sustained and widespread, rather than limited to a particular sector.",
      "Could the U.S. tumble into a recession anytime soon?",
      "For now, economic data suggest that's unlikely. Although layoffs around the country are rising, the U.S. labor market continues to create jobs at a decent clip. Despite economic growth slowing, it's not expected to fall off a cliff. In fact, Julia Pollack, chief economist at career site ZipRecruiter, notes that four of the six signals tracked by the NBER point to continued economic expansion.",
      "\"Right now, things feel uncomfortable given the significant amount of policy uncertainty, the federal layoffs, and we've seen business, consumer and investor sentiment fray,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So to some it feels like the economy is in a recession, but we are not there yet.\"",
      "Still, cracks are appearing that could portend a sharper downturn down the road. Retail spending, which is the lifeblood of the economy, is\u00a0waning, while measures of consumer confidence show a\u00a0sharp deterioration of late. Investor concerns about the Trump administration's barrage of tariffs on other nations has also slammed stock prices, which could further pressure spending.",
      "\"Negative consumption is concerning because consumer spending is backbone of U.S. economy,\" Pollack said. \"And it's not just that spending fell. Sentiment has fallen, household budgets are squeezed and consumers are more vulnerable to shocks, which has heightened recession fears.\"",
      "Sweet added, \"Right now, your traditional causes of a recession aren't flashing red, but we just have this suffocating effect of all the uncertainty around trade and fiscal policy and immigration.\"",
      "Lutnick, the Commerce Department chief, defends Mr. Trump's economic policies, saying they will boost economic activity.",
      "\"The only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here,\" he told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "What signals would point to a recession?",
      "The clearest sign would be a steady increase in job losses and a jump unemployment. In a recession, consumers pare spending and businesses pull back on investment. That typically leads to a slowdown in hiring and rise in layoffs.",
      "The nation's unemployment rate did tick up last month, to 4.1% from 4%, though that is still quite low. But employers added 151,000 jobs, a sign that businesses are still seeking to hire workers and enough payroll gains to keep unemployment in check.",
      "Many economists monitor the number of people who seek unemployment benefits each week, a gauge that indicates whether layoffs are worsening. Weekly jobless claims\u00a0remain low.",
      "Who is most vulnerable in a recession?",
      "Most Americans would feel the impact of a recession in one way or another, for weaker hiring to tepid wage gains. Among people who are employed, those who entered the labor market last tend to be the first to lose their job in a recession, noted Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at the Groundwork Collective, a left-leaning economic think tank.",
      "\"So you see the people who are hardest to reach as we reach full employment are the first to get laid off. That includes lower wage workers, black workers, Latino workers. Those who have the hardest time getting a job when times are good are first to lose jobs when times are bad,\" he said.",
      "Americans who carry debt on their homes and can't make minimum payments also can face foreclosure in a downturn, locking a generation out of building household wealth.",
      "\"That's one reason why recessions are so damaging, because it's the least among us that get hurt the most when downturns come,\" Jacquez said.",

      "\"Today's inflation report brings some much needed relief for equity markets, averting immediate concerns around stagflation and giving the Fed space to cut policy rates in the coming months if economic data continue to deteriorate,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in an analyst note.",
      "Markets have whipsawed in recent weeks, with investors spooked by the Trump administration's protectionist trade policies. In the latest salvo, President Trump on Wednesday increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%, prompting immediate threats of retaliation by the European Union and Canada.",
      "\"Trump's tariff policies continue to have a destabilizing effect on markets, with investors left guessing as to which measures will either be added or walked back next,\" said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade.",
      "The recent market swings followed more warning signals about the economy as Mr. Trump's on-and-off-again rollout of tariffs creates confusion among U.S. households and businesses.",

But even if they end up being milder than feared, all the whipsaw moves could leave U.S. companies and consumers unwilling to invest or spend, and looking to the Fed for a clearer economic outlook.",
      "\"As we entered 2025, investors' main economic worry centered around reflation,\" Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at eToro, said in a research note. \"But as the trade war continues to escalate and as economic policy uncertainty continues to rise, that worry has shifted from inflation to the labor market and the economy as a whole.

      "President Trump officially increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Wednesday, promising they would help create U.S. factory jobs at a time when his seesawing tariff threats are jolting the stock market and raising fears of an economic slowdown, increased inflation and even a global trade war.",
      "The European Union quickly announced it would retaliate with steps that will take effect April 1.",

We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs.\"",
      "France's European Affairs Minister Benjamin Haddad said the EU could go even further, adding that a trade war was in no-one's interests, the Reuters news agency reports.",
      "The world's biggest trading bloc was expecting the U.S. tariffs and prepared in advance, but the measures still place great strain on already tense transatlantic relations. Only last month, Washington warned Europe that it would have to take care of its own security in the future.",
      "The EU measures will not only cover steel and aluminum products but textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods as well.",
      "British Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said \"all options were on the table\" to respond \"in the national interest,\" according to Reuters.",

      "Canada also plans to announce\u00a0nearly $21 billion in retaliatory tariffs in response to the U.S. steel and aluminum levies, a senior Canadian government official said Wednesday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak before the announcement.",
      "Mr. Trump removed all exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on the metals, in addition to increasing the tariffs on aluminum from 10%.His moves, based off a February directive, are part of a broader effort to disrupt and transform global commerce.",
      "The president has separate tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, with plans to also tax imports from the European Union, Brazil and South Korea by charging \"reciprocal\" rates starting on April 2.",
      "Mr. Trump told CEOs in the Business Roundtable Tuesday that the tariffs were causing companies to invest in U.S. factories. The 8% drop in the S&P 500 stock index over the past month on fears of deteriorating growth appears unlikely to dissuade him, as Mr. Trump argued that higher tariff rates would be more effective at bringing back factories.",
      "\"The higher it goes, the more likely it is they're going to build,\" Mr. Trump told the group. \"The biggest win is if they move into our country and produce jobs. That's a bigger win than the tariffs themselves, but the tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money to this country.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Tuesday threatened to put tariffs of 50% on steel and aluminum from Canada, but reversed course and\u00a0chose to stay with the 25% rate after the province of Ontario suspended plans to put a surcharge on electricity sold to Michigan, Minnesota and New York.",
      "Trump tariffs history",
      "In many ways, the president is now addressing what he perceives as unfinished business from his first term. Mr. Trump meaningfully increased tariffs, but the revenues collected by the federal government were too small to significantly increase overall inflationary pressures.",
      "Mr. Trump's 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum were eroded by exemptions. After Canada and Mexico agreed to his demand for a revamped North American trade deal in 2020, they avoided the import taxes on the metals. Other U.S. trading partners had import quotas supplant the tariffs. And the first Trump administration also allowed U.S. companies to request exemptions from the tariffs if, for instance, they couldn't find the steel they needed from domestic producers.",
      "While Mr. Trump's tariffs could help steel and aluminum plants in the U.S., they could raise prices for the manufacturers that use the metals as raw materials. Economists also say the gains to the steel and aluminum industries were more than offset by the cost they imposed on \"downstream'' manufacturers that use their products.",
      "At these downstream companies, production fell by nearly $3.5 billion because of the tariffs in 2021, a loss that exceeded the $2.3 billion uptick in production that year by aluminum producers and steelmakers, the U.S. International Trade Commission found in 2023.",
      "Mr. Trump sees the tariffs as leading to more domestic factories, and the White House has noted that Volvo, Volkswagen and Honda are all exploring an increase in their U.S. footprint. But the prospect of higher prices, fewer sales and lower profits might cause some companies to refrain from investing in new facilities.",
      "\"If you're an executive in the boardroom, are you really going to tell your board it's the time to expand that assembly line?\" remarked John Murphy, senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.",

      "Egg prices were one of the main inflation drivers in January, with the cost jumping 53% from a year earlier. Overall grocery prices rose 1.9% over the same period, with declines in some foods, such as bread and tomatoes, offsetting the surge in egg prices.",

    "story": [
      "Stocks racked up heavy losses for a second day on Tuesday in a volatile session that had investors fixated on President Trump's ever-evolving trade war with Canada and the direction of the U.S. economy.",
      "\"Unless and until we know where the goal posts actually are on trade and tariffs, this uncertainty will continue to weigh on markets,\" Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "After a 662-point drop, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 41,433, down 478 points, or 1.1%, with 24 of its 30 components in the red. Verizon fronted blue-chip losses, dropping 6.6%, after the telecom warned of \"soft\" subscriber growth.",
      "After a brief turn higher, the S&P 500 shed 42 points, or 0.8%, to finish at 5,572. At its daily low, the index was 10% below its record close notched last month.",
      "\"Ten percent declines happen more than people think,\" said Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at Solus Alternative Asset Management. The current decline comes after an extended six-month rally for stocks, he noted. \"We've basically gone straight up.\"",
      "Sectors including energy and manufacturing were hit especially hard by Mr. Trump's decision to hike tariffs even more on imports of steel and aluminum from Canada to 50% in response to the country's largest province, Ontario, on Monday announcing a 25% surcharge on\u00a0electricity exports to the U.S.",
      "Ontario's premier on Tuesday backed down and said he would pause the levy, with President Trump in turn dialing back the additional hike.",
      "The Nasdaq Composite also switched to positive terrain, only to revert to losses by the close, falling 32 points, or 0.2%, to 17,436.",
      "Mr. Trump also said he would \"substantially increase\" other tariffs on Canada on April 2 if it did not rescind tariffs on U.S. dairy products and other goods.",
      "\"The market has been down for three weeks in a row, largely driven by uncertainty about where trade policy lands, full stop. We've been inundated with tariff announcements that, unlike the 2018 playbook, are actually being applied universally versus the surgical approach we saw with term 1.0,\" offered Hogan.",
      "Shares of Stellantis thudded lower. The manufacturer of Jeep and Dodge vehicles has multiple production plants in Canada, and could be impacted by the latest escalation.",
      "\"That's kind of the problem for the market, now we have to wait until April 2\" to learn of possible reciprocal actions, said Greenhaus, chief strategist at Solus Alternative Asset Management. \"So there's three weeks to make it worse.\"",
      "The sell-off came as Citigroup strategists lowered their view of U.S. equities, echoing other banks including JPMorgan Chase in curtailing bullish takes for 2025.",
      "Stocks had\u00a0plunged on Monday\u00a0morning, continuing three consecutive weeks of losses, with the technology-laden Nasdaq marking its worst day since September 2022 and the Dow shedding\u00a0890 points\u00a0to close beneath its 200-moving average for the first time since late 2023.",
      "The losses came a day after Mr. Trump declined to say whether he expects a recession this year, telling Fox News that \"I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big.\"",
      "Guidance from Delta Air Lines added to concerns about the economy, with the carrier cutting its earnings outlook amid weaker U.S. demand.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 20:02:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The president's tariff announcements have rocked the stock markets and fueled concerns of an economic downturn.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick defended President Trump's economic policies Tuesday, saying they are \"worth it\" even if they lead to a recession.",
      "\"These policies are the most important thing America has ever had,\" Lutnick told CBS News in an interview when asked whether they would be worth it if they lead to a recession. \"It's worth it.\"",
      "But he quickly added, \"The only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here.\"",
      "Mr. Trump in a recent interview with Fox News declined to rule out that his policies, including increasing tariffs, could cause a recession.",
      "\"I hate to predict things like that,\" Mr. Trump told Fox News. \"There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing, and there are always periods of, it takes a little time. It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's tariff announcements on Canada, Mexico and China have rocked the stock markets and fueled concerns of an economic downturn. Canada received some welcome news Tuesday, after Lutnick told CBS News that the U.S. no longer plans to double tariffs against its northern neighbor on aluminum and steel.",
      "Asked whether the president plans to proceed with the 50% tariffs, Lutnick replied, \"No, that's off, too. So, we're at 25% for steel and aluminum because that's where we were.\"",
      "The one- or two-day tariffs that are ultimately withdrawn have their purpose, Lutnick argued.",
      "\"When you're negotiating with someone and they're not paying attention and they're disagreeing, the president, who's the best dealmaker ever to sit in that chair, he's going to say, 'here's my response,'\" Lutnick said. \"And then all of a sudden, shockingly, they respond.\"",
      "Lutnick said the markets will learn to adjust to Mr. Trump's negotiation tactics.",
      "He denied that there's any chaos in the way the president has been using tariffs to pressure U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"It is not chaotic, and the only one who thinks it's chaotic is someone who's being silly,\" Lutnick said, pointing out that Mr. Trump had warned he'd impose reciprocal tariffs.",
      "As for the sudden announcement of the 50% tariffs on Canada Tuesday morning, Lutnick said, \"He needed to break some guy in Ontario who said he was going to tax American energy 25%. The president of the United States, in the White House says, 'Oh no, you won't,' and breaks him. Breaks him \u2026 by a tweet and a truth (social post). And you think that's chaotic?\"",
      "\"Let the dealmaker make his deals,\" Lutnick said, adding that \"within a short period of time,\" any country negotiating with the U.S. will come to \"realize it doesn't need to do it this way.\"",
      "\"Let's just do it the grown-up way,\" he continued, \"where the biggest economy in the world says, 'I don't like the way you're treating us. How about a little respect? How about a little dignity?'\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-roll-over-an-old-401k/",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:38:30 -0400",
    "summary": "If deciding what to do with an old 401(k) plan has been on your to-do list, here are the key steps you should take to get it done.",
    "story": [
      "Aging 401(k)s are a little like the old clothes in the back of your closet. You know you should do something about them, but there they sit, mostly out of sight and mind.",
      "And so it is with your old 401(k). If deciding what to do with an old 401(k) plan has been on your to-do list for a while, here are the key steps you should take to get it done.",
      "Step 1: See how much you have saved",
      "If your balance in your former employer's 401(k) plan is over $7,000, you can leave the money behind in the old plan or roll the assets into an IRA or your new employer's 401(k).",
      "But if your balance falls below that $7,000 threshold, some of the decision-making may be out of your hands.",
      "Step 2: Decide whether to roll the money or leave it alone",
      "Assuming your balance is over $7,000, your next task is to decide whether to roll the money into an IRA or keep it inside a 401(k).",
      "I often recommend rolling over the assets from a former 401(k) into a no-fee IRA with a topnotch mutual fund company or discount broker. But some people value the extra creditor protections that can accompany 401(k) assets versus IRA assets, while others may prize 401(k)-specific investment options.",
      "If you think you will be better off leaving your money inside a 401(k) rather than rolling it over to an IRA, the next job is to conduct some research on your own 401(k) options.",
      "Even if you do decide to stay with a 401(k), you may need to decide whether you're better off staying put in your former employer's plan or that of your new employer.",
      "Step 3: If rolling over into an IRA, find the right options",
      "If a rollover to an IRA is the way to go, the next step is to identify the right brokerage firm or mutual fund company. Look for a firm that offers a breadth of high-quality investment options with no additional layers of fees for IRA investors. Target-date funds are an elegant, low-maintenance, and underutilized option.",
      "If you decide to roll Roth 401(k) contributions to an IRA or your current employer's 401(k), your new account will be Roth, too, meaning that you won't owe tax on qualified withdrawals.",
      "If you have traditional 401(k) assets, a rollover is also a good time to consider whether to convert those assets to a Roth account at the same time.",
      "Step 4: Fill out the necessary paperwork",
      "If you've decided to roll over your assets to an IRA, fill out the paperwork or online form to open the IRA. You'll then request a direct rollover from your 401(k) plan to the new IRA provider.",
      "The process may be a bit more cumbersome if you're rolling over to your current employer's 401(k).",
      "In both cases, make sure your 401(k) provider makes the check payable to the provider and sends it directly to them, rather than to you. If the check is made out to you, 20% of the balance will be withheld for income tax. You'll then have 60 days to get that money deposited into an IRA or another 401(k); if that deadline comes and goes, the distribution will count as a withdrawal and you'll owe ordinary income tax and a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you're not 55 or older.",
      "If you've decided to roll over your assets from an old 401(k) to another 401(k) or IRA, you'll also have to determine how you'll allocate those assets.",
      "If all of your retirement assets were in your old 401(k), a sturdy target-date fund is a one-stop, low-maintenance choice that you can hold into retirement. If your old 401(k) is just one of several accounts geared toward retirement, a rollover can be an ideal time to check up on how all the pieces fit together\u2014and where you have holes.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 14:48:29 -0400",
    "summary": "Ruth Marcus, a longtime op-ed writer for the Washington Post, quit on Monday after, she said, her column criticizing owner Jeff Bezos was killed by publisher.",
    "story": [
      "A columnist who has worked at The Washington Post for four decades resigned on Monday after she said the newspaper's management decided not to run her commentary critical of owner Jeff Bezos' new editorial policy.",
      "\"It breaks my heart to conclude that I must leave,\" Ruth Marcus, who has\u00a0worked\u00a0at the newspaper since 1984, wrote in a resignation letter.",
      "Her exit is the latest fallout from the billionaire owner's directive that the Post narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. The newspaper's opinions editor, David Shipley, had already resigned because of the shift.",
      "The storied newspaper has been in a free fall, financially and editorially, over the past year. Marcus, who worked in the news and opinion departments during her career, is \"the bedrock of The Washington Post, embodying the history of the place as well as the talent and accomplishments of its journalists,\" said Paul Farhi, a former media reporter there.",
      "Marcus, who was a finalist for the\u00a0Pulitzer Prize for Commentary\u00a0in 2007, said that the Post's publisher, Will Lewis, declined to run her column, which she described as \"respectfully dissenting\" from Bezos' edict. It was the first time in nearly 20 years of writing columns that she's had one killed, she said.",
      "The decision \"underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded,\" she wrote. Her resignation letter was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "A Post spokesperson said Monday that \"we're grateful for Ruth's significant contributions to The Washington Post over the past 40 years. We respect her decision to leave and wish her the best.\"",
      "While Bezos and Lewis have the right to make such decisions \u2014 they're the bosses \u2014 \"that has not been the tradition,\" Farhi said. He likened it to how the Justice Department, while technically under White House control, has generally operated independently. Editorial writers and columnists, paid to give their opinions, usually decide what to write, he said.",
      "The danger is that a decision by the publisher not to allow a column to go forward can make readers question whether the viewpoints of writers are truly their own, he said. Worse yet, it could taint the news department, which by most accounts is aggressively covering the new administration.",
      "Shortly after the editorial page decision was announced nearly two weeks ago, another Post story on the issue, by media columnist Erik Wemple, was scrapped, according to the Gene Pool, a blog written by former Post writer Gene Weingarten. Wemple declined comment on Monday.",
      "In January, editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after her work depicting Bezos and other billionaires genuflecting before a statue of President Donald Trump was rejected, a decision Shipley explained at the time was because it was repetitive of other opinion pieces.",
      "Under executive editor Matt Murray, the Post has also said it would refrain from having its journalists write about issues involving the newspaper, a decision Wemple said in a chat with readers in January that \"I couldn't possibly dissent (from) more strongly.\"",
      "The Post's opinion section on Monday included an editorial opposing Mexico's $10 billion lawsuit against firearms manufacturers, a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Columnists Max Boot wrote about Trump and Russia, Perry Bacon Jr. about Democratic resistance to Trump centering in the states, Phillip Bump on whether Trump would pay a political price for unpopular policies and Jim Geraghty about violence in Syria.",
      "The Post, which made money during the first Trump administration, has been losing money in recent years and its internal strife largely began last June, when Sally Buzbee resigned as executive editor rather than accept a newsroom reorganization. Several prominent Post journalists \u2014 among them Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, Philip Rucker, Matea Gold, Jackie Alemany, Michael Scherer and Will Sommer \u2014 have left for other jobs.",
      "Bezos' decision last fall that the Post would not endorse a presidential candidate \u2014 after the editorial staff had prepared to support Democrat Kamala Harris \u2014 led to an exodus of subscribers that the newspaper is fighting to recover from.",
      "Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor when Bezos bought the paper in 2013, wrote last week in the Atlantic that Bezos \"handled his ownership admirably for more than a decade. But his courage failed him when he needed it the most.\"",
      "Marcus' resignation on Monday overshadowed a newsroom reorganization plan introduced by Murray, including separating workflows for the Post's digital and print products.",

    "story": [
      "Airbus is investigating corrosion issues on some of its A220 passenger jets. The issue has been found on what the manufacturer calls a \"limited population\" of A220s, including some operated by U.S. airlines. The manufacturer and multiple airlines said the issue does not constitute an immediate safety issue.",
      "\"Regular maintenance checks are scheduled to ensure it is captured early and the right corrective actions are put in place in a timely manner to mitigate the situation,\" an Airbus spokeswoman told CBS News in a statement. \"The A220 fleet's airworthiness remains intact.\"",
      "Sources familiar with the problem said the corrosion has been found on some passenger seat fittings and certain wing components, including what's known as the wing-to-body fairing, which is designed to minimize drag where the wing and body of the plane meet. It essentially acts as an aerodynamic cover over that junction and is not structural in nature.",
      "\"The FAA is aware of the issue and is ensuring airlines address it,\" an agency spokesman confirmed to CBS News in a brief statement.",
      "Delta Air Lines, the world's largest A220 operator, told CBS News it has observed the issue with some passenger seat fittings that require additional inspection and lubrication.",
      "The Atlanta-based carrier said the issue is not impacting scheduled A220 flights and has not resulted in cancellations.",
      "\"Delta has a sophisticated aircraft maintenance apparatus that is always-on and has many layers to ensure that every aircraft in our fleet is safe to fly by meeting or exceeding standards governed by our regulators,\" a company spokesman told CBS News. \"There is broad consensus by our technical experts that these issues aren't surprising especially for a new, clean-sheet aircraft and pose no major concerns.\"",
      "The airline said while it is aware some A220 carriers may be finding corrosion in the wing-to-body fairing structure, so far Delta mechanics have not found it on their fleet.",
      "JetBlue and Breeze Airways also fly dozens of A220s along with a host of international carriers, including Air Canada, Air France and Swiss Air.",
      "\"We are aware that some areas of the A220 have experienced corrosion and are proactively taking measures to mitigate these concerns,\" a Breeze spokesman told CBS News. \"The safety of our Guests is our first priority, which is why Breeze performs regular maintenance inspections on all of its aircraft to ensure airworthiness.\"",
      "And a JetBlue spokesperson told CBS News, \"All JetBlue aircraft are regularly inspected and maintained to ensure their safety and reliability. JetBlue is working closely with Airbus to proactively address corrosion on certain areas of some A220 aircraft. This does not impact the reliability of our A220 fleet.\"",
      "The A220 was subject to a 2021 airworthiness directive to address corrosion and wear in wing components known as slat tracks that were likely caused by insufficient grease being applied to the component during production. The directive called for additional inspections to monitor the amount of grease applied to the slat tracks.",
      "Sources told CBS News the new issues go beyond the focus of that 2021 order from Transport Canada.",
      "The plane was originally developed by Bombardier as the C-series before being sold to Airbus due to financial headwinds facing Bombardier. The plane is built in Quebec and Mobile, Alabama.",
      "The A220 seats between 100 and 150 passengers with five-seat rows. It's seen as a replacement for larger regional jets like the Embraer 190 and aging Boeing 717 jets.",
      "Because the plane was developed in Canada, it was initially certified by regulators there. The FAA and European Union Aviation Safety Agency validated the certification but would not typically be the lead agency on an issue like this.",

      "Southwest Airlines boasts that its passengers' \"bags fly free\" \u2014 but not for long.",
      "Starting May 28 \u2014 just in time for the busy summer travel season \u2014 only Southwest's most elite Rapid Rewards A-List Preferred members and passengers who book their top-tier Business Select fares will receive two free checked bags. Frequent flyer A-List Members, Southwest-branded credit card holders and other select customers will be allowed one checked bag.",
      "Everyone else will be charged for their first and second checked bags on flights booked on or after May 28, the carrier says.",
      "\"Just another airline\"?",
      "It's a break with Southwest's 54 year history \u2014 one that could undermine customer loyalty to the carrier, according to experts.",
      "\"This is how you destroy a brand. This is how you destroy customer preference. This is how you destroy loyalty. And this, I think, is going to send Southwest into a financial tailspin,\" airline industry analyst Henry Harteveldt, of Atmosphere Research Group, told CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave. \"Southwest, with these changes, becomes just another airline.\"",
      "Just last September, Southwest CEO Bob Jordan told Van Cleave bags would continue to fly without charge.",
      "\"Bags will still fly free,\" Jordan said. \"It's the third thing customers look for after fare and schedule: Bags fly free, on us. Ninety-seven percent are people who are aware of our policies. So it's a huge consumer advantage. So bags will absolutely fly free.\"",
      "But when pressed if they'd always fly free, he acknowledged, \"Well, never say never. \u2026 It's like saying open seating would never change 20 years ago. Consumer preferences change, but from everything that we see, there's no reason to reconsider this at all, especially right now.\"",
      "\"When 97% of your customers say they fly you because of your 'bags fly free' policy and you make dramatic changes to it, you are telling almost all of your customers, 'Your business doesn't matter to us anymore,'\" Harteveldt said. \"We are watching an airline self-destruct.

      "\"I view it as a big deal because it feels more a financially driven, results driven airline than it's ever been before,\" he said.",

      "Southwest recently announced its first ever layoffs, launched its first redeye flights, and intends to end its long-running open seating policy next year. Instead, the airline will offer seat assignments and sell extra legroom seats for an additional fee.",
      "Also announced Tuesday are changes to Southwest's Rapid Rewards frequent flyer program \u2014 increasing the points flyers get for booking higher-priced Business Select fares while reducing the points earned on less expensive \"Wanna Get Away\" and \"Wanna Get Away Plus\" fares. The airline will also start dynamic or variable pricing for points redemption across higher and lower demand flights.",
      "What's more, starting May 28, Southwest will add a heavily discounted basic economy fare class that will guarantee a flyer a seat on a plane but will likely come with restrictions similar to other carriers' basic economy offerings.",
      "In a video statement Tuesday morning, Jordan said the changes \"will help us return to the levels of profitability we all expect, and to support our collective long term success. It's also about adapting to what our customers want.",
      "\"Many things have changed post-Covid: the loss of short-haul demand, a rise in premium demand, and a change in customer preferences.\"",
      "Jordan said the goal is to secure Southwest's future.",
      "\"We are more than the logo on our planes,\" he said. \"Our DNA isn't open seating, or even bags fly free. It's a dedication to service.\"",
      "Harteveldt says, \"More choice is always a good thing. More low fares are always a good thing. And Southwest is large enough that if they use their basic economy fares in the right way, and I believe they will, they may force other airlines to be more aggressive in their pricing.\"",
      "Southwest is the last major U.S. airline to offer a basic economy product, which carriers launched to compete with ultra-low cost airlines like Frontier and Spirit.",
      "While the offerings vary by airline, basic economy tickets often come without an advance seat assignment, tend to be in the last boarding group and may limit the number or size of carry-on luggage. Checked bags and other perks come with a cost. It's been a hit for airlines. United Airlines reported basic economy revenue jumped 20% last year.",
      "\"Southwest Airlines remains committed to its core tenets \u2014 amazing people who deliver great hospitality to all Southwest customers, a strong network with the most nonstop flights within the U.S., and a loyalty program that gives real value to Rapid Rewards Members,\" the carrier said in a statement.",
      "But is that the Southwest that people know?",
      "\"Yes,\" Harteveldt said. \"This change is just so unlike Southwest. And it really is something that I worry could be far more financially damaging to the airline than helpful.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doge-cuts-hundreds-federal-offices-start-empty-summer/",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Mar 2025 07:35:18 -0400",
    "summary": "Federal agencies will begin to vacate hundreds of offices nationwide this summer under a frenetic and error-prone push by DOGE to scrap leases it says waste money.",
    "story": [
      "Federal agencies will begin to vacate hundreds of offices across the country this summer under a frenetic and error-riddled push by Elon Musk's budget-cutting advisers to terminate leases that they say waste money.",
      "The White House's Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk heads, maintains a list of canceled real estate leases on its website, but internal documents obtained by The Associated Press contain a crucial detail: when those cancellations are expected to take effect. The documents from inside the General Services Administration, the U.S. government's real estate manager, list dozens of federal office and building leases expected to end by June 30, with hundreds more slated over the coming months.",
      "The rapid pace of cancellations has raised alarms, with some agencies and lawmakers appealing to DOGE to exempt specific buildings. Several agencies are facing 20 or more lease cancellations in all, including the IRS, the Social Security Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Many of the terminations would affect agencies that aren't as well-known but oversee services critical to many Americans.",
      "They span from a Boise, Idaho, office of the Bureau of Reclamation - which oversees water supply and deals with disputes across the often-parched American West, to a Joliet, Illinois, outpost of the Railroad Retirement Board, which provides benefits for railroad workers and their survivors.",
      "The lease terminations don't mean all the locations will close. In some cases, agencies may negotiate new leases to stay in place, downsize their existing space or relocate elsewhere.",
      "\"Some agencies are saying: 'I'm not leaving. We can't leave,'\" said Chad Becker, a former GSA real estate official who now represents building owners with government leases at Arco Real Estate Solutions. \"I think there's going to be a period of pushback, a period of disbelief. And then, if necessary, they may start working on the actual execution of a move.\"",
      "DOGE says GSA has notified landlords in recent weeks that it plans to terminate 793 leases, focusing mostly on those that can be ended within months without penalty. The group estimates those moves will save roughly $500 million over the terms of the leases, which in some cases were slated to continue into the 2030s. The Bureau of Reclamation cancellation in Boise, for instance, would take effect Aug. 31 and is expected to save a total of $18.7 million through 2035.",
      "But DOGE's savings estimates - a fraction of Musk's $1 trillion cost-cutting goal - haven't been verified and don't take into account the costs of moves and closures. The group hasn't released any information about what they would mean for agencies.",
      "\"My initial reaction is this is just going to cause more chaos,\" said Jim Simpson, an accountant in Arizona who helps low-income people file taxes and serves on an IRS panel that advocates for taxpayers. \"There's a lot of room to help with government efficiency, but it should be done surgically and not with a chainsaw.\"",
      "Simpson said he was surprised to learn that dozens of IRS offices, including local taxpayer assistance centers, were facing upcoming lease cancellations. He refers clients there to get paperwork to file returns and answer IRS inquiries, and he said losing services would \"cause a lot of anxiety\" and delay refunds.",
      "DOGE scrapping some lease cancelations due to mistakes",
      "Plans to cancel the leases at several of the IRS centers and other sites were in error and have been rescinded, according to a person with direct knowledge of the changes who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity in order to avoid retaliation. Those changes aren't reflected yet on DOGE's list, which only removed one and added dozens more in its latest update published Thursday.",
      "The GSA walked back the cancellation of a Geological Survey office in Anchorage, Alaska, for instance, after learning it didn't have termination rights, according to the person familiar with the matter.",
      "Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said Monday that he'd convinced DOGE to back off lease terminations planned for the National Weather Center in Norman, a Social Security office in Lawton and the Indian Health Services office in Oklahoma City. But all three leases remained on DOGE's list of cancellations as of Thursday.",
      "GSA's press office didn't respond to inquiries.",
      "DOGE push took many by surprise",
      "While there was already a bipartisan push to reduce the government's real estate footprint, the mass cancellations blindsided an industry known for its stability.",
      "Landlords who'd been expecting government agencies to remain tenants \u2014 for several more years in some cases under their existing leases \u2014 were stunned. Some agencies learned from building managers, not their federal partners, that their leases were being canceled, according to real estate managers.",
      "Some cancelations could incur extra costs",
      "Becker, whose firm is tracking the DOGE lease cancellations, and other observers said they expect some agencies will be unable to move their personnel and property out of their spaces within such tight timelines. That may force some agencies to pay additional rent during what's known as a holdover period, undermining DOGE's stated goal of saving taxpayer money.",
      "The Building Owners and Managers Association, which represents the commercial real estate industry, told landlords in a recent advocacy alert to be prepared to seek payment from any federal government tenants who stay beyond their leases.",
      "Asked about plans for buildings with leases that will soon expire, the IRS didn't respond. A Social Security Administration spokesperson downplayed the impact of its offices losing leases, saying many were \"small remote hearing sites,\" didn't serve the public, were already being consolidated elsewhere or planned for closure.",
      "Several other agencies provided little clarity - saying they were working with GSA to consider their options, in statements that were nearly identical in some cases.",
      "But a spokesperson for the Railroad Retirement Board expressed concern over the upcoming lease cancellations of its offices in Joliet, Illinois, and eight other states, saying it was working to \"maintain a public-facing office presence for the local railroad community.\"",
      "Trimming federal real estate was already underway",
      "Government Accountability Office official David Marroni told a congressional hearing last week that the push to unload unnecessary federal real estate was \"long overdue,\" saying agencies have for too long held onto unnecessary space. But he warned the downsizing must be deliberate and carefully planned to \"generate substantial savings and mitigate the risk of mistakes and unexpected mission impacts.\"",
      "That process had already started before Musk's team arrived, with the federal government's real estate portfolio steadily declining over the last decade. Indeed, critics of DOGE say if it were truly interested in cost-cutting it could learn from GSA, whose mission even before Mr. Trump took office was to deliver \"effective and efficient\" services to the American public.",
      "A law signed by former President Joe Biden before he left office in January directed agencies to measure the true occupancy rates of leased spaces by this summer. Those that didn't meet a target of 60% use rate over time would be directed to dispose of their excess space.",
      "\"There is a logical and orderly way to do this,\" Rep. Greg Stanton, an Arizona Democrat, said at last week's hearing. Instead, he said, DOGE is pursuing a reckless approach that threatens to harm the delivery of public services.",
      "Industry observers cautioned that each situation is different and it will take months or years to understand the full impact of the lease cancellations.",
      "\"It really depends on the terms. But it is a shock, there is no question, that all of a sudden, boom, in six weeks all these things have happened,\" said J. Reid Cummings, a professor of finance and real estate at the University of South Alabama. \"It's like a blitzkrieg.\""

    "story": [
      "Former heart surgeon and television host Dr. Mehmet Oz is set to face questions Friday from the Senate's finance committee over his nomination to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Trump.",
      "After Friday's hearing, the GOP-led finance committee will schedule a vote on whether to send Oz's nomination to the full Senate, where he is likely to be approved given the Republican majority. If confirmed, Oz would be the administrator charged with overseeing the nearly $1.5 trillion spent by the federal government on Medicare and Medicaid. The two health insurance programs for seniors and poor Americans make up more than a third of the budget.",
      "Medicare covers around 65 million people, through programs run directly by the federal government or contracted out to private insurers. Medicaid supports around 85 million, through programs administered primarily by state governments overseen by CMS.",
      "It will be up to Oz to finalize or abandon some major changes to Medicare and Medicaid sought by the Biden administration, like a pricey proposal in November to expand coverage to drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy and Ozempic.",
      "Oz is also expected to face questions over the significant authority he would wield over private health insurance as CMS administrator.",
      "On Monday, CMS proposed making several moves to reverse Biden administration expansions to the insurance marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, like shortening the open enrollment period and excluding DACA recipients from coverage. In 2022, Oz said that the law \"caused havoc on our health care system\" and that he \"wouldn't have voted for it.\"",
      "Oz will be the fourth of Trump's health official picks to face questioning from senators. It comes a day after a hearing for Dr. David Weldon was abruptly canceled, after the White House withdrew his nomination to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "A majority of senators on the Senate's health committee advanced Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the president's nominee to head the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Marty Makary, the pick to head the Food and Drug Administration, on Thursday.",
      "Oz's potential new supervisor, Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was narrowly confirmed by the Senate a month ago.",
      "In social media posts last month, Oz has touted \"great conversations\" with key Republicans he would need to win over for his nomination.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the Republican chair of the Senate's health committee, was among those to sit down with Oz last month. Cassidy is one of four medical doctors in the Senate.",
      "\"Great meeting with Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Trump's nominee to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. It will be great to have a doctor in charge,\" Cassidy posted on Feb. 5.",
      "The president's pick to head CMS has earned criticism from some Senate Democrats, who have cited Oz's past embrace of \"alarming pseudoscience,\" record of anti-abortion statements and worries over conflicts of interest.",
      "Oz previously worked as a professor of cardiac surgery at Columbia University and host of \"The Dr. Oz Show\" until 2022, when he stopped taping new television episodes to run for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania.",
      "He lost that Senate race to Democrat John Fetterman, in a narrow contest where abortion had ranked as a top issue for voters.",
      "As part of an ethics agreement published last month, Oz said he will resign from positions at several companies, including the nutritional supplement company iHerb and the drugmaker Housey Pharma. He also pledged to divest from several healthcare companies, including insurance giant UnitedHealth Group.",
      "After the Senate race, Oz had been advertised as iHerb's global advisor. He continued to promote iHerb's supplements on social media after his nomination.",
      "He has also continued to republish past excerpts from his show in recent years after the Senate race, like a clip he shared on Sept. 4 from a sponsored interview about Medicare Advantage coverage. In 2020, Oz would later propose that Medicare Advantage should be expanded to all Americans.",
      "In the clip, Oz said that enrollment in Medicare Advantage had grown 70% since he started his show. Just over half of seniors have opted for these plans, according to the latest federal data, instead of \"original Medicare\" coverage.",
      "\"I want to nudge you. I don't want to shove you. But think about this, because a 70% increase since I started the show means a lot to me,\" he said.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge William Alsup extended relief to fired workers at the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in California ordered six federal agencies to reinstate probationary employees who were fired last month, finding that their terminations by the Office of Personnel Management were unlawful.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco handed down his order in a challenge brought by a group of unions against the Trump administration from the bench. He said that neither OPM nor its Acting Director Charles Ezell had the authority to direct the terminations across agencies.",
      "The order extends relief to fired workers at the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury.",
      "\"It is a sad, sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that's a lie,\" Alsup said at the end of a hearing on the unions' request for a preliminary injunction. \"That should not have been done in our country. It was a sham in order to avoid statutory requirements.\"",
      "The judge, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, noted that federal law allows for agencies to engage in a \"reduction-in-force,\" the government's name for mass layoffs, but doing so comes with several requirements.",
      "\"It can be done if it's in accordance with the law,\" he said. \"This case is not about that. What this case is about is really an attempt to do a reduction-in-force\" through OPM. He said that having OPM, the federal government's chief human resources agency, direct departments to fire probationary workers was an \"easy way to get a reduction-in-force underway\" and a \"gimmick.\"",
      "The judge also criticized President Trump's firing of former special counsel Hampton Dellinger and attempts to get rid of members of the Merit Systems Protection Board, which oversees the administrative appeals of federal workers challenging their firings. A federal judge in Washington ordered that Cathy Harris, a member of the MSPB removed by Mr. Trump, return to her role. The Trump administration has appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "Alsup said Mr. Trump's removals of Harris and Dellinger were likely part of efforts to \"decimate\" the MSPB and ensure \"these employees will have no recourse.\"",
      "Spokespeople for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Interior declined to comment. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that a \"single judge is attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the executive branch.\"",
      "\"The president has the authority to exercise the power of the entire executive branch \u2014 singular district court judges cannot abuse the power of the entire judiciary to thwart the president's agenda. If a federal district court judge would like executive powers, they can try and run for president themselves,\" she said. \"The Trump administration will immediately fight back against this absurd and unconstitutional order.\"",
      "A federal judge in Maryland also issued a similar ruling Thursday night in response to a lawsuit filed by 19 states and the District of Columbia challenging the mass firings of probationary government workers.",
      "The hearing",
      "The judge's order came at the end of a roughly two-hour-long hearing on the unions' request for a preliminary injunction. He repeatedly condemned the Trump administration's efforts to keep key officials, namely Ezell, from testifying in the early stages of the litigation.",
      "Ahead of the hearing, the Justice Department had withdrawn a declaration from Ezell. Lawyers for the unions said the move was part of an effort to keep him from having to answer their questions. In an order issued Monday, Alsup said that if Ezell failed to appear, the court \"will have to decide the sanction.\"",
      "The judge told Kelsey Helland, a Justice Department lawyer, that allowing the acting OPM head to be questioned by lawyers representing the unions \"will reveal the truth.\"",
      "Noting his decades on the bench, Alsup said, \"I know how we get at the truth, and you're not helping me.\" He accused the government of frustrating his ability to find out whether OPM directed agencies to fire probationary workers, or whether the agency heads acted on their own.",
      "But in the end, Alsup concluded that the human resources agency directed departments to get rid of the workers, with the exception of those considered \"mission critical.\" He rejected the Justice Department's attempts to argue that press releases announcing the terminations show the agency heads themselves were the decisionmakers.",
      "The Trump administration last month fired thousands of probationary employees, generally those who were in their roles for less than a year, as part of the president's efforts to shrink the size of the federal government.",
      "The notices informed the affected federal employees that they were being terminated for performance reasons. Shortly after, a group of unions representing government workers, the state of Washington and nonprofit organizations challenged the mass firings, arguing that OPM lacked the authority to order agencies to carry them out.",
      "Danielle Leonard, a lawyer for the unions, said during Thursday's hearing that the firings were not done at the discretion of each agency and argued OPM deliberately targeted probationary employees because they cannot challenge their terminations. She pointed to a Jan. 20 memo from Ezell noting that those on probationary periods \"can be terminated during that period without triggering appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board.\"",
      "\"That's how insidious this action was,\" she said, adding that the plan from the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term was to fire all probationary workers because they did not have a means of challenging their removals.",
      "\"It's profoundly unlawful,\" she said.",
      "Leonard noted that probationary employees are not just those who are new to the workforce, but also includes those who recently received promotions.",
      "\"This action made Swiss cheese of the federal agencies at every level,\" she said, adding that it targeted people with \"decades\" of federal service and experience. \"They're gone. Turn in your keys.\"",
      "But Helland, the government's lawyer, argued that press releases from agencies show that their political leadership was taking credit for the terminations. He acknowledged that while OPM had a role in coordinating the efforts, it was the departments who made the final determinations of whom to fire.",
      "Alsup's latest order comes after he said last month said in separate decision providing temporary relief that the mass firings were likely unlawful\u00a0and ordered OPM to inform certain agencies that it did not have the authority to order the terminations.",
      "On the heels of that decision, Ezell and OPM issued revised guidance\u00a0telling department leaders that they do not have to take any \"specific performance-based actions\" regarding probationary employees.",
      "\"Agencies have ultimate decision-making authority over, and responsibility for, such personnel actions,\" the revised memo stated.",
      "In addition to the mass firings, Mr. Trump's efforts to drastically cut the size of the federal government included a so-called deferred resignation program, through which government workers OPM also gave federal workers the option to resign their positions but retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.",
      "The White House said roughly 75,000 employees accepted the offer to leave their government jobs, far fewer than the\u00a0200,000 it expected\u00a0to take the so-called buyout.",

On the record before the Court, this isn't true. There were no individualized assessments of employees. They were all just fired. Collectively.\"",
      "The states contend the Trump administration blindsided them by ignoring laws set out for large-scale layoffs, which already are having an impact on state governments as they try to help the suddenly jobless. At least 24,000 probationary employees have been terminated since President Trump took office, the lawsuit alleges, though efforts by the judge to get an estimate from a government attorney at a hearing Wednesday were unsuccessful.",
      "The Trump administration argues that the states have no right to try and influence the federal government's relationship with its own workers. Mr. Trump has said he's targeting fraud, waste and abuse in a bloated federal government.",
      "In his temporary restraining order, Bredar issued a 14-day stay on what he called \"illegal\" reductions in force. His order, however, did not apply to firings at the Department of Defense, the National Archives and Records Administration and the Office of Personnel Management.",
      "\"So, although it is a close call, at this early stage, and given that a TRO is 'an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief,'...there is insufficient basis in the record for the Court to conclude that RIFs likely occurred at these three agencies,\" Bredar wrote.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday threatened to impose tariffs on wines, Champagnes and other alcoholic products imported to the U.S. from France and other European countries in response to raised tariffs the European Union placed on American whiskey.",
      "In a post to Truth Social, the social media company the president owns, Mr. Trump said the U.S. will retaliate against the European Union after it announced Wednesday that it would be increasing tariffs on U.S.-made whiskey to 50%.",
      "\"If this tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% tariff on all wines, champagnes, & alcoholic products coming out of France and other E.U. represented countries,\" he wrote. \"This will be great for the wine and champagne businesses in the U.S.\"",
      "Mr. Trump accused the EU of being \"one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the world.\"",
      "Since returning to office, the president has threatened tariffs, and imposed the levies, on a host of major U.S. trading partners. On Wednesday, he increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%, prompting retaliatory action from the EU.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement Wednesday that the countermeasures from the EU are worth 26 billion euros, or $28 billion. The tariffs, set to take effect April 1, target a range of U.S. exports, including beef, poultry, bourbon, jeans and peanut butter.",
      "\"We deeply regret this measure,\" von der Leyen said. \"Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business, and worse for consumers. They are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy. Jobs are at stake. Prices will go up.\"",
      "The U.S. exported $1.2 billion in wine and related products in 2024, including more than $167 million to the EU, according to the Department of Agriculture. It is the top importer of wine, bringing in nearly $4.9 billion worth in 2023. France and Italy were the top partners for importing both wine and Champagne into the U.S.",
      "Champagne is a sparkling wine from the Champagne region in northeast France. If it is made outside of that region, it is called sparkling wine.",
      "Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council, a trade group representing the U.S. spirits industry, called the EU's announcement to reimpose heightened tariffs on American whiskey \"deeply disappointing\"",
      "\"Reimposing these debilitating tariffs at a time when the spirits industry continues to face a slowdown in U.S. marketplace will further curtail growth and negatively impact distillers and farmers in states across the country,\" Swonger said in a statement. \"We urge the U.S. and EU governments to come to a resolution that gets our spirits industry back to zero-for-zero tariffs.\"",
      "According to the Distilled Spirits Council, a retaliatory tariff imposed in 2018 during Mr. Trump's first term, caused exports of U.S.-made whiskey to drop 20%. But over the last three years, exports to the EU grew nearly 60% from $439 million in 2021 to $699 million in 2024, the trade group said.",
      "Since returning to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has made tariffs a key area of his economic agenda, though the levies have sparked concerns of a recession and roiled the stock market. The president declined to rule out the possibility of an economic downturn, telling Fox News in an interview that aired Sunday that \"there is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday that Mr. Trump's economic policies are \"the most important thing America has ever had\" when asked whether they would be worth it if they lead to a recession. \"It's worth it.\"",
      "Lutnick added, \"The only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here.\"",
      "The president's trade war escalated this month with 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tax on goods imported from China, taking effect last week. Beijing imposed retaliatory measures that went into force Monday that target U.S. farmers with levies of 15% on chicken, wheat and corn, and 10% on soybeans, pork, beef and fruit.",
      "The president, however, swiftly reversed course on the levies on imports from Mexico and Canada, pausing the tariffs covered under a 2020 trade deal negotiated during his first administration until April 2. That agreement, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, covers the majority of goods imported from Mexico. Those that are not subject to the deal, however, still face tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump has also exempted other products from his planned tariffs, including providing a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers that were bracing to be hit hard\u00a0by the levies on vehicle parts and components imported from Canada, Mexico and China.",

      "\"I think it's a lot of uncertainty at the moment,\" Martin said in an interview with CBS News on Thursday. \"Overall, tariffs are damaging to trade, damaging to businesses, but also damaging to consumers, because they will lead to an increase in prices for consumers. I don't think that's good, either way. So, we would hope that in the fullness of time that these things will settle down and that there would be negotiation, trade negotiations, to arrive at a landing zone that people can cope with and can accommodate.\"",
      "Martin said that Mr. Trump was \"very conscious of the goods surplus that Ireland has, particularly through the pharmaceutical issue.\"",
      "\"But if you put services into the mix, of course Ireland is in deficit,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The Senate plans to take up a House-passed bill to fund the government through September beginning on Friday, which needs the support of Democrats to move forward.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he'll vote to keep the government open as the chamber prepares to take up a\u00a0GOP stopgap bill\u00a0continuing government funding Friday.",
      "\"I believe it is my job to make the best choice for the country, to minimize the harms to the American people,\" Schumer said. \"Therefore, I will vote to keep the government open, and not shut it down.\"",
      "His support for the measure signaled that Democrats would let the measure pass to prevent a shutdown as the caucus grappled Thursday with the uncomfortable choice.",
      "In a lengthy speech from the Senate floor, the New York Democrat outlined his opposition to the House-passed bill but went on to say that his bigger worry was about what failing to fund the government could bring. He warned that a government shutdown would give President Trump and his allies \"the keys to the city, state and country,\" arguing that \"while the CR bill is very bad, the potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much, much worse.\"",
      "The Senate plans to take up the House-passed bill to fund the government through September beginning on Friday. Republicans need 60 votes to invoke cloture and advance the measure, meaning it will need the support of Democrats to get to a vote on final passage. Speaking to reporters after his remarks, Schumer wouldn't say whether enough Democrats would support advancing the measure, noting that \"each is making his or her own decision.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Senate Democrats have been considering a plan to pave the way for a vote on final passage of the Republican-led bill in exchange for a doomed-to-fail vote on their own 30-day alternative. Schumer told reporters that the option remains their preference, but no agreement has been reached with Senate Republican leadership.",
      "With government funding set to expire on Friday night, Democrats have found themselves in the position of being able to block the GOP bill, but also wary of the government shutdown that would ensue if they do so. Democratic leaders have instead been pushing for a 30-day funding extension that would allow more time for negotiations on new spending bills \u2014 a nonstarter, given Republican control of the House and Senate.",
      "A possible solution began to emerge after Senate Democrats met on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. The plan would call for Democrats to provide the votes needed to advance the GOP bill in exchange for a vote on an amendment with their own one-month stopgap measure, which would almost certainly fail. Democrats who oppose the GOP version could then vote against its final passage. Some members see it as a way to save face while also avoiding a shutdown.",
      "\"I think we're going to all be 'no' on cloture unless we get an agreement to propose at least this 30-day clean [continuing resolution] amendment and maybe a couple of others,\" Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia told reporters Thursday. \"So we'll be 'no' on cloture unless we get an agreement to do that. I'm not aware of whether the Republicans have agreed to that yet, but we'll be 'no' on cloture if we don't get it, and I think that's a unified position.\"",
      "The House approved the six-month funding measure on Tuesday largely along party lines, sending the funding fight to the Senate.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters ahead of Schumer's remarks that his office has been in touch with the minority leader's staff, but Democrats haven't made a formal offer. Thune noted that if Democrats want a vote on the 30-day continuing resolution in exchange for helping Republicans reach the 60-vote threshold on the House-passed bill, \"they can get that.\"",
      "\"There's basically one path to keep the government from shutting down and one door to unlock, and Democrats have the keys,\" he said. Thune filed cloture on the House-passed measure Thursday night, setting up a Friday vote.",
      "Democrats emerged from Wednesday's meeting touting their alternate plan that would fund the government until April 11. Schumer warned Republicans that they do not have the votes to approve the House-passed stopgap measure, which increases defense spending and funding for veterans' health care, while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels.",
      "Although efforts to fund the government usually find bipartisan support, Democrats widely oppose the measure and have expressed frustration with the spending reductions, while warning that it would give the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts. The possibility of forcing a shutdown is one of the few points of leverage Democrats have as the minority in both chambers.",
      "But Democrats also fear the fallout of a lapse in funding, which could serve as the pretext for the Trump administration to make even deeper cuts across the federal workforce. Some Senate Democrats see the plan to vote for cloture but against final passage as a way to thread the needle, while others have argued that a vote on the short-term continuing resolution isn't for show.",
      "Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, said the approach isn't a gimmick, noting the bipartisan work that has been done so far on new funding bills that would go by the wayside with the House-passed funding extension.",
      "\"What would be an absolute crime is to support a House bill written only by Republicans,\" Merkley said, adding, \"You don't stop a bully by handing over your lunch money, and you don't stop a president like Trump from being authoritarian by proceeding to give in and give him more power again.\"",
      "Frustrations appeared to mount among Democrats throughout the day on Thursday, as they met again behind closed doors on the issue. Schumer told his caucus during the meeting that he planned to vote to advance the GOP funding measure, a source familiar confirmed to CBS News. As the meeting let out, a number of Democrats released statements on social media announcing that they would vote no on the House-passed continuing resolution, while they otherwise remained tight-lipped about their intentions.",
      "Meanwhile, some outspoken progressives have denounced the plan, saying the party is capitulating to the president and Republicans while getting nothing substantive in return.",
      "\"I hope Senate Democrats understand there is nothing clever about setting up a fake failed 30 day CR first to turn around & vote for cloture on the GOP spending bill,\" New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posted on X on Thursday. \"Those games won't fool anyone. It won't trick voters, it won't trick House members. People will not forget it.\"",
      "Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, the sole Democrat who publicly said he would back the House-passed measure, likewise criticized the idea of exchanging support for cloture for a vote on the short-term continuing resolution.",
      "\"The House GOP CR will then pass the Senate because it only needs 51 votes,\" Fetterman said in a post on X. \"Total theater is neither honest with constituents nor a winning argument.\"",

      "President Trump has made a number of inaccurate claims about Canada in the past week as he imposed new tariff hikes on the country and touted his plans for more.",
      "On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump imposed a blanket 25% tariff on foreign steel and aluminum, significantly impacting Canada, the largest foreign supplier of these metals to the U.S. An additional 25% tariff on most Canadian goods is set to go into effect on April 2.",
      "Experts warn these hikes could lead to increases in consumer prices, but Mr. Trump has justified them in part by saying he's protecting American manufacturers and incentivizing Canada to crack down on drug crime.",
      "However, in interviews and social media posts, Mr. Trump has exaggerated the size of the U.S.trade deficit with Canada and the amount of fentanyl coming over the northern border. The president also misrepresented Canada's tariffs on U.S. dairy and lumber products.",
      "Here's a breakdown of some of these claims:",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has tariffs above 200% on U.S. dairy products",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"In Canada, we find that they're charging us over 200% for dairy products\u2026 And when I left, we had that well taken care of, but under Biden they just kept raising it.\"",
      "Details: President Trump has suggested Canada unfairly put tariffs of over 200% on American dairy products during President Biden's term, but the level has been unchanged since before Biden took office.",
      "The over 200% tariffs on U.S. dairy products are only triggered if U.S. dairy exports exceed certain yearly duty-free limits, and U.S. dairy manufacturers say they have never been close to exceeding these limits.",
      "Additionally, these tariffs were negotiated during the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Mr. Trump signed during his first term. Canada's published tariff lists for 2020 and 2025 show tariffs on U.S. dairy products have remained unchanged from the end of his first term through the end of President Biden's term. For example, both lists show the same tariff rate of 245.5% for any cheese products above the duty-free limit.",
      "Canadian Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman told told CBS News the dairy tariffs are in place to \"protect our farmers and families.\" Canada is the second-largest importer of U.S. dairy, purchasing about $1.1 billion worth in 2024.",
      "The U.S. sold roughly double the amount of dairy to Canada as Canada sold to the U.S. last year, according to trade data from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has a \"tremendously high tariff\" on lumber while the U.S. charges \"a tiny fraction of that\"",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"They have a tremendously high tariff, give you the exact numbers in a little while coming out, on lumber. So, they sell us lumber, they have a tremendous tariff. They make it impossible for us to sell lumber or dairy products into Canada, but our numbers are a tiny fraction of that, almost non-existent.\"",
      "Details: On March 4, Canada imposed a tariff of 25% on softwood lumber from the U.S., a rate that is high compared to recent history.",
      "But Mr. Trump did not mention these tariffs are part of Canada's response to the 25% levies on most Canadian goods, including lumber, that the Trump administration initially announced in early March, which are now expected to take effect on April 2.",
      "Before this trade escalation, Canada had imposed zero tariffs on U.S. softwood lumber for years, according to Dustin Jalbert, a senior economist at Fastmarkets who covers wood products.",
      "\"It's certainly true that right now there are tariffs in place, but that was not the case before the kickoff of the trade war. These are retaliatory to what the U.S. instigated, if you will, in early March,\" Jalbert said.",
      "The U.S. had previously placed duties on imported softwood lumber, with tariffs on Canadian lumber rising from 8% to 14.5% in 2024.",
      "Trump's false claim that the U.S. has a $200 billion trade deficit with Canada",
      "President Trump\u00a0said\u00a0March 13:\u00a0\"In the case of Canada, we're spending $200 billion a year to subsidize Canada.\"\u00a0And on Feb. 26 he said: \"The tariffs will make it impossible for them to sell lumber or anything else into the United States. And all I'm asking to do is break even or lose a little bit, but not lose $200 billion.\"",
      "Details: Mr. Trump has repeatedly exaggerated the U.S.-Canada trade deficit, claiming it's as large as $200 billion.",
      "In fact, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services with Canada in 2024 was closer to $35.7 billion, according to the latest trade data released from the U.S. Census Bureau on March 6.\u00a0 That trade deficit narrowed from $40.6 billion in 2023.",
      "For goods alone, the U.S. bought $70.6 billion more in goods from Canada than it sold in 2024, down from $72.3 billion in 2023.",
      "The overwhelming driver of the deficit with Canada is that the U.S. buys a lot of unrefined oil from the country, according to Julian Karaguesian, a lecturer at the department of economics at McGill University.",
      "\"A lot of Canadian economists say if you take out energy, Canada is running a small deficit with the United States,\" Karaguesian said.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that large amounts of fentanyl come from Canada",
      "President Trump said in his address to Congress\u00a0March 4: \"Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. But even more importantly, they have allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.\"",
      "Details: Mr. Trump has cited Canada's failure to halt the flow of illicit drugs as a reason for imposing tariffs, saying that fentanyl has been coming from the country \"at levels never seen before.\" He claimed, \"The fentanyl coming through Canada is massive.\"",
      "However, Mr. Trump overstates the amount of fentanyl coming across the northern border. In 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the U.S.-Canada border, accounting for roughly 0.2% of all fentanyl seized by CBP that year. By contrast, approximately 21,100 pounds \u2014 about 96.6% of the total \u2014 was seized at the southern border.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 18:19:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth vowed in January to review \"in a gender-neutral way\" readiness standards for troops.",
    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered a review of military standards, including physical fitness, body composition and grooming. It's a review Hegseth promised during his confirmation hearing when questioned about his statements he's made that military standards have eroded.",
      "\"That will be part of one of the first things we do at the Pentagon \u2014 is reviewing that in a gender-neutral way \u2014 the standards ensuring readiness and meritocracy is front and center,\" Hegseth said in January.",
      "The Pentagon released a memo Wednesday night from Hegseth that directs the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness to review the existing standards set by the military departments.",
      "\"We must remain vigilant in maintaining the standards that enable the men and women of our military to protect the American people and our homeland as the world's most lethal and effective fighting force,\" Hegseth said. \"Our adversaries are not growing weaker, and our tasks are not growing less challenging.\"",
      "The memo directs the review to examine the standards and how they have changed since Jan. 1, 2015. In December 2015, the Defense Department announced it would open up all combat roles to women.",
      "Hegseth has previously opposed that policy decision, saying in a podcast interview shortly before he was tapped as defense secretary, \"We should not have women in combat roles. It hasn't made us more effective. Hasn't made us more lethal.\"",
      "Hegseth walked that view back somewhat during his confirmation hearing, promising that women would have access to combat roles if the standards remain high and \"have not been eroded.\"",
      "Katherine Kuzminski, the director of studies at the Center for a New American Security, told CBS News in an interview there are separate requirements for men and women, as well as for different ages, to pass the Army Combat Fitness Test that every recruit has to pass. To qualify for special forces, however, the standards are gender-neutral.",
      "\"Those standards are uniform across the genders,\" Kuzminski said, \"which is why we have only seen very small numbers of women going into special operations.\"",
      "For example, as of early January, according to data provided by the Army, there have been 156 female graduates of the notoriously grueling Ranger Course, with 381 women attending the course since it was first made available to women in 2015, for a graduation rate of approximately 41%.",
      "The Ranger Course requires all candidates to swim 15 meters in full uniform, run five miles in under 40 minutes and march 12 miles with a 35-lb. ruck, according to\u00a0the Army.",
      "\"The standards have not been lowered, and each Ranger Course graduate meets the same training standards,\" an Army official told CBS News.",
      "The Pentagon's review could lead to a change in the Army Combat Fitness test, the generic test, so that the requirements are the same for men and women.",
      "Currently, the Army Combat Fitness test is scored based on different requirements for men and women, depending on age. For instance, a man who's 17 to 21 years of age must at a minimum be able to run two miles in 22 minutes, while a woman would need to run the same distance in 23:22. The minimum requirement for hand-release push-ups \u2014 which involve lifting your hands off the ground at the bottom of the push-up \u2014 is the same for men and women of any age: 10.",
      "Facing a recruiting crisis, services in recent years have offered adjustments on drug and tattoo policies and provided enlistment bonuses to attract potential service members, while still maintaining physical and educational standards. The Army also launched pre-enlistment boot camps to help potential candidates get into shape before going into basic training.",
      "Hegseth said during his confirmation hearing that while writing his book \"War on Warriors,\" he spoke to service members who told him that \"in ways direct, indirect, overt and subtle\" standards have changed, but Hegseth didn't provide senators with concrete examples.",
      "Kuzminski also said the defense secretary's review could include revisiting grooming standards, like the Army allowing women to\u00a0wear ponytails or the Navy permitting some men to grow\u00a0facial hair, due to a medical condition exacerbated by shaving.",
      "\"They seem like little things, but they were also tied to a broader initiative during the Biden administration to ensure that there weren't any standards that were disproportionately affecting minorities,\" Kuzminski said.",
      "Kuzminski added that changing those back may have some impact on recruiting or retention, but \"it's not something that's going to break the force because the objective of every person in uniform is professionalism, and they will follow through the standard, whatever the standard is.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to limit for now the scope of three lower court orders that broadly blocked enforcement of his executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship.",
      "The Trump administration asked the high court for emergency relief in three separate requests, which arise out of cases brought in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state. In all three disputes, U.S. district court judges issued orders blocking nationwide enforcement of Mr. Trump's executive order, which was issued his first day in office.",

      "\"These cases \u2014 which involve challenges to the president's January 20, 2025 Executive Order concerning birthright citizenship \u2014 raise important constitutional questions with major ramifications for securing the border,\" she wrote in the requests. \"But at this stage, the government comes to this court with a 'modest' request: while the parties litigate weighty merits questions, the court should 'restrict the scope' of multiple preliminary injunctions that 'purpor[t] to cover every person in the country,' limiting those injunctions to parties actually within the courts' power.\"",
      "Trump's birthright citizenship order",
      "Mr. Trump issued his executive order seeking to terminate birthright citizenship on his first day in office, part of a broad, long-promised crackdown on illegal immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border. The order denies U.S. citizenship to children born to mothers who are in the country unlawfully or temporarily on visas, and whose fathers are neither citizens nor lawful permanent residents.",
      "The president's executive action sparked immediate legal challenges, including in the cases that have now arrived at the Supreme Court. The challengers all argue Mr. Trump's order violates the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment.",
      "Four U.S. district judges \u2014 in Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Washington \u2014 issued orders blocking enforcement of the president's attempt to end birthright citizenship. Efforts by the Trump administration to have U.S. appeals courts restrict the scope of three of those decisions to apply only the parties \u2014 which include 22 states, members of two organizations and seven individuals \u2014 while legal proceedings move forward have not been successful.",
      "In its request to the Supreme Court, the Trump administration said it should clear the way for the president's birthright citizenship order to partially take effect. Harris, who represents the federal government before the court, largely criticized the scope of the relief \u2014 which extends nationwide \u2014 and warned that these injunctions harm the executive branch's ability to carry out its functions.",
      "\"District courts have issued more universal injunctions and [temporary restraining orders] during February 2025 alone than through the first three years of the Biden administration,\" she wrote. \"That sharp rise in universal injunctions stops the executive branch from performing its constitutional functions before any courts fully examine the merits of those actions, and threatens to swamp this court's emergency docket.\"",
      "She noted that the decisions arising out of challenges to Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship order cover all 50 states and \"millions of aliens across the country.\"",
      "\"This court should declare that enough is enough before district courts' burgeoning reliance on universal injunctions becomes further entrenched,\" the acting solicitor general wrote.",
      "On the issue of immigration, specifically, Harris said the lower court orders impede the president's efforts to address what she said is a crisis at the southern border.",
      "\"The district courts' universal injunctions threaten to perpetuate those problems by holding out a nationwide incentive for illegal immigration: the prospect of American citizenship for the unlawful migrants' children and of derivative immigration benefits for the migrants themselves,\" she argued.",
      "Republicans and Democrats alike have sought these nationwide orders when challenging the policies of a president from the opposing political party, and decisions granting that broad relief have been criticized by administrations on both sides of the political spectrum.",
      "Even several members of the Supreme Court have expressed concern about the soundness of these broad orders, which bar the government from enforcing the policy at issue against anyone, anywhere in the country. In a\u00a02018 concurring opinion\u00a0in a\u00a0case involving Mr. Trump's travel ban\u00a0issued during his first term, Justice Clarence Thomas noted that district courts in Hawaii and Maryland entered preliminary injunctions that barred the Trump administration from enforcing the policy, and said he was skeptical they have the authority to do so.",

      "In another deleted post he appeared, possibly in jest, to embrace the anti-communist firebrand Joseph McCarthy. Above a picture of McCarthy, Reitz wrote, \"Bring back the good 'ol days.\"",
      "Reitz declined to comment.",
      "Senators on the Judiciary Committee will be voting Thursday on whether to advance his nomination to become assistant attorney general in charge of the Office of Legal Policy, a low-profile but highly consequential post within the Justice Department.",
      "Reitz is currently the chief of staff to Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, and before that was the deputy attorney general of Texas where he oversaw the office's so-called \"Biden Docket,\" a barrage of more than 20 lawsuits challenging the previous administration's policies, with a major focus on immigration and the border. In announcing Reitz's appointment on Truth Social, Mr. Trump praised him as a true MAGA attorney, a \"warrior for our Constitution.\"",
      "The Office of Legal Policy advises the attorney general on key matters of policy and law, works closely with Congress to craft legislation and is often at the forefront of picking and vetting federal judges. Its roughly two dozen lawyers toil away on the department's fourth floor, rarely drawing public attention and largely staying out of the political crossfire.",
      "Reitz graduated from the University of Texas Law School, where he was editor-in-chief of the Texas Review of Law & Politics. He clerked for a conservative member of the Texas Supreme Court before joining Bracewell LLP, a white-shoe law firm in Houston that once included former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani as a name partner. He is a member of the Federalist Society and also did a five-year combat tour in Helmand Province during the Afghan war.",
      "Online, Reitz has for years been an active advocate for conservative views and an avid supporter of the MAGA movement.",
      "\"Friendly reminder that 'birthright citizenship' is not a thing,\" he tweeted in 2021. He has called for rolling back reforms to mandatory minimum sentences, posting, \"make mandatory minimums great again.\" And he has inveighed against the federal right to an abortion, saying that \"roe's finding that there's a const right to abortion is garbage.\" In 2022, the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, leaving the legality of abortion to the states.",
      "But Reitz's social media monologue has at times veered into more provocative terrain. Some of those views have attracted the attention of Democrats in Congress during the confirmation process.",
      "Among them are comments he made suggesting it may be permissible in certain instances to defy a court order.\u00a0 At his confirmation hearing last month, Reitz was grilled by Democrats about what they saw as his online taunt of Judge Yeakel about his abortion ruling, challenging him to \"enforce it.\"",
      "At his confirmation hearing, Reitz responded to questioning about the post, saying, \"There is no hard and fast rule in all instances in which a litigant must comply with all or some or various parts of a judicial decision. It is so fact-law- and case-specific that one cannot speak generally.\"",
      "Some of his most extreme social media posts have eluded scrutiny until now. A review of hundreds of Reitz's posts in the past few years reveal incendiary views on a number of legal, social and political issues. Ahead of his confirmation, at least 4,000 tweets were deleted from his X feed, though it is unclear when the scrubbing took place.\u00a0 The tweets cover a cross-section of hot-button issues, from abortion to the murder of George Floyd to false claims Reitz made about the 2020 election.",
      "One of Reitz's posts suggested openness to arranged marriages.",
      "\"The more one realizes that marriage is more of a public institution than a private one, the more 'arranged' marriages (rightly understood and coupled with some limited/guiding principles) makes a lot of sense,\" he wrote.",
      "And in September 2020, Reitz seemed to want to resurrect the reputation of McCarthy, the a American demagogue who launched a furious campaign to discover and blacklist suspected communists across American society and whose name became synonymous with political witch hunts.",
      "White House spokesman Harrison Fields said in a statement, \"Aaron Reitz is an eminently-qualified nominee, who will join our incredible Attorney General Pam Bondi to ensure the Department of Justice delivers for the American people.\"",
      "Cruz's office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Senate Judiciary Committee vote is scheduled for Thursday, and Reitz is expected to be approved on a party-line vote.",
      "Editor's note: An earlier version of this article said that Reitz was editor-in-chief of the University of Texas law review. He was editor-in-chief of the Texas Review of Law & Politics. The article has been updated.",

At Mr. Trump's direction, officials have been detaining some migrants awaiting deportation at the naval base, though the holding facilities were left empty earlier this week.",
      "Those subject to the Alien Enemies Act would not be allowed to have a court hearing or an asylum interview since they would be processed under an emergency, wartime authority \u2014 not immigration law. Instead, they would be eligible to be detained and deported, with little to no due process, under Title 50, the section of the U.S. code housing America's war and defense laws.",
      "CNN first reported Mr. Trump's plans to invoke the law as early as Friday.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act has been invoked only a few times in U.S. history, including during World War II, when the government used it to surveil and detain Italian, German and Japanese immigrants in the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "A volcano near Alaska's largest city is showing new signs of unrest, with experts saying the likelihood of an eruption at Mount Spurr in the next few weeks or months has increased.",
      "The Alaska Volcano Observatory said Wednesday\u00a0it had measured during recent overflights \"significantly elevated volcanic gas emissions,\" and said signs indicated an eruption was likely, though not certain, in the weeks or months ahead.",
      "\"We expect to see further increases in seismic activity, gas emissions and surface heating prior to an eruption, if one were to occur,\" the observatory said in a statement. \"Such stronger unrest may provide days to weeks of additional warning.\"",
      "However, the observatory warned that it was possible that an eruption could happen with little or no warning.",
      "\"While we expect additional changes to monitoring data prior to an eruption, it is also possible that an eruption could occur with little or no additional warning,\" the observatory wrote. \"This would be extremely hazardous for recreators on Mount Spurr or near its drainages as well as those overflying the volcano.\"",
      "What is Mount Spurr?",
      "Mount Spurr is one of 53 volcanoes in Alaska that have been active within the last 250 years. It has two main vents and is 11,070 feet (3,374 meters) tall. It is covered in ice and snow and is located roughly 80 miles (129 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage.",
      "When did Mount Spurr last erupt?",
      "The last known eruption from the summit vent was more than 5,000 years ago. The Crater Peak vent, meanwhile, erupted once in 1953 and three times in 1992, according to the observatory. The Crater Peak vent is about 2 miles (3 kilometers) south of the summit.",
      "There have been periods of increased earthquake or other activity since then, including between 2004 and 2006, but no other eruptions. Last October, the observatory raised its alert status for Mount Spurr from green to yellow when an increase in seismic activity became pronounced and a ground deformation was spotted in satellite data.",
      "The most likely outcome of the current unrest would be an eruption or eruptions similar to those in 1953 and 1992, the observatory said.",
      "\"It is also possible that no eruption occurs and the present activity slowly dies away or that a smaller eruption takes place,\" John Power, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey at the observatory, wrote in an email.",
      "What impacts could an eruption have?",
      "The eruptions during the last century lasted between three and seven hours, produced ash columns that rose more than 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) above sea level and deposited ashfall in south-central Alaska communities, according to the observatory.",
      "In 1992, ashfall of about a quarter-inch in Anchorage prompted residents to stay inside or to wear masks if going outside to avoid breathing ash. The cloud drifted as far as Greenland.",
      "CBS affiliate WGME-TV reported that the ash could drift all the way to the East Coast, but that would depend on the jet stream, and it probably would not have a major impact.",
      "Volcanic ash is angular and sharp and has been used as an industrial abrasive. The powdered rock can cause a jet engine to shut down.",
      "The 1992 eruptions prompted the temporary closures of airports in Anchorage and other communities.",
      "Closing airports can be more than an inconvenience in a state where most communities aren't connected to Alaska's main road system. Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport also is among the world's busiest cargo hubs.",

This includes 112 \"tipping point\" species \u2014 those that have lost more than half their populations in the past five decades. Some, like the Allen's hummingbird, tricolored blackbird and saltmarsh sparrow, are at extreme risk without immediate intervention, says the report, released Thursday.",
      "The population of grassland birds in the U.S. has dropped by 43% since 1970, as row-crop production, drought and habitat loss take their toll, the report says. Aridland birds have declined 41% in the same period due to drought, wildfires and invasive species. Even forest birds, facing habitat degradation from fire suppression and industrial timber practices, are seeing widespread declines. Waterfowl, once considered a conservation success, have declined by 20% since 2014 from the loss of wetlands and grasslands.",
      "The findings continue a downward trend. A 2019 study published in Science, an academic journal, found that North America lost nearly 3 billion birds over the previous 50 years, including 90 \"tipping point\" species of 529 bird species that were examined.",
      "\"The 2025 State of the Birds report shows those losses are continuing, with declines among several bird trend indicators,\" the new report says. \"Notably duck populations\u2014a bright spot in past State of the Birds reports, with strong increases since 1970\u2014have trended downward in recent years.\"",
      "Conservationists have previously warned that bird populations are in steep decline due to habitat loss and climate change, and they're further alarmed after the U.S. Interior Department last month suspended a legal opinion from the Biden administration that held companies accountable for accidentally killing birds through industrial activities like oil and gas drilling, wind energy production and construction \u2013 in a victory for the energy sector.",
      "Birds play a critical role in maintaining healthy ecosystems. They help control pests, disperse seeds and pollinate plants, contributing to crop yields and supporting biodiversity, says Amanda Rodewald, faculty director of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Center for Avian Population Studies",
      "And declining bird populations signal larger environmental problems, experts say.",
      "\"There's a really long history and a lot of evidence that shows that birds can be excellent indicators of environmental conditions,\" Rodewald told CBS News. \"We share the same environments with birds, if they're not healthy for bird populations, they're not likely to be healthy for us either.\"",
      "Beyond their ecological role, birds bring significant economic and mental health benefits. Birdwatching contributes $279 billion to the U.S. economy and supports 1.4 million jobs, according to the report. Encounters with birds have also been linked to reduced stress and improved mental well-being, further underscoring their importance.",
      "Experts stress that conservation efforts can succeed when adequately funded. The bald eagle, once nearly wiped out by the pesticide DDT, has rebounded thanks to concerted efforts. In December, the species even gained bipartisan recognition as the official U.S. bird.",
      "Strategic habitat conservation efforts \u2014 such as conservation ranching, coastal restoration and seabird translocation \u2014 are already making a difference in some regions.",
      "The new report calls for increased investment in conservation programs, stronger habitat protections, and policies that promote sustainable land management. Without swift action, scientists warn, the next State of the Birds report could bring even graver news.",
      "\"Birds unite us across the hemisphere and across the political spectrum,\" said Marshall Johnson, chief conservation officer at the National Audubon Society. \"There should be no hesitation in moving to protect them today and in the future.\""

      "The alliance was founded by Nippon Foundation and Nekton in April 2023; about 400 institutions participate in its activities, and 93 scientists were funded to participate in expeditions and research projects in an effort to speed up the identification and official registration of a new species, the Ocean Census\u00a0said\u00a0on its website. The process can take up to 13.5 years, some species may go extinct before they are even documented.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 15:15:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The prehistoric facial bones were found buried in 50 feet of mud and silt, and are believed to be 1.1 to 1.4 million years old, researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "Researchers in Spain have unearthed a fossil from a potential new prehistoric member of the human family tree, and they say it's the earliest known remnants of a face discovered in Western Europe.",
      "The facial bones from an adult were found at the Atapuerca archaeological site in northern Spain in 2022. Since then, a team of scientists has been working to learn more about the hominin, whom they nicknamed Pink. The researchers shared their findings in a study in the journal\u00a0Nature, which was published on Tuesday.",
      "Pink's remains have been dated as between 1.1 and 1.4 million years old, the researchers said.",
      "The research \"introduces a new actor in the history of human evolution in Europe,\" study author Rosa Huguet, of Spain's University of Rovira i Virgili, said at a news conference, according to the AFP news agency.",
      "The discovery suggests that early humans settled in Europe, traveling from the east side of the continent to the west, about 1.4 million years ago, the researchers said. Until now, the oldest-known human species in Western Europe was the\u00a0Homo antecessor. Experts have found Homo antecessor remains that are around 850,000 years old.",
      "The oldest human ancestor found in any area of Europe is the Dmanisi people, or Homo georgicus, a group that lived in what is now the nation of Georgia. Remains of that species have been dated back to 1.8 million years ago. They are the first members of the human family known to have traveled from Africa to Europe.",
      "The face of \"Pink\"",
      "The fossilized upper jawbone and partial cheekbone were excavated from a 52-foot-deep layer of silt and mud at Sima del Elefante, or the \"elephant pit,\" a site less than 1,000 feet from where the fossils of\u00a0Homo antecessor were discovered in 1994. The bones were not enough for researchers to determine Pink's age or gender.",
      "From those fossilized bones, researchers were able to use 3D imaging techniques to create a model of Pink's face. The face is more \"projected forward and more robust\" than a modern human face or a\u00a0Homo antecessor face, Maria Martinon-Torres, director of Spain's National Research Center on Human Evolution, told the AFP.",
      "Pink's face bears some similarities to the human ancestor Homo erectus,\u00a0researchers said. That species spanned nearly 2 million years and was the first human species to evolve more familiar human body proportions and use fire and tools. Remains of the species have been found in Africa, Asia and Europe.",
      "But the similarities weren't strong enough for the scientists to confirm that Pink was a member of that species. Instead, they have proposed that Pink could belong to a new possible species, which they called Homo 'affinis' erectus.",
      "\"This is the most honest proposal we can make with the evidence we have,\" Martinon-Torres said, according to AFP.",
      "The scientists were also able to analyze small stone tools and animal bones found at the excavation site to learn more about how Pink lived. The environment at the time was a humid forest landscape, and the early human population lived alongside horses, ancient cattle, monkeys and hippos, the researchers said. The area also likely had plenty of water, which would have made it an \"ideal\" place for the species to settle, Huguet said in the news conference.",
      "The researchers suggested that the species may be a bridge between the\u00a0Homo georgicus species and the\u00a0Homo antecessor species. Study co-author Jose Maria Bermudez de Castro told the AFP that it's likely the species \"probably disappeared\" during a severe global cooling era that occurred nearly 900,000 years ago.",
      "Research at the excavation site will continue, the scientists said.",

    "story": [
      "Those who glanced up at the sky Thursday night had an opportunity to catch the March 2025 \"Blood Moon,\" a phenomenon that colors the full moon in shades of red, orange and yellow during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "This month's full moon\u00a0was due to pass through the shadow of Earth either late Thursday night or very early Friday morning, depending on the viewer's time zone. It was visible to people in the Americas and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Dubbed the \"Worm Moon\" by the Farmer's Almanac, which has been assigning names to full moons for almost a century, this one is expected to last through Saturday morning, according to NASA. The full moon technically rose in its totality early Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about the event \u2014 and why the moon showed a new hue when it happened.",
      "Why was the moon red, orange and yellow?",
      "The moon appeared to turn red as Earth passed directly between it and the sun in what's known as a total lunar eclipse. Their perfect alignment darkens the moon, from the perspective of folks looking up, because our planet's position blocks most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "Some light still makes its way to the moon's surface, but only certain shades of it. The colors that wind up there are longer wavelengths of light \u2014 red, orange, yellow \u2014 which withstood the journey through \"a thick slice of Earth's atmosphere,\" NASA said.",
      "Shorter wavelengths of the color spectrum, like blue, scatter easily when they hit the atmosphere. That's why a vast sky can look blue in the middle of the day, when sunlight can shine straight down from overhead. Longer wavelengths materialize on Earth when sunlight hits from more of a perpendicular angle, so its route through our atmosphere can be more extensive. Short wavelengths are essentially filtered out by the atmosphere over such a protracted distance, and only the longer reds, oranges and yellows remain.",
      "What is a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "\"Blood Moon\" is a nickname that refers to the moon's reddish appearance during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "The full moon takes on several shades of red, orange and yellow when it's nearer the outer edges of Earth's shadow \u2014 when it first intersects with the path of Earth's shadow, for example, and as it's on its way out. But shades of deep red will become more pronounced as the moon enters the darkest part of the shadow.",
      "What exactly causes a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "A \"Blood Moon\" happens during a total lunar eclipse, when the sun, Earth and the moon align in that order. Long wavelengths of sunlight are refracted through Earth's atmosphere before reaching the moon, which reflects them in reddish hues that may resemble the color of blood.",
      "How to see the \"Blood Moon\" lunar eclipse",
      "The upcoming \"Blood Moon\" will begin before the full moon reaches its brightness point tonight.",
      "As the lunar eclipse gets underway, the moon will start moving through Earth's shadow at 11:57 p.m. EDT. It will become steadily dimmer over the next several hours as it travels toward the darkest part of the shadow and, eventually, appear fully darkened from around 2:26 p.m. to 3:31 a.m. in the early hours of Friday. The most ideal opportunity to see the reddish moon is during the minutes leading up to 3 a.m. EDT, as the moon should be situated in the center of Earth's shadow around then.",

      "What is a lunar eclipse?",
      "A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon all align so that the moon passes into the Earth's shadow. During a total lunar eclipse, like the one happening this March, the entire moon will fall within the darkest part of Earth's shadow.",
      "Each lunar eclipse is visible from half of Earth.",
      "There are also partial and penumbral eclipses, which are when the sun, Earth and moon are not perfectly aligned.",
      "Why does the moon look red during the lunar eclipse?",
      "With the moon in the shadow of the Earth, it will appear red-orange, according to NASA. Lunar eclipses are sometimes called blood moons because of the phenomenon.",
      "During a lunar eclipse, the moon gets its red coloration because any sunlight that's not blocked by the Earth is filtered through a \"thick slice of Earth's atmosphere\" as it heads toward the moon's surface, according to NASA. The more dust or clouds in Earth's atmosphere during the total lunar eclipse, the redder the moon will appear.",

      "This is the same phenomenon that makes the sky appear blue during the day.",
      "Why is March's full moon called the worm moon?",
      "The Worm Moon nickname may have come from the earthworms typically found as spring nears, according to the\u00a0Old Farmer's Almanac. Other research suggests the name may date back to writings from the 1760s about worms, or beetle larvae, coming out from bark as trees thaw from the winter.",
      "There are also other names for March's full moon related to the transition from winter to spring. The first day of spring will be on March 20, just days after the Worm Moon.",
      "Other names for March's full moon are the Eagle Moon, Goose Moon, Crow Comes Back Moon, Sugar Moon, Wind Strong Moon and Sore Eyes Moon.",
      "What else can you see during the full Blood Worm Moon?",
      "If there's a bit of rain during the full moon, there may be a rare moonbow, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. It's like a rainbow, but created by moonlight, rather than sunlight. Moonbows only happen when the full Moon is fairly low in the sky, so the phenomenon would be most apparent in the hours after sunset when the sky is dark.",
      "Viewers can also look to the western sky on the night of the total lunar eclipse to catch a glimpse of Jupiter and Mars, according to NASA. Constellations may also be easier to spot than usual as Earth's shadow dims the Moon's glow.",

    "story": [
      "A space probe flying past Mars captured images of the red planet's small, mysterious moon.",
      "The space probe, named Hera, was launched on Oct. 7, 2024, and is on a mission to gather close-up data about the Dimorphos asteroid, the European Space Agency said in a news release. The asteroid was the first to have its orbit altered by human action, when it was impacted by NASA's DART spacecraft in 2022. The goal of Hera is to learn more about asteroid deflection so the technique can be refined and used again.",
      "While on a flyby of Mars, Hera was able to use three of its imaging instruments to capture images of Deimos, the smaller of Mars' two moons, the ESA said. Deimos is about 15,000 miles from Mars. Scientists have previously speculated that it may actually be a piece of asteroid, not a moon.",
      "Hera got as close as 1,000 kilometers, or about 620 miles, to Deimos. It used its various instruments to capture the images, characterize the mineral makeup on the moon and chart surface temperatures. These features combined will help scientists learn more about the lunar body, the ESA said.",
      "\"These instruments have been tried out before, during Hera's departure from Earth, but this is the first time that we have employed them on a small distant moon for which we still lack knowledge \u2013 demonstrating their excellent performance in the process,\" ESA Hera mission scientist Michael Kueppers said in the news release.",
      "The ESA's Mars Express, which has been orbiting the red planet for over 20 years, also contributed observations of the moon. Results from the encounter should help guide operational planning for a mission set to explore Martian moons in 2026, the ESA said. That mission, in conjunction with NASA and French and German space agencies, will collect detailed measurements of Mars' two moons and land on Phobos, the larger lunar body, to collect a sample that can be returned to Earth for analysis.",
      "Hera also used the flyby of Mars to adjust its trajectory through deep space. That maneuver shortened Hera's travel time to Dimorphos, the ESA said. Hera will also collect information about Didymos, the asteroid that Dimorphos orbits around. Hera is expected to reach the Didymos in December 2026, the ESA said.",
      "\"This has been the Hera team's first exciting experience of exploration, but not our last,\" said Hera mission manager Ian Carnelli in the news release. \"In 21 months the spacecraft will reach our target asteroids, and start our crash site investigation of the only object in our Solar System to have had its orbit measurably altered by human action.\"",

If the problem can be resolved in time, NASA and SpaceX will make another attempt to launch the crew Friday evening.",
      "The scrub will add at least two more days to the eventual return to Earth of Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams, along with two other outgoing space station crew members.",
      "Crew-10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov were strapped in and ready for blastoff from historic pad 39 at the Kennedy Space Center at 7:48 p.m. EDT Wednesday.",
      "But throughout the final few hours of the countdown, SpaceX engineers were troubleshooting an apparent problem with one of two clamp arms that hold the Falcon 9 rocket to its launch support gantry. Hydraulics are used to retract the two clamps prior to launch, and while the system appeared to be working normally, it wasn't clear whether one of the arms would retract fully.",
      "A launch opportunity Thursday was ruled out due to expected high winds and to give engineers more time to assess data and determine what, if any, repairs are needed. If the hydraulics problem can be resolved in time, NASA and SpaceX could be ready to press ahead with a launch attempt at 7:03 p.m. Friday.",
      "Whenever Crew-10 takes off, rendezvous and docking with the space station is expected the following day.",
      "Standing by to welcome them aboard will be Crew-9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams, along with cosmonauts Alexsey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Don Pettit, who were launched last September aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "McClain and her crewmates will spend two days getting briefed by Crew-9 on the intricacies of space station operations before Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams undock on March 19\u00a0for their return to Earth. The normal \"handover\" period is five days or so, but mission managers shortened it this time around to maintain the lab's food reserves.",
      "While the ongoing saga of the \"stranded\" Starliner astronauts has overshadowed the Crew-10 mission, McClain said she and her crewmates began training for their mission in 2023 and they were all eager to finally get into space. McClain and Onishi are space station veterans while Ayers and Peskov are making their first flight.",
      "All four are veteran military or commercial pilots. Before joining NASA, McClain, an active-duty Army colonel, served as a combat helicopter pilot while Ayers, an Air Force major, is a veteran F-22 Raptor pilot. Onishi served as a commercial pilot in Japan, flying Boeing 767 jetliners, and Peskov is an experienced commercial 757 pilot.",
      "\"We're going to have planned and unplanned maintenance to keep the space station running,\" McClain said. \"We have a plethora of science experiments, both inside and outside of the space station. We have spacewalks. We have visiting vehicles (and) the potential of (hosting) private astronaut missions.\"",
      "\"They're ready to come home\"",
      "As for Wilmore and Williams, McClain said, \"honestly, I'm kind of most looking forward to breaking bread with those guys, talking to them, giving them big hugs. We go way back. ... We're ready to go up there. They're ready to come home.\"",
      "\"This is a huge mission for us on Crew 10,\" said Steve Stich, manager of the commercial crew program that oversees SpaceX Crew Dragons and Boeing's Starliner. \"They're all big, but this started all the way back to Crew 9 when we launched that mission with two empty seats, and we had those seats reserved for Butch and Suni.\"",
      "The Starliner astronauts have \"just done a phenomenal job,\" Stich said, \"and so we're excited to bring them back.\"",
      "Given an on-time launch for Crew 10 Friday, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams could undock on March 19 and land as early as March 20 or 21. If so, the Starliner astronauts will have logged 288 days or so \u2014  9.5 months \u2014  \u00a0in space on a flight originally expected to last a little longer than one week. Hague and Gorbunov's time in space will come to about 173 days.",
      "The U.S. record for longest single spaceflight is held by astronaut Frank Rubio, who spent 371 days in space because of problems with the Soyuz spacecraft that carried him to orbit. Like the Starliner crew, he was forced to extend his mission and come home on a different Soyuz.",
      "In any case, what would normally be a relatively routine crew rotation, sending up four crew members to replace four others wrapping up a five- to six-month station visit, has turned into political theater, fueled by repeated criticism from President Trump and Elon Musk blaming the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's predicament.",
      "Musk said in a post on his social media platform X that he offered to \"go get\" Wilmore and Williams earlier, but the offer was turned down. He did not say who turned the proposal down or even whether it was someone at NASA or the White House.",
      "\"Biden left them up there,\" Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on March 6. \"We have two astronauts that are stuck in space. I have asked Elon, I said, do me a favor, can you get 'em out? He said yes. He is preparing to go up I think in two weeks.\"",
      "But the Crew Dragon he was referring to will not be bringing Wilmore and Williams back to Earth. It will be carrying the Crew-10 fliers and will remain docked at the outpost for the next five months. Their arrival does, however, clear the way for Crew-9, including Wilmore and Williams, to finally return to Earth aboard their own Crew Dragon.",
      "That Crew Dragon, which carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September for a normal tour of duty, has been docked at the lab ever since. It was launched with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams so their ride home has been at the station for the past five-and-a-half months.",
      "NASA could have brought Crew-9 down earlier, but that would have left a single astronaut, Pettit, aboard the lab to operate and maintain the U.S. segment of the space station. Research would have ground to a halt and he would have had difficulty in a variety of emergency scenarios.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams told CBS News in an in-flight interview. \"And, you know, the space station is big. It's a building, you know, it's the size of a football field. Things happen.",
      "\"So things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside and outside. And so having additional people to be able to do that is really important.\"",
      "\"We don't feel stranded\"",
      "Both Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly said they are not \"stranded\" and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "\"That's been the narrative from day one, stranded, abandoned, stuck, and I get it, we both get it,\" Wilmore told a reporter during a recent interview. \"But that is, again, not what our human space flight program is about. We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded.",
      "\"We come prepared. We come committed. That is what your human space flight program is. It prepares for any and all contingencies that we can conceive of, and we prepare for those. ... Let's change (the narrative) to 'prepared' and 'committed.'\"",
      "And so, NASA's plan to bring the Starliner astronauts home, a plan managers said minimized disruption to the space station crew rotation schedule, has been in place since last August. Even so, the president has repeatedly blamed the Biden administration for the extended mission.",
      "NASA managers have not openly challenged the president's comments and have generally downplayed their responses to questions about Musk's claim to have offered to launch another Crew Dragon to bring Wilmore and Williams home.",
      "Last August, Stich was asked about the possibility of launching a mission specifically to bring the Starliner crew back to Earth. He told reporters during a news conference that the agency \"really never considered that option.\"",
      "\"From the very beginning, we liked the option of modifying Crew-9 or Crew-8,\" he said, referring to the option of adding Williams and Wilmore to Hague's crew or whether to shoehorn them into a Crew Dragon that brought four other station fliers back to Earth last October.",
      "\"We looked at both of those and bringing them back on either one of those vehicles,\" Stich said at the time. \"We're trying to lay out the rest of our manifest to make sure we have vehicles available for all the flights. It just didn't make sense to go ahead and accelerate a flight to return Butch and Suni earlier.\"",
      "What went wrong with Boeing's Starliner?",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched aboard a Boeing Starliner capsule last June 5 for the spacecraft's first piloted test flight. They successfully docked with the International Space Station the next day, but the Starliner experienced multiple helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets that did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "NASA carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine whether the Starliner could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could safely come home in the Starliner. But NASA managers disagreed and ruled that option out. Instead, as Stich described, they decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year\u00a0when they could hitch a ride back aboard the Crew-9 Dragon.",
      "The Starliner astronauts took the news of a lengthy mission extension in stride.",
      "\"Butch, and I knew this was a test flight, we knew that we would probably find some things (that did not work as expected), and we found some stuff,\" Williams told CBS News. \"And so that was not a surprise. The discussion went over the summer, and as things started unrolling, unraveling, we sort of understood that, hey, we might be up here a little bit longer.",
      "\"And that's what our job is. We have both been in the military, both Navy guys, our deployments have been extended. You do what's right for the team, and what was right for the team is to stay up here and be expedition crew members for the International Space Station.\"",
      "Last September, Boeing successfully brought the Starliner down by remote control and NASA launched the Crew-9 mission aboard a Crew Dragon carrying just two crew members, Hague and Gorbunov, along with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Starliner astronauts joined the Crew-9 expedition and originally expected to return to Earth in February after arrival of the next Crew Dragon in the crew rotation sequence. But the Crew-10 Dragon, a new vehicle making its first flight, ran into problems that delayed launch, and Crew-9's return, to the end of March.",
      "NASA eventually decided to switch Crew-10 to a different Dragon, enabling a launch on March 12, a few weeks earlier than the previous late March target. Stich said the capsule swap and slightly earlier launch date were not the result of any outside pressure.",
      "The decision \"really was driven by a lot of other factors,\" Stich said. \"We were looking at this before some of those statements were made by the President and Mr. Musk.\"",
      "Said Ken Bowersox, NASA's chief of spaceflight operations at agency Headquarters: \"I can verify that Steve had been talking about how we might need to juggle the flights and switch capsules a good month before there was any discussion outside of NASA.\"",
      "\"But the president's interest sure added energy to the conversation, and it's great to have a president who's interested in what we're doing.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 16:47:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Faced with the need to cut carbon emissions, and an increasing energy demand to power AI, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon are investing in nuclear, from restarting Three Mile Island, to creating \"small modular reactors.\"",
    "story": [
      "It might have seemed like one of the weirder headlines of 2024: Microsoft is paying $1.6 billion to restart Three Mile Island. That's the nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania whose reactor #2 had a partial meltdown in 1979. There were no injuries, and nobody died, but it set the nuclear industry back years. Only two new plants have been started since that accident.",
      "\"This is hallowed ground in the nuclear industry,\" said Joe Dominguez, the CEO of Constellation Energy, which owns about half of America's 54 nuclear plants (including Three Mile Island). \"This is a place where we learned and got better.\"",
      "He says that, as a result of the 1979 accident, there have been thousands of changes in protocols and procedures regarding nuclear power. \"The thing that people forget is that there was another reactor at the site,\" he said. \"That site, that reactor, continued to operate until 2019, when it was closed for economic reasons. Cheap natural gas, low demand, subsidization of different technologies in the business, [and] no policy supporting nuclear caused plants to start retiring.\"",
      "So, what is Microsoft's interest?",
      "All  of the Big Tech companies have ambitious goals to fight the climate  crisis. That includes Google and Microsoft, which have each  pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions. They were making progress, too; each has invested billions in wind and solar energy.",
      "And then, then artificial intelligence came along. AI data centers require huge amounts of electricity. \u00a0Big Tech realized that they wouldn't make their emissions goals without taking power into their own hands.",
      "Dominguez said, \"Microsoft is going to enjoy the benefit of the reliable, clean energy for 20 years.\"",
      "He says reopening the existing Three Mile Island facility would be quicker and less expensive than constructing a brand-new nuclear plant. \"At least 10 times cheaper than building a new plant,\" he said. \"And we think we could get it going in about three years, versus the last plant that was built, [which] took almost 10 years.\"",
      "But if you're a tech company, what do you do if you don't have a recently-retired nuclear plant handy? You develop new ones. Only weeks after Microsoft's announcement, both Amazon and Google announced major investments in nuclear power.",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google is supplementing its already enormous green energy investments with a new kind of nuclear, called small modular reactors. \"These are not the nuclear power plants of yesterday, with the very large cooling towers,\" said Michael Terrell, who heads Google's decarbonization efforts. \"These are much smaller facilities. But because they're modular, you can stack them together to make bigger power plants.",
      "He anticipates the first advanced nuclear reactor will be online by 2030. \"And we're not going to do just one reactor, but we hope to buy from what will be a series of reactors that follow that,\" Terrell said.",
      "Nuclear power still isn't perfect; it still produces waste that has to be safely stored. But unlike solar and wind, nuclear power is always on, which is essential to those AI data centers.",
      "So, Google is funding a company called Kairos Power to design and build this new generation of reactors. Kairos is building three small demonstration plants in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on the very spot where uranium was processed for the first atomic bomb.",
      "CEO Mike Laufer says that his reactors don't use fuel rods; they use fuel pebbles, about the size of golf balls \u2013 mostly graphite, with tiny kernels of uranium. And each pebble has as much power capacity as four tons of coal.",
      "And how much carbon dioxide emissions, compared to coal? \"Zero,\" Laufer said.",
      "The Kairos reactors also run at lower power and lower pressure than traditional reactors, which means lower risk.",
      "Well, this all sounds great! But what's the catch?",
      "\"There's only one problem with small modular reactors: They don't really exist,\" said George Washington University professor Sharon Squassoni, who spent 15 years researching nuclear safety for the government. She thinks Big Tech companies might be in over their heads. \"I think they're going to find out pretty quickly that it takes way too long and it's way too expensive,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see just how strong their commitments are to clean energy futures.\"",
      "\"So, you're saying they may have to turn to burning stuff [for power]?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure they will,\" Squassoni replied.",
      "\"Do you think there's a little bit of tech-bro overconfidence therein?\"",
      "\"Oh, completely, completely!\" she laughed.",
      "Kairos' Mike Laufer admitted, \"Yes, it's really hard. I will totally agree with anyone. But we're doing it at smaller scale to start, and then building on that in the future.\"",
      "Joe Dominguez's team is getting Three Mile Island ready for Microsoft, including renaming the plant the Crane Clean Energy Center. And if AI is igniting a renaissance in American nuclear, he says: full steam ahead.",
      "I asked, \"Why do all new plants take so much longer and cost so much more than projected?\"",
      "\"Honest answer? We don't build enough of them,\" Dominguez said. \"You don't want to build a unique design; you want to do kind of a cookie-cutter, one-after-another design.\"",
      "\"Is it well understood in government and the industry that if you start doing the same design over and over, we can get there faster and cheaper?\"",
      "\"It's probably the best understood idea,\" Dominguez said. \"It's understood by both Republicans and Democrats, which is a hard thing to say about anything! Everybody understands that if you build a common design, you build a bunch of them.\"",
      "\"So, you think we'll get there?\"",
      "\"I do.\"",
      "Google's Michael Terrell agrees, and believes his company will make its zero-carbon goal by 2030. \"It is an incredibly ambitious goal: 24/7 carbon-free energy everywhere we operate every way around the world,\" he said. \"But it's something we're working very hard to achieve, and we hope to get there.\"",

    "story": [
      "Springtime brings warmer weather, longer days and nature's awakening across much of the country. It also brings higher chances for tornadoes, large hail, flash floods and damaging winds \u2014 and that means more alerts about threatening forecasts, which often come in the form of watches and warnings. There is a distinct difference between the two, particularly when it comes to what they mean about taking action when the weather takes a turn for the worse.",
      "Conditions in spring are more favorable for these severe weather events, which happen more frequently and with greater intensity.",
      "What's the difference between a watch and a warning?",
      "A watch is usually issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Storm Prediction Center, or SPC, hours ahead of a storm system. A watch is intended to alert people in affected areas to monitor weather conditions and stay informed about forecasts. They are issued over a larger area that could span numerous counties or states.",
      "No matter what type of watch is issued, such as a severe thunderstorm watch or a tornado watch, they urge people to be prepared to act quickly.",
      "A warning is more urgent and calls for action to be taken immediately. It is issued by the nearest National Weather Service office when a severe weather event has either been spotted by someone on the ground or indicated on radar. They are issued for a much smaller area, like a city or small county.",

      "How meteorologists monitor severe weather",
      "Specialists at NOAA's Storm Prediction Center monitor severe weather and can issue forecast outlooks days in advance.",
      "They use a 1-5 rating system to categorize severe thunderstorms, with 1 indicating a \"marginal\" threat with isolated storms possible, and 5 indicating a \"high\" threat that includes widespread, damaging winds and/or a tornado outbreak.",

      "Meteorologists analyze the forecast models well ahead of storm systems to look at the atmospheric conditions that may be favorable for issuing any kind of weather alerts. In the case of possible severe storms, they look at where moisture is as well as where cold fronts may track, which would help fuel thunderstorm development. They also consider the speed at which a storm develops and its severity on forecast models to help determine where to issue a severe storm outlook and how high to rate it.",

      "The order from U.S. District Judge James Bredar came late Thursday in a lawsuit filed by 19 states and the District of Columbia against multiple federal agencies alleging the mass firings are illegal.",
      "\"In this case, the government conducted massive layoffs, but it gave no advance notice,\" Bredar wrote. \"It claims it wasn't required to because, it says, it dismissed each one of these thousands of probationary employees for 'performance' or other individualized reasons. On the record before the Court, this isn't true. There were no individualized assessments of employees. They were all just fired. Collectively.\"",
      "The states contend the Trump administration blindsided them by ignoring laws set out for large-scale layoffs, which already are having an impact on state governments as they try to help the suddenly jobless. At least 24,000 probationary employees have been terminated since President Trump took office, the lawsuit alleges, though efforts by the judge to get an estimate from a government attorney at a hearing Wednesday were unsuccessful.",
      "The Trump administration argues that the states have no right to try and influence the federal government's relationship with its own workers. Mr. Trump has said he's targeting fraud, waste and abuse in a bloated federal government.",
      "In his temporary restraining order, Bredar issued a 14-day stay on what he called \"illegal\" reductions in force. His order, however, did not apply to firings at the Department of Defense, the National Archives and Records Administration and the Office of Personnel Management.",
      "\"So, although it is a close call, at this early stage, and given that a TRO is 'an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief,'...there is insufficient basis in the record for the Court to conclude that RIFs likely occurred at these three agencies,\" Bredar wrote.",

    "summary": "A CDC program tests wastewater from airplanes, looking for pathogens that may have hitched a ride with passengers on long-haul international flights.",
    "story": [
      "In the past year, over 135 million passengers traveled to the U.S. from other countries. To infectious disease experts, that represents 135 million chances for an outbreak to begin. To identify and stop the next potential pandemic, government disease detectives have been discreetly searching for viral pathogens in wastewater from airplanes. Experts are worried that these efforts may not be enough.",
      "The CDC's Traveler Genomic Surveillance Program tests wastewater from airplanes, looking for pathogens that may have hitched a ride with passengers on long-haul international flights. This program operates with participating airlines at four major airports: Boston, San Francisco, New York's John F. Kennedy, and the Washington, D.C., area's Dulles.",
      "CBS News received exclusive on-site access to this program, which launched in September 2021 and has since expanded, thanks to a federal government grant of $120 million.",
      "In the time it takes to unload checked baggage, technicians collect a sample of wastewater from airplane lavatories. A courier ships these samples to a lab operated by private contractors at Ginkgo Bioworks in Boston. Researchers sift through the genetic material captured in each water sample, searching for infectious pathogens.",
      "\"We need to go find that needle in a haystack,\" explained Alex Plocik, Ginkgo's Biosecurity Genomics director. \"In theory, we can look at almost anything that is a potential biosecurity threat.\"",
      "One day, metagenomic sequencing, a technique used to analyze all of the genetic material in a sample, could allow researchers to detect new, previously unknown pathogens.",
      "\"These technologies are getting better all the time\u2026 that day is coming,\" said Plocik. However, for now, they are only testing for seven viruses: COVID-19, influenza A and B, adenovirus, norovirus, RSV, and mpox.",
      "Within 48 hours, wastewater testing can alert scientists if a passenger is carrying one of these viruses.",
      "Ginkgo shares the results with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and they're posted to a public dashboard to keep scientists around the world informed. (The most recent data posted is from Feb. 17. Neither the CDC nor the White House has commented on the program since President Trump took office.)",
      "Flight paths are tracked, allowing the CDC to see where the virus came from \u2014 information that can be particularly valuable when other countries are reluctant to share public health data. Government officials can use this intelligence to shape their public health response, which could include enhanced monitoring, contact tracing, and the administration of vaccines and preventive medications.",
      "But a dozen public health and national security experts consulted by CBS News expressed concern that the U.S. is not adequately prepared for another significant outbreak. While they are encouraged by technological advancements like airplane wastewater testing, some worry that the current program is too limited to reliably detect every incoming pathogen. At present, the CDC's airplane wastewater testing program is at only four airports, despite the fact that an estimated 333 international airports across the U.S. receive passengers, according to Department of Transportation data.",
      "Last September, CBS News sat down with Dr. David Fitter, the CDC's director of global migration health, to discuss the program and its impact. When asked if the U.S. is prepared for another pandemic, he paused for more than 10 seconds before answering. \"We've learned a lot from COVID. We've learned that we need early detection. We've learned about surveillance systems. We've learned about expanding testing capacity so that we can respond faster. We continue to learn, and I think that we are prepared to go forward,\" Fitter said.",
      "The coronavirus made its way to the U.S. on Jan. 15, 2020, when a 35-year-old American businessman disembarked from a flight in Washington state after visiting Wuhan, China. Unaware that he was infected, he became the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States. Public health officials are unsure if he was truly the first case in the country, as no tests were conducted on passengers or airplane wastewater at that time.",
      "\"Disease doesn't know geographic boundaries\"",
      "The CDC's airplane wastewater testing program is designed to act as radar for infectious diseases entering the country.",
      "\"Disease doesn't know geographic boundaries,\" explained Fitter. \"Our job is to stop disease from entering the U.S., and I think that's where it's helping us: we're able to detect early, respond faster.\"",
      "The CDC is monitoring various outbreaks around the world \u2014 including Marburg in Tanzania, Ebola in Uganda, and mpox in the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2014 but of these, currently only has the capacity to test for mpox in airplane wastewater.",
      "As a proof of concept, the CDC's airplane wastewater testing program successfully detected new COVID variants three weeks before they appeared in municipal wastewater and two weeks before a surge in cases at doctors' offices. This advance warning provides public health officials and healthcare providers with lead time to prepare.",
      "\"Early warning could mean the difference between life and millions of deaths,\" said Admiral Brett Giroir, President Trump's COVID testing czar at the height of the pandemic in 2020 and now an infectious disease adviser to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "While at DARPA years before the COVID pandemic, Giroir looked at wastewater testing as a surveillance tool to determine whether foreign facilities might be producing bioweapons. But he came to realize that wastewater testing had many potential applications. He was a big advocate for wastewater testing programs early in the COVID pandemic.",
      "\"If we see a spike going on, we don't wait until 300,000 people are in the emergency room. We know right away to raise the flag to get the vaccines up, to get antivirals, to get testing, to get everything started,\" said Giroir.",
      "Recently declassified U.S. intelligence warned that \"a pathogen can travel from a remote village to a major city in less than thirty-six hours.\"",
      "A report\u00a0released last spring by the National Intelligence Council stated that the COVID pandemic \"strained\" global health systems, \"diminished\" their ability to detect and respond to outbreaks, and undermined public trust in government, reducing people's willingness to follow public health guidance. The report further cautioned that while COVID was a once-in-a-century pandemic, odds are that it won't be the last for this generation, noting a \"nearly 28% chance that a pandemic at least as deadly as COVID-19 would occur during the decade.\"",
      "In January, one of President Trump's first official actions was to release a new CIA report suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic was most likely caused by a lab leak in China. The world may never know for certain whether the pandemic originated from an animal-to-human spillover or a lab leak. However, expanding wastewater testing beyond municipal treatment plants and airplane wastewater could help provide answers in the future.",
      "\"The lesson I would like everyone to understand is that it doesn't matter whether it's natural or a lab leak\u2026 BSL-4 laboratories are a risk,\" Giroir said. Wastewater surveillance might be conducted in areas where humans come into close contact with domesticated animals or wildlife. \"One might even think of doing wastewater surveillance from the BSL-4 laboratory because if a person's infected, they use the toilet in that laboratory, and you might be able to detect that bug out of the wastewater knowing immediately that somebody got infected,\" Giroir said.",

      "\"Everybody who can is going to take that early out, but I think that 7,000 number is conservative,\" O'Malley said Thursday at a panel discussion on recent changes at the agency and how they could affect customer service, held by the National Academy of Social Insurance (NASI), a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization.",

      "The amount of the SSA incentive payments being offered individual workers depends on the employee's classification, or where they stand on the federal payscale. The highest-tier worker would receive a maximum of $25,000.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 18:19:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth vowed in January to review \"in a gender-neutral way\" readiness standards for troops.",
    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered a review of military standards, including physical fitness, body composition and grooming. It's a review Hegseth promised during his confirmation hearing when questioned about his statements he's made that military standards have eroded.",
      "\"That will be part of one of the first things we do at the Pentagon \u2014 is reviewing that in a gender-neutral way \u2014 the standards ensuring readiness and meritocracy is front and center,\" Hegseth said in January.",
      "The Pentagon released a memo Wednesday night from Hegseth that directs the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness to review the existing standards set by the military departments.",
      "\"We must remain vigilant in maintaining the standards that enable the men and women of our military to protect the American people and our homeland as the world's most lethal and effective fighting force,\" Hegseth said. \"Our adversaries are not growing weaker, and our tasks are not growing less challenging.\"",
      "The memo directs the review to examine the standards and how they have changed since Jan. 1, 2015. In December 2015, the Defense Department announced it would open up all combat roles to women.",
      "Hegseth has previously opposed that policy decision, saying in a podcast interview shortly before he was tapped as defense secretary, \"We should not have women in combat roles. It hasn't made us more effective. Hasn't made us more lethal.\"",
      "Hegseth walked that view back somewhat during his confirmation hearing, promising that women would have access to combat roles if the standards remain high and \"have not been eroded.\"",
      "Katherine Kuzminski, the director of studies at the Center for a New American Security, told CBS News in an interview there are separate requirements for men and women, as well as for different ages, to pass the Army Combat Fitness Test that every recruit has to pass. To qualify for special forces, however, the standards are gender-neutral.",
      "\"Those standards are uniform across the genders,\" Kuzminski said, \"which is why we have only seen very small numbers of women going into special operations.\"",
      "For example, as of early January, according to data provided by the Army, there have been 156 female graduates of the notoriously grueling Ranger Course, with 381 women attending the course since it was first made available to women in 2015, for a graduation rate of approximately 41%.",
      "The Ranger Course requires all candidates to swim 15 meters in full uniform, run five miles in under 40 minutes and march 12 miles with a 35-lb. ruck, according to\u00a0the Army.",
      "\"The standards have not been lowered, and each Ranger Course graduate meets the same training standards,\" an Army official told CBS News.",
      "The Pentagon's review could lead to a change in the Army Combat Fitness test, the generic test, so that the requirements are the same for men and women.",
      "Currently, the Army Combat Fitness test is scored based on different requirements for men and women, depending on age. For instance, a man who's 17 to 21 years of age must at a minimum be able to run two miles in 22 minutes, while a woman would need to run the same distance in 23:22. The minimum requirement for hand-release push-ups \u2014 which involve lifting your hands off the ground at the bottom of the push-up \u2014 is the same for men and women of any age: 10.",
      "Facing a recruiting crisis, services in recent years have offered adjustments on drug and tattoo policies and provided enlistment bonuses to attract potential service members, while still maintaining physical and educational standards. The Army also launched pre-enlistment boot camps to help potential candidates get into shape before going into basic training.",
      "Hegseth said during his confirmation hearing that while writing his book \"War on Warriors,\" he spoke to service members who told him that \"in ways direct, indirect, overt and subtle\" standards have changed, but Hegseth didn't provide senators with concrete examples.",
      "Kuzminski also said the defense secretary's review could include revisiting grooming standards, like the Army allowing women to\u00a0wear ponytails or the Navy permitting some men to grow\u00a0facial hair, due to a medical condition exacerbated by shaving.",
      "\"They seem like little things, but they were also tied to a broader initiative during the Biden administration to ensure that there weren't any standards that were disproportionately affecting minorities,\" Kuzminski said.",
      "Kuzminski added that changing those back may have some impact on recruiting or retention, but \"it's not something that's going to break the force because the objective of every person in uniform is professionalism, and they will follow through the standard, whatever the standard is.\"",

    "story": [
      "Those who glanced up at the sky Thursday night had an opportunity to catch the March 2025 \"Blood Moon,\" a phenomenon that colors the full moon in shades of red, orange and yellow during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "This month's full moon\u00a0was due to pass through the shadow of Earth either late Thursday night or very early Friday morning, depending on the viewer's time zone. It was visible to people in the Americas and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Dubbed the \"Worm Moon\" by the Farmer's Almanac, which has been assigning names to full moons for almost a century, this one is expected to last through Saturday morning, according to NASA. The full moon technically rose in its totality early Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about the event \u2014 and why the moon showed a new hue when it happened.",
      "Why was the moon red, orange and yellow?",
      "The moon appeared to turn red as Earth passed directly between it and the sun in what's known as a total lunar eclipse. Their perfect alignment darkens the moon, from the perspective of folks looking up, because our planet's position blocks most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "Some light still makes its way to the moon's surface, but only certain shades of it. The colors that wind up there are longer wavelengths of light \u2014 red, orange, yellow \u2014 which withstood the journey through \"a thick slice of Earth's atmosphere,\" NASA said.",
      "Shorter wavelengths of the color spectrum, like blue, scatter easily when they hit the atmosphere. That's why a vast sky can look blue in the middle of the day, when sunlight can shine straight down from overhead. Longer wavelengths materialize on Earth when sunlight hits from more of a perpendicular angle, so its route through our atmosphere can be more extensive. Short wavelengths are essentially filtered out by the atmosphere over such a protracted distance, and only the longer reds, oranges and yellows remain.",
      "What is a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "\"Blood Moon\" is a nickname that refers to the moon's reddish appearance during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "The full moon takes on several shades of red, orange and yellow when it's nearer the outer edges of Earth's shadow \u2014 when it first intersects with the path of Earth's shadow, for example, and as it's on its way out. But shades of deep red will become more pronounced as the moon enters the darkest part of the shadow.",
      "What exactly causes a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "A \"Blood Moon\" happens during a total lunar eclipse, when the sun, Earth and the moon align in that order. Long wavelengths of sunlight are refracted through Earth's atmosphere before reaching the moon, which reflects them in reddish hues that may resemble the color of blood.",
      "How to see the \"Blood Moon\" lunar eclipse",
      "The upcoming \"Blood Moon\" will begin before the full moon reaches its brightness point tonight.",
      "As the lunar eclipse gets underway, the moon will start moving through Earth's shadow at 11:57 p.m. EDT. It will become steadily dimmer over the next several hours as it travels toward the darkest part of the shadow and, eventually, appear fully darkened from around 2:26 p.m. to 3:31 a.m. in the early hours of Friday. The most ideal opportunity to see the reddish moon is during the minutes leading up to 3 a.m. EDT, as the moon should be situated in the center of Earth's shadow around then.",

      "On the morning of the accident, some other chairlifts at Red Lodge Mountain were not operating because of high winds. Wind gusts of about 50 miles per hour were recorded in the area shortly before and after the accident, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Hawks said the Triple Chairlift, which is almost a mile long and was built in 1983, was operating within safety parameters. It will remain shut down until an engineer fully assesses it, he said.",
      "Staff at the ski area inspect its chairlifts daily, Hawks said. A professional inspection is conducted annually as required by Red Lodge Mountain's insurance carrier and the U.S. Forest Service, which leases land to the ski area, he said.",
      "\"We place a top priority on the safety of all of our lifts and lift operations, and perform daily, weekly, monthly, and annual safety measures to better ensure the safe operation of our lifts,\" the resort said in a statement\u00a0on social media.",
      "A GoFundMe page for Zinne described him as a \"devoted husband\" to his wife and a \"caring father\" to his two-year-old son.",
      "\"This unexpected loss has left his family, friends, and all who knew him heartbroken and in disbelief,\" the GoFundMe said.",
      "Fatal lift accidents at ski areas are relatively rare, according to the National Ski Areas Association. Between 1956 and 2024, 35 people died in accidents involving chairlifts and aerial ropeways. Sixteen of the deaths were linked to mechanical malfunctions, according to data collected by the group.",
      "The latest death during that time period was in 2020, when a man died at\u00a0Colorado's Vail resort\u00a0after his clothing got entangled in part of the chairlift, making him unable to breathe.",

    "story": [
      "Those who glanced up at the sky Thursday night had an opportunity to catch the March 2025 \"Blood Moon,\" a phenomenon that colors the full moon in shades of red, orange and yellow during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "This month's full moon\u00a0was due to pass through the shadow of Earth either late Thursday night or very early Friday morning, depending on the viewer's time zone. It was visible to people in the Americas and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Dubbed the \"Worm Moon\" by the Farmer's Almanac, which has been assigning names to full moons for almost a century, this one is expected to last through Saturday morning, according to NASA. The full moon technically rose in its totality early Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about the event \u2014 and why the moon showed a new hue when it happened.",
      "Why was the moon red, orange and yellow?",
      "The moon appeared to turn red as Earth passed directly between it and the sun in what's known as a total lunar eclipse. Their perfect alignment darkens the moon, from the perspective of folks looking up, because our planet's position blocks most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "Some light still makes its way to the moon's surface, but only certain shades of it. The colors that wind up there are longer wavelengths of light \u2014 red, orange, yellow \u2014 which withstood the journey through \"a thick slice of Earth's atmosphere,\" NASA said.",
      "Shorter wavelengths of the color spectrum, like blue, scatter easily when they hit the atmosphere. That's why a vast sky can look blue in the middle of the day, when sunlight can shine straight down from overhead. Longer wavelengths materialize on Earth when sunlight hits from more of a perpendicular angle, so its route through our atmosphere can be more extensive. Short wavelengths are essentially filtered out by the atmosphere over such a protracted distance, and only the longer reds, oranges and yellows remain.",
      "What is a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "\"Blood Moon\" is a nickname that refers to the moon's reddish appearance during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "The full moon takes on several shades of red, orange and yellow when it's nearer the outer edges of Earth's shadow \u2014 when it first intersects with the path of Earth's shadow, for example, and as it's on its way out. But shades of deep red will become more pronounced as the moon enters the darkest part of the shadow.",
      "What exactly causes a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "A \"Blood Moon\" happens during a total lunar eclipse, when the sun, Earth and the moon align in that order. Long wavelengths of sunlight are refracted through Earth's atmosphere before reaching the moon, which reflects them in reddish hues that may resemble the color of blood.",
      "How to see the \"Blood Moon\" lunar eclipse",
      "The upcoming \"Blood Moon\" will begin before the full moon reaches its brightness point tonight.",
      "As the lunar eclipse gets underway, the moon will start moving through Earth's shadow at 11:57 p.m. EDT. It will become steadily dimmer over the next several hours as it travels toward the darkest part of the shadow and, eventually, appear fully darkened from around 2:26 p.m. to 3:31 a.m. in the early hours of Friday. The most ideal opportunity to see the reddish moon is during the minutes leading up to 3 a.m. EDT, as the moon should be situated in the center of Earth's shadow around then.",

    "story": [
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that he agrees in principle with a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, but that the terms need to be worked out, and he emphasized that it should pave the way to lasting peace.",
      "\"The idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it,\" Putin said during a news conference in Moscow.",
      "\"But there are issues that we need to discuss, and I think that we need to discuss it with our American colleagues and partners,\" he said, adding that he could discuss those details in another phone conversation with President Trump.",
      "Putin noted that Ukrainian troops are encircled in their last foothold in Russia's Kursk region, and said it would be necessary to determine before a ceasefire whether they will lay down weapons and surrender. He also noted the need to develop a mechanism to control possible breaches of the truce, though the Kremlin has repeatedly ruled out Western troops being deployed to Ukraine as peacekeepers.",
      "\"We agree with the proposals to halt the fighting, but we proceed from the assumption that the ceasefire should lead to lasting peace and remove the root causes of the crisis,\" said Putin, who has always blamed the war and his full-scale invasion that sparked it on Ukraine.",
      "He said that while the U.S. had apparently persuaded Ukraine to accept a ceasefire, Kyiv was interested in a truce because of the battlefield situation.",
      "\"In these conditions, I believe it would be good for the Ukrainian side to secure a ceasefire for at least 30 days,\" he said.",
      "Putin spoke hours after a senior U.S. envoy arrived in Moscow to discuss the U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire, and less than a day after he made a first visit to his commanders in Kursk, wearing military fatigues and promising the full recapture of the region.",
      "On Wednesday, a U.S. official confirmed to CBS News that Russian troops had made \"significant gains\" in Kursk over the past week. Russia has been maneuvering to surround the Ukrainian forces who launched a surprise incursion into Kursk months ago, and they have succeeded in doing so to the extent that the Ukrainians will likely soon have to decide whether to withdraw back into Ukraine, or be cut off from their supply lines, the American official told CBS News a day before Putin made essentially the same assertion.",
      "The renewed Russian military push and Putin's high-profile visit to his troops in Kursk came amid Mr. Trump's push for a rapid diplomatic end to the war sparked by Russia's full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. The U.S. on Tuesday lifted its March 3 suspension of military aid and intelligence sharing for Kyiv after senior U.S. and Ukrainian officials made progress on how to stop the fighting during talks held in Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"It's up to Russia now,\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday, as his administration presses Moscow to agree to the ceasefire. The U.S. president has made veiled threats to hit Russia with new sanctions if it refuses to engage with his peace efforts, saying Wednesday that, \"in a financial sense, we could do things very bad for Russia. It would be devastating for Russia. But I don't want to do that because I want to see peace.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Mr. Trump's special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, Steve Witkoff, was heading to Moscow for talks with Russian officials, possibly including Putin. His plane touched down in Moscow on Thursday morning, but his schedule was not revealed.",
      "Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said after meeting Thursday with U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz, who was with Witkoff in Moscow, that the U.S. proposal for a one-month ceasefire failed to take into account Russia's position, and would need reworking, according to Russian media.",
      "\"The document, it seems to me, has a hasty character,\" Ushakov said, according to Russia's state-run RIA news agency \"Itwill be necessary to work, think and take into account our position, too. It outlines only the Ukrainian approach.\"",
      "The Kremlin has repeatedly ruled out accepting any agreement that sees Western forces deployed in Ukraine to help maintain a peace, something many European nations have said will be needed, though only Britain and France have suggested any willingness to do so.",
      "By signaling its openness to a ceasefire, Ukraine has presented the Kremlin with a dilemma at a time when the Russian military has the upper hand in the war \u2014 whether to accept a truce and abandon hopes of making new gains, or reject the offer and risk derailing a cautious rapprochement with Washington.",
      "The Ukrainian army's foothold inside Russia has been under intense pressure for months from a renewed effort by Russian forces, backed by North Korean troops. Ukraine's daring incursion last August led to the first occupation of Russian soil by foreign troops since World War II and embarrassed the Kremlin.",
      "But given the recent Russian advances, Putin did not look like a man who was interested in ordering his forces to lay down their weapons on Wednesday as he visited troops in Kursk, wearing military fatigues and talking strategy with his commanders. He said he expected the military \"to completely free the Kursk region from the enemy in the nearest future.\"",
      "Putin added that going forward, \"it's necessary to think about creating a security zone alongside the state border,\" in a signal that Moscow could try to expand its territorial gains by capturing parts of Ukraine's neighboring Sumy region. That idea could complicate a ceasefire deal.",
      "Ukraine launched the summer raid into Kursk in a bid to counter the increasingly glum news from the front line, as well as to draw Russian troops away from the battlefield inside Ukraine and gain a bargaining chip in any peace talks. But the incursion failed to significantly change the dynamic of the war.",
      "Ukraine's top military head, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said late Wednesday that Russian aviation had carried out an unprecedented number of strikes on Kursk and that as a result Sudzha had been almost completely destroyed. He did not comment on whether Ukraine still controlled the settlement but said it was \"maneuvering (troops) to more advantageous lines.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Major General Dmytro Krasylnykov, commander of Ukraine's Northern Operational Command, which includes the Kursk region, was dismissed from his post, he told Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne on Wednesday.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's nominee to be ambassador to Canada affirmed the nation's sovereignty on Thursday amid the president's repeated threats to make it part of the United States.",
      "\"Canada is a sovereign state, yes,\" Pete Hoekstra said during his confirmation hearing when asked by Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware whether he agreed that Canada is an independent nation and that it \"should not be even jokingly referred to as the 51st state.\"",
      "Hoekstra also said that the two countries \"have a great history of working together.\" He added that Mr. Trump's priorities of \"freer, fairer trade\" would \"grow the business relationship\" with Canada.",
      "On Thursday, Mr. Trump questioned the international boundary between the U.S. and Canada, calling it an \"artificial line\" that somebody drew decades ago.",
      "\"Makes no sense,\" he said.",
      "This week, Mr. Trump imposed 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and threatened to double the levies if the country did not suspend its new 25% surcharge on exports of electricity to several U.S. states.",
      "Mr. Trump has justified the tariffs as protecting U.S. interests, though the existing trade agreement with Canada was negotiated and signed by him during his first term. The president suggested that Canada should acquiesce to his requests for annexation to alleviate the economic pressure.",
      "\"The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State,\" Mr. Trump wrote Tuesday. \"This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear. Canadians' taxes will be very substantially reduced, they will be more secure, militarily and otherwise, than ever before, there would no longer be a Northern Border problem, and the greatest and most powerful nation in the World will be bigger, better and stronger than ever \u2014 And Canada will be a big part of that.\"",

    "summary": "Along with Arab nations backing an alternative to Trump's \"Riviera of the Mideast\" proposal, Hamas also cautiously welcomed his sharp change in rhetoric.",
    "story": [
      "During a meeting on Wednesday with Ireland's leader Michel Martin, President Trump made an offhand remark that was quickly picked up in the Middle East as a major change in his stance on the war-torn Gaza Strip and its roughly 2 million Palestinian inhabitants.",
      "\"Nobody is expelling any Palestinians,\" Mr. Trump told reporters.",
      "That came after he repeatedly said that under his own proposal to rebuild Gaza, all of its residents would be moved out, while the U.S. moved in to \"take over\" the coastal territory to turn it into a luxury real estate development. Just a month ago, Mr. Trump was clear that, in his mind, not only would Palestinians need to leave Gaza, they would not be permitted to return.",
      "That plan was roundly and clearly rejected by Arab countries, including Egypt and Jordan, which Mr. Trump had said would take in the displaced masses.",
      "Egypt, which has led efforts to present an alternative plan for Gaza that does not involve displacing Palestinians, welcomed the change in tone by Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Egypt expresses its appreciation for the statements made by U.S. President, Donald Trump\u2026 regarding the non-displacement of the residents of the Gaza Strip,\" the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday. \"Egypt affirms that this position reflects an understanding of the importance of avoiding further deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the Strip and the necessity of working towards finding just and sustainable solutions to the Palestinian cause.\"",
      "Hamas, the U.S. and Israeli designated terrorist organization that sparked the war in Gaza with its brutal Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel, also cautiously welcomed the shift in Mr. Trump's rhetoric.",
      "\"If Trump's statements represent a retreat from the idea of Palestinian displacement, then they are welcomed,\" a statement from the group's spokesperson said.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks came Wednesday after his senior envoy Steve Witkoff met with the foreign ministers of five Arab nations in Qatar to discuss Gaza's post-war future. That future, regardless of what reconstruction plan is eventually implemented, can only start taking shape once there is an official end to the war, however.",
      "A fragile truce between Israel and Hamas has largely kept the peace since January 19, but the two sides have not yet agreed on whether to extend the first phase of the agreement, or to move onto a second phase as originally envisioned. The dialogue in Doha, Qatar, involving delegations from the host-nation as well as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan and the U.S. is aimed at pushing the process forward \u2013 and keeping the guns silent in Gaza.",
      "The five Arab nations involved have pushed the Egyptian-crafted alternative to Mr. Trump's \"Riviera of the Mideast\" proposal in their talks with American officials.",
      "The Arab plan, the rough outline of which officials shared with CBS News earlier this month, carries a price tag of $53 billion and envisions all of the enclave's residents remaining in Gaza throughout the years-long reconstruction. The Trump administration initially rejected the plan, with U.S. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes issuing a statement saying it failed to \" address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance.\"",
      "\"President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas,\" Hughes said at the time, adding: \"We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region.\"",
      "It appeared on Wednesday, with Mr. Trump's remarks at the White House, that those further talks with America's regional partners may have convinced the White House that displacing the entire population of Gaza was not a tenable proposition.",
      "\"The Arab foreign ministers presented the Gaza reconstruction plan, which was approved at the Arab Summit held in Cairo on March 4, 2025,\" the five Arab nations that met in Doha said in a joint statement shared Wednesday. \"They also agreed with the U.S. envoy to continue consultations and coordination on this plan as a basis for the reconstruction efforts in the sector.\"",
      "That Egyptian plan has been adopted by the broad Muslim solidarity group of 57 countries known as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. It envisions the Gaza Strip eventually being run by the Palestinian Authority, which currently administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, not by Hamas.",
      "That will likely prove an ongoing point of contention as the PA holds little support among Palestinians and has been dismissed as a potential future Gaza administrator by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, showing there's still much negotiation ahead if Mr. Trump is to make good on his vows to end the crisis in the heart of the Middle East.",

      "President Trump is planning to invoke a wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 as soon as Friday to authorize the summary deportation of some migrants, including to Guantanamo Bay, escalating his government-wide immigration crackdown, multiple U.S. officials familiar with the plan told CBS News.",
      "The 227-year-old law gives presidents the extraordinary power to order the arrest, detention and deportation of noncitizens who are 14 years or older and come from countries staging an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" of the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to cite the 18th-century statute to order the swift detention and deportation of suspected members of the Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang with prison origins that his administration has designated a foreign terrorist organization, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.",
      "Officials have made preparations to send suspected gang members to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, soon after Mr. Trump invokes the Alien Enemies Act, two of the U.S. officials said. At Mr. Trump's direction, officials have been detaining some migrants awaiting deportation at the naval base, though the holding facilities were left empty earlier this week.",
      "Those subject to the Alien Enemies Act would not be allowed to have a court hearing or an asylum interview since they would be processed under an emergency, wartime authority \u2014 not immigration law. Instead, they would be eligible to be detained and deported, with little to no due process, under Title 50, the section of the U.S. code housing America's war and defense laws.",
      "CNN first reported Mr. Trump's plans to invoke the law as early as Friday.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act has been invoked only a few times in U.S. history, including during World War II, when the government used it to surveil and detain Italian, German and Japanese immigrants in the U.S.",
      "Its invocation to target migrants from countries with which the U.S. is not actively at war is almost certain to face legal challenges.",
      "Mr. Trump previewed his invocation of the Alien Enemies Act in an executive order issued on his first day back at the White House. It directed the secretaries of state and homeland security to plan for the potential invocation of the law and prepare facilities \"necessary to expedite the removal\" of those subject to it.",
      "\"By invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities,\" Mr. Trump said in his inaugural address.",

      "In August 2021, Tamim Satari raced to the Kabul International Airport to evacuate Afghanistan after working with the American military as an intelligence officer, helping U.S. forces coordinate aerial bomb campaigns against the Taliban. But in the chaos of the U.S. withdrawal, his wife and newborn son were left behind.",
      "\"It was so hard, and we didn't want to lose our small son,\" Satari said.",
      "He was not alone. Thousands of Afghan families were separated in the rushed withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Babies were passed across throngs of people and over fences, and families scrambled to get through the gates to the airport.",
      "Three years later, more than 10,000 families remain separated, according to Shawn VanDiver, the founder of #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that worked with the State Department to create a path to reunite separated Afghan families.",
      "\"There's all these moms or dads or young children who are stuck here without their family,\" said VanDiver. \"These people are in danger because of us. And the least we can do is help them reunite.\"",
      "He says the number of children separated from their parents includes 2,800 unaccompanied refugee minors \u2014 children who made it to the U.S. but whose parents did not, or who were left behind as their parents fled.",
      "VanDiver works with the Office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts, known as CARE, a State Department program that was established to assist wartime Afghan allies immigrate to the U.S.",
      "Since 2021, the CARE program has facilitated travel for nearly 200,000 Afghans, according to documents reviewed by CBS News.",
      "This includes those with special immigrant visas who were wartime allies typically paid by the U.S. government. It also includes Afghan refugees who assisted the U.S. mission in military roles, as civil society members, or those who are family members of those who served.",
      "\"The truth is, is that every single person in the refugee pipeline and every single person in the [special immigrant visa] pipeline are somebody who took action in our name and are now in danger,\" said VanDiver.",
      "\"And these Afghans deserve everything that we can give to them because they protected us.\"",
      "After trying unsuccessfully to bring his wife and son over on his own, Satari connected with CARE in 2023 to get help facilitating their visa process. His wife, Shiba, and their son had escaped to Pakistan after she was threatened by the Taliban for continuing her work as a midwife while her husband was in the U.S.",
      "On Jan. 18, the weekend before President Trump's inauguration, Shiba and her son were flown to JFK airport in New York and then driven to Newark, New Jersey, for an emotional reunion with her husband. Tamim had not seen his son, now nearly 4 years old, since he was a newborn.",
      "The Sataris' family reunion at Newark Liberty International Airport was one of the last refugee reunions to take place.",
      "Three days later, Mr. Trump signed an executive order suspending the U.S. refugee program, stating \"the United States lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans that protects their safety and security, and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees.\"",
      "A federal judge ordered the administration to stop the ban, but since then normal refugee processing has not continued. In a recent court filing, lawyers for the administration said it would\u00a0 take time to restart refugee programs, since agencies have already cut contracts, reduced the workforce and frozen funding.",
      "In addition to Mr. Trump's executive order, Secretary of State Marco Rubio froze all federal funding for the programs that were providing travel for Afghans who had already been approved to resettle in the U.S. This means that anyone vetted and approved for travel \u2014 including those already holding special immigrant visas \u2014 cannot leave Afghanistan unless they are able to pay for the trip themselves.",
      "According to government documents reviewed by CBS, more than 40,000 Afghans who have been vetted and approved to leave Afghanistan are now in limbo, with their lives at stake.",
      "\"I've heard countless horror stories of torture and murder of these allies of the United States,\" said Republican Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, who voted for the CARE program.",
      "\"I would urge the administration to take a look at this and to honor the commitment that we made to [our allies], and not break our promise, but let them know that we are going to protect them.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump and other Republican lawmakers have expressed concern that allowing Afghans into the U.S. makes the country more vulnerable to terrorism.",
      "McCaul and others who advocate for the program say the vetting is already extremely effective.",
      "\"You want to vet them again? Go ahead. But they've already been vetted, and probably the most thorough vetting in American history,\" McCaul told CBS News.",
      "Afghans who come to the U.S are reviewed by the State Department, Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. They go through several in-person interviews and their biometrics are checked against government databases, in addition to extensive medical screening.",
      "\"Afghans who come to this country via the CARE program are the most vetted immigrant population in our country's history,\" said a former State Department official.",
      "Satari remains hopeful he will not be one of the last to be reunited with his family. He has settled in New Jersey and is employed in a mechanical job while he studies for his real estate license.",
      "\"I have a lot of hope in the future. I would like to have a great life,\" Satari said. \"I am responsible for taking care of my son, to enroll in school and start lessons over there. I have a big hope.\"",

      "Trump spoke to reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday previewing his Justice Department speech. He nodded to problems faced in cities, such as subway violence. \"We don't want to have crime in the streets. We don't want to have people pushed into subways and killed,\" Trump said. \"We want to have safety in our cities, as well as in our communities, and we'll be talking about immigration. We'll be talking about a lot of things. The complete gamut.\"",

      "\"They keep open lines of communication. Whereas, before, the only time I ever heard from Merrick Garland was if he was trying to sue Virginia for some reason,\" Miyares told Fox News Digital.",
      "Miyares said he viewed the fentanyl epidemic as both a national security and domestic challenge, citing how an average of 105,000 Americans were dying every 12 months of addiction deaths at the peak of the crisis. By contrast, over 50,000 Americans died in the Vietnam War over the course of 15 years. \"It was two Vietnam wars happening every 12 months in this country to absolutely devastating impact.

As for the Biden administration, Miyares said he \"never felt that they took it as seriously.\" He said one federal agent told him the Biden administration discouraged posting about drug busts online, describing the attitude at the top of the bureaucracy as signaling,[ \"We don't want to admit we have a drug problem in this country.\"",
      "\"It was almost like an ostrich with its head in the sand. The other problem was the border. More fentanyl was crossing our southern border in one year to kill every man, woman and child in America three or four times over. It was staggering,\" Miyares said. \"The reality is the Sinaloa Cartel is the single most dangerous criminal enterprise, I would argue, in the history of the world, they have a reach that is staggering.\"",
      "\"It was President Trump who has declared the cartels a foreign terrorist organization. The Biden administration could have done so,\" Miyares said. \"These were criminal enterprises that, in my opinion, were conducting chemical warfare on everyday Americans to levels that we don't see even lost in war or happening to our kids, our friends and our neighbors. They are terrorist organizations.\"",
      "With Democrats having lost control of both houses of Congress, Democratic attorneys general have led their party's charge against the Trump administration's agenda on a number of issues, including immigration.

      "\"As I go into this meeting tomorrow, I view this through a positive lens. This is an opportunity for us,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"This epidemic not only is killing people. It's destroying our economy, and it's tearing families apart. And that's one of the absolute worst parts of this.

      "\"I'm here, and I'm not going away, and my resources are going to be here, and they're not going away because the citizens in Philadelphia have every right to demand that I work hard for them, just like anyone else,\" Sunday said. \"When you have, you know, one party like the Democrat control over a city like this, without the influence, you know, of, I'll say, a Republican prosecutor, that creates a situation like we've dealt with.\"",

      "Chrome extensions are incredibly useful, whether you want to block ads, track the best deals or\u00a0enhance your browsing experience. They can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store, which functions like the Play Store but for extensions. However, extensions are easier to mimic and turn into malicious software compared to apps.",
      "As we just reported, over 3.2 million users were victimized by a security breach tied to\u00a016 malicious browser extensions, highlighting how attackers exploit tools that seem legitimate to spread malware or steal sensitive data.",
      "Now, security researchers have discovered a polymorphic attack that allows malicious Chrome extensions to transform into other browser extensions, including password managers, crypto wallets and banking apps, to steal sensitive information.",

      "Chrome browser on smartphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the malicious polymorphic attack works",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0SquareX Labs have found a new attack that lets malicious Chrome extensions disguise themselves as legitimate ones, like password managers, crypto wallets and banking apps, to steal sensitive information. This \"polymorphic\" attack takes advantage of Chrome\u2019s extension system to trick users while staying under the radar.",
      "The attack starts with hackers uploading what looks like a harmless extension to the Chrome Web Store. It might even have real features, like an AI-powered marketing tool, to convince users to install and pin it to their browser.",
      "Once installed, the malicious extension scans the victim\u2019s browser for other extensions. It can do this in two ways. If it has permission to use the \"chrome.management\" API, it grabs a list of installed extensions directly. If not, it injects code into web pages to check for unique files or resources tied to certain extensions.",
      "If it finds a targeted extension, like 1Password, the malicious extension reports back to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker then tells it to impersonate the real extension by disabling it if permissions allow, changing its name and icon and displaying a fake login popup that looks just like the real thing.",
      "Fake extension page (SquareX)",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Social engineering makes things worse",
      "To steal user credentials, the malicious extension triggers a fake \"Session Expired\" prompt when the victim tries to log in to a website. This tricks them into thinking they need to reenter their credentials for their password manager or banking app. When they do, the stolen data is sent straight to the attackers.",
      "After collecting the credentials, the extension switches back to its original form. It restores the legitimate extension, making everything look normal so the victim doesn\u2019t suspect anything. This shows just how dangerous malicious Chrome extensions can be and why stronger security measures are needed to protect users.",
      "We reached out to Google, and a spokesperson told CyberGuy,\u00a0\"We appreciate the work of the research community and we've received the report. We are constantly investing in ways to improve the security of the Chrome Web Store, and we take appropriate action when we learn of emerging threats.\"",

      "Here are five ways to safeguard your sensitive information and maintain your online privacy.",
      "1.\u00a0Keep your browser and extensions up to date: Outdated software is a goldmine for cybercriminals. Bugs or security gaps in old versions of your browser or extensions can be exploited to inject malicious code, steal data or take control of your system. Updates patch these vulnerabilities, making them a critical line of defense. Turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2. Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons have rules and scans to catch bad actors, but they\u2019re not perfect. Extensions from random websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware. Stick to the official store for your browser; don\u2019t download extensions from sketchy links.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the extension and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a password manager. This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5.\u00a0Invest in personal data removal services: If your personal data gets stolen by the extension, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Security researchers pointed out that the Chrome Web Store lacks protections against these types of attacks, such as blocking sudden changes to an extension\u2019s icon or HTML, or at least alerting users when such changes occur. The problem isn\u2019t limited to the Chrome Web Store. The Play Store also hosts malicious apps from time to time, affecting millions of users.

      "1. Have strong antivirus software: Install and regularly update strong antivirus software on all your devices. Antivirus software can help detect and prevent infostealer malware infections. Be sure to perform regular scans to identify and remove potential threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware potentially accessing your private information is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Use virtual cards for online payments: Instead of using your actual bank card, generate virtual cards through your bank or a service like Privacy.com. These temporary cards limit exposure in case of a data breach.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Enable transaction alerts and spending limits:\u00a0Set up real-time alerts for transactions and daily spending limits on your cards. This way, you\u2019ll be notified immediately of any unauthorized activity.",
      "4. Never store card details in browsers:\u00a0Infostealers target autofill data in Chrome, Edge and Firefox. Always deny the pop-up that asks to \"save payment info\" and use a secure password manager instead. You may also want to take advantage of additional digital security measures such as\u00a0two-factor authentication. Newer types of authentication, such as Face ID and Touch ID, are slowly replacing passwords as a legitimate means to grant a person access to sensitive financial information.",
      "5. Be smart about passwords: Simply employing all the password rules won\u2019t prevent a breach, but since you don\u2019t know exactly what information thieves are looking for, it can\u2019t hurt. You should use strong passwords and change them frequently. I recommend using a password manager to generate and store strong passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal services: While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "OUTSMART HACKERS WHO ARE OUT TO STEAL YOUR IDENTITY",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Infostealers are a major threat to everyone online, and they are also quite common. However, since this malware often disguises itself as legitimate apps or uses social engineering tricks, it\u2019s easy to get fooled. Even the most cautious individuals can fall victim to a well-executed campaign. The best way to stay safe is to exercise caution when browsing online, downloading apps or making online transactions. Using tools like a password manager and antivirus software can also help enhance security and make your life easier.",

      "SpyLoan apps are everywhere and\u00a0yet people keep falling for them. They promise easy loans with flexible repayment, but what they actually do is steal your personal data, including contacts, sensitive images and files. The moment you take a loan, they start blackmailing you using your own data against you.",
      "Some of these apps do not even bother giving loans. They just grab your data and start the harassment. One such app has been making the rounds on the Play Store, racking up more than 100,000 downloads and putting thousands of Android users at risk of blackmail and extortion.",

      "SpyLend spread by posing as a credible financial management tool, \"Finance Simplified,\" on the Google Play Store, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer. It attracted financially vulnerable individuals by offering fast loans with minimal documentation.",
      "The app surged from 50,000 to 100,000 downloads in a single week despite red flags in user reviews about harassment and blackmail.",
      "Once downloaded, the app requested excessive permissions far beyond what a typical financial app would need, including access to contacts, SMS messages, call logs, photos and location data. This allowed the malware to silently collect personal information from users' devices.",
      "The stolen data fueled a vicious cycle of scams and extortion. SpyLoan apps like SpyLend lure users with attractive loan terms, only to exploit their data for predatory lending practices. If users fail to meet repayment demands, the operators weaponize their information by harassing them, blackmailing them with threats of leaking private photos or contacting their friends and family, and creating a climate of fear and coercion.",
      "In some cases, the extortion escalated to public shaming or even deepfake creation using stolen images, amplifying the psychological and financial toll on victims.",
      "We reached out about this incident, and a Google spokesperson told us, \"The app has been removed from Google Play. Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by\u00a0Google Play Protect, which is on by default on Android devices with Google Play Services. Google Play Protect can warn users or block apps known to exhibit malicious behavior, even when those apps come from sources outside of Play.\"",

      "It also collects device details like the model and OS version, tracks location in real time every three seconds, records past locations and IP addresses, and it even saves the last 20 copied texts from the clipboard. On top of that, it gathers financial data like loan histories and banking SMS messages.",

      "3) Download apps from reliable sources: It\u2019s important to download apps only from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. You might say I am contradicting myself, but Play Store is still safer than other options out there. They have strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software. However, even with the security measures provided by Google Play, downloading apps from the store does not guarantee 100% protection against malware or harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they can pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Never trust download links that you get through SMS.",
      "4) Review app permissions carefully: If an app asks for unnecessary permissions, like access to your contacts, call logs or storage, do not install it. A legitimate loan app should only require essential permissions related to financial transactions.",
      "5) Check reviews and red flags: Before installing any financial app, read user reviews carefully. If multiple people report harassment, blackmail or excessive permissions, avoid the app entirely.",
      "6) Report and uninstall suspicious apps: If you encounter a SpyLoan app, immediately\u00a0uninstall it and revoke its permissions. Report it to the Google Play Store, cybersecurity authorities and financial regulators to help prevent further victims.",

As a general rule, it is best to avoid borrowing money through online apps unless they are from well-known financial institutions. Google also needs to take responsibility for allowing SpyLoan apps on the Play Store, even when user reviews clearly indicate they are malicious.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says Clone Robotics\u2019 Protoclone mimics humans with 1,000 muscles \u2013 too human for comfort.",
      "Clone Robotics, a Polish-American company, has recently unveiled its groundbreaking humanoid robot, Protoclone, sparking both fascination and unease across the internet. This eerily lifelike android represents a significant advancement in biomimetic robotics, closely replicating human anatomy and movement in ways never before seen.",
      "With its unsettlingly realistic movements, Protoclone is pushing the boundaries of what we expect from robots, raising both intrigue and questions about the future of robotics.",

      "Protoclone (Clone Robotics) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The anatomy of this robot",
      "Protoclone stands at an impressive 6 feet tall and boasts a skeleton made of 206 polymer bones, mirroring the human skeletal structure. What truly sets this robot apart is its muscular system, featuring over 1,000 artificial muscles powered by\u00a0Clone Robotics' proprietary \"Myofiber\" technology.",

      "HUMANOID ROBOTS BUST DANCE MOVES ALONGSIDE HUMANS",
      "The muscle behind the machine",
      "The Myofiber system is a revolutionary approach to robotic movement. Each artificial muscle consists of a mesh tube containing an air-filled balloon. When hydraulic fluid is pumped into the balloon, it expands, causing the mesh to contract, much like a human muscle. This system is powered by a 500-watt electric pump, Protoclone's mechanical \"heart,\" capable of circulating fluid at a rate of 40 liters per minute.",

      "CHINA LAUNCHES FACILITY TO TRAIN 100 PLUS HUMANOID ROBOTS SIMULTANEOUSLY",
      "Sensory sophistication",
      "Protoclone's nervous system is equally impressive, featuring four depth cameras in the skull for vision, 70 inertial sensors for joint position awareness and 320 pressure sensors for force feedback. This advanced sensory network allows the robot to process visual input and learn by observing human activities.",

      "The recent video release of Protoclone in action has garnered millions of views and sparked intense online debate. In the footage, the faceless android is seen suspended from the ceiling, its limbs twitching and moving in an unsettlingly human-like manner.",
      "While some viewers have expressed awe at the technological achievement, others have reacted with discomfort or even hostility. Comments range from comparisons to \"sleep paralysis demons\" to references to dystopian science fiction scenarios.",

      "Protoclone (Clone Robotics) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

Clone Robotics plans to launch production with 279 units, named \"Clone Alpha,\" with pre-orders opening in late 2025.",

      "While Protoclone's current iteration may be more unsettling than practical, it's clear that we're on the cusp of a new era in robotics. As these technologies continue to advance, we'll likely see more refined and capable humanoid robots entering our homes and workplaces.

      "Urgency as a weapon: Scammers exploit our fear of financial loss to prompt hasty actions. They use phrases like, in this case, \"Act now\" or \"Cancel Now\" and warn of dire consequences if immediate action isn't taken. This urgency is designed to bypass rational thinking and prevent you from verifying the legitimacy of the request.",
      "Suspicious links: Legitimate banks avoid sending security-sensitive links via text. These links could download viruses to your device or lead you to a fake website designed to steal your personal information. Always verify the URL before entering any sensitive data.",
      "Specific yet unfamiliar details: The mention of \"Bryana White\" and the precise amount of $950.44 is a clever tactic. Scammers often use specific details to create an illusion of legitimacy, even when these details are unfamiliar to the recipient. This approach aims to instill doubt and urgency, increasing the chances that the victim will act hastily.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Brand impersonation: Scammers often employ brand impersonation tactics, using similar logos, fonts and color schemes to create a facade of legitimacy. This deceptive strategy is designed to manipulate you into believing you are interacting with a trusted institution, thereby increasing the likelihood of falling for their scam.",
      "Unsolicited contact: Be wary of unexpected texts claiming to be from your bank, especially if you haven't signed up for text alerts.",
      "Spelling and grammatical errors: Look for mistakes in spelling, grammar or punctuation. Legitimate messages from banks are usually written by professionals and are free of errors.",
      "Requests for personal information: Scammers often ask you to \"confirm\" details like your account number or password. Legitimate banks never request sensitive information via text.",
      "Too good to be true offers: Be skeptical of messages promising large returns or unexpected windfalls.",

      "2. Have strong antivirus software: This can help detect and block malicious software that might be downloaded if Jane had clicked on the scammer's link. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Contact your bank directly using official channels: Jane should call Kinecta's official number to verify if there's any real issue with her account, rather than responding to the text.",
      "4. Report the text to your bank and forward it to 7726 (SPAM): By reporting this text, Jane can help Kinecta and her mobile carrier protect other customers from similar scams.",
      "5. Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) on your accounts: This extra layer of security could prevent scammers from accessing Jane's account even if they obtained her password.",
      "6. Use SMS filtering tools provided by your mobile carrier: These tools might have caught and flagged the suspicious \"Kinect\" text before it reached Jane's inbox.",
      "7. Invest in personal data removal services: This can help reduce the amount of personal information available online, making it harder for scammers to target Jane and you with personalized attacks in the future. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Remember, legitimate financial institutions will never pressure you to act immediately or click on links in text messages. When in doubt, always reach out to your bank directly using official channels. Thank you, Jane, for bringing this to our attention.

The attack stemmed from a supply chain breach, where threat actors infiltrated legitimate extensions and pushed malicious updates. These updates embedded hidden scripts that allowed unauthorized data collection, altered HTTP requests and injected ads into web pages, all without users noticing.",

They also communicated with command-and-control servers to receive further instructions, showing a high level of coordination. The attackers exploited the trust users place in the Chrome Web Store and its automatic update system. Investigations suggest this activity has been ongoing since at least July 2024.",

      "The United Nations\u2019 International Organization for Migration, for example, previously funded care for victims of trafficking in scam compounds in one shelter in Cambodia, but was forced to halt that work by the Trump Administration\u2019s funding freeze announced in January, according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation. The halt to funding has also impacted a network of civil society groups that worked to stop human trafficking and rescue survivors in Thailand.",
      "\"It\u2019s really heartbreaking to see that there\u2019s such an immense amount of people that are in need of assistance,\" said Saskia Kok, Head of Protection Unit in Thailand for the IOM.",
      "In a statement, U.S. officials acknowledged the high pressure impasse.",
      "\"The United States remains deeply concerned about online scam operations throughout Southeast Asia, which affect thousands of Americans and individuals from many other countries,\" said a State Department spokesperson in a statement sent to the AP.",
      "A bigger problem",
      "While advocates estimate some 50 million people are living in modern slavery, mass rescues of enslaved workers are rare. In 2015, more than 2,000 fishermen were rescued from brutal conditions at sea, liberated after an Associated Press investigation exposed their plight. That same year hundreds of Indians were rescued from brick factories in India. And last year Brazilian prosecutors rescued 163 Chinese nationals working in \"slavery-like\" conditions at an electric vehicle factory construction site in northeastern Brazil.",
      "\"What we are seeing at the Thai-Myanmar border now is the result of years of inaction on a trafficking crisis that has had a devastating impact on thousands of people, many of whom were simply seeking better economic prospect, but were lured to these compounds on false pretenses,\" said Amnesty International Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman.",
      "Being forced to commit a crime under threat of violence should not be criminalized, said Freeman. \"However, in general we are aware of countries in the region repatriating their nationals from scam compounds only to then charge them with crimes.\"",
      "Business as usual",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much of an effect these releases will have on the criminal groups that run the scam centers.",
      "February marked the third time the Thais have cut internet or electricity to towns across the river. Each time, the compounds have managed to work around the cuts. Large compounds have access to diesel-powered generators, as well as access to internet provider Starlink, experts working with law enforcement say.",
      "\"The resources is the one thing that they are not lacking and they\u2019ve been able to bring them to bear in the past,\" said Benedikt Hoffman, acting representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in the region.",
      "The armed groups that staged the crackdown have also been accused of helping to run scam compounds in Myawaddy. The head of the Kayin Border Guard Force, General Saw Chit Thu, has been sanctioned by the European Union and the United Kingdom for profiting from scam compounds and human trafficking, respectively. Compounds in the DKBA\u2019s control are less well-documented in the public record, but activists say they also control a fair number.",
      "\"There is clearly a lot of pressure on the Border Guard Force to take action and helping people to leave is one of the most visible ways to do so,\" Hoffman said. \"That said, it likely also reflects an adjustment to the business model, reducing the number of people involved \u2014 and with less attention, continuing lower key operations.\"",
      "It will take simultaneous pressure exerted in multiple areas to truly shut down the compounds, said Hoffman.",
      "In this crackdown, there have been no major prosecutions or compounds shut down.",

    "summary": "Jennifer Gilkerson never imagined that her West Virginia farm\u2019s freeze-dried fruits would get caught up in political fights in Washington, D.C.",
    "story": [
      "Jennifer Gilkerson never imagined that her West Virginia farm\u2019s freeze-dried fruits would get caught up in political fights in Washington, D.C.",
      "But last Friday, she learned that funding for a U.S. Agriculture Department program that helps schools and food banks buy products from local farmers like her had been cut. Without those federal dollars, Gilkerson no longer expects local schools to be able to buy her freeze-dried fruits, which she has already spent thousands of dollars preparing to produce.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just in such a state of shock. We just don\u2019t really even know how to respond to all this. We thought that this was sacred and really untouchable,\u201d Gilkerson said. \u201cEveryone thinks all farmers voted for this, but we did not vote for this.\u201d",
      "From funding cuts to tariffs, farmers have found themselves caught in the middle of President Donald Trump\u2019s escalation of trade wars and efforts to slash billions of dollars in spending, leaving a growing number now struggling to find markets for their products and facing the risk of steep losses for the year ahead.",
      "Trump has acknowledged the impact his trade policies will have on farmers, telling them in his address to Congress this month that there will be \u201ca little bit of an adjustment period\u201d and that farmers will have to \u201cbear with me again.\u201d When it comes to spending cuts at the Agriculture Department and other agencies, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a CNBC interview this week, the current federal spending levels are unsustainable and there will have to be a \u201cdetox period\u201d for the economy as cuts are made.",
      "But farmers across the country \u2014 from small organic berry growers in Maine to large-scale hog producers in Iowa \u2014 say those policy changes could cripple their businesses if they aren\u2019t resolved soon, wreaking long-lasting damage on the U.S. agriculture industry.",
      "\u201cI think any farmer will tell you that we will take some short-term pain, but do not make this a long-term extended trade war, because that just won\u2019t be good for agriculture or for the country in general,\u201d said Bob Hemesath, an Iowa farmer who grows corn and raises hogs. \u201cI know that this is the way President Trump believes he\u2019s going to create better markets long term. I hope he\u2019s correct. But my fear is that once you lose those markets to other suppliers, it\u2019s very hard to get them back.\u201d",
      "U.S. farmers depend on exporting their products because for many products, like corn, the country produces more than it is able to consume. Foreign buyers are also more willing to buy agricultural products people in the United States don\u2019t want, like chicken feet or cow tongues.",
      "But those overseas markets are now in question as Trump threatens to ratchet up the amount of tariffs charged on products being shipped into the United States \u2014 a move that is already causing other countries to retaliate with their own tariffs on U.S. goods.",
      "\"I've been at this for 45 years, and for all of those years, any time there is a trade dispute with another country, they recognize that our soft underbelly, where we really get sensitive, is when you start messing with our food exports,\" said Chuck\u00a0Conner, head of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives. \"That has always been the case, and that is the case this time around on steroids.\"",
      "Farmers say they are already seeing the effects after Trump put an additional 20% tariff on Chinese imports, after which China responded with an additional 10% to 15% tariff on U.S. agriculture products, including pork, wheat and corn.",
      "After Trump briefly placed a 25% tariff on all imports from Canada last month, cattle farmers in Maine got notices that their grain prices would be increasing 15%, said Sarah Alexander, executive director of the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association. Trump later walked back some of the tariffs, but he also warned that more are to come. A farmer also told Alexander that his price quote for a greenhouse shot up this week after Trump put a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports.",
      "\u201cConsumers are going to see these impacts if farms are not able to carry through with their plans or their costs increase dramatically, whether it\u2019s in what products are actually available this year or that the cost is going to have to go up because farmers can\u2019t shoulder all of those changes themselves,\u201d Alexander said.",
      "Tariffs hit amid issues with federal aid",
      "Federal funding cuts and freezes, along with staffing shortages at the Agriculture Department, have also been rippling across the U.S. agriculture industry. Farmers say they rely on grants and loans from the Agriculture Department to help make their products more affordable for U.S. consumers and weather the natural volatility in the market for agriculture commodities.",
      "As Gilkerson tries to figure out a new market for her farm\u2019s freeze-dried fruits, another group of West Virginia farmers has also been caught up in funding cuts to a separate Agriculture Department program to help promote local foods.",
      "A group of farmers had been working to launch a brand of West Virginia-grown products called Appalachian Cellar. After months of work, they were preparing to begin distributing the brand to grocery stores and other food distributors when the Agriculture Department told them their funding had been cut off as of Jan. 19, the day before Trump entered office.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got 31 farmers who are pissed off,\u201d said Spencer Moss, executive director of the West Virginia Food and Farm Coalition, who was working on launching the line of products. \u201cWe are rounding the corner into the planting season, and we are supposed to be ramping up, but we are not. We are unable to ramp up.\u201d",
      "Not only will the group not be getting funding going forward for expenses it had coming up, but it\u2019s unclear whether it will get reimbursed, as planned, for $100,000 in expenses related to the grant it had already paid for, Moss said.",
      "\u201cThis is the economy of rural America. West Virginia is a wholly rural state, and so developing this agriculture economy in the state is extremely important,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cThese farmers pay their property taxes, they\u2019re business owners, a lot of times they\u2019re commissioners or school board members. These are the drivers that keep rural communities alive. So it feels like a divestment in rural communities across the board.\u201d",
      "Seth Kroeck, a blueberry farmer in Maine, said he received a $50,000 grant to spread 200,000 cubic yards of mulch on his wild blueberries to help improve his crop yields. He has the truck, the fuel and the manpower lined up to spread the mulch and has to get started in the coming weeks as the planting season gets underway.",
      "But he\u2019s unsure whether he will actually get reimbursed by the Agriculture Department, because he knows of several other farmers still waiting to get paid for equipment they purchased under Agriculture Department grants.",
      "\u201cIt has really sent a chill among a lot of farmers,\u201d Kroeck said. \u201cYou sign a contract with the USDA, you expect that they\u2019re going to pay on it. You would never expect that they\u2019re not going to fulfill their end of the deal. It makes me worry in a broader sense about where we\u2019re heading. So much of what we do with each other is based on that basic trust, and to have that be shattered is very, very worrisome.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s uncertainty as farmers are trying to make decisions at the start of the planting season in many parts of the country.",
      "In Virginia, John Boyd is unsure whether his loan from the Agriculture Department will come through in time for him to buy the seeds he needs to begin planting his soybean crops for this year. Boyd typically gets an Agriculture Department loan in the spring to help cover some of the cost of planting until he can harvest the crops in the fall and use the proceeds to repay the loan.",
      "But so far, the loan money hasn\u2019t come through, and he has been unable to get any update from the Agriculture Department about whether or when it will be available. With just days until he needs to start putting his seeds in the ground, Boyd said, he\u2019s urgently trying to negotiate a payment plan with his seed supplier or find another way to finance the expense.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s planting season, and there\u2019s a cloud of uncertainty among the agriculture industry with this president,\u201d said Boyd, who is president of the National Black Farmers Association.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve got real debt; I\u2019ve got real expenses. But I also have the will to farm in some sort of way. I can\u2019t tell you how, but I am making calls and trying to put some things in place to get through this crisis the president has put us in.\u201d",
      "Soybean prices, which have already been falling amid a glut of supply in the market as production has ramped up globally, have been tumbling in recent years, and he worries they will fall further in a trade war with China.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s alarming here to me as a leader in the farm community and civil rights work is that it\u2019s the farmer that is the first getting affected, and it was the farmer that delivered for this president,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cThey were all in for Trump, and they are the first in line to be affected.\u201d",
      "Prices for soybeans, like other agricultural products, including corn, wheat and pork, are set not by the individual farmers but by a wider commodities market, which factors in the global supply and demand. If demand for U.S. agriculture products from a major buyer, like China, goes down as a result of tariffs, so can the price.",
      "\u201cIn order to get a fair price, you need a good, steady market, and the president is disrupting the market,\u201d Boyd said.",
      "Farmers have been through Trump\u2019s trade wars before in 2018 and 2019, when he imposed tariffs on China, which retaliated with its own tariffs on U.S. farm products, sending sales tumbling. In response, Trump set up a payment program during his first term to compensate some of the affected farmers. The amount of payments doled out was about equivalent to the revenue the United States collected from the tariffs on Chinese imports.",
      "Trump hasn\u2019t said whether he will implement a similar payment plan again. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Trump\u2019s moves are intended to improve the longer-term picture for farmers by ultimately creating a more level playing field overseas.",
      "\u201cHe understands that the best way to get our farmers, our ranchers and our fishermen's produce and products in the rest of the world \u2014 which they block, India blocks our farmers, all these countries block our farmers \u2014 the way to grow it is to make deals with them where they have to understand the power of the U.S. economy,\u201d Lutnick said in a Bloomberg TV interview Thursday.",
      "In the meantime, farmers are trying to figure out how to pay for their current bills and how to cut costs to lessen their losses.",
      "In Iowa, Hemesath, who is on the board of the National Corn Growers Association and president of Farmers for Free Trade, said he\u2019s bracing for the possibility of losing money on his crops this year if there is no change in policy in the coming months.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re used to the ups and downs in the markets. There\u2019s no doubt about that, but we need to be looking for more markets and building on the markets that we already have,\u201d he said. \u201cSo long term, we definitely have to get this resolved to stay viable.\u201d"

      "U.S. District Judge James Bredar in Maryland issued a temporary restraining order against dozens of agencies, departments and their leaderships across the federal government that had terminated workers as part of reduction-in-workforce efforts.",
      "\u201cIn this case, the government conducted massive layoffs, but it gave no advance notice. It claims it wasn\u2019t required to because, it says, it dismissed each one of these thousands of probationary employees for 'performance' or other individualized reasons,\" Bredar wrote in his ruling.",
      "\"On the record before the Court, this isn\u2019t true. There were no individualized assessments of employees. They were all just fired. Collectively,\u201d he added.",
      "Hours earlier, a federal judge in California directed that the departments of Veterans Affairs, Defense, Energy, Interior, Agriculture and Treasury offer reinstatement to the thousands of probationary employees the Trump administration terminated last month. The Justice Department filed a notice of appeal in that case.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "The order from Bredar applies to 12 departments that have fired probationary workers: the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, Transportation, Treasury and Veterans Affairs.",
      "It also applies to probationary workers who were terminated recently at the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the General Service Administration and the Small Business Administration.",
      "They were given a deadline of before March 17 at 1 p.m. ET to reinstate the affected employees.",
      "Bredar acknowledged the impact of his order amid the government's dismissal of about 200,000 probationary employees \u2014 workers who are either recent hires or had taken new positions \u2014 since President Donald Trump took office in January.",
      "\u201cThe Court is not blind to the practical reality that the relief being ordered today will have far-reaching impacts on the federal workforce and will require the Government to expend considerable resources in an effort to undo the [reductions in force] that have been put into place,\u201d Bredar wrote.",
      "\u201cWhen, as is likely the case here, the Government has engaged in an illegal scheme spanning broad swaths of the federal workforce, it is inevitable that the remediation of that scheme will itself be a significant task,\u201d he added.",
      "A group of states with Democratic attorneys general had brought the lawsuit seeking a temporary restraining order\u00a0that would allow the terminated employees to have their jobs restored, arguing that the\u00a0Trump administration ignored protocol for the mass terminations of federal employees.",
      "The Defense Department, the Office of Personnel Management and the National Archives were excluded from the judge's order due to the provision of \"insufficient evidence\" that a reduction in force had occurred, Bredar wrote.",
      "California Attorney General Rob Bonta lauded the ruling in a post on X.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re pleased with the court\u2019s decision to restrain\u00a0the Trump Admin\u2019s reckless directive and we\u2019ll continue to monitor and ensure compliance,\" he wrote.",

      "There was one final option, however: He could join an unusual clinical trial at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston that had just started recruiting patients. Highly experimental \u2014 and with no guarantee of success \u2014 the trial involved getting a so-called fecal transplant from a patient with advanced cancer who had been completely cured by immunotherapy. The idea was that the unique populations of gut bacteria found within the stool might help kick-start the immune system to better recognize and fight the cancer.",

      "There were \u201ccertainly reasons to be cautiously optimistic\u201d about the prospect of peace in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Friday, after President Donald Trump\u2019s envoy Steve Witkoff met Putin in Moscow.",
      "Peskov's comments echoed those of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said Thursday that he in theory accepted the ceasefire proposed by the United States and Ukraine \u2014 but only on terms tantamount to a victory over Ukraine.",
      "It was an emphatic \"yes, but.\"",
      "\u201cWe agree with the proposals to stop the hostilities,\u201d Putin said in a speech Thursday. But only if it leads \u201cto long-term peace and eliminate the root causes of this crisis.\u201d",
      "That term \u2014 \u201croot causes\u201d \u2014 is a reference to long-held Russian grievances about what it sees as NATO\u2019s eastward expansion. Western officials and analysts reject this, saying Putin wants to subjugate Ukraine, drawing it into Russia\u2019s sphere of influence and away from its European tilt.",
      "Trump himself called Putin's remark \u201ca promising statement,\u201d but many officials and experts across Ukraine and Europe are far less impressed. But, despite flirting with the Trump administration there is little evidence Putin has shifted from his core war goals: cementing his landgrabs in Ukraine and stopping it ever joining NATO.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called Putin\u2019s words \u201cmanipulative\u201d during his nightly address Thursday. \"Putin often does this \u2014 he does not say \u2018no\u2019 directly, but he does it in such a way that practically everything only delays it and makes normal decisions impossible.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cPutin, of course, is afraid to tell President Trump directly that he wants to continue this war, that he wants to kill Ukrainians.\u201d",
      "Other observers believe Putin is in a tight spot and that his evasive response was an attempt to balance two competing realities.",
      "First, the Kremlin has no reason to accept a truce unless it delivers him a favorable outcome; and second, he wants to achieve a settlement with the White House while it is led by a president amenable to Moscow, said Jonathan Eyal, a director at the Royal United Services Institute think tank in London.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not in Putin\u2019s interest to get a ceasefire now,\" Eyal said Friday.  \"However, he cannot afford to annoy the American president, and expose and humiliate him with an outright rejection.\u201d",
      "The deal on offer to Putin is not going to improve, Eyal said, adding that Putin has \u201cgot an amazing opportunity to return to the global stage and [escape] from his isolation \u2014 with the help of the United States,\u201d he added. So \u201che\u2019s got to try to grab this deal without making too many concessions on Ukraine, and that\u2019s his dilemma.\u201d",
      "Officials in Kyiv will be hoping to use Putin\u2019s \u201cevasive\u201d response to \u201chelp convince their American colleagues that the Kremlin dictator is not genuinely interested in ending the war,\u201d wrote Mykola Bielieskov, a research fellow at the National Institute for Strategic Studies, a Ukrainian think tank.",
      "While Putin may entertain a truce with terms favorable to Moscow, he will not accept an independent Ukrainian state on Russia\u2019s border, Bielieskov wrote for the Atlantic Council.",
      "\u201cThis does not mean that current U.S.-led peace efforts are entirely futile, but it is vital to recognize that freezing the conflict along the current front lines will not be enough to end the war.\u201d"

      "\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re snatched out of your reality, and you\u2019re plunked down without any warning\u00a0into a completely different world, a world that\u2019s not particularly friendly to you,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cAfter doing what I\u2019ve done in the criminal justice system for 40 years, finding myself in that chair was bewildering and hard to fathom.\u201d",
      "In response to critics who may still think the killing was intentional, Ferguson insisted, and reiterated over and over, that it was an accident.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not getting away with anything because I lost her, and she lost her life,\u201d he said while sobbing.",
      "The interview with NBCLA followed a mistrial that was declared Monday in the 74-year-old Ferguson\u2019s murder trial. He faced a murder charge in the Aug. 3, 2023 shooting death his 65-year-old wife Sheryl in the couple\u2019s Anaheim Hills home.",
      "The jury, which could have convicted Ferguson of second-degree murder or involuntary manslaughter, split 11-1 in favor of a guilty verdict on a second-degree murder charge soon after resuming deliberations Monday morning. Deliberations began Feb. 26.",
      "As deliberations stretched into the new week, the jury signaled they were at an impasse, but continued efforts to reach a decision. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Eleanor Hunter as jurors Thursday afternoon how many votes they had taken and the forewoman said several.",
      "Hunter asked them to go back to deliberations and discuss.",
      "Jurors left early on Friday, telling the judge overseeing the case they were \u201cexhausted.\u201d",
      "\u201cJustice rests in the hands of 12 strangers who were taken from their everyday lives and given the immense responsibility to weigh the evidence and determine guilt or innocence,\u201d said Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer. \u201cAlthough we are disappointed with the outcome, we will be reviewing the questions presented by the jury along with the facts as well as meeting with the victim\u2019s family in order to make a decision in the coming weeks regarding this case. The District Attorney has always been available to meet with the victim\u2019s family should that be something they request.\u201d",
      "A hearing to set a new trial date is scheduled for Thursday.",
      "\u201cA hung jury is not a failure,\u201d defense attorney Cameron Talley said outside the courtroom. \u201cA hung jury is part of the process. It\u2019s also a success in its own way.",
      "\u201cThe surprise was that the jury was out this long. I\u2019ve never had a jury out for two weekends. But I think it\u2019s a testament to how hard this jury worked.\u201d",
      "During closing arguments, attorneys for the prosecution tried to convince jurors that Ferguson was upset following a dispute with his wife at a restaurant. When they two were back home, Ferguson took out his gun and killed his wife in a tragic chain of events that warrant a murder conviction, prosecutors said.",
      "\u201cYou have been presented with evidence -- credible evidence -- he took out the gun, he was angry,\u201d Senior Deputy District Attorney Seton Hunt told jurors Wednesday. \u201cHe took the gun out, pointed at her and killed her.\u201d",
      "Defense attorneys argued the shooting was accidental.",
      "\u201cNo, absolutely not. It was an accident,\u201d Ferguson said when asked by Talley whether he meant to shoot his wife.",
      "The Fergusons and their son Phillip went to El Cholo Mexican restaurant earlier that day, but Sheryl Ferguson left after her husband made a hand gesture mimicking a gun during an argument, according to testimony. Later at their home, Phillip Ferguson said he heard his mother say something to the effect of, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you point a real gun at me?\u201d",
      "Calling it the most reliable account of the shooting, Hunt played video of the son later telling police, \u201cI turned around and he pulls out a gun and aims at her and fires.\u201d",
      "Hunt called the judge\u2019s account -- that he fumbled with the Glock pulled from an ankle holster and it accidentally discharged when he tried to place it on a cluttered coffee table -- \u201cridiculous.\u201d",
      "Phillip Ferguson said his mother\u2019s last words were, \u201cHe shot me,\u201d Hunt said.",
      "Hunt suggested Ferguson could have gone upstairs and put the gun away as he routinely did each night before going to bed.",
      "\u201cI could have done a lot of things,\u201d Ferguson said.",
      "Ferguson\u2019s blood-alcohol level was .065 percent when it was measured seven hours after the shooting, Hunt said. An expert testified it was likely about .17 percent, or nearly twice the legal limit for driving, at the time of the shooting, Hunt noted.",
      "At a news conference after the court proceeding, Spitzer said he plans to review some of Ferguson\u2019s cases. Ferguson, who has been in judge in Orange County for nine years, testified that he sometimes had a few drinks during lunch and may have been intoxicated during hearings over which he was presiding.",
      "Talley challenged the prosecution\u2019s argument by saying it stems from a misunderstanding of how guns work. Talley noted how Hunt referred to loading bullets in the gun during the trial when the weapon uses magazines. Talley also said the pathway of the bullet as the pathologist in the case testified disproves any legal theory that Ferguson\u2019s arm was crooked at a 45-degree angle.",
      "Talley noted one detective\u2019s testimony about how far the casing from the gun\u2019s projectile would go if it were fired the way the prosecution theorized. But Talley said it was found right next to the coffee table, which was consistent with his theory of an accidental shooting.",
      "Talley also argued that home surveillance video also indicated there was no muzzle flash, which was also consistent with an accidental misfire. The bullet ripped through the victim\u2019s abdomen \u201cslightly to the left\u201d and exited the upper right of her back, which would match the angle of where the defendant said the gun misfired, Talley argued.",
      "Talley said there\u2019s no evidence his client was angry, but, he said, he was attempting to make peace and end the conflict.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not mad,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere\u2019s this drunken rage coming from?\u201d"

    "story": [
      "There were \u201ccertainly reasons to be cautiously optimistic\u201d about the prospect of peace in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Friday, after President Donald Trump\u2019s envoy Steve Witkoff met Putin in Moscow.",
      "Peskov's comments echoed those of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said Thursday that he in theory accepted the ceasefire proposed by the United States and Ukraine \u2014 but only on terms tantamount to a victory over Ukraine.",
      "It was an emphatic \"yes, but.\"",
      "\u201cWe agree with the proposals to stop the hostilities,\u201d Putin said in a speech Thursday. But only if it leads \u201cto long-term peace and eliminate the root causes of this crisis.\u201d",
      "That term \u2014 \u201croot causes\u201d \u2014 is a reference to long-held Russian grievances about what it sees as NATO\u2019s eastward expansion. Western officials and analysts reject this, saying Putin wants to subjugate Ukraine, drawing it into Russia\u2019s sphere of influence and away from its European tilt.",
      "Trump himself called Putin's remark \u201ca promising statement,\u201d but many officials and experts across Ukraine and Europe are far less impressed. But, despite flirting with the Trump administration there is little evidence Putin has shifted from his core war goals: cementing his landgrabs in Ukraine and stopping it ever joining NATO.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called Putin\u2019s words \u201cmanipulative\u201d during his nightly address Thursday. \"Putin often does this \u2014 he does not say \u2018no\u2019 directly, but he does it in such a way that practically everything only delays it and makes normal decisions impossible.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cPutin, of course, is afraid to tell President Trump directly that he wants to continue this war, that he wants to kill Ukrainians.\u201d",
      "Other observers believe Putin is in a tight spot and that his evasive response was an attempt to balance two competing realities.",
      "First, the Kremlin has no reason to accept a truce unless it delivers him a favorable outcome; and second, he wants to achieve a settlement with the White House while it is led by a president amenable to Moscow, said Jonathan Eyal, a director at the Royal United Services Institute think tank in London.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not in Putin\u2019s interest to get a ceasefire now,\" Eyal said Friday.  \"However, he cannot afford to annoy the American president, and expose and humiliate him with an outright rejection.\u201d",
      "The deal on offer to Putin is not going to improve, Eyal said, adding that Putin has \u201cgot an amazing opportunity to return to the global stage and [escape] from his isolation \u2014 with the help of the United States,\u201d he added. So \u201che\u2019s got to try to grab this deal without making too many concessions on Ukraine, and that\u2019s his dilemma.\u201d",
      "Officials in Kyiv will be hoping to use Putin\u2019s \u201cevasive\u201d response to \u201chelp convince their American colleagues that the Kremlin dictator is not genuinely interested in ending the war,\u201d wrote Mykola Bielieskov, a research fellow at the National Institute for Strategic Studies, a Ukrainian think tank.",
      "While Putin may entertain a truce with terms favorable to Moscow, he will not accept an independent Ukrainian state on Russia\u2019s border, Bielieskov wrote for the Atlantic Council.",
      "\u201cThis does not mean that current U.S.-led peace efforts are entirely futile, but it is vital to recognize that freezing the conflict along the current front lines will not be enough to end the war.\u201d"

      "The nation\u2019s interim rulers have struggled to exert their authority across much of Syria since the Islamist former insurgent group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, led a lightning insurgency that overthrew longtime President Bashar al-Assad in December.",
      "Former HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa is now the country\u2019s interim president \u2014 a decision that was announced after a meeting of the armed groups that took part in the offensive against Assad. At the same meeting, the groups agreed to repeal the country\u2019s old constitution and said a new one would be drafted.",
      "While many were happy to see an end to the Assad family\u2019s dictatorial rule of more than 50 years in the war-torn country, religious and ethnic minorities have been skeptical of the new Islamist leaders and reluctant to allow Damascus under its new authorities to assert control of their areas.",
      "Abdulhamid Al-Awak, one of the seven members of the committee al-Sharaa tasked to draft the temporary constitution, told a news conference Thursday that it would maintain some provisions from the previous one, including the stipulation that the head of state has to be a Muslim, and Islamic law is the main source of jurisprudence.",
      "But Al-Awak, a constitutional law expert who teaches at Mardin Artuklu University in Turkey, also said that the temporary constitution includes provisions that enshrine freedom of expression and the media.",
      "The constitution will \u201cbalance between social security and freedom\u201d during Syria\u2019s shaky political situation, he said, and will set up an \u201cabsolute and rigid separation\u201d between legislative, executive and judicial authorities.",
      "The text of the temporary constitution, published late Thursday, sets up a People\u2019s Committee which will serve as an interim parliament until a permanent constitution is adopted and elections held. Two-thirds of its members will be appointed by a committee selected by the interim president and one-third by al-Sharaa himself.",
      "The documents says the state is \u201ccommitted to combatting all forms of violent extremism while respecting rights and freedoms\u201d and that \u201ccitizens are equal before the law in rights and duties, without discrimination based on race, religion, gender or lineage.\u201d It stipulates that the army is a \u201cprofessional national institution\u201d and arms outside of its control are prohibited and designates \u201cglorifying the former Assad regime\u201d as a crime."

      "Still, the drugs don\u2019t always work. While clinical trials of PD-1 inhibitors in small bowel cancer have been limited, several studies have found that more than half of patients with advanced disease don\u2019t respond to them, even if their tumors are MSI-H.",

The melody is beautiful, and so I just connected with it and I listened to it over and over and over again.\"",

      "Right before they moved on to the next topic, Jenna played Wade a short video message that Sheeran had made for him. In the clip, Sheeran told Wade that it was \"lovely\" meeting him at the Met Gala and he invited \"The Cube\" host to one of his shows in the U.S.",

      "She vaguely touched on what she wanted to reveal, saying that some people in her life were worried she would be judged by what she had to share. \u201cPart of being human is being vulnerable,\u201d she said before addressing the changes in her life.",
      "\u201cYou guys, for the past three years, I have been living in my car,\u201d she shared and let out a scream. \u201cI said it! Oh my God, it\u2019s out.\u201d",
      "Robinson explained that in 2020 she was living with her parents in Las Vegas. They got along at first before she started butting heads with her mom. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand. I still don\u2019t and it hurt me,\u201d she recalled. The musician decided to leave and slept in her car for about a month before her co-manager at the time contacted her.",
      "He advised her to return to Los Angeles. He also said she could move in with him, Robinson claimed.",
      "\u201cThen when I got to his place, he actually didn\u2019t have room for me,\u201d she remembered. She said he checked her into a hotel for a night, but she ended up residing there for eight months.",
      "While searching for apartments, she told her assistant that she started researching \u201ccar life,\u201d discovering people who lived in their vans, cars and RVs.",
      "\u201cI loved what I was seeing. I just thought, \u2018Wow I can do that. I can do this,\u2019\u201d she said. Robinson added that that was three years ago, on March 9, 2022, and she has been living in her vehicle ever since.",
      "She also opened up in the video about her relationship with her family. Robinson said that she is estranged from her sister and has three people in her life: Vilma, her \u201cforever mother-in-law,\u201d her assistant and her brother.",
      "As a woman and a celebrity, Robinson said that she hadn\u2019t let many people know she was alone in her car to protect her safety. However, she said she felt \u201cfree\u201d in her current living situation.",
      "\u201cI felt like, \u2018Wow, this is so different.\u2019 I felt like I was on a camping trip,\u201d she explained. She later shared that she has a gym membership so she has a place to shower.",
      "The powerful vocalist, heard on En Vogue\u2019s hits like \u201cHold On\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Go,\u201d said she has no regrets and pointed out that many celebrities have had to sleep in their cars.",
      "\u201cThis is not like, \u2018Oh my God, poor Dawn. She\u2019s living in her car. It\u2019s terrible, Oh, woe is me,\u2019\u201d she told fans. \u201cLike I said, I\u2019m learning about who I am. I\u2019m learning myself as a person (and) as a woman.\u201d",
      "Although she would\u2019ve never thought when she was in En Vogue that one day she would be living in her car, she said she is proud of herself and enjoying documenting her \u201cadventure\u201d for fans.\u00a0She hoped that revealing this news would inspire fans and give them the courage to try anything.",
      "At the end of the video, she said, \u201cWhen I succeed again, because I will, when I\u2019m on top again or when I have a resurgence in my career again, the way that I want, getting to that point is only up to me. So from my car into that life is going to be amazing.\u201d"

      "While on the red carpet in Austin, Levi told People that McConaughey gave him priceless acting tips.",
      "\u201cI mean, he gave me a lot of advice, and he was able to mentor me in a couple different ways,\u201d said Levi. \u201cBut I\u2019d say the main thing for acting, and pardon my French, is no bulls--- in your bones and own what you\u2019re doing and make a choice regardless if that ends up being the right one or the wrong one \u2014 commit to it and know what you\u2019re saying.\u201d",

    "summary": "Despite flirting with Trump there is little evidence Putin has shifted from his core war goals: cementing his landgrabs in Ukraine and stopping it joining NATO.",
    "story": [
      "There were \u201ccertainly reasons to be cautiously optimistic\u201d about the prospect of peace in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Friday, after President Donald Trump\u2019s envoy Steve Witkoff met Putin in Moscow.",
      "Peskov's comments echoed those of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said Thursday that he in theory accepted the ceasefire proposed by the United States and Ukraine \u2014 but only on terms tantamount to a victory over Ukraine.",
      "It was an emphatic \"yes, but.\"",
      "\u201cWe agree with the proposals to stop the hostilities,\u201d Putin said in a speech Thursday. But only if it leads \u201cto long-term peace and eliminate the root causes of this crisis.\u201d",
      "That term \u2014 \u201croot causes\u201d \u2014 is a reference to long-held Russian grievances about what it sees as NATO\u2019s eastward expansion. Western officials and analysts reject this, saying Putin wants to subjugate Ukraine, drawing it into Russia\u2019s sphere of influence and away from its European tilt.",
      "Trump himself called Putin's remark \u201ca promising statement,\u201d but many officials and experts across Ukraine and Europe are far less impressed. But, despite flirting with the Trump administration there is little evidence Putin has shifted from his core war goals: cementing his landgrabs in Ukraine and stopping it ever joining NATO.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called Putin\u2019s words \u201cmanipulative\u201d during his nightly address Thursday. \"Putin often does this \u2014 he does not say \u2018no\u2019 directly, but he does it in such a way that practically everything only delays it and makes normal decisions impossible.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cPutin, of course, is afraid to tell President Trump directly that he wants to continue this war, that he wants to kill Ukrainians.\u201d",
      "Other observers believe Putin is in a tight spot and that his evasive response was an attempt to balance two competing realities.",
      "First, the Kremlin has no reason to accept a truce unless it delivers him a favorable outcome; and second, he wants to achieve a settlement with the White House while it is led by a president amenable to Moscow, said Jonathan Eyal, a director at the Royal United Services Institute think tank in London.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not in Putin\u2019s interest to get a ceasefire now,\" Eyal said Friday.  \"However, he cannot afford to annoy the American president, and expose and humiliate him with an outright rejection.\u201d",
      "The deal on offer to Putin is not going to improve, Eyal said, adding that Putin has \u201cgot an amazing opportunity to return to the global stage and [escape] from his isolation \u2014 with the help of the United States,\u201d he added. So \u201che\u2019s got to try to grab this deal without making too many concessions on Ukraine, and that\u2019s his dilemma.\u201d",
      "Officials in Kyiv will be hoping to use Putin\u2019s \u201cevasive\u201d response to \u201chelp convince their American colleagues that the Kremlin dictator is not genuinely interested in ending the war,\u201d wrote Mykola Bielieskov, a research fellow at the National Institute for Strategic Studies, a Ukrainian think tank.",
      "While Putin may entertain a truce with terms favorable to Moscow, he will not accept an independent Ukrainian state on Russia\u2019s border, Bielieskov wrote for the Atlantic Council.",
      "\u201cThis does not mean that current U.S.-led peace efforts are entirely futile, but it is vital to recognize that freezing the conflict along the current front lines will not be enough to end the war.\u201d"

      "Israel says it took extraordinary measures to avoid harming civilians in the 15-month war, which has been paused by a fragile ceasefire. It blames civilian deaths and destruction on Hamas because the militants operate in residential areas. Israeli forces carried out a number of raids on hospitals, accusing Hamas of using them for military purposes, allegations denied by Palestinian health officials.",

Informed by the attorney that Khalil was in the United States as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that too, according to the lawyer.",
      "The arrest appears to be among the first known actions under President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to deport international students who joined the protests against the war in Gaza that swept college campuses last spring. His administration has claimed participants forfeited their rights to remain in the country by supporting Hamas, a terror organization.",
      "When ICE agents arrived at the campus building Saturday, they also threatened to arrest Khalil\u2019s wife, an American citizen who is eight months pregnant, Greer said. The authorities declined to say why Khalil was being arrested, according to the attorney.",

      "\u201cThis has the appearance of a retaliatory action against someone who expressed an opinion the Trump administration didn\u2019t like,\u201d Mackler said.",

      "The university\u2019s allegations against Khalil focused on his involvement in the Columbia University Apartheid Divest group.

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Several Chinese trade unions have issued notices to companies to stop asking female job seekers about their marital and childbearing status, as women concerned about discrimination at work resist government entreaties to boost the national birth rate.",
      "Requiring job applicants to declare their marital and childbearing status has long been seen as a way for Chinese employers to avoid hiring women who plan to get married or have children in the near future.",
      "Employers \u201cshall not further inquire or investigate the marriage and childbearing status of female job applicants,\u201d read a notice from the state-backed trade union of Hunan province in central China that was posted last week around International Women\u2019s Day on the Chinese social media platform WeChat.",
      "The notice also said employers should not limit recruitment to men, stipulate a preference for male job applicants or require pregnancy tests as a condition of employment.",
      "Similar notices were posted by unions in the southern industrial hub of Shenzhen and the northwestern province of Qinghai.",
      "The notices have been widely shared in recent days on Chinese social media, where users discussed the challenges that women face when applying for jobs.",
      "\u201cFemale employees are expected to lie when employers ask about personal privacy during the job search process and give the employer a satisfactory answer if they really like the job,\u201d said a user on the Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu, also known as RedNote.",
      "As much as some employers would prefer their female workers to remain single, women are getting the opposite instructions from the Chinese government, which has been pressuring them to get married and have children to help address the declining and fast-aging population.",
      "Women are being encouraged to embrace more \u201ctraditional\u201d roles in society as wives and mothers, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping has personally called on women to promote a \u201cchildbearing culture.\u201d",
      "Some have rushed to adopt Beijing\u2019s line.",
      "Last month, a company in China rolled back a policy that threatened never-married and divorced employees with termination if they were still single by the end of September following public uproar.",
      "The company\u2019s notice had criticized single employees for \u201cnot responding to the national call.\u201d",
      "Despite women making strides in the workplace, achieving gender equality has been an uphill battle in China.",
      "It was only in 2012 that the State Council, China\u2019s Cabinet, prohibited employers from reducing female employees\u2019 wages or terminating their contracts because of pregnancy and childbirth.",
      "In an effort to encourage childbearing, Chinese officials have rolled out a series of measures including subsidies, improved child care and longer maternity leave.",
      "Those measures have had limited impact on Chinese women, who cite fear of falling behind in their careers among the reasons they hesitate to have children.",
      "A third of women in the country still take less than the 98 days of maternity leave they are entitled to, according to\u00a0a survey last year\u00a0by the Women\u2019s Studies Institute of China.",
      "Though the trade unions\u2019 notices were praised by some as a step forward for women, others questioned whether companies would take them seriously.",
      "\u201cWill there be any punishment for violating the rules? Most likely not,\u201d read one comment on Xiaohongshu."

      "A group of more than 80 Afghan women who fled the Taliban regime to study in Oman say they are at risk of imminent deportation to Afghanistan after their U.S.-funded scholarship was canceled as part of the Trump administration\u2019s cuts to foreign aid.",
      "The female students received an email on Feb. 28 informing them that the scholarship program administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development at the Middle East College of Oman had been terminated along with thousands of other foreign aid initiatives, according to the email obtained by NBC News.",
      "The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The plight of the Afghan students was first reported by the BBC.",
      "In a letter to aid groups, the Afghan women are appealing for urgent help to allow them to continue their studies abroad and avoid returning to a country where, they say, they will face certain persecution and life-threatening risks.",
      "\u201cThe situation is catastrophic,\u201d the letter says. \u201cBeing sent back to Afghanistan would mean the permanent loss of our education and exposure to severe risks, including oppression, insecurity, and a future without opportunities. This is a life-or-death situation for many of us.\u201d",
      "The Afghan students were pursuing undergraduate and graduate degrees in Oman under the Women\u2019s Scholarship Endowment, one of numerous programs eliminated in the Trump administration\u2019s effort to drastically scale back USAID.",
      "Secretary of State\u00a0Marco Rubio said Monday\u00a0that 83% of USAID programs had been canceled after a six-week review and that the remaining programs would be merged into the State Department.",
      "\u201cPlease don\u2019t let our dreams be shattered and the Taliban decide our fate,\u201d the students\u2019 letter reads. \u201cWe have fought very hard to get out of their hands, we won\u2019t be living anymore if we have to go back to Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "The program for female scholars was launched in 2019 with a $50 million endowment from USAID, according to Brian Le, deputy legislative director of With Honor, a nonprofit group that works with veterans in Congress from both parties on bipartisan initiatives. Interest from the endowment has covered the cost of the program, which was administered by USAID, without requiring additional annual funding from the U.S. government, Le said.",
      "Nonprofit groups are in discussions with the government of Oman to try to resolve the situation, he said.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to avoid is their return to Afghanistan, which would functionally amount to a death sentence for these women who have been aided by the United States in pursuing higher education opportunities,\u201d Le said.",
      "While the letter from the Afghan students said 83 women were affected, Le said it now appears more than 120 Afghans had their scholarship funding cut off.",
      "Since the Taliban returned to power in 2021 following the withdrawal of U.S.-led forces from Afghanistan, they have reimposed draconian restrictions on women, including banning them from secondary school and higher education,\u00a0prohibiting them from most employment and limiting their freedom of speech and movement, according to human rights groups.",
      "Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., said the elimination of the scholarship program was \u201cshameful\u201d and called on the Trump administration to reverse course.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration thinks it\u2019s politically advantageous to villainize USAID, but Americans need to realize that behind the cancelled contracts and mass layoffs are innocent lives now put at risk,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "\u201cIn this case, these bright young women with the world ahead of them could receive what could amount to a death sentence in a matter of days \u2014 simply because they were relying on a US-funded scholarship to get their education abroad.\u201d"

(Officially, she is registered as a resident of \u00dcberlingen, in Germany, just over the border from Switzerland.)",

      "Multiple international agencies have been searching for Konanki since she disappeared March 6 as the investigation nears its second week.",
      "Here's what we know about the case.",
      "Who is Sudiksha Konanki?",
      "Konanki, 20, is a junior in biology at the University of Pittsburgh, according to the Loudoun County, Virginia, Sheriff's Office. She is an Indian citizen and permanent U.S. resident who lives with her family in Chantilly, Virginia, which is in Loudoun County.",
      "She traveled to Punta Cana from Pitt on March 3 with five other female friends for their spring break trip, the sheriff's office said.",
      "Konanki is also in the South Asian fusion a cappella group Avaaz at college, according to the\u00a0group\u2019s Instagram account.",
      "When was Konanki last seen?",
      "Konanki was last seen early March 6 after she went to the beach with friends.",
      "She disappeared after 4:15 a.m., after her friends left the beach and she stayed behind with people she met on the trip.",
      "Security video showed Konanki and her friends entering the beach area in the Riu Republica Resort, where they were staying, Dominican Republic National Police said.",
      "Loudoun County Sheriff Michael Chapman told\u00a0NBC Washington\u00a0on Monday that Konanki's friends went back to the hotel after about 40 minutes and that Konanki stayed with the others whom she met and who were not friends from college.",
      "One of the last people who had contact with her said that \"a wave hit them while they were on the beach and caused some kind of situation,\" Dominican President Luis Abinader said at a\u00a0news conference Monday, citing local reports. Abinader said at the time that authorities were still trying to piece together what happened.",
      "Konanki's friends went on an excursion Thursday and did not realize she had disappeared until they returned, about 12 hours later, at which point they told the hotel about their missing friend, National Police spokesperson Diego Pesqueira said.",
      "The Loudoun County Sheriff's Office was then notified of her disappearance, Chapman said.",
      "National Police launched a search effort Friday morning after it learned Konanki was missing, using drones, helicopters, divers, boats and canine units. The search effort was expanded Monday.",
      "Konanki's friends were supposed to return to the United States on Friday but stayed back to aid in the search,\u00a0sheriff's spokesperson Thomas Julia said.",
      "The hotel said that beach access is always open and that security guards are stationed around the hotel and the area.",
      "What do we know about the investigation?",
      "Multiple agencies are involved in the investigation, which is being led by Dominican police, the Dominican attorney general's office, the FBI and a U.S. Embassy liaison.\u00a0The U.S. Coast Guard is also involved.",
      "A person of interest has been identified and was interviewed at length, Julia, the sheriff's office spokesperson, told NBC News. The sheriff's office has no jurisdiction over the case but sent detectives to the island to assist local investigators.",
      "A person of interest is \"not the same thing as a suspect, as this is not a criminal matter. It is still a missing person case,\" Julia said.",
      "National Police said Thursday morning that they do not use the term \"person of interest\" in their investigations and that no one is considered a suspect at this point.",
      "The University of Pittsburgh said it was in contact with Konanki's family and offering support in the investigation. The Indian Embassy in the Dominican Republic is also helping in the investigation, Chapman said.",
      "Konanki\u2019s family had traveled to Punta Cana to aid in search efforts but as of Thursday had returned to Virginia. They declined to comment on the search.",
      "La Altagracia Civil Defense, the local Dominican emergency operations agency,\u00a0shared photos of multiple agencies searching on the beach\u00a0over the weekend. The hotel was also assisting in search efforts, it said.",
      "Authorities have said it's not clear whether Konanki\u2019s disappearance is accidental or whether foul play was involved. No signs of blood or violence were found at the beach, Pesqueira said.",
      "National Police sent teams to monitor the beach overnight at least twice to watch how the water moves to see where a body would drift if someone drowned and to see where the waves crash.",
      "A hotel spokesperson said red flags \u2014\u00a0which indicate \"that the sea had a strong current and very high waves\" \u2014\u00a0were flying when Konanki disappeared.",
      "Dominican authorities said Thursday morning that the search was moving from the Riu Republic Resort to Macao Beach.",
      "Officials said they were interviewing Konanki\u2019s friends and those who last interacted with her, as well as hotel staff members and a person who was at the beach around the same time she was.",
      "Officials are also looking into Konanki's phone and texts, said Chapman, the Loudoun County sheriff. She did not appear to have a history of excessive drinking, he said.",
      "The sheriff's office said it filed for Interpol to issue a yellow notice, a worldwide police alert for a missing person, which will alert authorities if she travels to another country.",
      "\"We are going on the presumption that she\u2019s still alive,\" Chapman said Monday. \"We want to make sure that we're exhausting every possible lead that we can, and we feel we're doing that.\""

      "President Donald Trump threatened Thursday to impose 200% tariffs on alcohol from the European Union in response to the region's retaliatory 50% tariff on U.S. whiskey, further escalating tensions between two longtime trading partners.",
      "Trump also sharpened his rhetoric toward the E.U., which has for decades been one of the closest U.S. allies.",
      "\"The European Union, one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the World, which was formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States, has just put a nasty 50% Tariff on Whisky,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES. This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the European Commission said that the region's trade minister has already contacted his U.S. counterparts and that \u201ccalls are being prepared.\u201d",
      "Later Thursday morning, Trump posted: \"The U.S. doesn\u2019t have Free Trade. We have 'Stupid Trade.' The Entire World is RIPPING US OFF!!!\"",
      "After some early gyrations Thursday morning, the major U.S. stock indexes settled firmly in the red, with the S&P 500 approaching correction territory, almost 10% down from its all-time high in February. The tech-focused Nasdaq index was down 1.4% and is now down more than 14% from is February high.",
      "The United States remains the world's largest importer of both wine and Champagne and sparkling wine, with the former comprising $4.9 billion in annual sales and the latter more than $1.7 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. exports of wine rank fifth among all nations at about $1 billion, while its exports of sparkling wine total just $67 million, 12th in the world.",
      "The impact of the tit-for-tat tariffs could weigh more heavily on U.S. consumers, who depend on imports of the goods, than manufacturers of them.",
      "In a statement, the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, which represents alcohol makers here, called on Trump to come to an agreement with the E.U. over the impasse, noting that neither region's liquors have been subjected to tariffs for multiple decades.",
      "\"We urge President Trump to secure a spirits agreement with the EU to get us back to zero-for-zero tariffs, which will create U.S. jobs and increase manufacturing and exports for the American hospitality sector.\u00a0We want toasts not tariffs,\u201d said Chris Swonger, the council's president and CEO.",
      "Trump has made wielding tariff threats against stalwart U.S. partners a core practice of his early second administration. The latest volley shows he has no plans to halt doing so despite protests from economists and businesses groups alike about the repercussions of such a policy. On Wednesday, Trump\u2019s largest tariffs regime \u2014 targeting all steel and aluminum imports into the United States \u2014 went into effect. In response, the E.U. and Canada announced they would impose retaliatory duties on U.S.-made products.",
      "Trump has repeatedly suggested the United States' large trade deficit with the rest of the world is a sign of weakness. He has acknowledged that his tariffs strategy may lead to a period of \"transition\" for the U.S. economy, which has shown signs of wobbling in recent weeks, but he has said it will ultimately emerge stronger.",
      "Thursday morning, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick added additional context to Trump's latest barb and the E.U.'s specifically targeting products from states that strongly support Trump.",
      "\"The president was totally annoyed that the Europeans did this, and so you\u2019re going to hear back from someone who emotionally cares about America,\" he said on Bloomberg Television.\u00a0\"He cares about America, and he wants to take care of Americans. And why are Europeans picking on Kentucky bourbon ... Harley Davidson motorcycle? It\u2019s disrespectful.\"",
      "Lutnick added Trump was looking to \"balance\" trade relations with the E.U.",
      "\"We are your largest, most important trading partner. Treat us with respect, and let\u2019s get a little balance,\" he said.",
      "Ernst B\u00fcscher, a spokesperson for the German Wine Institute, said in an interview that a 200% tariff would be a \"catastrophe,\" noting that the United States is the most important export market for German winemakers, accounting for about one-sixth of exports.",
      "He added that when a tariff of 25% was placed on German wines during the first Trump administration, importers and winemakers shared the cost to shield U.S. consumers from the price increases \u2014 but that would most likely not be possible with a 200% tariff.",
      "French Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin said in a statement Thursday that Trump was \"escalating the trade war he chose to launch.\"",
      "\"France remains determined to fight back with the European Commission and our partners,\" he said. \"We will not give in to threats and will always protect our industries.\u201d",
      "So far, market reaction to Trump's approach has been broadly negative. Major stock indexes have erased their post-electoral gains, as investors rebel against the prospect of higher costs. On Thursday, stock futures immediately fell in response to Trump's latest announcement, though they pared their losses somewhat after a favorable inflation report.",
      "Most academics say the ability of U.S. consumers and businesses alike to import goods cheaply mostly leads to higher living standards and more efficient output for companies."
