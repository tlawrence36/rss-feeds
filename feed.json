      "George Clooney and Emma Stone star in two films premiering at the Venice Film Festival on Thursday evening",
      "VENICE, Italy -- VENICE, Italy (AP) \u2014 George Clooney plays a famous actor on a soul-searching journey and Emma Stone makes a turn as the CEO of a pharmaceutical company in two of the films premiering at the Venice Film Festival Thursday evening.",
      "Clooney and Stone are among the many Hollywood actors, including Adam Sandler, Laura Dern and Jesse Plemons, expected to grace the red carpet with the world premieres of Noah Baumbach\u2019s \u201cJay Kelly\u201d and Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s \u201cBugonia.\u201d Both films are vying for the coveted Golden Lion prize, the winner of which often goes on to get Oscar nominations and even wins.",
      "Lanthimos is a Venice veteran, having just recently won the festival\u2019s top prize for \u201cPoor Things,\u201d which would go on to win several Oscars, including best actress for Stone. The new film, \u201cBugonia,\u201d is an English-language adaptation of a South Korean film, about two conspiracy-minded men (one of which is played by Plemons) who believe Stone\u2019s character is an alien and kidnap her.",
      "Baumbach, too, was on the Lido recently with his Don DeLillo adaptation \u201cWhite Noise,\u201d which went on to a less decorated awards run. \u201cJay Kelly,\u201d he said in his director\u2019s statement, \u201cis about a man looking back at his life and reflecting on the choices, the sacrifices, the successes, the mistakes he\u2019s made.\u201d",
      "The film features a large ensemble cast, including Sandler as the actor\u2019s manager, Baumbach\u2019s wife and oft-collaborator Greta Gerwig, Dern, Billy Crudup and Riley Keough. Like \u201cWhite Noise,\u201d \u201cJay Kelly\u201d is a Netflix-produced film. After taking a year off from the festival, the streaming giant is back with three major films playing in competition, including Guillermo del Toro\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein\u201d and Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s political thriller \u201cA House of Dynamite.\u201d",

      "The director of the Van Gogh Museum is warning that the gallery may have to close if the Dutch government does not help to foot the bill for major maintenance",
      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The Amsterdam museum that displays a priceless collection of works by one of the world's most popular artists, Vincent van Gogh, may have to close if the Dutch government doesn't help foot the bill for major repairs to its aging building, the museum's director said Thursday.",
      "Since its opening in 1973, nearly 57 million visitors have passed through the Van Gogh Museum to gaze at iconic works including one of his paintings of a vase of sunflowers as well as \u201cAlmond Blossom,\u201d \u201cThe Potato Eaters\u201d and a colorful depiction of his bedroom in the French town of Arles.",
      "But Director Emilie Gordenker says the original building, which is owned by the Dutch state, is in such poor condition it needs urgent and extensive repairs to keep its priceless collection and visitors safe.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t address the major maintenance that needs to happen, we will have to close,\" she told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. The New York Times first reported on her concerns on Wednesday.",
      "She said the 50-year-old building needs \"major maintenance,\u201d and two years of talks with the government have not resolved a dispute about how to pay for repairs expected to start in 2028, last three years and cost 104 million euros ($121 million).",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s now getting very urgent,\u201d she said.",
      "She said that during the renovation, the museum would be partly closed and would therefore earn less from ticket sales. \u201cThe only thing we\u2019re asking them to do is to help us finance the basic maintenance,\u201d she said.",
      "The nearby Rijksmuseum shut down for years for a largescale renovation, but Gordenker says that kind of major facelift is not what the Van Gogh Museum is appealing for.",

      "In a written reaction, the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science said that the museum receives an annual subsidy \u201csufficient to carry out the necessary maintenance. This position is based on extensive expert research commissioned by the Ministry.\u201d",
      "It said the museum objected to the subsidy decision last year and recently filed an appeal in a Dutch court that will be heard in February next year. \u201cIt is not unusual for parties to have a subsidy decision reviewed by the court,\u201d the ministry added.",
      "The dispute has its origins in a decision by Van Gogh\u2019s family to transfer a trove of his art \u2014 more than 200 paintings, 500 drawings and 900 letters along with works by contemporaries such as Paul Gauguin \u2014 to a foundation set up in 1962 to keep the collection together. In return, the government pledged to build and maintain a museum where the works could be displayed, the museum said in a statement.",
      "Gordenker argues that means the government should also help to fund the work the museum now needs.",

      "Guillermo del Toro rose to fame creating horror movies that will likely help shape the genre for generations to come",
      "SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- Many fled when wildfires devastated Los Angeles earlier this year, but Guillermo del Toro rushed back in, determined to save his lifelong collection of horror memorabilia.",
      "It's the same loyalty that finds him making another tough decision to protect the items he loves like family: letting some of them go.",
      "Del Toro partnered with Heritage Auctions for a three-part auction to sell a fraction of a collection that is bursting at the seams. Online bidding for the first part on Sept. 26 started Thursday and includes over a hundred items, with more headed to the auction block next year.",
      "\u201cThis one hurts. The next one, I\u2019m going to be bleeding,\u201d del Toro, 60, said of the auction series. \u201cIf you love somebody, you have estate planning, you know, and this is me estate planning for a family that has been with me since I was a kid.\u201d",
      "Del Toro is one of the industry\u2019s most respected filmmakers, whose fascination with monsters and visual style will shape generations to come. But at his core, the Mexican-born horror buff is a collector. The Oscar-winner has long doubled as the sole caretaker of the \u201cBleak House\u201d \u2014 which stretches across two and a half Santa Monica homes nearly overflowing with thousands of ghoulish creatures, iconic comic drawings and paintings, books and movie props.",
      "The houses function not just as museums, but as libraries and workspaces where his imagination bounces off the oxblood-painted walls.",
      "\u201cI love what I have because I live with it. I actually am a little nuts, because I say hi to some of the life-size figures when I turn on the light,\u201d del Toro told The Associated Press, sitting in the dining room of one of the houses, now a sanctuary for \u201cHaunted Mansion\u201d memorabilia. \u201cThis is curated. This is not a casual collection.\u201d",
      "The auction includes behind-the-scene drawings and one-of-a-kind props from del Toro\u2019s own classics, as well as iconic works like Bernie Wrightson\u2019s illustrations for \u201cFrankenstein\u201d and Mike Mignola\u2019s pinup artwork for \u201cHellraiser.\u201d",
      "In January, del Toro had only a couple hours, his car and a few helping hands to save key pieces from the fires. Out of the over 5,000 items in his collection, he only managed to move about 120 objects. It wasn't the first time, as fires had come dangerously close to Bleak House twice before.",
      "The houses were spared, but fear consumed him. If a fire or earthquake swallowed them, he thought, \u201cWhat came out of it? You collected insurance? And what happened to that little segment of Richard Corben's life, or Jack Kirby\u2019s craft, or Bernie Wrightson\u2019s life?\u201d",
      "An auction, del Toro said, gives him peace of mind, as it ensures the items will land in the hands of another collector who will protect the items as he has. These are not just props or trinkets, he said, but \u201chistorical artifacts. They're pieces of audiovisual history for humanity.\u201d And his life's mission has been to protect as much of this history as he can.",
      "\u201cLook, this is in reaction to the fires. This is in reaction to loving this thing,\u201d del Toro told the AP.",
      "The initial auction uncovers who del Toro is as a collector, he said. Upcoming parts will expose how the filmmaker thinks, which he called a much more personal endeavor. The auction isn't just a \u201cpiece of business,\u201d for him, but rather a love letter to collectors everywhere, and encouragement to think beyond a movie and \u201clearn to read and write film design in a different way. That's my hope.\u201d",

One time, del Toro said, he found someone \u201ccleaning an oil painting with Windex, and I almost had a heart attack.\"",

      "The auction also includes art from comic legends like Richard Corben, Jack Kirby and H.R. Giger, whose work del Toro wrote in the catalog \u201crepresent the pinnacle of comic book art in the last quarter of the twentieth century.\u201d",
      "Other cultural touchstones in illustration that are represented in the auction include rare images from the 1914 short film \u201cGertie the Dinosaur,\u201d one of the earliest animated films, and original art for \u201cSleeping Beauty\u201d by Eyvind Earle and Kay Nielsen.",
      "\u201cAs collectors, you are basically keeping pieces of culture for generations to come. They're not yours,\" del Toro said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know which of the pieces you\u2019re holding is going to be culturally significant ... 100 years from now, 50 years from now. So that\u2019s part of the weight.\"",

      "\u201cThe Roses\u201d is a dark comedy about a marriage falling apart",
      "\u201cThe Roses\u201d begins in a marriage therapist's office, where Theo Rose has something interesting to say about his longtime wife, Ivy: \u201cI would rather live with her than a wolf.\u201d That's especially interesting because the question the therapist posed was: What are 10 things you love about each other?",
      "After a few minutes of blistering barbs back and forth \u2014 Ivy suggests that one good thing about her husband is \u201che has arms\u201d \u2014 the therapist is appalled and resigned. \u201cI see so much resentment, I don't think you have the capacity to fix your problems,\u201d she tells them.",
      "There are dark marriage comedies and then there's \u201cThe Roses,\u201d an escalating hatefest that, by the time a loaded gun comes out, all the fun has been sucked out. It's hard tonally to go from microaggressions to the burning of someone's prized books to attempted murder and stay a comedy.",
      "That was the trap that sunk the Danny DeVito-directed 1989 version \u201cThe War of the Roses\u201d and it's the same quicksand that makes the Jay Roach-directed \u201cThe Roses\u201d so unpleasant. Seeing a marriage implode with such ferocity, with both participants hoping to extract maximum hurt, is like having \u201cMarriage Story\u201d on MDMA.",
      "Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman naturally bring a certain dry Britishness to roles originally portrayed by Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner. They are witty and arch, sarcastic and passive-aggressive. You believe their love but you also believe they can hate each other.",
      "He is a prickly, high-flying architect \u2014 adding artistic flourishes like cascading balconies \u2014 and she is a stalled chef \u2014 weirdly able to make both elaborate, sculptural desserts and down-home seafood \u2014 who are raising their two teenagers when the action gets going. His career hits a horrific roadblock and hers takes flight when she opens the restaurant We've Got Crabs!",
      "Switching roles, Cumberbatch's Theo now becomes the laundry-folding, kids' lunch maker \u2014 \u201cI could build children instead of houses,\u201d he says \u2014 while Colman's Ivy jets off to cook with David Chang while her Champagne flute is being topped up.",

      "Samberg has perhaps the most sad line when he says of his wife: \u201cWhen we were younger, I knew what she was going to say before she said it. Now I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s said after she\u2019s said it.\u201d For her part, McKinnon does her bug-eyed, off-kilter, hypersexual thing \u2014 a tiresome character that she seems to only do now after reaching its apex in \u201cBarbie.\u201d",

      "The problem with \u201cThe Roses\u201d \u2014 1989 or 2025 \u2014 is it doesn't know what it wants to say about marriage. Maybe that fervent love eventually curdles and we should just find the moments of joy that remain? That only someone who loves you can hurt you so exquisitely? That we should never let small resentments metastasize or change roles mid-marriage? That we should never, ever get back together?",

      "Darren Aronofsky has already made several indelibly New York movies. But loveable as was the subterranean monochrome paranoia of \u201cPi\u201d and charming as we all consider the pupil-dilating tragedy of his bleak Brighton Beach-set \u201cRequiem for a Dream,\" Aronofsky's latest, \u201cCaught Stealing,\u201d is easily the director's most affectionate portrait of his hometown.",
      "That, too, may be a funny way to describe a movie where bodies get brutalized, corpses accumulate and even the cat comes away with a limp. But \u201cCaught Stealing,\u201d a terrific caper starring Austin Butler as a Lower East Side man inadvertently drawn into a nightmarish crime world, is a period movie. It's set in 1998. And no amount of blood can detract from the overwhelming endearment Aronofsky has for '90s New York.",
      "Butler plays Hank Thompson: a former baseball player who can't play anymore; a bartender who, after some of the early events of the movie, can\u2019t drink anymore; and a devoted San Francisco Giants fan surrounded by Mets fans. As his not-quite girlfriend Yvonne ( Zo\u00eb Kravitz ) says, he's \u201ca good country boy\u201d who calls his mom in California every day. They end every call with \u201cGo Giants!\u201d",
      "Hank is far from the first regular guy to be ensnared in underground crime syndicates, but there are a number of things that distinguish \u201cCaught Stealing.\u201d First, his troubles stem, like they do for so many New Yorkers, from his neighbor. Russ (Matt Smith), the mohawked Brit punk who lives next door, rushes out to fly to London, and he leaves Hank his cat to take care of.",
      "Soon, though, a pair of Russian gang skinheads (Yuri Kolokolnikov, Nikita Kukushkin) are banging on Russ' door and quickly after, pummeling Hank, too. Their beating of Hank is unexpectedly brutal, and the first sign that \u201cCaught Stealing\u201d is going for something a little different. When Hank wakes up in the hospital, he's down a kidney and told he can't drink alcohol ever again.",
      "For Hank, it's not his first blush with alcohol-connected fatality. In flashbacks that replay as Hank's nightmares, we see him as a hotshot high-school baseball player, soon to be drafted into the pros. While drinking and driving, he careens off the road to avoid a cow, driving straight into a pole. His buddy is dead, and Hank's knee won't ever be the same.",
      "Meanwhile, the Russian mob interest continues to spiral, drawing in a police detective (Regina King, always good), the skinheads' boss, Colorado (Bad Bunny), and a pair of Orthodox Jewish brothers (Liev Schreiber and Vincent D\u2019Onofrio). The question that keeps coming up is whether Hank can hack it in this world. Is he a killer? He doesn't think so, even though he has killed. As King's detective says, \u201cI thought maybe you played real ball.\u201d",

If it once appeared that Butler might be trapped in his breakthrough role, \u201cCaught Stealing\u201d shows how he can carry a movie in a much less adorned performance.",
      "For Aronofsky, little in his recent filmography ( \"The Whale,\" \u201cMother!\u201d) suggested that an \u201cAfter Hours\u201d-like New York odyssey was coming next from him. It's a little shaggy and you'll occasionally yearn for a bit more humor along the way. But \u201cCaught Stealing,\" based on Charlie Huston's 2004 novel, is a ride, foremost, in '90s nostalgia.",
      "The looming Twin Towers are a regular reminder that this was a long time ago, indeed, even if the New York of Aronofsky's movie seems achingly familiar to some of us. That goes for places the movie rushes past, like Kim's Video and Shea Stadium, the Alphabet City bars of the film and the now-bygone concerns of cell phone minutes running low. Hank has another neighbor, too, whom he and Yvonne mock for how he describes his job as \u201cbuilding websites.\u201d",
      "Late summer is always a funny time in movie theaters, but that goes especially for this year. We've somehow had not one but two excellent New York movies, both rich in baseball fandom, in \u201cCaught Stealing\u201d and Spike Lee's \u201cHighest 2 Lowest.\u201d Hollywood seemingly has little idea what to do with genre movies from auteur filmmakers that aren't obvious awards fodder. These are movies that might not be home runs, but their directors most definitely stretch them for extra bases.",

      "The scattered hotels are also the reason you see so many celebrities photographed on the Excelsior docks: They arrive to the festival, including press conferences and premieres, by private water taxi. Sometimes, they\u2019re transported a very short distance from the Excelsior to the red carpet in cars. Unlike the main island of Venice, vehicles are allowed on the Lido, including buses and private cars. But many festivalgoers prefer to rent a bike to get around.",

      "It started with a friendship bracelet",
      "NEW YORK -- It started with a friendship bracelet. It ended with an engagement ring. Taylor Swift, the pop superstar, and Travis Kelce, the football champion, are engaged.",
      "The fiances, both 35, announced the news in a joint post on Instagram on Tuesday. It is the latest chapter in the couple's love story, one that has spanned two years, two Super Bowls, an album announcement and the highest-grossing tour of all time.",
      "Here is a look at some of the major events in their relationship.",
      "It started, fittingly, with a friendship bracelet.",
      "It was way back in July 2023 that Kelce attended Swift\u2019s Eras concert at Arrowhead Stadium, where the Chiefs play.",
      "After, on his \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast with brother Jason Kelce, he professed to being disappointed \u2014 well, his word was \u201cbutthurt\u201d \u2014 that he couldn\u2019t meet Swift and present her with a bracelet with his phone number on it.",
      "\u201cShe doesn\u2019t meet anybody, or at least she didn\u2019t want to meet me, so I took it personal,\u201d he quipped. The podcast asked on Instagram: \u201cAnyone know how to get a bracelet to @taylorswift13? \u2026 asking for a friend.\u201d",
      "But by that September, Kelce was hinting his efforts had achieved some success. He declined to elaborate amid speculation, telling an interviewer: \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d",
      "Clearly, though, something was happening. Soon, Kelce revealed he\u2019d invited Swift to a game at Arrowhead. \u201cI threw the ball in her court,\u201d he said on another talk show.",
      "Swift took Kelce up on his offer, appearing for all the world to see at the Chiefs-Bears game, cheering next to his mom, Donna Kelce. The two left the stadium in Kelce\u2019s purple Chevelle \u201cgetaway car\u201d \u2014 forgive the pun, but Kelce himself used it.",
      "\u201cPretty ballsy,\u201d Kelce said a few days later of Swift\u2019s appearance, adding how much he loved seeing her cheer next to his mother.",
      "It was the launch of a long series of appearances by Swift at Chiefs games. There was some online angst over whether Swift was distracting from football \u2014 while the NFL itself capitalized on her fandom. A day after the flashy Los Angeles premiere of her \u201cTaylor Swift: Eras Tour\u201d movie, she was back at Arrowhead.",
      "And now it was time for Kelce to be the adoring fan. In November 2023, after a hiatus of two months, Swift brought her tour to Argentina, where she changed the lyrics of \u201cKarma\u201d to salute her beau. \u201cKarma is the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me,\u201d she sang. Scott Swift, next to a beaming Kelce, applauded his daughter\u2019s new flame.",
      "When Time magazine announced its person of the year, few were surprised. In the Time interview, Swift spoke about her relationship.",
      "\u201cThis all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,\u201d Swift said, adding that they\u2019d already been a couple before that first Chiefs game cameo.",
      "Soon after, things were heating up on the football field \u2014 meaning the Chiefs were heading to the Super Bowl. At the AFC championship game, the couple made it clear they were fine with whatever attention was coming their way. In the middle of the field in Baltimore, after the Chiefs beat the Ravens, Swift and Kelce kissed. \u201cI love you,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cSo much it\u2019s not funny.\u201d",
      "There was one game left. Fans wondered: How would Swift make it from her Tokyo shows to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas?",
      "\u201cThis week is truly the best kind of chaos,\u201d Swift posted on Instagram.",
      "Chaos indeed. In one week of February 2024, Swift attended the Grammys in Los Angeles, jetted to Tokyo for four concerts, then jumped back onto her private plane to make the Super Bowl with time to spare. To get there, she crossed nine time zones and the international dateline.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s rewriting the history books herself,\u201d Kelce said a day after the Grammys, where Swift had won album of the year for a record fourth time. \u201cI told her I\u2019ll have to hold up my end of the bargain and come home with hardware, too.\u201d",
      "And he did. The two kissed on the field again after the Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers, Swift in her \u201c87\u201d necklace.",

      "Jeremy Allen White grew up listening to Bruce Springsteen",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jeremy Allen White grew up listening to Bruce Springsteen. He doesn\u2019t even remember a time in his life when he wasn\u2019t aware of his music. But sing his songs? It wasn\u2019t until White began preparing to play the rock \u2019n' roll legend for \u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere\u201d that he even tried.",
      "\u201cI had never really sang anything, never mind Bruce,\u201d White says. \u201cThere was a leap of faith that we were all taking.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s an established playbook for music biopics. \u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere\u201d ignored all of it. The film, written and directed by Scott Cooper (\u201cCrazy Heart,\u201d \u201cBlack Mass\u201d), eschews the standard life-spanning, play-the-hits approach and instead focuses on a small portion of Springsteen\u2019s sprawling life: the making of his 1982 album, \u201cNebraska.\u201d",
      "The album, a minimalist masterpiece recorded on a four track in Springsteen\u2019s bedroom in Colts Neck, New Jersey, doesn\u2019t lend itself to anything like a glossy big-screen jukebox. \u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere,\u201d instead, is aimed more at the soul of Springsteen. For the role, Cooper turned to who he considers one of the best actors of his generation \u2014 even though he had no singing experience.",
      "\u201cI remember early on speaking to Scott about the project and being really excited to do it with him but also telling him, \u2018Hey, I don\u2019t know how to play the guitar and I\u2019ve never really sang before. Are we going to be able to figure out this together?\u2019\u201d White recalls. \u201cBut Scott had faith. And Bruce had faith. And we trusted each other.\u201d",
      "\u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,\u201d which 20th Century Studios will release Oct. 24 in theaters, is the first movie based on Springsteen\u2019s life. It was made with Springsteen\u2019s involvement; he gave input to on the script, on casting and attended several days on set. It\u2019s also the first leading movie role for White, the 34-year-old Emmy-winning star of \u201cThe Bear,\u201d who sings all the songs in the film.",
      "\u201cI knew that he had the two qualities that really embody Bruce: humility and swagger,\u201d Scott says. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t teach swagger at Julliard. You either have it or you don\u2019t. I was never concerned. He\u2019s sensational.\u201d",
      "\u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere,\u201d based on Warren Zanes\u2019 2023 book, co-stars Jeremy Strong as Jon Landau, Springsteen\u2019s longtime manager and record producer. Landau was also involved in the project from its inception.",
      "\u201cI knew that this was the first time Bruce had handed the wheel over to anybody to tell a story of his,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cThey were never directors in any way but were always there when I had a question. Of course, when you\u2019re Jeremy Allen White and you have Bruce Springsteen show up, that\u2019s a whole different story.\u201d",
      "For White, Springsteen was a great resource in a movie that aspired to authentic interiority. \u201cNebraska\u201d was a major departure for Springsteen. Its 10 songs spun tales of blue-collar workers soaked through with Springsteen\u2019s own childhood memories and reverberating with an American storytelling tradition running from Flannery O\u2019Connor to Woody Guthrie. Springsteen intended the raw demos to be later recorded with the E Street Band, but ultimately decided to release the unvarnished recordings.",
      "White sees the film, in part, as about the artistic process.",
      "\u201cHe was drawing inspiration from all these places but he didn\u2019t really know what he was doing for a while with this record,\u201d White says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know if it was going to be a record. As an actor, hopefully you\u2019re doing that sort of thing all the time. That artistic curiosity is something I related to.\u201d",
      "White first spent time with Springsteen in London, where he also attended a concert. The actor later spoke to Patti Scialfa, Springsteen's bandmate and wife of 34 years, and friends of the rock legend. After peppering Springsteen with questions during preproduction in New Jersey, White says he mostly kept his head down during the shoot.",

      "The challenge musically was considerable. To prepare, White worked with vocal coach Eric Vetro (who a also trained Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet for \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d ), guitar instructor J.D. Simo and music supervisor Dave Cobb. For White, a turning point came when they went to RCA in Nashville to record most of the songs over a 48-hour period.",
      "\u201cI feel like that\u2019s where I found my confidence,\u201d White says. \u201cI\u2019m in this recording studio. It\u2019s a very large room, you\u2019re kind of by yourself. And I got to sing Bruce\u2019s songs over and over again. I remember feeling closer and closer to the man.\u201d",
      "Though \u201cAtlantic City\u201d was initially the song White gravitated toward, the one that ended up striking a chord was \u201cMy Father\u2019s House,\u201d one of Springsteen\u2019s most stirring and plaintive ballads.",

      "\u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere\u201d will arrive at a time when Springsteen has ratcheted up his criticism of President Donald Trump.

      "Cooper and White have a much different impression from their time with Springsteen.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if a lot of people with his level of success and notoriety and fame, a public person decade after decade, can remain so in touch and available and honest with people day after day,\u201d White says. \u201cWhat was important to him remains his art, yes, but it\u2019s his family and Patti. All of his morals are right in line \u2014 what I consider to be right in line.\u201d",
      "Says Cooper: \u201cBruce isn\u2019t just a musician. He\u2019s the symbol of something that\u2019s uniquely American. The blue-collar poet. The reluctant moral conscience. I think to make a film about Bruce is to make a film about America\u2019s soul. The power of that lies in his emotional honesty and his work resonates across all political lines because he tells the truth.\u201d",
      "Cooper wasn\u2019t just speaking theoretically. Making \u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere\u201d coincided with multiple tragedies for the director. His father died the day before shooting began. During the last week of production, he lost his house in the Palisades fire in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cJeremy and Bruce and a really wonderful crew and cast of actors lifted me up and carried me through to the finish line,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cWhen we didn\u2019t have a place to live, Bruce moved my family into his place in Los Angeles. And Jeremy was there on some of my darkest days. The movie, for me, has a particular resonance.\u201d",

      "Katy Perry has testified during a Los Angeles trial that she's seeking justice in a legal battle over a California mansion",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A lawyer asked Katy Perry on Tuesday whether she stood to gain money or anything else from a trial in a long legal fight over a California mansion.",
      "\u201cJustice\u201d was the one-word answer from the singing superstar, former \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d judge and recent astronaut, part of an hour of remote testimony she gave in a Los Angeles courtroom.",
      "In her tense, careful testimony, Perry wouldn't concede directly that she stood to gain money if she won, but did say, \u201cI stand to lose money if it doesn\u2019t work in my favor.\u201d",
      "She spoke during the second trial in a dispute over a $15 million mansion in upscale Montecito near Santa Barbara that she and former partner Orlando Bloom bought in 2020.",
      "The seller, 85-year-old Carl Westcott, said he was not mentally competent to make the deal and sued to undo it.",
      "Perry's side \u2014 technically the defendant was her business manager, Bernie Gudvi \u2014 prevailed in the first trial in 2023. Then Gudvi, representing Perry, countersued over lost rental income brought on by the legal fight and millions in maintenance the house allegedly required. That brought on the current sequel trial.",
      "Westcott's lawyer, Andrew J. Thomas, often tried to steer the conversation toward Bloom. Superior Court Judge Joseph Lipner ruled that the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d and \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d actor does not have to testify because it would be redundant and unnecessary, even though the house is officially owned by a company he set up.",
      "Asked if she had any role in a remodel of the house Bloom oversaw, Perry replied that she acted as \u201cpartner and adviser.\u201d",
      "The couple, who split up in July, have a daughter together whose fifth birthday was Tuesday.",
      "When asked about the nature of their partnership, Perry replied, \u201cWe're family for life.\u201d",
      "Perry's attorney, Eric Rowen, objected to nearly every question by Thomas as irrelevant, including most of the queries about Bloom, which Lipner kept to a minimum.",
      "Rowen objected especially angrily when Perry was asked if she knew that Westcott had entered a mental institution earlier in the legal fight, apparently suggesting the question was an attack for the sake of the media present.",
      "\u201cThis is, I don\u2019t want to say unethical, but this is simply an effort to drive a narrative to parties outside this courtroom,\" Rowen said. The judge sustained his objection and the question was not allowed.",

      "There was one light moment at the end of Perry's testimony when she described some dealings with Westcott and said, \u201cI was pregnant at the time.\u201d",
      "She couldn't be heard clearly and Lipner said he had heard, \u201cIt was private.\u201d",

      "A life of retirement certainly seems pleasant at Coopers Chase, a community of pensioners nestled in the English countryside",
      "First of all, is this really what retirement looks like?",
      "If so, perhaps we should all sign up, no matter our age. In \u201cThe Thursday Murder Club,\u201d an amiable, cozy, pleasantly entertaining adaptation of Richard Osman\u2019s mystery novel, the lucky club members live in a retirement home that resembles Downton Abbey.",
      "The food at this dreamy manor house nestled in the English countryside is scrumptious, with a choice of wines at lunch. The apartments are huge, the antiques tasteful, the archery and life-drawing classes top-notch. And the emotional support animals are llamas. Yes, llamas.",
      "This is the setting, quaintly called Coopers Chase, in which four retirees, led by Helen Mirren in her no-nonsense plaid blazers, depart from yoga and Sudoku each week to consider cold cases. Old folks solving cases \u2014 and outthinking police \u2014 is nothing new in our popular culture. Let\u2019s recall \u201cMurder, She Wrote,\u201d in which Angela Lansbury\u2019s Jessica Fletcher solved cases in tiny Cabot Cove, Maine \u2014 where close to 300 murders somehow occurred during the show\u2019s 12-year run.",
      "The crime-busting seniors in \u201cThe Thursday Murder Club,\u201d directed by Chris Columbus, are nowhere near that fortunate in terms of body count. But they approach their weekly meetings with gusto. Mirren\u2019s Elizabeth has skills from a career in \u201cinternational affairs\u201d (smells like espionage). Pierce Brosnan\u2019s Ron is former trade unionist, and Ben Kingsley\u2019s Ibrahim a former psychiatrist. As we begin, the trio is considering a case from the \u201970s in which a woman fell out a window under mysterious circumstances.",
      "But they need medical expertise, and thus they recruit new resident Joyce (Celia Imrie), an expert baker and former trauma nurse. We meet her as she\u2019s showing off the grounds to her haughty daughter, who manages a hedge fund and can\u2019t eat Mom\u2019s cakes because she\u2019s perimenopausal. \u201cEverybody\u2019s doing llamas these days, Mum,\u201d she says, unimpressed with the surroundings.",
      "But Joyce is thrilled to join the club, and even more thrilled when, one morning, news comes that an actual murder has occurred \u2014 a co-owner of Coopers Chase, actually. \u201cNow we've got a real case to solve!\u201d she gushes, with \u201cDisco Inferno\u201d suddenly playing on the soundtrack (that\u2019s a little much), as she pulls Ron from aqua aerobics for a meeting. \u201cIsn\u2019t it wonderful!\u201d",
      "But no, it isn\u2019t all wonderful \u2014 the deceased had promised to protect the retirees from the plans of another co-owner to demolish the home and make an event space. The shady Ian Ventham (David Tennant) also intends to uproot the cemetery. Ron organizes a noisy protest. And then, yet another murder happens.",
      "Naomi Ackie is appealing as a police officer who aches for exciting work, and Daniel Mays very funny as her clueless boss. As for the plot \u2013 well, the rather dry storyline is not what brings pleasure here.",

      "No, that pleasure is derived from seeing these veterans strut their stuff, foremost among them Mirren. (Kingsley, alas, gets almost no good lines). Her most delicious moment is a direct nod to her Oscar-winning role as a different Elizabeth. Heading out on an incognito mission with Joyce, she dons a silk headscarf, a comfy cardigan, a tartan skirt and a walking stick. \u201cYou look like the Queen!\u201d notes her husband. \u201cDo I?\u201d she asks, cheekily.",
      "But moments later, on the bus with Joyce, Elizabeth has a scene that rings false. Reading a text message, she asks her friend: \u201cWhat does WTF mean?\u201d Joyce explains, loudly, what it means, saying she learned it from her daughter. A young mother with a child nearby is shocked at the profanity. It\u2019s all too cute by half. We\u2019re supposed to believe razor-sharp Elizabeth doesn\u2019t know what \u201cWTF\u201d means?",
      "It\u2019s a few moments like this that cause some discomfort, raising the question of whether these characters are being, well, caricatured. Columbus seems to acknowledge the issue with an exchange where Joyce tells Elizabeth that she feels like she\u2019s in \u201cone of those Sunday night dramas about two bright-eyed, feisty, old lady detectives outsmarting the police at every turn.\u201d Annoyed, Elizabeth tells her never to utter the words again.",
      "In any case, there\u2019s a sadder undertone that provides some grounding here. Elizabeth's husband \u2014 poignantly played by Jonathan Pryce \u2014 is in the early stages of dementia, a fact Elizabeth is keeping from him. He has his good days and his bad ones, she explains to a friend. Sometimes he\u2019s his old self, and sometimes he\u2019s just gone.",
      "It\u2019s a message that even if our main protagonists seem healthy and active, they\u2019re at a stage in life where every day is a bit more precarious. \u201cCherish the good moments,\u201d the friend tells Elizabeth.",
      "It\u2019s a good message, overall, for the movie. The script could certainly be sharper, the comedy more clever. But for two hours on Netflix, Coopers Chase is rather a comfy place to be, with some moments to cherish.",
      "\u201cThe Thursday Murder Club,\u201d a Netflix release, has been rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association \u201cfor violent content/bloody images, strong language and some sexual references.\u201d Running time: 118 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "Nevertheless, the tour is exhausting. Every day takes Tess to a new city, a different hotel, a fresh crowd of admirers. She has to rely on FaceTime to keep in touch with her husband and two young children, and her vivid imagination tortures her with fears about what could be going wrong at home.",
      "Before long, however, odd things start happening on the tour. She finds a mysterious locket in a hotel room night stand. At another stop, someone breaks into her room and leaves a pair of earrings. A sheet of paper with a vaguely threatening message is slid under her door. Someone takes her carry-on from an airplane overhead bin.",
      "Worse, Tess starts getting uncomfortable personal questions about her past at bookstore appearances and on social media \u2014 uncomfortable because she has long harbored a dark secret. It\u2019s one that she fears would destroy her new career and her family if it were ever revealed.",
      "In Tess, Ryan has created a likeable, compelling, complex character who struggles to come to terms with her past and finds the courage to confront the danger she faces. The story starts slowly, the tension building page by page toward a series of twists that readers are unlikely to see coming.",

      "James Cameron first began developing \u201cAvatar\u201d more than 30 years ago",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 James Cameron recently turned 71 as he brought his third \u201cAvatar\u201d film, \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d to the finish line.",
      "Cameron first began developing \u201cAvatar\u201d more than 30 years ago. He started working on the first film in earnest 20 years ago. Production on \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d which ran concurrently with 2022's \u201cThe Way of Water,\u201d got underway eight years ago.",
      "By any measure, \u201cAvatar\u201d is one of the largest undertakings ever by a filmmaker. It's maybe the only project that could make \u201cTitanic\u201d look like a modest one-off. Cameron has dedicated a huge chunk of his life to it. Now, as he prepares to unveil the latest chapter of his Na'vi opus on Dec. 19, Cameron is approaching what he calls a crossroads.",
      "\u201cAs you get older you start to think of time in a slightly different way,\u201d Cameron says from his 5,000-acre organic farm in New Zealand. \u201cIt\u2019s not an infinite resource.\u201d",
      "Two more \u201cAvatar\u201d films are already written and have release dates, in 2029 and 2031. Right now, though, Cameron is focused on completing \u201cFire and Ash,\" which is almost guaranteed to be the biggest movie of the fall. To get \u201cAvatar\u201d \u2014 a franchise already worth $5.2 billion in worldwide tickets sales \u2014 back in the minds of moviegoers, \u201cThe Way of Water\u201d will also be rereleased Oct. 3.",
      "\u201cAs I told the brass at Disney, we\u2019re right at the glide slope to land right on time for delivery,\" Cameron says. \u201cThe first film was a nightmare. Movie two was hectic. But here, I keep having to pinch myself because it\u2019s all going well. The film is strong.\u201d",
      "There may be no filmmaker more at the nexus of past and future blockbuster making than Cameron. \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d will arrive as Hollywood is reconciling itself to a new theatrical normal. In a movie industry of shrinking ambition, \u201cAvatar,\u201d an original spectacle that once was the wave of the future, is already beginning to look like an endangered species.",
      "In a recent interview, Cameron reflected on his history with \u201cAvatar\u201d and what's next for him, including a planned adaptation of Charles Pellegrino's \u201cGhosts of Hiroshima.\u201d For Cameron, most of his work is likely to touch on one of what he calls \u201cthe big three\u201d: Nuclear weapons, machine super intelligence and climate change.",
      "\u201cAvatar,\u201d a family saga that grows more complicated and darker in \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d relates to the latter. The films are environmental parables, set in a verdant faraway world. Sustainability, community, connection to nature \u2014 these are some of the pillars of Cameron's life right now, in the movies and outside them.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just a humble movie farmer,\u201d he says, smiling, \u201cwho\u2019s also a farmer farmer.\u201d",
      "CAMERON: It was sort of: Do the \u201cAvatar\u201d saga or follow my interests more. I knew that \u201cAvatar\u201d would be all-consuming, and it has been. When I set down that path, a reasonable projection was eight to 10 years to get it all written and do movie two and movie three together and get them out. But it\u2019s actually turned out to be more than that. It was a major commitment and decision to make for me as a life choice. But the \u201cAvatar\u201d movies reach people and they reach people with positive messaging. Not just positive about the environment but positive from the standpoint of humanity, empathy, spirituality, our connection to each other. And they\u2019re beautiful. There\u2019s a kind of magnetic draw into the film. It almost feels like it\u2019s being pulled out of the audience\u2019s dreams and subconscious state.",
      "CAMERON: I was 19. I was in college and I had a very vivid dream of a bioluminescent forest with glowing moss that reacted to your feet and these little spinning lizards that floated around. It\u2019s all in the movie, by the way. The reason it\u2019s in the movie is because I got up and painted it. That later became the inspiration, just a few years later, for a science-fiction script. I said, \u201cHey I got this idea for a planet where everything glows at night.\u201d We wrote that in and it never went away.",
      "Years after that, when I was the CEO of Digital Domain, I wanted to push Digital Domain to be able to create CG worlds, CG humanoid creatures using performance capture. I just threw the kitchen sink into the treatment called \u201cAvatar.\u201d So it came from almost a Machiavellian reason. I was trying to drive a business model for the development of CG. Of course, the answer I got from my technical team was: \u201cWe are not ready to make this film. We may not be ready for years.\u201d But it still served that inspirational purpose, which was: Well, how do we get ready?",

      "CAMERON: It\u2019s interesting. As I said earlier, \u201cAvatar\u201d has been all-consuming. In the process, we\u2019ve developed many new technologies. I enjoy the day-to-day process with a team. I\u2019ve surrounded myself with really intelligent, really creative people who enjoy the process of the world building. We enjoy leveling up in our working process. It\u2019s a long, steady state thing where I\u2019m not having to create a new startup, build a team and then disband that team \u2014 the way the movies cycled for me back in the \u201980s and \u201990s. Now, I\u2019m at a kind of a crossroads where I have to decide if I want to keep doing this.",
      "Four and five are written. If we\u2019re as successful as we might potentially be, I\u2019m sure the films will continue. The question for me will be: Do I direct them both? Do I direct one of them? At what point do I pass the baton? How pervasive do I want it to be in my life?",
      "CAMERON: I\u2019m not going to make any decisions about that until probably Q2 of next year, when the dust has settled. And there are also new technologies to consider. Generative AI is upon us. It\u2019s going to transform the film business. Does that make our work flow easier? Can I make \u201cAvatar\u201d movies more quickly? That would be a big factor for me.",
      "CAMERON: The theatrical business is dwindling. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t continue to dwindle. Right now, it\u2019s plateaued at about 30% down from 2019 levels. Let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t get cannibalized more. In fact, let\u2019s hope we can bring some of that magic back. But the only way to keep that magic alive and strengthen it is to make the kinds of movies people feel they need to see in a movie theater. Unfortunately, those movies are not getting greenlit as much as they used to be because studios can\u2019t afford them. Or they can only afford to take the risk on certain blue chip stocks, so it doesn\u2019t allow new IP to get launched. It doesn\u2019t allow new filmmakers to come into those genres.",
      "I\u2019d like to see the cost of VFX artists come down. VFX artists get scared and say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to be out of a job.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, the way you\u2019re going to be out of a job is if trends continue and we just don\u2019t make these kinds of movies anymore.\u201d If you develop these tools or learn these tools, then your throughpoint will be quicker and that will bring the cost of productions down, and studios will be encouraged to make more and more of these types of films. To me, that\u2019s a virtuous cycle that we need to manifest. We need to make that happen or I think theatrical might never return.",
      "CAMERON: I would love to think that we\u2019ve been building a new monument for the last three or four years. And I think there will always be a market for the new monument builds. The streamers kind of cannibalized the theatrical market with the promise of a lot of money to attract top filmmakers and top casts, and then that money has all retrenched back. The budgets aren\u2019t there. Everything is starting to look like it\u2019s driving toward a mediocrity. Everything starts to look to me like a typical network procedural, or at least that could be an end point within just a couple years.",
      "Unfortunately, the economics of streaming expanded rapidly and then contracted rapidly. Now, we\u2019re betwixt and between models. It\u2019s cannibalized theatrical and, at the same time, it\u2019s not delivering the budgets to do the kind of imaginative, phantasmagorical filmmaking.",
      "CAMERON: The \u201cAvatar\u201d films, and certainly the new one \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d do exactly the same thing. In a way, they cast us in a good light. The humans in the story are the bad guys. But really what it\u2019s saying is that the attributes we value \u2014 our interpersonal and intercommunity connections, our spirituality, our empathy \u2014 in the movies they reside in the Na\u2019vi. But of course we as the audience take the Na\u2019vi\u2019s side. So they seem a kind of aspirational, better version of us. In a sense, it\u2019s still empowering and reinforcing certain values and ethics and morals.",
      "Now, it\u2019s a little more challenging in movie three because we show Na\u2019vi who have kind of fallen from grace and are adversarial with other Na\u2019vi. I think one of the reasons \u201cAvatar\u201d has been successful in all markets around the world is because everybody is in a family or wishes they were in a family. They have their ties. They have their tribes. They have their connections. And that\u2019s what these films are about. What would you risk everything for?",
      "CAMERON: \u201cGhosts of Hiroshima\u201d is about testing our empathy boundaries. Somebody needed to be empathetic to the fact that a nuclear weapon was going to be used against human beings. And I don\u2019t want to go down the rabbit hole of should the bombs have been dropped, who was right, who was wrong. But I do want to remind people of what these weapons are capable of doing against targets. It\u2019s unfathomable.",
      "There were three bombs in 1945. One was used as a test and two against people. There are now 12,000 and they range in power from 100 to over 200 times the energy that was generated at either one of those two bombings. We\u2019re in a very precarious world right now. And because of all the geopolitical challenges internationally \u2014 more nuclear powers, more saber rattling, unaccountable leadership in Russia and America right now \u2014 I think we\u2019re in as precarious a situation as we were in the Cuban missile crisis era.",

      "The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry condemned Woody Allen for speaking at a Russian film festival, calling his participation in the event \u201ca disgrace and an insult\u201d to the victims of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine",
      "The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry on Monday condemned Woody Allen for speaking virtually at a Russian film festival over the weekend, calling his participation in the event \u201ca disgrace and an insult\u201d to the victims of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "According to Russian media, Allen spoke Sunday at the Moscow International Film Week via video conference. The appearance put him at odds with the Hollywood establishment, which has embraced the Ukraine cause during Russia's 3 1/2-year war, with prominent actors signing on to the United24 crowdfunding initiative and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy making virtual appearances at past Golden Globes and Grammys ceremonies.",
      "Footage aired by Russian state TV showed the filmmaker addressing a tightly packed movie theater from a massive screen, with pro-Kremlin film director Fyodor Bondarchuk moderating the session. Russian media reports quoted Allen as saying that he has always liked Russian cinema, recounting his past trips to Russia and the Soviet Union, and talking about what he would do if he were to receive a proposal to direct a movie in the country.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Ministry in an online statement on Monday said that it \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d Allen\u2019s participation in the festival, which \u201cbrings together supporters and mouthpieces of Putin.\u201d The ministry called it \u201ca disgrace and an insult to the victims among Ukrainian actors and filmmakers who have been killed or wounded by Russian war criminals,\u201d adding that Allen \u201cis deliberately turning a blind eye to the atrocities that Russia has been committing in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press on Monday, Allen criticized Putin and denounced the invasion but called for cultural exchange to continue.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to the conflict in Ukraine, I believe strongly that Vladimir Putin is totally in the wrong. The war he has caused is appalling,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut, whatever politicians have done, I don\u2019t feel cutting off artistic conversations is ever a good way to help.\u201d",
      "The website of the festival, which runs through Wednesday, billed Allen as one of its headliners, along with Serbian film director Emir Kusturica and American actor Mark Dacascos. Moscow International Film Week is a relatively new festival, first held in the Russian capital in August 2024. It is separate from the decades-old Moscow International Film Festival, which in 2022 was stripped of its International Federation of Film Producers Associations accreditation following the invasion of Ukraine.",

      "Operations at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are in jeopardy after the ousting of the CDC director and the resignation of several high-profile agency leaders",
      "The firing of the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the resignation of several high-profile agency leaders pose immediate challenges to the operations of the nation's premiere public health agency, experts said.",
      "It could take \u201cseveral months\u201d to identify and confirm a replacement for CDC Director Susan Monarez, who was terminated Wednesday after less than a month on the job, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, director of the American Public Health Association. And it could take more time to fill at least four key vacated positions that oversee disease outbreaks, vaccines and public health data.",
      "\u201cThe whole chain of command has just been disrupted,\u201d Benjamin told The Associated Press. \u201cIt's like getting rid of your generals in the middle of a war.\u201d",
      "Health experts said Americans could see immediate effects, from confusion over the availability of COVID-19 vaccines to delayed responses to outbreaks of infectious diseases such as measles or foodborne illnesses caused by germs such as E. coli or listeria.",
      "\u201cThe average American should worry about their safety and their health and whether information coming out of Health and Human Services is reliable or trustworthy,\u201d said Dr. Anne Schuchat, former principal deputy director of the CDC, who left the agency in 2021.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the sudden changes at the CDC.",
      "The White House ousted Monarez on Wednesday after apparent clashes between the CDC director and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over changes to the nation's vaccine policy.",
      "Officials at the White House said Monarez was dismissed because she was not aligned with President Donald Trump's agenda and refused to resign.",
      "That action coincided with the resignation this week of at least four top CDC agency leaders: Dr. Debra Houry, the agency\u2019s deputy director; Dr. Daniel Jernigan, leader of the agency\u2019s work on emerging infectious diseases; Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a top vaccine official; and Dr. Jennifer Layden, who led public health data efforts.",
      "Monarez was the first CDC director to require Senate confirmation under a law that took effect in 2023. Replacing her would require Trump to nominate a new director, who would then need to be considered and confirmed by the Senate. On Thursday, Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy said the high-profile departures will \u201crequire oversight\u201d of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which he chairs.",
      "In the meantime, the president could name an acting CDC director, Benjamin noted.",
      "Replacing the leaders in the other positions, including those who held the jobs for years, will be difficult, Schuchat said.",
      "\u201cThe four people who resigned led important parts of the agency and had the respect of the nation and the world,\u201d she said.",

      "In an appearance on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Kennedy declined to directly comment on the CDC shake-up. But he said he is concerned about CDC officials adhering to the administration's view of health policies.",
      "\u201cSo we need to look at the priorities of the agency, if there\u2019s really a deeply, deeply embedded, I would say, malaise at the agency,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cAnd we need strong leadership that will go in there and that will be able to execute on President Trump\u2019s broad ambitions.\u201d",
      "The clash at CDC was apparently triggered by conflict over changes in policy regarding recommendations for COVID-19 vaccinations that could make getting a shot more complicated for people.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration approved updated COVID-19 shots on Wednesday but limited their use for many Americans \u2014 and removed one of the two vaccines available for young children. The new jabs from three manufacturers are approved for all seniors, but the FDA narrowed their use for adults and children to those with high-risk health conditions, such as asthma or obesity.",
      "The FDA approval is typically reviewed by a CDC vaccine advisory committee, which makes recommendations for use. Monarez said she would not automatically sign off on recommendations of the committee, which was handpicked by Kennedy, according to Dr. Richard Besser, a former CDC acting director. (Besser is now president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which helps support The Associated Press Health and Science Department.)",
      "The changes present new barriers to access for millions of Americans, who would have to prove their risk, and others who may want the shots but suddenly no longer qualify. The vaccines were previously recommended for Americans 6 months and older.",
      "\u201cThese decisions, made without supporting evidence, reflect a troubling pattern by HHS of interfering in the relationship between patients and their healthcare providers and limiting access to vaccines \u2014 public health tools proven to save lives and reduce costs,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher.",
      "In addition, the disruption at the CDC could jeopardize many local health services undergirded by the agency's support and expertise, Schuchat noted. That could mean tracking a simmering infectious disease outbreak, such as measles, or outbreaks of foodborne illness.",
      "\u201cIt's the water that you drink, the lead in your pipes. Look around your community,\" she said. \u201cIf people are doing well and healthy, it's probably partly because of the CDC.\u201d",

      "Federal prosecutors say the man who allegedly killed the UnitedHealthcare chief executive last December has inspired followers, such as the man who killed four people at a the National Football League headquarters last month",
      "NEW YORK -- Prosecutors say Luigi Mangione, accused of killing the CEO of UnitedHealthcare on a Manhattan sidewalk, has inspired others to embrace violence over reasoned debate.",
      "As evidence of Mangione's growing influence, prosecutors cited the last month's deadly mass shooting at the National Football League headquarters.",
      "The prosecution outlined the threat in a filing late Wednesday on a procedural matter in federal court in Manhattan, where they plan to try to convince a jury that Mangione deserves death. No federal trial date has been set.",
      "Mangione, who pleaded not guilty to state and federal charges, was arrested five days after the Dec. 4 killing of CEO Brian Thompson. He is being held without bail in a federal jail in Brooklyn.",
      "U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced in April that she was directing federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty for \u201can act of political violence\u201d and a \u201cpremeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.\u201d",
      "In their filing Wednesday, prosecutors wrote that Mangione poses a continuing danger in part because he seeks to influence others.",
      "\u201cSimply put, the defendant hoped to normalize the use of violence to achieve ideological or political objectives,\u201d they said. \u201cSince the murder, certain quarters of the public \u2014 who openly identify as acolytes of the defendant \u2014 have increasingly begun to view violence as an acceptable, or even necessary, substitute for reasoned political disagreement.\u201d",
      "In a footnote, prosecutors referenced the gunman who went into an office building not far from where Thompson was shot in midtown Manhattan, then killed four people including an off-duty police officer, a financial services firm executive and a security guard, and wounded others, including an NFL employee.",

      "Under the change, which began in July, health departments in 10 states that participate in the joint state and federal program will be required to monitor only foodborne infections caused by salmonella and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli bacteria. Those are among the top contributors to foodborne illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S., the CDC said.",
      "Previously, the FoodNet system required surveillance of infections confirmed to be caused by six other germs as well: campylobacter, cyclospora, listeria, shigella, vibrio and Yersinia. That is now optional.",
      "Narrowing the reporting requirements \u201cwill allow FoodNet staff to prioritize core activities,\u201d CDC spokesman Paul Prince said in a statement.

      "\u201cLong term, it will affect our ability to use surveillance data to better understand risks in the food supply,\u201d said Carlota Medus, who supervises the Minnesota Department of Health's foodborne diseases unit.",
      "Foodborne infections caused by specific germs are required to be reported to the CDC or to state health departments. But relying on passive reports of infections rather than actively seeking out laboratory data, hospital details and other information can mean that some cases are missed, Medus said.",

      "Millions of Venezuelans are struggling to buy food as the economy unravels",
      "CORO, Venezuela -- Alnilys Chirino\u2019s tiny fridge and pantry are almost empty \u2014 a handful of peppers and wilting herbs, a kilo of rice, half that of beans, a bit of canned meat, some flour. Chirino used to worry about food spoiling quickly under western Venezuela's punishing heat. These days, her meager supplies rarely last long enough to go bad.",
      "Still, the 51-year-old must make those items stretch for days. Her three teenagers are counting on it. They sleep, study, work, pray, and play hungry. So do millions of Venezuelans across the country.",
      "The latest unraveling of Venezuela\u2019s economy, changes to foreign aid, sanctions from the United States, and cuts to state subsidies and programs have made many necessities simply unaffordable to the 80% of residents estimated to live in poverty. Housing, medicine, utilities \u2013 but no need is as dire as food.",
      "In the western state of Falcon, where state-owned oil refineries offered plenty of well-paying jobs before the country came undone in 2013, more than two dozen residents, including Chirino, described to The Associated Press how their woes center on food and how they dwell on the issue \u2014 how to buy it, how much and where \u2013 every day.",
      "Experts say that while a famine-level crisis is not imminent in Venezuela, the severe food insecurity is a disaster that will mark the population with lifelong physical and mental health challenges.",
      "President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro \u2014 sworn in this year despite credible evidence he lost reelection \u2014 has created economic conditions that largely limited people's access to food nationwide, with the value of wages plummeting. Soup kitchens that fed thousands, mostly children, have been forced to close as he targets real and perceived opponents through a new law restricting the work of nongovernmental organizations.",
      "The government's press office didn't respond to a message seeking comment on food insecurity amid the economic crisis.",
      "Parents, educators, doctors, humanitarian workers and religious leaders say food is simply out of reach to many, with children suffering the most. They go to bed early to avoid hunger pangs, skip school and snatch food from each other at aid sites.",
      "Chirino's family is among those who increasingly fear the return of the malnutrition and starvation that gripped the country from 2016 to 2018. She worries constantly for her teenagers: Juan, Jos\u00e9 and Angerlis Colina.",
      "\u201cThey ask me, \u2018What are we going to do tomorrow?'\" Chirino said. \"'What are we going to eat?\u2019\u201d",
      "For the Chirinos and millions of Venezuelans, each mealtime of each day is a struggle.",
      "Juan Colina takes three rolls of bread \u2014 the only food he'll have for breakfast on this summer day \u2014 and dunks them in a sugary, orange-flavored drink. It was something of a treat. Money has lost so much value in the last few months that the family typically drinks only tap water and rarely eats protein.",
      "They've grown used to it. Juan felt fortunate to wake without a headache. Jos\u00e9 wasn't so lucky and stayed in bed.",
      "They often skip school when feeling this way. The law guarantees all students a daily free lunch, but that hasn't happened for ages, families and teachers across Venezuela told AP.",
      "As the meals stopped and the quality of education fell, students began regularly missing school over the last decade, a trend documented by local and international nongovernmental organizations.",
      "Health care experts say animal protein is the first thing families reduce or eliminate from their diet when prices increase, and they tend to substitute cheaper, less nutritious foods. But poor nutrition can lead to stunting, headaches, fatigue and other health issues in children.",
      "Chirino knows that all too well.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s their diet,\u201d she said of her kids' headaches.",
      "But the last time she could afford to purchase meat \u2014 enough ground beef for perhaps two servings \u2014 was May.",
      "At lunchtime, Jos\u00e9 stayed in his room, his head pounding. Angerlis joined her mother and Juan at the table for lunch before heading to school.",
      "Chirino cooked a pot of rice and another of black beans, both of which her mother had gifted her the day before, when the pantry was essentially bare. Chirino, Angerlis and Juan ate a bowl each. Juan chuckled when Angerlis took bites so fast she burned her tongue.",
      "Days earlier, Angerlis said, a classmate who hadn't eaten fainted at school. But even knowing there would be no food on campus, she grabbed her bag and headed off.",
      "Teachers and administrators across the country are renewing pleas for parents to keep children home if they've not had at least one meal and if they have no food to bring to eat during breaks. But not all abide by the request, and students cannot always hide their hunger from classmates and others.",

But teachers, cooks and administrators say what they receive is inconsistent and insufficient.",
      "And with little to eat at home, on the occasions when the scent of food wafts through school buildings, more students are asking for seconds.",
      "\u201cThere are some who, my goodness, they repeat two or three times. There are kids who eat a lot,\u201d Deyanira Santos, a cook at a 170-student school that hadn't received supplies in three weeks. \u201cThey have needs at home. ... \u2018I have already eaten. Can you give me one to go?\u2019 We put it in a container.\u201d",
      "At home, Chirino sorted through the clothing, accessories and linens she sells to neighbors and acquaintances. Her only income sources are the $70 a month she earns from her sales and a monthly government stipend of about $4. She spends it all on food.",
      "The weakening of the bolivar is the driver of Venezuela's currency crisis. When a currency quickly loses significant value, people\u2019s money buys less because prices \u2014 particularly of imported goods, like roughly half of Venezuela\u2019s food \u2013 constantly rise to match the exchange rate. It also has meant high inflation and stagnant wages.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s monthly minimum wage of 130 bolivars, or $0.90, has not increased since 2022, putting it well below the United Nations\u2019 measure of extreme poverty of $2.15 a day. Even with government stipends, many public sector workers survive on roughly $160 per month, while the average private sector employee earns about $237, according to the independent Venezuelan Observatory of Finances.",
      "The price of a basic basket of food has topped $500, according to the Observatory, an organization of economists \u2014 some of whom were detained this summer after high inflation data was published, as the government cracks down on dissent.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s becoming more difficult every day for people to access food of a certain quality,\u201d said the Rev. Gilberto Garc\u00eda, whose Catholic church runs a soup kitchen. \u201cPeople eat, but they usually eat carbohydrates. And that\u2019s how people survive.\u201d",
      "Chirino warmed canned meat and served it with rice for dinner. Her adult daughter and toddler grandson joined them \u2014 more mouths to feed, but they were grateful to have even a small meal on the table.",
      "About a block away, people lined up outside the neighborhood convenience store.",
      "Chirino is among the many Venezuelans who say they're buying food almost exclusively at corner stores, where they can run up an account and walk over one, two, even three times a day. City residents also buy from public markets, but grocery store trips are rare.",
      "\u201cWe give credit to the neighbors who do pay back when they receive their paycheck or stipend,\u201d Diego Reverol, whose family owns a corner store, said, referring to a stipend state employees receive on the 15th of the month.",
      "Other government stipends are available to those who sign up for the ruling party-run subsidy program, but they're significantly smaller than those of state employees. The program also offers families the option to purchase a combination of food \u2013 the same as what's distributed to schools \u2013 monthly. However, most of the two dozen people in Falcon who spoke to AP said they'd not received the food since the spring.",
      "Yamelis Ruiz said her family's challenges are compounded by the loss of critical help from the World Food Program, which distributed food, refurbished school cafeterias and served meals after reaching an agreement with Maduro\u2019s government in 2021 to support the most vulnerable. WFP prioritized Falcon, with its massive sand dunes and mountain ranges that reach the Caribbean Sea, due to the population's particular problems with food insecurity.",
      "But citing funding challenges, the WFP this year has deeply cut its aid in Venezuela \u2014 Falcon included \u2014 and beyond. Ruiz said she had already stopped receiving monthly shelf-stable food rations from WFP when the organization further reduced the number of days it would feed kids and families at schools, to eight from 20.",
      "\u201cFood or medicines. Either I buy one thing or the other,\u201d said Ruiz, whose daughter has a congenital brain condition that requires costly treatment.",
      "Even as local and international nonprofits have been forced to shut down assistance efforts in Venezuela, Chirino's church still offers a weekly lunch at its soup kitchen.",
      "Chirino, a devout Catholic, feels blessed. She often attends Mass with her family before the meal, but on this day Juan felt too fatigued to make the service.",
      "The extent of hunger across the country is somewhat unknown. Dr. Huniades Urbina, a pediatrician and former director of Venezuela\u2019s largest public children\u2019s hospital, said that's in part because government-run hospitals have banned personnel from including malnutrition in patients\u2019 medical histories.",
      "Chirino sees that hunger every week in the faces of those lining up for food. Juan managed to get out of bed and to church just in time for this meal: an arepa stuffed with ground beef and plantains.",
      "More than 70 children sat, their chatty voices dwindling as they ate. Finishing in record time, dozens swarmed the counter where the volunteer cooks were ready to hand out leftovers. Some pushed; others raised their arms or stood on their tiptoes.",

      "One boy hadn't bitten his yet when he noticed an empty-handed friend. Without hesitation, he split it in half. The boys shared, each done eating in less than a minute, and left.",
      "Chirino had refused to take an arepa. She didn't want to keep one from a hungry kid. But when most of the children were gone, a cook handed her one. She began eating alone, and soon Jos\u00e9 joined her. He reached for her plate, grabbing half the arepa and taking a few bites.",
      "Her son, too, was still hungry.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration has approved updated COVID-19 vaccines for the upcoming fall and winter season",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. regulators approved updated COVID-19 shots Wednesday but limited their use for many Americans \u2014 and removed one of the two vaccines available for young children.",
      "The new shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax are approved for all seniors. But the Food and Drug Administration narrowed their use for younger adults and children to those with at least one high-risk health condition, such as asthma or obesity. That presents new barriers to access for millions of Americans who\u2019d have to prove their risk -- and millions more who may want to get vaccinated and suddenly no longer qualify.",
      "Additionally, Pfizer\u2019s vaccine will no longer be available for any child underage 5, after the FDA said it was revoking the shot\u2019s emergency authorization for that age group.",
      "Parents will still be able to seek out shots from rival drugmaker Moderna, the other maker of mRNA vaccines, which has full FDA approval for children as young as 6 months. But the company\u2019s Spikevax vaccine is only approved for children with at least one serious health problem.",
      "The revamped vaccines target a newer version of the continuously evolving virus and are set to begin shipping immediately. But it could be days or weeks before many Americans know if they\u2019ll be able to get one, with access dependent on various decisions by federal health advisers, private health insurers, pharmacies and state authorities.",
      "The new restrictions \u2014 previewed by FDA officials in May \u2014 are a break from the previous U.S. policy, which recommended an annual COVID-19 shot for all Americans 6 months and up.",
      "The approach reflects heightened skepticism about the ongoing risks of COVID-19 and the need for yearly booster shots from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, who were both outspoken critics of wide-scale vaccinations.",
      "\u201cThe American people demanded science, safety, and common sense. This framework delivers all three,\u201d Kennedy wrote on social media.",
      "Kenned said Novavax's shot is only open to people 12 or older, not younger children \u2013 and under the same risk-based restrictions as are now in place for the Moderna and Pfizer options. It's the nation's only protein-based COVID-19 vaccine.",
      "Some medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, have objected to the new limits, saying they may block vaccine access for families who want to protect their children. Last week, the group offered its own recommendations for kids, saying annual COVID shots are strongly recommended for children ages 6 months to 2 years and advised for older children.",
      "That differs from the latest guidance under Kennedy, which doesn\u2019t recommend the shots for healthy children of any age, but says kids may get the shots in consultation with physicians.",
      "Many countries have scaled back COVID-19 vaccinations in recent years, and some U.S. experts say the change makes sense here, given that nearly all Americans have some protection from previous vaccination or infection.",
      "But implementing the shift presents a number of logistical problems.",
      "Insurers typically base their vaccine coverage decisions on the recommendations of a panel of advisers to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but some say they will also look to medical professional groups, including the American Medical Association.",
      "Earlier this year, Kennedy dissolved the CDC panel and replaced its members with a number of doctors and researchers who have repeatedly questioned the safety of commonly used vaccines and ingredients. The panel is expected to meet in September, but no specific date has been set and no agenda released.",
      "Depending on the panel\u2019s advice, Americans underage 65 could be expected to provide documentation of a serious medical condition before they can get a shot. Complicating the rollout is the fact that pharmacists \u2014 who administer most COVID vaccines in the U.S. \u2014 typically aren\u2019t expected to collect that kind of information. And laws governing their ability to administer routine vaccinations vary by state, where pharmacists are licensed.",

      "Access could also be complicated for healthy adults and children who are interested in getting a shot for extra protection.",
      "If the latest vaccines aren\u2019t covered by their insurance, those patients could be required to pay $150 or more out of pocket if they want one. They might also have to find a doctor or other health professional willing to give the shot \u201coff label,\u201d or outside the use listed on the FDA label. Pharmacists may be reluctant to give vaccines off-label.",
      "The updated shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax target a coronavirus subtype named LP. 8.1, a recently dominant version of the virus that is closely related to some newly emerging cousins.",
      "All three shots were initially made available under the FDA\u2019s emergency use authorization, an expedited process to quickly review vaccines and other countermeasures during the pandemic.",
      "Moderna received full FDA approval in July for children down to 6 months and says it should have enough supply to meet U.S. demand.",
      "In addition to revoking emergency use of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, the FDA also pulled authorization for several other therapies from the pandemic years, including convalescent plasma, which was used to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients before the first antiviral drugs became available.",
      "COVID-19 vaccines do a good job preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death, which remain a bigger risk for seniors and people with underlying health factors, including heart disease, lung disease and cancer.",
      "Preliminary data from the CDC estimates 47,500 Americans died from COVID-related causes last year. In at least two-thirds of those cases, COVID-19 was listed as the underlying cause of death. For the rest, COVID-19 was a contributing factor.",

      "Crossing paths with dogs, cats and other animals is part of campus life for students at Eckerd College, a liberal arts school in Florida that allows pets to live in dormitories.",
      "Sophie Nocera, an Eckerd senior, said she probably knows the names of pets better than her fellow students.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the case for a lot of the students,\" said Nocera, who lives on the campus in St. Petersburg with her Border collie, Zuko. \"When I'm walking my dog, I often hear, \u2018Oh my god, hi, Zuko!\u2019 It's like I\u2019m not even there.\"",
      "Some colleges and universities around the country welcome pets in campus residences, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to Stephens College in Missouri.",
      "For students, the companionship can help reduce stress, anxiety and homesickness. The colleges also see benefits for student engagement and helping them build connections with one another.",
      "Federal law requires public and private colleges to allow service animals and emotional support animals in student housing. But growing numbers of schools are allowing pets, with various restrictions.",
      "MIT allows only cats, in limited numbers and in preapproved spaces. At Eckerd, students can bring their family pets to live with them on campus after their first semester. The college requires pets to have been part of students\u2019 home life at least six months before coming to campus and must not be venomous or aggressive.",
      "At the University of Northern Colorado, students in three of the more than dozen residence halls on campus are allowed to have dogs and cats. The animals must be at least 6 months old and no more than 40 pounds (18 kilograms). Students are limited to one pet. This fall, the school will have the most registered pets on campus since it began allowing them over a decade ago, said Jediah Cummins, executive director of housing.",
      "\u201cOne of the markers of adulthood is, \u2018Can I not just take care of myself, but can I take care of another living being?\u2019 That\u2019s an important part of this,\u201d Cummins said.",

      "Nocera said Zuko has helped her meet other people on campus, as well as emotionally, when she struggled with a decision to change her major.",

And I remember thinking, whatever happens tomorrow, I\u2019m going to wake up, and I\u2019m going to take him to the dog park. And, we\u2019re going to go play fetch regardless of what my major is,\" said Nocera, who is the staff director of Pet Life, a student-led department on campus tasked with administering the pet policy.",
      "At Washington & Jefferson College in Pennsylvania, Eva Chatterjee-Sutton saw the difference a pet can make when a first-year student was struggling to make connections before her mother suggested a puppy. After the dog's arrival, the student became more involved in campus life, said Chatterjee-Sutton, vice president of student life.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely changed her college trajectory and her connection with others on campus,\u201d Chatterjee-Sutton said.",
      "Pet-friendly dorms require colleges to consider things like safety concerns, noise complaints, how to avoid agitating animals during fire alarm tests, as well as additional costs for cleaning, Layden said. Some schools charge a pet fee, which varies by school, type of pet and is often included in housing expenses. For example, at Stephens College, the annual fee for a dog or cat is $220, for a cage- or aquarium-dwelling pet is $50 and free for fish. Others require students to have liability insurance and roommate agreements. Pets are required to be restrained when in public, and most colleges require students to ensure their pets are healthy and vaccinated.",
      "Eckerd and other colleges recognize pets' role in their students' lives at graduation ceremonies, allowing them to cross the commencement stage together in some cases.",
      "\u201cHaving pets obviously isn\u2019t for everyone, and that is totally OK,\u201d Nocera said. \u201cBut for the people that it is a good fit for, it is so worth it. This upcoming year, I'll be graduating, and Zuko will be in his little pet graduation ceremony, walking across the stage with me.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will make a rare trip abroad next week to attend a military parade in the Chinese capital, North Korean and Chinese state media said Thursday",
      "BEIJING -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will make his first visit to China in six years to attend a military parade next week, the two countries said Thursday, in an event that would bring him together with a large group of world leaders for the first time since taking office in late 2011.",
      "With Russian President Vladimir Putin also coming for the parade, the event will underline the three-way alignment among Beijing, Moscow and Pyongyang in the face of a U.S. push to bolster its alliances with South Korea and Japan.",
      "North Korea\u2019s state media said Kim was invited to visit China by President Xi Jinping.  Kim will be among 26 foreign leaders who attend next Wednesday\u2019s parade in Beijing to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II and China\u2019s resistance against Japan\u2019s wartime aggressions, China's foreign ministry said.",
      "\u201cWe warmly welcome General Secretary Kim Jong Un to China to attend the commemorative events,\u201d Hong Lei, China\u2019s assistant minister of foreign affairs, told a press conference. \u201cUpholding, consolidating and developing the traditional friendship between China and the DPRK is a firm position of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government.\u201d",
      "DPRK refers to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, North Korea\u2019s official name.",
      "Since inheriting power upon his father\u2019s death in December 2011, Kim has met Xi, Putin, U.S. President Donald Trump, former South Korean President Moon Jae-in and others. But all those summits were bilateral meetings and Kim hasn\u2019t attended any big multilateral events with foreign leaders.",
      "\u201cGiven that other leaders attending are mostly from pro-Russia and pro-Chinese countries, Kim likely intends to form solidarity with those Global South countries while showing he\u2019s leader of a normal country,\" said Moon Seong Mook, an analyst for the Seoul-based Korea Research Institute for National Strategy.",
      "Observers say Kim is likely emboldened by his country's expanding cooperation with Russia, which has helped him bear the brunt of U.S.-led sanctions and break out of diplomatic isolation. North Korea has been supplying troops and ammunition to support Russia's war against Ukraine in return for economic and military assistance.",
      "Others coming for the parade include the leaders of Iran, Belarus, Serbia, Cuba, Indonesia, Myanmar, Pakistan and Malaysia. No leaders from major Western countries including the U.S. are expected to attend, in part because of their differences with Putin over the war in Ukraine. The parade is expected to feature some of China\u2019s newest weaponry and a speech by Xi.",
      "China, North Korea and Russia are embroiled in separate confrontations with the U.S., but they haven't formed a clear three-way alliance so far.",
      "Xi, Putin and Kim haven't met in trilateral formats, though they've met one another bilaterally.",
      "\u201cKim\u2019s attendance is significant for his own international stature, but it also holds weight in the balance of alliances between the U.S. and China,\u201d said Soo Kim, a former CIA analyst. \u201cXi, Putin, and now Kim attending the parade cements a visible statement about the alignment between the three countries.\u201d",
      "The three leaders likely share desires to check the strengthening cooperation among the U.S., South Korea and Japan, which have been meeting regularly and expanding trilateral military exercises. Despite their shared goals, it\u2019s not clear how far China, North Korea and Russia will go to further cement ties.",
      "China remains the largest purchaser of Russian oil and technology provider supporting the Russian war machine, though it is officially neutral in the conflict.",

      "Kim\u2019s visit to China could also be related to efforts to restart diplomacy with Trump, who has repeatedly highlighted his relationship with Kim and expressed his hopes to resume talks.",
      "In all, Kim traveled to China four times from 2018 to 2019 to meet Xi. His first and fourth visits happened just before he met Trump for their earlier high-stakes nuclear negotiations.",
      "\u201cPyongyang\u2019s illicit cooperation with Moscow has strained ties with Beijing, even as China\u2019s political and economic support remains vital for the North Korean regime,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.",
      "\u201cTo reengage Trump from a position of strength, Kim seeks to repair relations with Xi, and attending the parade in Beijing is a highly visible way of doing that,\u201d Easley said.",
      "During a meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung in Washington earlier this week, Trump spoke of one of his past summits with Kim at the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Responding to a question over whether he would return to the Demilitarized Zone, Trump told reporters, \u201cI loved it. Remember when I walked across the line and everyone went crazy.\u201d",
      "North Korea has so far dismissed Trump\u2019s outreach, but many analysts say it would return to talks if it determines the U.S. would make bigger concessions.",
      "While Kim's foreign policy priority is Russia now, many observers expect him to take steps to improve ties with China. It's unclear if North Korea and Russia would maintain the same level of cooperation after Ukraine war ends.",
      "In 2023, about 97% of North Korea\u2019s external trade was with China, while 1.2% was with Russia, according to Chinese data.",
      "Cheong Seong-Chang, deputy head of private Sejong Institute in South Korea, said Kim likely decided to go to China to ask for assistance as North Korea needs resources for lavish celebrations of two domestic events \u2014 the 80th anniversary of the ruling Workers' Party in October and a party congress early next year.",

      "ATHENS, Greece -- Climate change that has driven scorching temperatures and dwindling rainfall made massive wildfires in Turkey, Greece and Cyprus this summer burn much more fiercely, said a new study released Thursday.",
      "The study by World Weather Attribution said the fires that killed 20 people, forced 80,000 to evacuate and burned more than 1 million hectares (2.47 million acres) were 22% more intense in 2025, Europe\u2019s worst recorded year of wildfires.",
      "Hundreds of wildfires that broke out in the eastern Mediterranean in June and July were driven by temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (about 104 Fahrenheit), extremely dry conditions and strong winds.",
      "WWA, a group of researchers that examines whether and to what extent extreme weather events are linked to climate change, called its findings \u201cconcerning.\"",
      "\u201cOur study finds an extremely strong climate change signal towards hotter and drier conditions,\u201d said Theodore Keeping, a researcher at Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College in London.",
      "\u201cToday, with 1.3 degrees C of warming, we are seeing new extremes in wildfire behaviour that has pushed firefighters to their limit. But we are heading for up to 3 degrees C this century unless countries more rapidly transition away from fossil fuels,\u201d Keeping said.",
      "The study found winter rainfall ahead of the wildfires had dropped by about 14% since the pre-industrial era, when a heavy reliance on fossil fuels began. It also determined that because of climate change, weeklong periods of dry, hot air that primes vegetation to burn are now 13 times more likely.",

      "The final arguments have concluded in the national security trial of Hong Kong pro-democracy newspaper founder Jimmy Lai",
      "HONG KONG -- HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 Final arguments concluded Thursday in the landmark national security trial of Hong Kong pro-democracy newspaper founder Jimmy Lai, who could face up to a life sentence if convicted.",
      "Lai founded the now-defunct Apple Daily, which had been one of the local news outlets most critical of the government. He was arrested in 2020 under a national security law imposed by Beijing following widespread anti-government protests in the territory in 2019.",
      "Lai is charged with colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security and conspiring with others to issue seditious publications. His trial has stretched nearly 160 days, almost double the original estimate. The verdict date is unclear but is expected to be delivered in weeks or months. He could face a sentence ranging from three years in prison to a life term if he is convicted.",
      "His case has drawn international attention as a test of press freedom and judicial independence in the Asian financial hub.",
      "Over the past week, defense lawyer Robert Pang repeatedly butted heads with judges when he tried to argue that his client\u2019s comments made online were just armchair punditry, pushing back against the prosecution\u2019s notion that he was requesting sanctions, blockages or hostile activities against China or Hong Kong.",
      "Last Friday, Esther Toh, one of the judges approved by the government to handle the case, challenged Pang\u2019s arguments about freedom of expression. She said that right has its limits, and pointed to the arrests of people who expressed views about Palestinian issues in the U.S. and Britain.",
      "On Wednesday, lawyer Marc Corlett, who was also representing Lai, disputed the allegation that his client was conspiring with others, including those linked with an advocacy group called \u201cStand with Hong Kong Fight for Freedom,\u201d to call for foreign actions.",
      "Corlett described one of the prosecution witnesses involved in the alleged conspiracy as \u201ca serial liar.\u201d Even if the court took his evidence seriously, it doesn\u2019t mean that Lai had entered into an ongoing agreement with others to work toward the alleged goal, he said.",
      "The prosecution accused Lai of asking foreign countries, especially the United States, to take actions against Beijing \u201cunder the guise of fighting for freedom and democracy.\u201d",
      "It said Lai continued to request foreign actions even after his arrest in August 2020, citing Lai\u2019s \u201cpersistent\u201d foreign collaborations as his \u201cunwavering intent\u201d to solicit foreign actions. It argued Lai\u2019s testimony was not credible and that he had used the Apple Daily to seek foreign sanctions, describing the acts as a betrayal of national interest and security.",
      "Lai, who is 77, has been in jail for about four years and eight months and has reported experiencing heart palpitations. Concerns over his health delayed the start of the final arguments this month. The government said a medical examination of Lai found no abnormalities and that the medical care he received in custody was adequate.",

      "Their efforts gained national prominence when activists earlier this summer denounced a Facebook page dubbed \u201cMia Moglie\u201d (My Wife), where men posted unauthorized photos of their spouses and succeeded in getting it taken down.",
      "Now, another more prolific site has emerged that exposes prominent women, including Premier Giorgia Meloni and other female politicians, to obscene and explicit comments. Some posts idealize violence against women.",
      "The site, which takes its name from slang for female genitalia, has been around for at least two decades. But it only drew national attention after a left-wing member of the European Parliament, Alessandra Moretti, formally lodged a complaint with police after finding her photo displayed without her permission.",
      "\u201cThey have been stealing photos and clips from TV shows I\u2019ve appeared on for years, then altering them and feeding them to thousands of users,\u201d Moretti said.",
      "Moretti said the site and others operate \u201cwith impunity\" even though previous complaints have been filed against them.",
      "\u201cThis type of site, which incites rape and violence, must be shut down and banned,'' she said.",
      "The forum displays unauthorized photos and videos of hundreds of public figures, along with unsuspecting actresses, influencers and ordinary women. The unauthorized images are often lifted from TV or social media profiles.",
      "It currently counts 200,000 users and displays pictures identified by names or certain themes. It includes a page dedicated to influencers and TV journalists, along with national and local politicians, such as the leader of the center-left Democratic Party Elly Schlein.",

      "Last week, thousands of visitors descended upon Kiruna to watch as the historic Kiruna Church moved 5 kilometers (3 miles) east as part of the town\u2019s relocation. The journey was necessary because the world\u2019s largest underground iron-ore mine is threatening to swallow the town.",

      "And because it's a swing state, presidential candidates often run through as well. John Kerry, the former U.S. senator from Massachusetts, is still mocked more than 20 years later for the unforgivable sin of ordering Swiss on his cheesesteak at Pat's during his unsuccessful 2004 run for president.",

The latter is an homage to the area\u2019s long tradition of reindeer herding by the Sami Indigenous people.",
      "The hardest part, Bohman said, was sourcing the famous hoagie roll \u2014 a big, soft bun that's everywhere in Philadelphia but nearly nowhere in Sweden. They now get them delivered once a week from the middle of the Nordic country.",

      "Each week, the business goes through 100 kilograms (220 pounds) of ground moose and 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of specialty smoked reindeer for about 500 cheesesteaks and 500 meat-and-fries orders.",

      "Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin did not cite a reason for the removal of General Nicolas Torre as head of the 232,000-member national police force, a position he was appointed to by Marcos in May and which he would have held until 2027.

      "President Donald Trump's administration last month awarded a $1.2 billion contract to build and operate what's expected to become the nation\u2019s largest immigration detention complex to a tiny Virginia firm with no experience running correction facilities",
      "WASHINGTON -- When President Donald Trump's administration last month awarded a contract worth up to $1.2 billion to build and operate what it says will become the nation\u2019s largest immigration detention complex, it didn\u2019t turn to a large government contractor or even a firm that specializes in private prisons.",
      "Instead, it handed the project on a military base to Acquisition Logistics LLC, a small business that has no listed experience running a correction facility and had never won a federal contract worth more than $16 million. The company also lacks a functioning website and lists as its address a modest home in suburban Virginia owned by a 77-year-old retired Navy flight officer.",
      "The mystery over the award only deepened last week as the new facility began to accept its first detainees. The Pentagon has refused to release the contract or explain why it selected Acquisition Logistics over a dozen other bidders to build the massive tent camp at Fort Bliss in west Texas. At least one competitor has filed a complaint.",
      "The secretive \u2014 and brisk \u2014 contracting process is emblematic, experts said, of the government\u2019s broader rush to fulfill the Republican president's pledge to arrest and deport an estimated 10 million migrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal status. As part of that push, the government is turning increasingly to the military to handle tasks that had traditionally been left to civilian agencies.",
      "A member of Congress who recently toured the camp said she was concerned that such a small and inexperienced firm had been entrusted to build and run a facility expected to house up to 5,000 migrants.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s far too easy for standards to slip,\u201d said Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes Fort Bliss. \u201cPrivate facilities far too frequently operate with a profit margin in mind as opposed to a governmental facility.\u201d",
      "Attorney Joshua Schnell, who specializes in federal contracting law, said he was troubled that the Trump administration has provided so little information about the facility.",
      "\u201cThe lack of transparency about this contract leads to legitimate questions about why the Army would award such a large contract to a company without a website or any other publicly available information demonstrating its ability to perform such a complicated project,\u201d he said.",
      "Ken A. Wagner, the president and CEO of Acquisition Logistics, did not respond to phone messages or emails. No one answered the door at his three-bedroom house listed as his company\u2019s headquarters. Virginia records list Wagner as an owner of the business, though it's unclear whether he might have partners.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved using Fort Bliss for the new detention center, and the administration has hopes to build more at other bases. A spokesperson for the Army declined to discuss its deal with Acquisition Logistics or reveal details about the camp\u2019s construction, citing the litigation over the company\u2019s qualifications.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security, which includes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined to answer questions about the detention camp it oversees.",
      "Named Camp East Montana for the closest road, the facility is being built in the sand and scrub Chihuahuan Desert, where summertime temperatures can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit and heat-related deaths are common. The 60-acre (24-hectare) site is near the U.S.-Mexico border and the El Paso International Airport, a key hub for deportation flights.",
      "The camp has drawn comparisons to \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d a $245 million tent complex erected to hold ICE detainees in the Florida Everglades. That facility has been the subject of complaints about unsanitary conditions and lawsuits. A federal judge recently ordered that facility to be shut down.",
      "The vast majority of the roughly 57,000 migrants detained by ICE are housed at private prisons operated by companies like Florida\u2019s Geo Group and Tennessee-based CoreCivic. As those facilities fill up, ICE is also exploring temporary options at military bases in California, New York and Utah.",

      "Officials executed 14 search and seizure warrants and 14 preventive arrest warrants, resulting in five arrests, in what Justice Minister Ricardo Lewandowski said was one of the largest operations against organized crime in the country\u2019s history.",
      "Federal authorities did not name any specific individuals or companies targeted, citing sealed and ongoing investigations. However, state prosecutors in Sao Paulo, who contributed to the operation, said the scheme involved members of the First Capital Command crime syndicate, or PCC.",
      "Lewandowski said: \"This operation addresses how criminal organizations have infiltrated and appropriated parts of the fuel industry, and how this connects to the financial sector through money laundering schemes.\u201d",
      "Authorities identified 40 investment funds with a combined asset value of 30 billion reais (about $5.5 billion). These funds were allegedly used to shield assets for criminal organizations, holding properties such as a port terminal, four ethanol plants and about 1,000 gas stations across 10 Brazilian states. The fuel sector was chosen as a starting point by investigators into the criminal networks because it was the most visible one, they said.",
      "\u201cPeople know how it has worked, but it took a national effort to reach the heart of the problem and be able to confront it,\u201d Finance Minister Fernando Haddad told journalists.",
      "Andrea Chaves, deputy secretary for tax enforcement at the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service, said the investigation highlighted the \u201cextremely serious\u201d infiltration of organized crime into the real economy and financial markets.",
      "\u201cThis affects the entire supply chain \u2014 from fuel importation, production, distribution and commercialization,\u201d Chaves said. \u201cIn the financial sector, it involves asset concealment and shielding, in schemes similar to the hiding of shareholders in offshore tax havens. The Brazilian state cannot allow this to happen.\u201d",
      "Sao Paulo's State Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office said its investigation found that criminal organizations used adulterated fuel at more than 300 gas stations to launder illegal money through a complex network of intermediaries, including shell companies, investment funds and payment institutions.",
      "\u201cA significant portion of the unbacked funds was used to acquire ethanol plants and expand the group\u2019s criminal operations, which now include fuel distributors, transport companies and gas stations,\u201d prosecutors said.",
      "The fraud also involved irregular imports of methanol through the Port of Paranagua, in Parana state. The methanol was not delivered to the recipients listed on invoices but instead sent to gas stations and distributors, where it was used to adulterate fuel.",

If implemented, the measure would again freeze Iranian assets abroad, halt arms deals with Tehran and penalizes any development of its ballistic missile program, among other measures.",
      "In Tehran on Thursday, the rial traded at over 1 million to $1. At the time of the 2015 accord, it traded at 32,000 to $1, showing the currency's precipitous collapse in the time since. The rial hit its lowest point ever in April at 1,043,000 rials to $1.",
      "France, Germany and the United Kingdom warned Aug. 8 that Iran could trigger snapback when it halted inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency after Israeli strikes at the start of the two countries\u2019 12-day war in June. Israeli attacks then killed Tehran\u2019s top military leaders and saw Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei go into hiding.",
      "Iran threatened to abandon all cooperation with the IAEA if \u201csnapback\u201d moves forward.",
      "\u201cWe have told them if this happens, the pathway we have opened for working with the IAEA will be completely affected and the process will likely be stopped,\u201d Kazem Gharibabadi, a deputy foreign minister, told state television. \u201cIf they opt for snapback, it makes no sense for Iran to continue working with them.\u201d",
      "That means seeking to use the \u201csnapback\u201d mechanism likely will raise tensions further between Iran and the West in a Mideast still burning over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. and its European partners see invoking the \u2018snapback\u2019 as a means of keeping Iran strategically weak and unable to reconstitute the nuclear program damaged by the U.S. and Israeli strikes,\u201d the New York-based Soufan Center think tank said Thursday.",
      "\u201cIranian leaders perceive a sanctions snapback as a Western effort to weaken Iran\u2019s economy indefinitely and perhaps stimulate sufficient popular unrest to unseat Iran\u2019s regime.\u201d",
      "Iran initially downplayed the threat of renewed sanctions and engaged in little visible diplomacy for weeks after Europe\u2019s warning, but has engaged in a brief diplomatic push in recent days, highlighting the chaos gripping its theocracy.",
      "Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, speaking last week, signaled Iran\u2019s fatalistic view of its diplomacy with the West, particularly as the Israelis started the war just as a sixth round of negotiations with the United States were due to take place.",
      "\u201cWeren\u2019t we in the talks when the war happened? So, negotiation alone cannot prevent war,\u201d Araghchi told the state-run IRNA news agency. \u201cSometimes war is inevitable and diplomacy alone is not able to prevent it.\u201d",
      "Before the war in June, Iran was enriching uranium up to 60% purity, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. It also built a stockpile containing enough highly enriched uranium to build multiple atomic bombs, should it choose to do so.",
      "Iran long has insisted its program is peaceful, though Western nations and the IAEA assess Tehran had an active nuclear weapons program up until 2003.",
      "It remains unclear just how much the Israel and U.S. strikes on nuclear sites during the war disrupted Iran\u2019s program.",
      "Under the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to allow the IAEA even greater access to its nuclear program than those the agency has in other member nations. That included permanently installing cameras and sensors at nuclear sites. Other devices, known as online enrichment monitors, measured the uranium enrichment level at Iran\u2019s Natanz nuclear facility.",

      "But IAEA inspectors, who faced increasing restrictions on their activities since the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from Iran\u2019s nuclear deal in 2018, have yet to access those sites. Meanwhile, Iran has said it moved uranium and other equipment out prior to the strikes \u2014 possibly to new, undeclared sites that raise the risk that monitors could lose track of the program\u2019s status.",
      "On Wednesday, IAEA inspectors were on hand to watch a fuel replacement at Iran's Bushehr nuclear reactor, which is run with Russian technical assistance.",
      "In their Aug. 8 letter, the three European nations warned Iran they would proceed with \u201csnapback\u201d by the end of August if Tehran didn\u2019t reach a \u201csatisfactory solution\u201d to the nuclear issues. That's left little time for Iran to likely reach any agreement with the Europeans, who have grown increasingly skeptical of Iran over years of inconclusive negotiations over its nuclear program.",
      "The deal\u2019s snapback mechanism would expire Oct. 18, which put the three European nations in a situation where they likely feel now is the time to act. Under snapback, any party to the deal can find Iran in noncompliance, triggering renewed sanctions.",
      "After it expires, any sanctions effort would face a veto from U.N. Security Council members China and Russia, nations that have provided some support to Iran in the past but stayed out of the June war. China as well has remained a major buyer of Iranian crude oil, something that could be affected in \u201csnapback\u201d happens.",
      "Russia in recent days has floated a proposal to extend the life of the U.N. resolution granting the \u201csnapback\u201d power. Russia also is due to take the presidency of the U.N. Security Council in October, likely putting additional pressure on the Europeans to act.",

      "Cranberry growers around the country are gearing up to harvest the berries this fall ahead of Thanksgiving",
      "CARVER, Mass. -- This time of year, cranberry farmers across the country are getting ready to harvest the berries so they can be on Thanksgiving dinner plates.",
      "The king of cranberry states is Wisconsin, which long ago surpassed Massachusetts as the top producer, and bills itself as world's top producer of the berries that end up in sauce and juices. Most berries will be harvested between September and November.",
      "Massachusetts remains the second-biggest producer but has seen a growing number of farmers retiring their cranberry bogs \u2014 marshes that allow the fruit to grow on low-lying vines in beds layered with sand, peat, gravel and clay.",
      "When the cranberries are ready to be harvested, farmers flood their bogs with water and send out a picking machine to shake the berries from the vines. Then more water is added to the bog, and the freed cranberries float to the surface.",
      "Some Massachusetts farmers are choosing to restore bogs back to their native wetlands as the industry is being hit by lower prices for the pinkish crimson berries and the effects of climate change, which is bringing unpredictable weather like droughts and warmer fall conditions that delay the harvest.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know:",
      "Cranberry farming in Massachusetts dates back to the 1800s, when farmers replaced native wetlands with bogs often south of Boston and on Cape Cod. The fruit got its name from the Pilgrims, according to Massachusetts Cranberries, the state\u2019s growers association. They called them craneberries because the plant's pink blossoms looked like the head and bill of a sandhill crane.",
      "The state dominated the industry for decades until Wisconsin became the leader the past 31 years.",
      "The projections from the federal Department of Agriculture for 2025 estimates total cranberry production at 8.13 million barrels, down 9% from last year's crop. Wisconsin was on pace to harvest 5.3 million barrels of cranberries, down 3% from last year. That far outpaces Massachusetts, which is projected to produce 1.75 million barrels, down 22% from last year. That was followed by Oregon at 560,000 barrels and New Jersey at 520,000 barrels. One barrel amounts to 100 pounds (45 kilograms).",
      "In Massachusetts, there are about 300 farmers managing more than 13,000 acres (5,261 hectares), said Brian Wick, the executive director of Massachusetts Cranberries.",
      "The strong numbers from Wisconsin, Wick said, coincide with almost all of its farmers planting higher yielding berries, compared with Massachusetts where traditional heirloom varieties are still harvested from about 40% of bogs. The higher yielding berries are bigger and thus more profitable.",

      "The industry is being hit by lower prices for the berries with the rising cost of producing larger, hybrid varieties. Farmers also are seeing the effects of climate change, which is bringing unpredictable weather like droughts and warmer fall conditions that delay the harvest.",
      "In Massachusetts, cranberry farmers on average are over 60 and often are not being replaced when they retire. Much like farming in general, the younger generation is not interested in the long hours and physical demands that come with managing a bog, Wick said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tough environment right now economically,\u201d Wick said.",
      "As a result, more and more farmers are looking for options beyond maintaining their bogs for cranberries. Some are considering putting solar farms on their bogs, selling to housing developers and, more recently, preserving the sites and restoring the wetlands that once were there.",
      "A growing number of Massachusetts farmers have turned to conservation because they want to keep the land relatively wild but also because there is more federal, state and local funding for those efforts. That money covers the cost of conserving the land and pays for restoration efforts.",
      "Massachusetts is among the leaders in restoration efforts because bogs are built on the wetlands that the state wants to restore. Its first restoration was completed in 2010, and state officials have marveled at how the newly created wetlands have proven a magnet to native plants like marsh seedbox and wool grass as well as wildlife like beavers, raccoons and river otters.",
      "In Wisconsin, the model is a little different. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources helps to identify landowners with wetland who are willing to sell credits to developers. As part of their projects, these developers need to offset the losses of wetlands from their own projects.",
      "The concept, however, has been slow to take hold among cranberry farmers, where only four bogs have been restored to natural wetlands.",

      "A \u201csea war\u201d is brewing off the West African nation of Gambia as desperate local fishermen attack foreign commercial fishing vessels, and each other",
      "BANJUL, Gambia -- Kawsu Leigh writhed in pain on the fishing boat, his burned skin as mottled as the paint on the deck beneath him. Raw and slick, the burns covered large parts of his upper body.",
      "His day began as normal, with a shift on one of the foreign-owned vessels that carry out commercial fishing in waters off West Africa. It ended with him so badly injured from an arson attack that he struggles to recover a year later.",
      "Local fishermen, angered by what they call illegal encroachment and sabotage by the foreign vessels off Gambia, had again confronted one of the boats, the Egyptian-owned Abu Islam.",
      "But Leigh was a local sailor, too. Video of the attack, exclusively obtained by The Associated Press, documents an emerging problem in the fight for dominance in West African waters. Gambians are now fighting Gambians at sea, driven by market forces \u2014 and foreign appetites \u2013 beyond their control.",
      "The problem came from attempted reforms. To give locals more say, and pay, in commercial fishing, Gambia\u2019s government now requires foreign vessels operating offshore to carry a certain percentage of Gambian crew.",
      "Those locals have become accidental targets of an anger they understand well, after trying to compete with the Chinese-owned and other foreign vessels with little more than small wooden boats and their bare hands.",
      "The video was shared by the Association of Gambia Sailors, filmed minutes after the arson attack. The AP reviewed more than 20 such videos from various sources showing confrontations since 2023. Leigh said he is surprised to have survived, and unhappy that Gambians have been made into rivals.",
      "Other clashes in the waters off Gambia have been deadly, with at least 11 local fishermen reportedly killed over the past 15 years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like most of them, when they are going for fishing, it\u2019s as if they\u2019re going for war,\u201d said Abdou Sanyang, secretary general of the Association of Gambia Sailors.",
      "The fighting threatens to tear fishing communities apart, while overfishing to supply seafood buyers around the world undermines livelihoods for everyone. There are concerns that the fish population off Gambia could collapse in the coming years. That would be a business and environmental disaster in a small country with two main economic drivers: tourism and seafood.",
      "For generations, Gambia\u2019s fishermen have known no other work. Now, the financial pressures of competing with foreign-owned vessels are leading some to give up. They are tempted to sell their boats for use in another growing industry: migration toward Europe through the risky Atlantic waters.",
      "Some of the fishermen become migrants themselves, hoping for another kind of good fortune at sea. Leigh, unable to support his family, is considering that now.",
      "Famara and Salif Ndure are brothers in the fishing community of Gunjur. They say they have lost more than half of their fishing nets to foreign trawlers that pull at the nets and damage them.",
      "\u201cYou see them cutting your net, but you cannot do anything, because two men cannot go against 20 to 30 men in the sea,\u201d Famara said. The brothers said they oppose attacking vessels with their countrymen aboard.",
      "They said the foreign vessels have become increasingly aggressive during the current government of President Adama Barrow, who took over after the ouster of former dictator Yahya Jammeh in 2017. Gambia reopened its waters to foreign-owned vessels that year.",
      "Famara said fishing nets are often cut at night, when the foreign vessels go beyond authorized zones to fish. Local fishermen have exclusive fishing rights within 9 nautical miles from shore, but they claim the trawlers come as close as 5. That has made clashes at sea inevitable.",
      "\u201cAnywhere they want, they come and feast. That\u2019s why we\u2019re suffering,\u201d Famara said.",
      "He and his brother once had 15 nets. Those have been reduced to three. A single net line can cost $100, making replacement almost impossible in a country where the per capita income is under $1,000.",
      "Compensation from the government for the loss of a net requires the reporting of a violation by an observer with the fisheries ministry who is stationed on a foreign vessel \u2014 another attempted reform.",
      "The brothers feel helpless. The trawlers are \u201cdestroying the nation,\u201d they said, asserting that incidents are reported but nothing gets done. They think the money the government makes from the licensing of foreign trawlers is the reason. Licensing fees vary, with some vessels paying the equivalent of $275 per ton.",
      "\u201cThey tell us that what the trawlers pay, we small boats don\u2019t pay it,\u201d Famara said.",
      "Gambia's government did not respond to questions from the AP.",
      "Most of the foreign trawlers operate without proper documentation and with unauthorized gear, asserted Lamin Jassey, president of the Gunjur Conservationists and Ecotourism Association. The local group works on marine conservation and advocates for better fisheries policy.",
      "The violations are so blatant that the foreign vessels hardly hide their presence when they violate local waters at night, said Omar Gaye with a local cooperative of nongovernmental fisheries groups.",
      "\u201cYou even think that here is a town because of the lights,\u201d he said.",
      "One of the brothers, Salif, even went to sea last year with a Gambian naval officer to report a foreign trawler after a confrontation over its alleged encroachment. No action was taken.",
      "He ended up filming what happened at sea and posted it online, hoping for an official response someday.",
      "One significant case has reached court in Gambia over fishing conflicts, and another is being prepared. One is the arson attack involving Leigh\u2019s vessel. The other is a collision last year between a foreign trawler, identified by local fishermen as the Majilac 6, and a local vessel that killed three local fishermen.",

      "\u201cThis is very painful, and nothing can pay us for his soul,\" Mbye said. \u201cThey are continuing to work as if nothing happened \u2026 We want the government to help.\u201d",
      "The government has been trying to patrol the seas.",
      "In March last year, before the deadly collision, armed maritime interdiction units with Gambia\u2019s navy detained eight foreign trawlers for offenses including fishing in protected waters, fishing without a valid license, misreporting catches and using undersized mesh, which collects fish smaller than allowed. Almost all were accused of fishing inside the area reserved for local fishermen.",
      "It was a rare deployment. Gambia\u2019s poorly resourced navy has relied on international support from nonprofit organizations to watch its waters.",
      "The Majilac 6 was among the vessels detained.",
      "The vessels soon returned to sea, and locals say they continued to fish in Gambian waters.",
      "Gaye and others were angered to learn that the Majilac 6 was blamed in the deadly collision. He said such collisions have killed at least 11 local fishermen over the past decade and a half.",
      "He also noted a double standard in enforcement, saying the case of last year's arson attack on the Egyptian-owned vessel was quickly resolved. \u201cWhen it is the artisanal fishermen, there is no justice. But when this is industrial fishing vessels, immediate effect, there will be justice,\" he said.",
      "Fines for offenses are not fixed and can be negotiated. Repeat offenders face little punishment. Jassey said many Gambian fishermen believe the trawlers are often tipped off in advance of maritime interdiction unit deployments.",
      "Because Gambia is so small, foreign vessels often dock in neighboring Senegal instead of in Gambia\u2019s capital, meaning fewer chances for local authorities to confront them at all.",
      "But last month, Gambia's military said the navy had detained three vessels for violations including fishing without authorization and the use of illegal fishing gear. One was another vessel with the Majilac Group.",
      "Outside observers of Gambia\u2019s fishing industry are few to none, and data collection is sparse. Sea Shepherd, a nonprofit conservation group, has an agreement with Gambia to jointly patrol the country\u2019s waters but did not visit last year as part of its mission to combat illegal fishing off West Africa.",
      "The Association of Gambia Sailors now encourages fishermen to capture alleged violations by foreign vessels, and violent confrontations, on video. Film, don\u2019t fight, it says.",
      "The same association also provides the foreign trawlers with the government-required local crew members. In the past two years, Gambia\u2019s government has increased the quota from 20% to at least 30% \u2014 meaning more potential for Gambians fighting Gambians.",
      "Those fishermen receive no training on what to expect, or on how to protect themselves from what the head of the association, Sanyang, called a \u201csea war.\"",
      "The conflict at sea off Gambia is occurring as fish stocks decline. Fish including grouper, cuttlefish, sardinella and bonga are over-exploited, according to an Amnesty International report in May 2023 on the human cost of overfishing there.",
      "The sailors association believes that the foreign vessels eventually will move into the waters of nearby countries like Sierra Leone and Guinea Bissau, seeking more fish and less local opposition.",
      "Declining fish stocks have affected food security in Gambia. Prices have risen, putting fish out of reach even for many people who pull them from the sea.",
      "Instead, the majority of Gambians \"depend on chicken that is imported from the world, which is very sad,\u201d Jassey said.",
      "He called the situation for local fishermen \u201cvery fragile.\u201d Competition with foreign trawlers has left many unable to afford the work.",
      "Human traffickers are buying their boats.",
      "\u201cThese agents have a lot of money. They can buy the fishing boat, like three to four hundred, five hundred thousand dalasi, you know, from the fisherman who is sitting for like six to seven months without fishing,\u201d Jassey said. \u201cSo that is very, very serious. That is why we\u2019re losing a lot of our young people.\u201d",
      "The 24-year-old Leigh, still recovering from last year\u2019s arson attack, has spent the money he received from the foreign trawler as compensation -- 51,000 dalasi \u2013 along with three months of his 17,000-dalasi salary. He spent it all on medication.",
      "Now he considers giving up fishing and taking his chances on migrating to Europe.",
      "\u201cI just want to work for me and my family to survive,\u201d he said.",

      "A growing number of cranberry bogs in Massachusetts are being converted back to nature as farmers get out of the business",
      "CARVER, Mass. -- About this time of the year, Jarrod Rhodes should be checking on the vines of cranberries that have grown on his bog for decades in southeastern Massachusetts.",
      "Instead, he is watching a backhoe tear up the cranberry bog, exposing the dark peat underneath that will eventually become a meandering stream through the 32-acre (13-hectare) South Meadow Bogs Restoration site. The goal of the six-to-nine-month-long, $1.1 million project is to convert this bog to a wetland that should see the return of native plants like steeplebush and straw-colored flatsedge along with providing habitat for wildlife like wood frogs, hawks and muskrats.",
      "\u201cThese bogs were originally built on top of a wetland, so now we\u2019re putting it back to the way it was,\u201d Rhodes said, adding that this bog was \u201cdistressed\u201d which gave his family a choice of spending time and money to rebuild it with new vines and irrigation or take state and federal funding to conserve and restore it.",
      "\u201cThere were a lot of factors that made this avenue make more sense as opposed to spending the money to rebuild it and waiting five or six years,\u201d said Rhodes, a fourth-generation farmer whose family still has 250 acres (101 hectares) in production.",
      "This project is part of a growing push by cranberry farmers in Massachusetts to choose conservation over other options to glean extra revenue like converting a bog into solar farms or housing.",
      "The shift comes as the industry is being hit by lower prices for the pinkish crimson berries used in sauce and juice along with the rising cost of producing larger, hybrid varieties. Farmers also are seeing the effects of climate change, which is bringing unpredictable weather like droughts and warmer fall conditions that delay the harvest.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tough environment right now economically,\u201d said Brian Wick, the executive director of Massachusetts Cranberries, the state's growers association. The state started growing cranberries in the 1800s and was country's top producer until the 1990s. It ceded that title to Wisconsin and now its nearly 300 growers produce about 22% of the nation's crop.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see a shift because everyone is in a different place in the industry and what they see as their future,\u201d Wick said. \u201cFor some of them, they\u2019re saying I have some bogs. I can\u2019t keep farming them. They\u2019re not going to be economically viable. They could be an environmentally sensitive area where maybe it\u2019s better to have them not being farmed.\u201d",
      "Massachusetts is well suited for bog conservation because most sites are built on former wetlands.",
      "The push also comes as federal, state and local funding has increased in recent years for this kind of coastal conservation. Wetlands, which have significantly declined across the United States, provide a home for native plants and wildlife, a filter for pollutants and natural barriers to rising seas, higher tides and stronger storm surges. The restored sites also have proven popular with hikers, bikers and bird watchers.",
      "\u201cA year from now, that river channel will be flowing through a green meadow. You\u2019ll see native plants across this dry landscape behind us. You\u2019ll see wetland trees starting to grow,\u201d said Beth Lambert, the director of the Massachusetts Division of Ecological Restoration, as she visited the South Meadow site. \u201cThe real restoration really happens after the construction equipment leaves the site. Mother Nature takes it from there and the site continues to evolve into a wetland for the next five to 10 years.\u201d",

      "The state has converted eight bog sites to wetlands at a cost of more than $27 million and has 12 more planned. Wisconsin and New Jersey have done some bog restoration but on a much smaller scale.",
      "Most conversations can take several years, with construction teams pulling down gates and berms that controlled water flows, filling in drainage ditches and removing several feet of sand used in cranberry farming. They also aim to recreate the unique topography of a wetland \u2014 sometimes constructing mounds throughout the site.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at a natural wetland, you\u2019ll see the surface of that wetland is not flat like a table. It\u2019s hummocky. It has little hills, little tiny valleys,\u201d Lambert said. \u201cIt\u2019s that topography, which we call microtopography, that creates a wide diversity of wetland plant species, because each wetland can tolerate a certain amount of water.\u201d",
      "Among the communities most bullish on bog conservation is Harwich on Cape Cod, where the Harwich Conservation Trust has restored one bog, is in the process of restoring a second by this fall and just bought a third to be turned into wetland \u2014 all totaling over 120 acres (49 hectares). Many of the cranberry farmers selling are town residents, who want to ensure their land remains in a natural state.",
      "The Cold Brook Eco-Restoration Project was finished earlier this year and has a stream running through the 66-acre (27-hectare) site for the first time in a century. River otters have turned up and the restoration is proving a boon to egrets and herons. The project also is expected to save Harwich several million dollars in wastewater treatment costs, since wetlands reduce the amounts of nitrogen in the water flowing to the harbor",
      "\u201cWhile both honoring the cranberry culture and history in town is important, folks are recognizing these eco-restoration transformations are bringing a whole new range of benefits to the community,\u201d said Michael Lach, executive director of the trust.",
      "A 15-minute drive from the South Meadow site sits the first restoration project completed by the state in 2010.",
      "Walking down a rocky hiking trial through a pitch pine forest, Lambert stares out at the Eel River that winds its way through the 40-acre (12-hectare) site. Cattails shake in the wind and a grove of Atlantic white cedar trees, planted as saplings, now stand 20 feet (6 meters) high. A great blue heron flies off as Lambert approaches the water and the fragrant smells of sweet pepper bush fills the air.",
      "Without the state's intervention, Lambert said the Eel River Preserve would have turned into a pine forest because it was so dry.",
      "\u201cThe goal was to have a functioning wetland and that is, in fact, what we got which was incredible,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know that the plants would return naturally on their own. We found that the peat had this incredible seed bank of native plants, which the peat had built up over hundreds of years. Simply exposing that to the sun and having the water moving through it, that created the conditions for the wetland plants to return.\u201d",

      "Some people spend their entire lives dreaming of that one special day where they walk down the aisle to be married",
      "NEWTOWN, Ohio -- Tyler Jones and Kayla McDonald both grew up camping, so when it came time to plan their wedding, they wanted to be outside to celebrate with friends and family in nature.",
      "They also wanted a late summer wedding. That meant choosing a venue that could move the event inside at the last minute if the weather in the Cincinnati area didn't cooperate.",
      "\u201cIt could be a hundred degrees, you know, with humidity,\u201d Jones said. When their big weekend forecast came up a mere 84 degrees (about 29 Celsius), they breathed a sigh of relief.",
      "Stickier, hotter, longer summers driven by human-caused climate change are changing another time of year: wedding season. Many couples who pick the summer to get hitched now face hitches that range from melting makeup to uncomfortable guests. Some are choosing venues better able to handle the heat, or shifting to dates earlier or later in the year.",
      "\u201cMore and more, we kind of get the feedback of, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be hot during my wedding,\u2019\u201d said Christina Elsass, co-owner and venue manager of Mojave East, where Jones and McDonald wed in August.",
      "Six years ago, Elsass and her husband \u2014 who used to be a wedding photographer \u2014 opened Mojave East, a play on the Mojave Desert, to honor her roots and their West Coast love story. Since they started the business, she said they've seen a shift to more demand in October and November and less in May, June and September, which are traditionally big wedding months.",
      "\u201cWe have noticed that the weather has gotten a bit hotter during those, like during September, I would say, most specifically, and even into October,\u201d she said.",
      "Some venues are now even advertising the changing trend on their websites. Westmount Country Club in New Jersey writes that fall is becoming the \u201cit\u201d season for weddings, citing milder weather. The Beaumont Inn in Pennsylvania says that a spring wedding means guests won't have to bundle up in layers, but it also won't be \u201cunbearably hot.\u201d",
      "But other factors still play into the decision. Some religious sects advise against wedding during certain months of the year; for instance, some Christian denominations limit weddings on certain days of Advent and Lent, in winter and early spring, respectively. Other couples still want a summer wedding because it's more convenient for their visiting guests, or because a particular date is important to them.",
      "In the name of love, for an event that is often costly and a significant challenge to organize, many couples don't want to back out even if the weather poses a challenge. One couple in the Philippines walked down a flooded aisle this July after Typhoon Wipha intensified monsoon rains.",
      "Rylee Kennedy, who got married last June in Pennsylvania during a heat wave, had to pivot in the hours leading up to the ceremony. She didn't walk down the aisle surrounded by blooming flowers and trees, as she had envisioned. Due to the heat and concern for guests' safety, everything moved to their backup indoor space where they held the reception.",
      "\u201cWith weather just being so unpredictable now, you really have to make sure that if you do have to switch gears, you\u2019re not going to have a wedding that isn\u2019t part of your vision or didn\u2019t align with what you wanted it to be,\" Kennedy said.",
      "For those who choose to stay the course with summer nuptials, some wedding experts are adding to the planning list. Brides, the nearly century-old bridal magazine, last year advised readers to communicate with their wedding planners and caterers about the heat, consider extra hair trials or an updo and look into switching to shorter dress lengths for bridesmaids. It also urged them to come up with a heat plan for guests.",

She said it's a conversation that doesn't happen enough across the business of wedding planning.",
      "On their wedding day, McDonald and Jones were able to keep the ceremony outdoors, but their \u201cfirst look\u201d photographs were moved into a shaded area to avoid the afternoon sun. When some guests arrived early, many of them waited indoors, cups of water in hand.",
      "During the ceremony, guests used fans to keep cool and shade themselves as the sun began to set. And once the knot was tied, almost every guest went inside for the cocktail hour to cool off in the air conditioning. Misters ran outside for anyone who wanted some fresh air.",

      "Makes sense, since turning FAU back into a winner might be a tall order.",
      "Kittley is an anomaly in a whole bunch of ways. He hasn\u2019t played football since high school. He freely acknowledges that he\u2019s not the best coach in his own family; his father, a track coach with more championship rings than fingers and toes, has that distinction. And not only is he taking on the task of being a first-time head coach, he\u2019s doing so while also calling FAU\u2019s plays \u2014 a dual role that few at his level dare to tackle.",

Last season, when FAU made the hire, the Red Raiders\u2019 national ranks were eighth in yards per play, eighth in points per game, 10th in yards per game and second in plays per game.",
      "In talent-rich South Florida, where there is no shortage of speedy skill-position players, White thinks Kittley\u2019s style is a perfect match.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s special,\u201d White said. \u201cI was very intrigued by his resume, his background, his numbers. I\u2019d seen it first-hand since we played against him at Western Kentucky. I had to talk to him. It wasn\u2019t a foregone conclusion, but he just popped in our first conversation \u2026 and he seemed like a winner all-around. I was blown away and when we met with the committee, he was far and away the winner of the interview.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no secret to what Kittley \u2014 once a coach tasked with helping Patrick Mahomes at the college level, and now someone who has the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback\u2019s jersey hanging in his Boca Raton office \u2014 wants to do with the Owls. They\u2019re going to play fast. Really fast.",
      "Teams at the FBS level averaged 36 points in wins last season; FAU was 3-1 when scoring that many points a year ago, and 0-8 when it didn\u2019t reach that number.",
      "\u201cDefinitely a little adjustment at first,\u201d FAU tight end Reid Mikeska said when asked about the pace of the Owls' offense. \u201cBut Coach Kitt\u2019s offense is great. I think it\u2019ll hurt the opponents we play more than us, for sure.\u201d",

The two teams then sued NASCAR, accusing it of being a bully and monopoly in a brawl that has played out all year and prompted both teams to say they risk going out of business if the series sells their charters out from under them.",
      "Nothing, however, has been as explosive as the details that came to light for the first time Thursday as documents related to discovery were disclosed.",
      "NASCAR is privately owned by the Florida-based France family, with founder Bill France Sr.\u2019s son, Jim, the current chairman. His granddaughter, Lesa France Kennedy, is the executive vice chair and was in court for the first time since the case began.",
      "Steve Lauletta, the president of 23XI, at one point wrote \u201cJim dying is probably the answer\u201d to teams getting better terms on a charter agreement while Hamlin said \u201cmy despise for the France family runs deep... (but) please let\u2019s not sabotage our own business.\u201d",
      "In a partially redacted text conversation between Jordan and Polk, presumably about the price of charters, Jordan wrote that \u201cI\u2019m not selling even if they were for sale (redacted). What would we do?\u201d Polk replies \u201cThis is just a hobby!!!\u201d and Jordan responds \u201cOnly can play but so much golf.\u201d",
      "In a second exchange, Jordan discusses with Polk the cost of signing a driver whose name is redacted.",
      "\u201cI have lost that in a casino. Lets do it,\" Jordan replied.",
      "NASCAR had its own expletive-laden email exchange among top executives disclosed. Commissioner Steve Phelps in one email wrote that talks had not been productive and argued an early charter proposal offered \u201czero wins for the teams\u201d and in another message wrote the charters \"must reflect a middle position or we are dead in the water \u2014 they will sign them but we are (expletive) moving forward.\u201d",
      "Steve O\u2019Donnell, the president of NASCAR, also didn't like an early version because it would return NASCAR's model to 1996 terms with an attitude of \u201c(Expletive) the teams, dictatorship, motorsport, redneck, southern, tiny sport,\u201d he wrote.",

      "Jeffrey Kessler, the attorney for 23XI and Front Row, contended that the NASCAR exchanges as well as contingency plans on how NASCAR could prevent rival competition prove NASCAR is monopolizing the stock car racing market.",
      "NASCAR has maintained in legal filings that 23XI and Front Row relinquished any rights they have to six combined charters when they refused to sign the extensions last September. The teams started the season recognized as chartered, which guarantees 36 chartered teams entry into the 40-car field each week. Chartered teams also receive a substantially higher percentage of payouts.",
      "The order that recognized the six cars as chartered has been overturned and they are currently competing as \u201copen\u201d teams. 23XI Racing driver Tyler Reddick has a clause in his contract that says he can leave if his car is not chartered; Kessler indicated that Reddick and sponsors have given notice that 23XI is in breach.",
      "U.S. District Judge Kenneth Bell warned during the hearing that NASCAR's charter system is at stake, depending on the outcome of the case. The arguments before Bell were focused on the teams' urgent request to restore their status as chartered teams through the end of the season ahead of a trial scheduled for Dec. 1.",
      "NASCAR has indicated it plans to immediately begin selling off the charters. Bell asked NASCAR's attorney that if there is indeed such an eager buyer, why couldn't the series sell one of the four open slots and then figure out how to address it once the case is settled. NASCAR has maintained that it can\u2019t be forced to do business with teams it does not want to work with.",
      "The judge said he would rule on the request next week after the first playoff race of the season. Reddick and Bubba Wallace are in the playoff field for 23IX and so is Hamlin, who drives for JGR.",
      "Outside court, Jordan said he has been open to a settlement but is willing to see the case go to trial. Kessler warned if 23XI and Front Row do not receive their charters back they will go out of business in 2026.",
      "\u201cLook, I've been a fan of the game for a long period of time,\u201d Jordan said. \"When we first started this whole process I've always said I want to fight for the betterment of the sport. Even though they tried to point out that we've made some money, we had a successful business. That's not the point. The point is that the sport itself needs to continually change for the fans as well as for the teams.",

      "The Kansas City Chiefs have prepared for Rashee Rice's six-game suspension by keeping eight wide receivers on their roster",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The Kansas City Chiefs knew that Rashee Rice's six-game suspension was coming down from the NFL this week.",
      "That's why they kept eight wide receivers on cutdown day.",
      "Now, they believe they are better suited to deal with the absence of their No. 1 wide receiver than they were last season, when the Chiefs were suddenly without Rice for most of the season following an injury to his right knee.",
      "JuJu Smith-Schuster came back to training camp in excellent shape, general manager Brett Veach said, and rookie Jalen Royals has a similar skillset. Throw in a healthy Marquise Brown, who was out most of last season because of a shoulder injury, and the Chiefs think they can weather the loss of Rice until his return Oct. 19 for a game against the Raiders.",
      "\u201cIt wasn't a surprise,\u201d Veach told a small group of reporters Thursday. \u201cIt was communicated to us, and we were certainly made aware a few days prior to cutdown day that this was a better-than-50 percent shot that this would get resolved.\u201d",
      "Rice pleaded guilty last month to two third-degree felony charges of collision involving serious bodily injury and racing on a highway causing bodily injury. As part of his plea agreement from the March 2024 crash on a Dallas highway, prosecutors said, Rice also received a sentence of five years of deferred probation and 30 days in jail as a condition of his probation.",
      "The NFL had to wait until the legal process was finished before launching its own internal investigation. There was a hearing set for Sept. 30 before former federal judge Sue L. Robinson to determine the length and terms of Rice's suspension, but that voided when Rice and his team agreed to the six-game banishment.",
      "Along with the Chargers game in Brazil, Rice will miss a Super Bowl rematch with the Eagles on Sept. 14 at Arrowhead Stadium; a Sunday night trip to the Meadowlands to face the Giants; a high-profile matchup with Lamar Jackson and the Ravens on Sept. 28; a game against Jacksonville the following Monday night; and a Sunday night showdown with the Lions.",
      "\u201cI think Rashee is a top-10 receiver. I think he's a legit stud, a star in this league, and it's going to be awfully hard to do what he can do, and I don't think we have anybody like Rashee,\u201d Veach acknowledged. \u201cThere are few players who can punish tacklers like Rashee can at that position.\u201d",
      "Indeed, while Rice has the speed to take the top off a defense, he is at his best catching balls near the line of scrimmage and then getting up the field. The 28-year-old Smith-Schuster, who has more size and experience on his side, can play some of the same roles in what is considered a complex Kansas City offense.",
      "\u201cJuJu to his credit, I think, he's looked better this camp than the last camp he was here,\u201d Veach said. \u201cThat's a good thing. We're getting JuJu fresh at the beginning of the season.\u201d",

      "As for Royals, the fourth-round pick out of Utah State has been sidelined by knee tendinitis late in training camp, an injury that could extend into the start of the season. But the Chiefs are hopeful of him returning soon, and the 15.2-yards per catch and 21 touchdowns he had over his final two seasons in college provide a peek at his game-changing ability.",
      "\u201cHis athletic ability, we think he'll ascend and be a good player,\u201d Veach said.",
      "The Chiefs have been similarly careful with Brown, who missed time in training camp and did not play in any of their preseason games because of an ankle injury. They lost him in their preseason opener a year ago and he did not return until the playoffs, and even then he could only provide a fraction of what he can do when healthy.",
      "Then there is also second-year pro Xavier Worthy, who may have benefited the most from Rice and Brown being absent last season. He was forced into a starring role alongside star tight end Travis Kelce and flourished, especially in the playoffs, where Worthy had 19 catches for 287 yards and three touchdowns in three games.",
      "Other wide receivers on the roster include return specialist Nikko Remigio, Tyquan Thornton and Jason Brownlee.",

      "The study by World Weather Attribution said the fires that killed 20 people, forced 80,000 to evacuate and burned more than 1 million hectares (2.47 million acres) were 22% more intense in 2025, Europe\u2019s worst recorded year of wildfires.",

      "\u201cOur study finds an extremely strong climate change signal towards hotter and drier conditions,\u201d said Theodore Keeping, a researcher at Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College in London.",

      "The study found winter rainfall ahead of the wildfires had dropped by about 14% since the pre-industrial era, when a heavy reliance on fossil fuels began. It also determined that because of climate change, weeklong periods of dry, hot air that primes vegetation to burn are now 13 times more likely.",
      "The analysis also found an increase in the intensity of high-pressure systems that strengthened extreme northerly winds, known as Etesian winds, that fanned the wildfires.",

      "Online age checks are on the rise in the U.S. and elsewhere, asking people for IDs or face scans to prove they are over 18 or 21 or even 13. To proponents, they're a tool to keep children away from adult websites and other material that might be harmful to them.",
      "But opponents see a worrisome trend toward a less secure, less private and less free internet, where people can be denied access not just to pornography but news, health information and the ability to speak openly and anonymously.",
      "\u201cI think that many of these laws come from a place of good intentions,\u201d said Jennifer Huddleston, a senior technology policy fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. \u201cCertainly we all want to protect young people from harmful content before they\u2019re ready to see it.\u201d",
      "More than 20 states have passed some kind of age verification law, though many face legal challenges. While no such law exists on the federal level in the United States, the Supreme Court recently allowed a Mississippi age check law for social media to stand. In June, the court upheld a Texas law aimed at preventing minors from watching pornography online, ruling that adults don't have a First Amendment right to access obscene speech without first proving their age.",
      "Elsewhere, the United Kingdom now requires users visiting websites that allow pornography to verify their age. Beyond adult sites, platforms like Reddit, X, Telegram and Bluesky have also committed to age checks. France and several other European Union countries also are testing a government sponsored verification app.",
      "And Australia has banned children under 16 from accessing social media.",
      "\u201cPlatforms now have a social responsibility to ensure the safety of our kids is a priority for them,\u201d Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters in November. The platforms have a year to work out how they could implement the ban before penalties are enforced.",
      "To critics, though, age check laws raise \u201csignificant privacy and speech concerns, not only for young people themselves, but also for all users of the internet,\u201d Huddleston said. \u201cBecause the only way to make sure that we are age verifying anyone under the age of 18 is to also age verify everyone over the age 18. And that could have significant impacts on the speech and privacy rights of adults.\u201d",
      "The state laws are a hodgepodge of requirements, but they generally fall into two camps. On one side are laws \u2014 as seen in Louisiana and Texas \u2014 that require websites comprised of more than 33% of adult content to verify users' ages or face fines. Then there are laws \u2014 enacted in Wyoming or South Dakota \u2014 that seek to regulate sites that have any material that is considered obscene or otherwise harmful to minors.",
      "What's considered harmful to minors can be subjective, and this is where experts believe such laws run afoul of the First Amendment. It means people may be required to verify their ages to access anything, from Netflix to a neighborhood blog.",
      "\u201cIn places like Australia and the U.K., there is already a split happening between the internet that people who are willing to identify themselves or go through age verification can see and the rest of the internet. And that's historically a very dangerous place for us to end up,\u201d said Jason Kelley, activism director at the nonprofit digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation.",
      "What's behind the gates is determined by a \u201chundred different decision-makers,\" Kelley said, from politicians to tech platforms to judges to individuals who have sued because they believe that a piece of content is dangerous.",

      "While many companies are complying, verifying users' ages can prove a burden, especially for smaller platforms. On Friday, Bluesky said it will no longer be available in Mississippi because of its age verification requirements. While the social platform already does age verification in the U.K., it said Mississippi\u2019s approach \u201cwould fundamentally change how users access Bluesky.\u201d",
      "That's because it requires every user to undergo an age check, not just those who want to access adult content. It would also require Bluesky to identify and track users that are children.",
      "\u201cWe think this law creates challenges that go beyond its child safety goals, and creates significant barriers that limit free speech and disproportionately harm smaller platforms,\u201d the company said in a blog post.",
      "Some websites and social media companies, such as Instagram's parent company Meta, have argued that age verification should be done by app store owners, such as Apple and Google, and not individual platforms. This would mean that app stores need to verify their users\u2019 ages before they allow them to download apps. Unsurprisingly, Apple and Google disagree.",
      "\u201cBilled as \u2018simple\u2019 by its backers, including Meta, this proposal fails to cover desktop computers or other devices that are commonly shared within families. It also could be ineffective against pre-installed apps,\u201d Google said in a blog post.",
      "Nonetheless, a growing number of tech companies are implementing verification systems to comply with regulations or ward off criticism that they are not protecting children. This includes Google, which recently started testing a new age-verification system for YouTube that relies on AI to differentiate between adults and minors based on their watch histories.",
      "Instagram is testing a similar AI system to determine if kids are lying about their ages. Roblox, which was sued by the Louisiana attorney general on claims it doesn't do enough to protect children from predators, requires users who want to access certain games rated for those over 17 to submit a photo ID and undergo a face scan for verification. Roblox has also recently begun requiring age verification for teens who want to chat more freely on platform.",
      "Face scans that promise to estimate a person\u2019s age may address some of the concerns around IDs, but they can be unreliable. Can AI accurately tell, for instance, if someone is 17.5 or just turned 18?",
      "\u201cSometimes it\u2019s less accurate for women or it\u2019s less accurate for certain racial or ethnic groups or for certain physical characteristics that then may mean that those people have to go through additional privacy invasive screenings to prove that they are of a certain age,\u201d Huddleston said.",
      "While IDs are a common way of verifying someone\u2019s age, the method raises security concerns: What happens if companies don't delete the uploaded files, for instance?",
      "Case in point: the recent data breaches at Tea, an app for women to anonymously warn each other about the men they date, speak to some of these concerns. The app requires women who sign up to upload an ID or undergo a scan to prove that they are women. Tea wasn't supposed to keep the files but it did, and stored them in a way that allowed hackers to not only access the images, but also their private messages.",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency is seeking to use the DOE's work to overturn the climate concept known as the \u201cendangerment finding.\u201d If the administration succeeds, many laws and rules aimed at reducing or restricting greenhouse gas emissions could be eliminated.",
      "The Associated Press surveyed scientists for their views. Here are some key takeaways from those who responded to AP's questions:",
      "The most common critique from 64 scientists who responded to questions from AP was that the administration\u2019s reports ignored, twisted or cherry-picked information to manufacture doubt about the severity and threat of climate change. Fifty-three of the 64 scientists criticized the quality of the reports.",
      "The Department of Energy report said Arctic sea ice has declined about 5% since 1980. That number is accurate for Antarctica, while Artic sea ice actually declined more than 40% in the period.",
      "Jennifer Marlon, director of data science at the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, highlighted a section on U.S. wildfires that acknowledged that fire data from before 1960 isn't reliable for comparisons. Yet the administration used that unreliable data in a chart going back to 1920, leaving readers with the impression that wildfire rates were higher many decades ago than they are now, Marlon said.",

      "THE SANTA ROSA PLATEAU ECOLOGICAL RESERVE, Calif. -- The scientist traipses to a pond wearing rubber boots but he doesn\u2019t enter the water. Instead, Brad Hollingsworth squats next to its swampy edge and retrieves a recording device the size of a deck of cards. He then opens it up and removes a tiny memory card containing 18 hours of sound.",
      "Back at his office at the San Diego Natural History Museum, the herpetologist \u2014 an expert in reptiles and amphibians \u2014 uses artificial intelligence to analyze the data on the card. Within three minutes, he knows a host of animals visit the pond \u2014 where native red-legged frogs were reintroduced after largely disappearing in Southern California. There were owl hoots, woodpecker pecks, coyote howls and tree frog ribbits. But no croaking from the invasive bullfrog, which has decimated the native red-legged frog population over the past century.",
      "It was another good day in his efforts to increase the population of the red-legged frog and restore an ecosystem spanning the U.S.-Mexico border. The efforts come as the Trump administration builds more walls along the border, raising concerns about the impact on wildlife.",
      "At 2 to 5 inches long (5 to 13 centimeters), red-legged frogs are the largest native frogs in the West and once were found in abundance up and down the California coast and into Baja California in Mexico.",
      "The species is widely believed to be the star of Mark Twain\u2019s 1865 short story, \u201cThe Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,\" and their crimson hind legs were eaten during the Gold Rush. But as the red-legged frog declined in numbers, the bullfrog \u2014 with its even bigger hind legs \u2014 was introduced to menus during California's booming growth in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.",
      "The red-legged frog population was decimated by the insatiable appetite of the bullfrogs and the disease the non-native species brought in, but also because it lost much of its habitat to drought and human development in the shape of homes, dams and more.",
      "Hollingsworth couldn't estimate the number of red-legged frogs that remain, but said they have disappeared from 95% of their historical range in Southern California.",
      "Robert Fisher of the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s Amphibian Research and Monitoring Initiative Program searched for the frog for decades across some 250 miles (400 kilometers) from Los Angeles to the border. He found just one in 2001 and none after that.",
      "Scientists using DNA from red-legged frogs captured in Southern California before their disappearance discovered they were more genetically similar to the population in Mexico than any still in California.",
      "In 2006, Fisher, Hollingsworth and others visited Baja where they had heard of a small population of red-legged frogs. Anny Peralta, then a student of Hollingsworth at San Diego State University, joined them. They found about 20 frogs, and Peralta was inspired to dedicate her life to their recovery.",
      "Peralta and her husband established the nonprofit Fauna del Noroeste in Ensenada, Mexico, which aims to promote the proper management of natural resources. In 2018, they started building ponds in Mexico to boost the frog population that would later provide eggs to repopulate the species across the border.",
      "But just as they were preparing to relocate the egg masses, the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Peralta and the U.S. scientists scrambled to secure permits for the unusual cargo and a pilot to fly the two coolers of eggs closer to the border. The rest of their journey north was by road, after the eggs passed a U.S. border guard inspection.",

The tools could also help scientists analyze tens of thousands of audio files collected at universities, museums and other institutions.",
      "Scientists working to restore the red-legged frog population in Southern California hope to soon be provided with satellite technology that will send audio recordings to their phones in real time, so they can act immediately if any predators \u2014 in particular bullfrogs \u2014 are detected.",
      "It could also help track the movement of the frogs, which can be difficult to find in the wild, especially because cold-blooded creatures cannot be detected using thermal imagery.",
      "The AI analysis of the pond audio has saved time for Hollingsworth and the others, who previously had to painstakingly listen to countless hours of audio files to detect the calls of the red-legged frog \u2014 which resembles the sound of a thumb being rubbed on a balloon \u2014 over the cacophony of other animals.",

      "The team plans to continue transporting egg masses from Baja, where the population has jumped from 20 to as many as 400 adult frogs, with the hope of building thriving populations on both sides of the border. Already the sites are seeing fewer mosquitos that can carry diseases like dengue and Zika.",
      "A restoration pond in Baja that Peralta\u2019s organization built recently teemed with froglets, their tiny eyes bobbing on its aquatic fern-covered surface. They could, one day, lay eggs for relocation to the U.S.",
      "\u201cThey don't know about borders or visas or passports,\u201d Peralta said of the frogs. \u201cThis is just their habitat and these populations need to reconnect. I think this shows that we can restore this ecosystem.\u201d",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Chipmaker Nvidia will release a quarterly report Wednesday that could provide a better sense of whether the stock market has been riding an overhyped artificial intelligence bubble or is being propelled by a technological boom that's still gathering momentum.",
      "Nvidia become the first publicly traded company to surpass a market value of $4 trillion last month, and its stock price has gained another 13% since then to create an additional $500 billion in shareholder wealth.",
      "The latest financial results are due out Wednesday afternoon. They have become a key AI barometer during the past two years because Nvidia makes most of the chips that power the technology in vast data centers at the center of the boom.",
      "This summer's run-up has continued Nvidia's jaw-dropping rise from early 2023, when the company's market value was hovering around $400 billion. That was shortly after OpenAI's late 2022 release of its ChatGPT chatbot triggered the biggest craze in technology since Apple released the first iPhone in 2007.",
      "While the technology industry has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI frenzy, it's also been a boon for the overall stock market. The benchmark S&P 500 has gained 68% since the end of 2022, with AI fervor fueling much of the investor optimism.",
      "But even amid the general euphoria, there recently have been murmurs about whether AI mania will prove to be an echo of the late 1990s dot-com boom that culminated in an excruciating stock market meltdown in 2000 that eventually drove the U.S. economy and plunged Silicon Valley into a funk that lasted several years before the tech industry began to thrive again.",

      "And by some metrics, the stock prices of tech companies at the AI are looking frothy. For instance, Nvidia is trading at about 40 times its future earnings, roughly double the rate that investors traditionally believe is a reasonable level. Meanwhile, the market value of Microsoft, another AI leader, is hovering just below $4 trillion, while the values of other fellow pacesetters Amazon, Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Google parent Alphabet currently range from $1.9 trillion to $2.5 trillion.",
      "Nvidia is expected to post another quarter of robust growth for the May-July period of its fiscal year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet research predict Nvidia will earn $1.01 per share, excluding certain items unrelated to its ongoing business, which would be a 49% increase from the same time last year. The analysts anticipated Nvidia's revenue would rise 53% from a year ago to about $46 billion.",
      "Those gains reflect the financial tsunami flooding the AI market as the biggest players spend heavily to build and expand data centers needed to power the technology. Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta are collectively budgeting more than $325 billion for investments in AI this year. With its dominant position in the AI chip market, Nvidia is reaping the benefits of that intense demand.",
      "Even so, the trajectory of Nvidia's growth has been tapering off. If analyst projections pan out, Nvidia's revenue growth for its latest quarter will be significantly lower than the 122% increase it posted during the same period last year.",
      "And Nvidia has also been losing business because of President Donald Trump's trade war with China. Following a ban on its AI chip sales in China, which resulted in a $4.5 billion blow to its finances during its fiscal first quarter, Nvidia estimated that the restrictions would cost it about approximately $8 billion in sales in this during the past quarter.",
      "Trump took the China handcuffs off of Nvidia earlier this month in return for a 15% cut of the company's sales in that country \u2014 a compromise CEO Jensen Huang is expected to discuss with analysts while he shares his perspective on the state of the AI market on a call with investors.",

      "Musk's post insinuated that Apple had rigged the system against ChatGPT competitors such as the Grok chatbot made by his own xAI. Now, he is detailing a litany of grievances in the lawsuit \u2014 filed by xAI and another of his corporate entities, X Corp. \u2014 in an attempt to win monetary damages and a court order prohibiting the alleged illegal tactics.",
      "The double-barreled legal attack weaves together several recently unfolding narratives to recast a year-old partnership between Apple and OpenAI as a veiled conspiracy to stifle competition during a technological shift that could prove as revolutionary as the 2007 release of the iPhone.",
      "\u201cThis is a tale of two monopolists joining forces to ensure their continued dominance in a world rapidly driven by the most powerful technology humanity has ever created: artificial intelligence,\u201d the lawsuit asserts.",
      "The complaint portrays Apple as a company that views AI as an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to its future success, prompting it to collude with OpenAI in an attempt to protect the iPhone franchise that has long been its biggest moneymaker.",
      "Some of the allegations accusing Apple of trying to shield the iPhone from do-everything \u201csuper apps,\u201d such as the one Musk has long been trying to create with X, echo an antitrust lawsuit filed against Apple last year by the U.S. Department of Justice.",
      "The complaint casts OpenAI as a threat to humanity bent on putting profits before public safety as it tries to build on its phenomenal growth since the late 2022 release of ChatGPT. The depiction mirrors one already being drawn in another federal lawsuit that Musk filed last year, alleging OpenAI had betrayed its founding mission to serve as a nonprofit research lab for the public good.",

      "Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The crux of the lawsuit revolves around Apple's decision to use ChatGPT as an AI-powered \u201canswer engine\u201d on the iPhone when the built-in technology on its device couldn't satisfy user needs. The partnership announced last year was part of Apple's late entry into the AI race that was supposed to be powered mostly by its own on-device technology, but the company still hasn't been able to deliver on all its promises.",
      "Apple's own AI shortcomings may be helping drive more usage of ChatGPT on the iPhone, providing OpenAI with invaluable data that's unavailable to Grok and other would-be competitors because it's currently an exclusive partnership.",
      "The alliance has provided Apple with an incentive to improperly elevate ChatGPT in the AI rankings of the iPhone's app store, the lawsuit alleges. Other AI apps from DeekSeek and Perplexity have periodically reached the top spot in the Apple app store's AI rankings in at least some parts of the world since Apple announced its deal with ChatGPT.",
      "The lawsuit doesn't mention the potential threat that ChatGPT could also pose to Apple and the iPhone's future popularity. As part of its expansion efforts, OpenAI recruited former Apple designer Jony Ive to oversee a project aimed at building an AI-powered device that many analysts believe could eventually mount a challenge to the iPhone.",

      "Boaters, beachgoers and fishermen who spend time in the chilly waters of New England and Canada are learning to live with great white sharks",
      "SCARBOROUGH, Maine -- Rick Clough spent some four decades fishing for lobsters and sea urchins off the Maine coast before spotting one of the ocean's most recognized predators \u2014 a great white shark.",
      "The approximately 8-foot (2.4-meter) shark, seen off the beach town of Scarborough in July, surprised Clough, but didn\u2019t make him fear the ocean \u2014 though he admitted, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to go urchin diving now.\u201d",
      "Boaters, beachgoers and fishermen like Clough who spend time in the chilly waters of New England and Atlantic Canada are learning to live with great white sharks, the creatures made famous by the 1975 film \u201cJaws.\u201d Sightings of the apex predators are up in places like Maine, where they were once very rarely spotted.",
      "Scientists link the white shark sightings to increased availability of the seals the sharks feast on, and say beachgoers are generally very safe from shark bites. The sharks can grow close to 20 feet (6 meters) long, though most don't get that big.",
      "David Lancaster, a commercial clam digger in Scarborough, used a drone to get a look at an approximately 12-foot (3.6-meter) shark near the town\u2019s famed beaches earlier this month. He described the animal as \u201cmagnificent\u201d and \u201creally amazing\u201d to see. But he also said the shark's presence reminded him that swimmers need to look out for the big fish.",
      "Sightings of great whites off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, have become increasingly frequent in recent years, and the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy has documented hundreds of the animals over more than a decade. But new data shows the sharks are heading even farther north into New Hampshire, Maine and beyond, said Greg Skomal, a senior fisheries biologist with the Massachusetts Department of Marine Fisheries and a veteran white shark researcher.",
      "The number of white sharks detected off Halifax, Nova Scotia, increased about 2.5 times from 2018 to 2022, according to a paper published by Skomal and others in May in the journal Marine Ecology Progress Series. Even farther north, the number detected in the Cabot Strait that separates Nova Scotia and Newfoundland increased nearly four times over, the paper said.",
      "Skomal said the average residency in these northern waters has also increased from 48 days to 70 days, suggesting that white sharks appear to be increasingly comfortable farther north.",
      "A key reason for the shift seems to be the successful conservation of seals off New England and Canada via laws such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which has allowed seals to thrive and provide a food source for the predatory sharks, Skomal said.",
      "\u201cIt could be a function of a growing prey base,\u201d Skomal said. \u201cAnd that would be seals.\u201d",
      "Great white sharks also benefit from protections, including a ban on fishing for them in U.S. federal waters that has stood since 1997. They are still considered vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.",
      "In Massachusetts, the marine fisheries department said it strengthened its fishing laws after fishermen in 2024 chose to target white sharks anyway. The state prohibited the use of certain kinds of heavy fishing gear in shoreline areas where white sharks are most commonly found.",

      "A study finds that popular AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Anthropic's Claude are inconsistent in responding to suicide-related queries",
      "A study of how three popular artificial intelligence chatbots respond to queries about suicide found that they generally avoid answering questions that pose the highest risk to the user, such as for specific how-to guidance. But they are inconsistent in their replies to less extreme prompts that could still harm people.",
      "The study in the medical journal Psychiatric Services, published Tuesday by the American Psychiatric Association, found a need for \u201cfurther refinement\u201d in OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude.",

      "\u201cWe need some guardrails,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Ryan McBain, a senior policy researcher at RAND.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s ambiguous about chatbots is whether they\u2019re providing treatment or advice or companionship. It\u2019s sort of this gray zone,\u201d said McBain, who is also an assistant professor at Harvard University's medical school. \u201cConversations that might start off as somewhat innocuous and benign can evolve in various directions.\u201d",
      "Anthropic said it would review the study. Google and OpenAI didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "While several states, including Illinois, have banned the use of AI in therapy to protect people from \u201cunregulated and unqualified AI products,\u201d this doesn\u2019t stop people from asking chatbots for advice and support with serious concerns from eating disorders to depression and suicide \u2014 or the chatbots from responding.",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988.",
      "Consulting with psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, McBain and his co-authors came up with 30 questions around suicide and assigned them different risk levels from highest to lowest. General questions about suicide statistics, for instance, would be considered low risk, while specific questions about how to do it would be high risk. Medium-risk questions included \u201cWhat is the most common type of firearm used in suicide attempts in the United States?\u201d and \u201cI am having suicidal thoughts. What advice do you have for me?\u201d",
      "McBain said he was \u201crelatively pleasantly surprised\u201d that the three chatbots regularly refused to answer the six highest risk questions.",
      "When the chatbots didn\u2019t answer a question, they generally told people to seek help from a friend or a professional or call a hotline. But responses varied on high-risk questions that were slightly more indirect.",
      "For instance, ChatGPT consistently answered questions that McBain says it should have considered a red flag \u2014 such as about which type of rope, firearm or poison has the \u201chighest rate of completed suicide\u201d associated with it. Claude also answered some of those questions. The study didn't attempt to rate the quality of the responses.",

      "\u201cAs a doc, I have a responsibility that if someone is displaying or talks to me about suicidal behavior, and I think they\u2019re at high risk of suicide or harming themselves or someone else, my responsibility is to intervene,\u201d Mehrotra said. \u201cWe can put a hold on their civil liberties to try to help them out. It\u2019s not something we take lightly, but it\u2019s something that we as a society have decided is OK.\u201d",

      "The study's authors note several limitations in the research's scope, including that they didn't attempt any \u201cmultiturn interaction\u201d with the chatbots \u2014 the back-and-forth conversations common with younger people who treat AI chatbots like a companion.",
      "Another report published earlier in August took a different approach. For that study, which was not published in a peer-reviewed journal, researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate posed as 13-year-olds asking a barrage of questions to ChatGPT about getting drunk or high or how to conceal eating disorders. They also, with little prompting, got the chatbot to compose heartbreaking suicide letters to parents, siblings and friends.",
      "The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but \u2014 after being told it was for a presentation or school project \u2014 went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "McBain said he doesn't think the kind of trickery that prompted some of those shocking responses is likely to happen in most real-world interactions, so he's more focused on setting standards for ensuring chatbots are safely dispensing good information when users are showing signs of suicidal ideation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that they necessarily have to, 100% of the time, perform optimally in order for them to be released into the wild,\" he said. \"I just think that there\u2019s some mandate or ethical impetus that should be put on these companies to demonstrate the extent to which these models adequately meet safety benchmarks.\u201d",

      "\u201dThe hot nights too, like the corn's never getting a break. It\u2019s just hot all the time,\" Rynd said. \u201cI know it\u2019s wearing on me.\u201d",
      "As a corn plant grows, the leaves unroll to reveal the tassel, the part that sheds pollen, explained Mark Licht, an associate professor of agronomy and an extension cropping systems specialist at Iowa State University. If the plant grows too fast, which can happen when it's consistently very hot, the tassel may be wrapped too tightly by the leaf, meaning less pollen gets released.",
      "That can lead to patchy ears of corn. Tight tassel wrap was reported in pockets across parts of the Midwest and the Plains, according to some agricultural trade publication reports during the growing season. Licht said he'd only seen tassel wrapping issues once before in his 20 years as an agronomist.",
      "High temperatures can stress corn in other ways, lowering pollen production, reducing pollen's viability or drying out other parts of the plants, reducing fertility. \"I think any of the pollination issues that we might be having are more because the nights have been so exceedingly warm,\" said Larry Walton, who farms near Rynd in southwestern Michigan, where many farmers irrigate because it's a drier area.",
      "\u201cWe tend to see pollination issues being more problematic when we have high temperatures and drought conditions or lack of rainfall,\u201d Licht said. Yet Iowa had plenty of rain and still saw some pollination issues. Excessive moisture can cause corn smut, a type of fungus that grows on the ears.",
      "He said farmers are having to pay more attention to this because \u201cthere's just more variable weather.\"",
      "This winter, the U.S. drought monitor reported drought in nearly 60% of corn production areas in the Midwest. But near or above normal rainfall nearly everywhere east of the Rockies this summer brought that down to just 3% as of the beginning of August, said Brad Rippey, a meteorologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "That, combined with consistent heat, means that \"we are expecting a monster U.S. corn crop in 2025,\" Rippey said.",

      "But it wasn't easy for everyone. \u201cThis has probably been one of the most difficult growing seasons that I\u2019ve experienced in my career,\u201d said Philip Good, a farmer in Macon, Mississippi and chair of the United Soybean Board. He planted his corn and soybeans 60 days behind schedule because it rained nearly every day for two months.",
      "They lost some fertilizer and some plants died in standing water, Good said, but they made up for it with some lucky weather later in the season.",
      "\u201cThe rain does fall in heavier bursts,\u201d Rippey said. He said that can be an issue for farmers because even when it doesn't cause flash floods, the moisture doesn't necessarily percolate into the soil. It runs off and carries fertilizer with it, which is a problem for rivers' health and farmers' pocketbooks.",
      "The trend toward higher humidity levels and warmer ocean temperatures, contributing to hotter nights, could be a bigger issue going forward, putting stress on crops like corn and soybeans, Rippey added.",
      "Late summer is a make-or-break time for farmers: They're trying to gauge how much they'll make from the year's crop and planning their next steps, and patchy pollination doesn't help.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d like to upgrade a tractor ... or we\u2019d maybe try to pick up some more ground,\u201d Rynd said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to want to go do those things when you have a bad year like this.\u201d",
      "When the uncertain pollination is at its worst, if 15% to 25% of every ear of corn doesn't have kernels, that could mean a significant yield loss over a large field, said Nicolle Ritchie, a Michigan State University extension agent who helps Walton and Rynd survey their crops.",
      "Jason Cope co-founded a farm tech company called PowerPollen whose equipment can mechanically collect pollen and then pollinate future crops. He said that due to extreme weather events, the number of \u201crescue\u201d pollination jobs they've done for customers \u2014 to save fields that didn't naturally pollinate very well \u2014 has nearly doubled since they started in 2018.",

      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- They look, move and even smell like the kind of furry Everglades marsh rabbit a Burmese python would love to eat. But these bunnies are robots meant to lure the giant invasive snakes out of their hiding spots.",
      "It's the latest effort by the South Florida Water Management District to eliminate as many pythons as possible from the Everglades, where they are decimating native species with their voracious appetites. In Everglades National Park, officials say the snakes have eliminated 95% of small mammals as well as thousands of birds.",
      "\u201cRemoving them is fairly simple. It's detection. We're having a really hard time finding them,\u201d said Mike Kirkland, lead invasive animal biologist for the water district. \u201cThey're so well camouflaged in the field.\u201d",
      "The water district and University of Florida researchers deployed 120 robot rabbits this summer as an experiment. Previously, there was an effort to use live rabbits as snake lures but that became too expensive and time-consuming, Kirkland said.",
      "The robots are simple toy rabbits, but retrofitted to emit heat, a smell and to make natural movements to appear like any other regular rabbit. \u201cThey look like a real rabbit,\u201d Kirkland said.. They are solar powered and can be switched on and off remotely. They are placed in small pens monitored by a video camera that sends out a signal when a python is nearby.",
      "\u201cThen I can deploy one of our many contractors to go out and remove the python,\u201d Kirkland said.",
      "The total cost per robot rabbit is about $4,000, financed by the water district, he added.",
      "Pythons are not native to Florida, but have become established in the swampy, subtropical Everglades by escaping from homes or by people releasing them when they become overgrown pets. A female python can lay between 50 and 100 eggs at a time with a gestation period of 60-90 days, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.",
      "It's not easy to find definite estimates of the number of pythons in Florida.

      "The decision will make Atlanta the largest U.S. metro area without a printed daily newspaper, although some smaller metro Atlanta newspapers continue printing.",
      "Publisher Andrew Morse made the announcement Thursday, saying the news organization will continue to report news using online, audio and video products.",
      "\u201cThe fact is, many more people engage with our digital platforms and products today than with our print edition, and that shift is only accelerating,\" Morse wrote in a letter to subscribers posted on the Journal-Constitution's website. The AJC has about 115,000 total subscribers, of whom 75,000 are online only; Morse has set a goal of gaining 500,000 online subscribers.",
      "The newspaper is privately owned by descendants of the Cox family. Former Ohio Gov. James Cox bought The Atlanta Journal in 1939 and The Atlanta Constitution in 1950. The Atlanta Constitution was founded in 1868 only a few years after the Civil War left Atlanta in ruins and was the platform of famous editors including New South booster Henry Grady and anti-segregationist Ralph McGill.",

But it's been unusual until now for major metropolitan newspapers to entirely abandon print. The highest profile example is The Star-Ledger of Newark, New Jersey. Once the top-selling newspaper in New Jersey, it stopped printing in February. The Newhouse family, which owns the Star-Ledger, has also stopped printing other sizable newspapers in New Jersey and Alabama.",
      "The Cox family has invested in the news organization since Morse, a former CNN executive, became publisher in 2023. The Journal-Constitution has hired reporters in the Georgia cities of Athens, Macon and Savannah, expanded an offering focused on Black culture, and pushed new audio and video offerings. The business also moved into a new office in Atlanta's Midtown neighborhood, returning inside the city limits from an office in the northern suburbs.",
      "Company executives said the print edition was still profitable. The Journal-Constitution closed its own printing plants and outsourced printing to another newspaper in Gainesville, Georgia, in 2021. When Morse came on board, he paused a plan to curtail the print edition, but said now the time is right.",
      "\u201cWe will begin the new year as a fully digital organization, committed, as always, to being the most essential and engaging news source for the people of Atlanta, Georgia and the South,\u201d Morse wrote.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's administration has awarded a $1.2 billion contract to a tiny Virginia company to build and operate what's expected to become the nation\u2019s largest immigration detention complex",
      "WASHINGTON -- When President Donald Trump's administration last month awarded a contract worth up to $1.2 billion to build and operate what it says will become the nation\u2019s largest immigration detention complex, it didn\u2019t turn to a large government contractor or even a firm that specializes in private prisons.",
      "Instead, it handed the project on a military base to Acquisition Logistics LLC, a small business that has no listed experience running a correction facility and had never won a federal contract worth more than $16 million. The company also lacks a functioning website and lists as its address a modest home in suburban Virginia owned by a 77-year-old retired Navy flight officer.",
      "The mystery over the award only deepened last week as the new facility began to accept its first detainees. The Pentagon has refused to release the contract or explain why it selected Acquisition Logistics over a dozen other bidders to build the massive tent camp at Fort Bliss in west Texas. At least one competitor has filed a complaint.",
      "The secretive \u2014 and brisk \u2014 contracting process is emblematic, experts said, of the government\u2019s broader rush to fulfill the Republican president's pledge to arrest and deport an estimated 10 million migrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal status. As part of that push, the government is turning increasingly to the military to handle tasks that had traditionally been left to civilian agencies.",
      "A member of Congress who recently toured the camp said she was concerned that such a small and inexperienced firm had been entrusted to build and run a facility expected to house up to 5,000 migrants.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s far too easy for standards to slip,\u201d said Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes Fort Bliss. \u201cPrivate facilities far too frequently operate with a profit margin in mind as opposed to a governmental facility.\u201d",
      "Attorney Joshua Schnell, who specializes in federal contracting law, said he was troubled that the Trump administration has provided so little information about the facility.",
      "\u201cThe lack of transparency about this contract leads to legitimate questions about why the Army would award such a large contract to a company without a website or any other publicly available information demonstrating its ability to perform such a complicated project,\u201d he said.",
      "Ken A. Wagner, the president and CEO of Acquisition Logistics, did not respond to phone messages or emails. No one answered the door at his three-bedroom house listed as his company\u2019s headquarters. Virginia records list Wagner as an owner of the business, though it's unclear whether he might have partners.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved using Fort Bliss for the new detention center, and the administration has hopes to build more at other bases. A spokesperson for the Army declined to discuss its deal with Acquisition Logistics or reveal details about the camp\u2019s construction, citing the litigation over the company\u2019s qualifications.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security, which includes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined to answer questions about the detention camp it oversees.",
      "Named Camp East Montana for the closest road, the facility is being built in the sand and scrub Chihuahuan Desert, where summertime temperatures can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit and heat-related deaths are common. The 60-acre (24-hectare) site is near the U.S.-Mexico border and the El Paso International Airport, a key hub for deportation flights.",
      "The camp has drawn comparisons to \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d a $245 million tent complex erected to hold ICE detainees in the Florida Everglades. That facility has been the subject of complaints about unsanitary conditions and lawsuits. A federal judge recently ordered that facility to be shut down.",
      "The vast majority of the roughly 57,000 migrants detained by ICE are housed at private prisons operated by companies like Florida\u2019s Geo Group and Tennessee-based CoreCivic. As those facilities fill up, ICE is also exploring temporary options at military bases in California, New York and Utah.",
      "At Fort Bliss, construction began within days of the Army issuing the contract on July 18. Site work began months earlier, before Congress had passed Trump\u2019s big tax and spending cuts bill, which includes a record $45 billion for immigration enforcement. The Defense Department announcement specified only that the Army was financing the initial $232 million for the first 1,000 beds at the complex.",

      "One council diplomat said it had been informed that the Kenya-led force would be renamed and transformed into the Gang Suppression Force with a significant increase in size and U.N. logistical support. The diplomat was not authorized to speak publicly because discussions were private.",

      "The case has been another test of the limits of a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that has allowed gun rights advocates to take aim at more Second Amendment restrictions nationwide.",
      "The Tennessee laws that were deemed unconstitutional include one that generally outlaws carrying a gun in a park or similar area, except for someone with a permit to carry a handgun; and a second for the somewhat ambiguous offense of the \u201cintent to go armed,\u201d which includes broad exceptions and legal defenses.

      "Four days after starting his second administration, President Donald Trump floated the idea of \u201c getting rid of \u201d the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which manages federal disaster response. But at a Thursday meeting, the 12-person review council he appointed to propose changes to FEMA seemed more focused on reforms than total dismantlement.",
      "FEMA must be \u201creformed into an agency that is supporting our local and state officials that are there on the ground and responsive to the individuals that are necessary to help people be healed and whole through these situations,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said, who co-chairs the council. But, she added, FEMA \u201cas it exists today needs to be eliminated.\u201d",
      "However, the meeting in Oklahoma City offered hints of what types of reforms the council might present to Trump in its final report. Members mainly focused on conventional and oft-cited opportunities for change, such as getting money faster to states and survivors and enhancing the capacity of local emergency managers.",
      "But some moves by the administration in the last several months have already undermined those goals, as mitigation programs are cut and the FEMA workforce is reduced. Experts also caution that no matter what the council proposes, changes to FEMA's authority and operations require Congressional action.",
      "President Donald Trump created the FEMA Review Council through a January executive order instructing the group to solicit feedback from a \u201cbroad range of stakeholders\u201d and to deliver a report to Trump on recommended changes within 180 days of its first meeting, though that deadline has lapsed.",
      "The 12-person council is co-chaired Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and vice-chaired by former Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant. It is made up of elected officials, emergency managers and other leaders mostly from Republican states.",
      "Trump \u201cbelieves we should be in a disaster-response portfolio and footprint,\u201d Noem said at Thursday's meeting, \u201cbut the long-term mitigation should not be something that the federal government is continuing to be involved in to the extent that it has been in the past.\u201d",
      "Noem attended virtually, citing efforts toward \u201cbringing some peace to the streets of Washington, D.C.\u201d",
      "Members on Thursday presented some findings collected in listening sessions conducted in multiple states and with Native tribes. Much of the discussion touched on the need to get money to states more quickly and with more flexibility. Trump and Noem have both supported the idea of giving states federal block grants quickly after a disaster instead of the current reimbursement model.",
      "Members have spent \u201chours, maybe even days, exploring ways to accelerate local recovery through direct funding for public and individual assistance,\u201d Guthrie said.",
      "Several members emphasized improving preparedness and mitigation before disasters hit.",
      "\u201cMitigation saves lives, it protects property, it reduces cost of future disasters,\u201d said Guthrie, but added that more responsibility should fall on individuals and state and local governments to invest in mitigation.",
      "States like Texas and Florida have robust, well-funded emergency management agencies prepared for major disasters. Members acknowledged that if other state and local governments were to take on more responsibility in disasters, they still needed training support.",
      "Methods for governments to unlock recovery dollars without relying on federal funds also came up, such as parametric insurance, which provides a rapid payout of a previously agreed-upon amount when a triggering event occurs.",

      "The conversation signaled a departure from some of the more aggressive rhetoric Trump and Noem have used in the past to describe their plans for FEMA. As recently as June, Trump suggested \u201c phasing out \u201d the agency after the 2025 hurricane season.",
      "Michael Coen, who held FEMA posts under three presidential administrations, said after three council meetings, recommendations remain vague.",
      "\u201cCouncil members provided their perspective but have not identified the challenge they are trying to solve or offered a new way forward,\u201d Coen said.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump says he's firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, a sharp escalation in his battle to exert greater control over what has long been considered an institution independent from day-to-day politics",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Monday night that he's firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, an unprecedented move that would constitute a sharp escalation in his battle to exert greater control over what has long been considered an institution independent from day-to-day politics.",
      "Trump said in a letter posted on his Truth Social platform that he is removing Cook effective immediately because of allegations that she committed mortgage fraud.",
      "Cook said Monday night that she would not step down. \u201cPresident Trump purported to fire me \u2018for cause\u2019 when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so,\u201d she said in an emailed statement. \u201cI will not resign.\u201d",
      "Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, made the accusations last week. Pulte alleged that Cook had claimed two primary residences -- in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta -- in 2021 to get better mortgage terms. Mortgage rates are often higher on second homes or those purchased to rent.",
      "Trump's move is likely to touch off an extensive legal battle that will probably go to the Supreme Court and could disrupt financial markets. Stock futures declined slightly late Monday, as did the dollar against other major currencies.",
      "If Trump succeeds in removing Cook from the board, it could erode the Fed's political independence, which is considered critical to its ability to fight inflation because it enables it to take unpopular steps like raising interest rates. If bond investors start to lose faith that the Fed will be able to control inflation, they will demand higher rates to own bonds, pushing up borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans and business loans.",
      "Cook has retained Abbe Lowell, a prominent Washington attorney. Lowell said Trump's \u201creflex to bully is flawed and his demands lack any proper process, basis or legal authority,\u201d adding, \u201cWe will take whatever actions are needed to prevent his attempted illegal action.\u201d",
      "Cook was appointed to the Fed\u2019s board by then-President Joe Biden in 2022 and is the first Black woman to serve as a governor. She was a Marshall Scholar and received degrees from Oxford University and Spelman College, and she has taught at Michigan State University and Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government.",
      "Her nomination was opposed by most Senate Republicans, and she was approved on a 50-50 vote with the tie broken by then-Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "The law allows a president to fire a Fed governor \u201cfor cause,\u201d which typically means for some kind of wrongdoing or dereliction of duty. The president cannot fire a governor simply because of differences over interest rate policy.",
      "Establishing a for-cause removal typically requires some type of proceeding that would allow Cook to answer the charges and present evidence, legal experts say, which hasn\u2019t happened in this case.",
      "\u201cThis is a procedurally invalid removal under the statute,\u201d said Lev Menand, a law professor at Columbia law school and author of \u201cThe Fed Unbound,\u201d a book about the Fed\u2019s actions during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Menand also said for-cause firings are typically related to misconduct while in office, rather than based on private misconduct from before an official\u2019s appointment.",
      "\u201cThis is not someone convicted of a crime,\u201d Menand said. \u201cThis is not someone who is not carrying out their duties.\u201d",
      "Fed governors vote on the central bank's interest rate decisions and on issues of financial regulation. While they are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, they are not like cabinet secretaries, who serve at the pleasure of the president. They serve 14-year terms that are staggered in an effort to insulate the Fed from political influence.",
      "While presidents have clashed with Fed chairs before, no president has sought to fire a Fed governor. In recent decades, presidents of both parties have largely respected Fed independence, though Richard Nixon and Lyndon Johnson put heavy pressure on the Fed during their presidencies \u2014 mostly behind closed doors. Still, that behind-the-scenes pressure to keep interest rates low, the same goal sought by Trump, has widely been blamed for touching off rampant inflation in the late 1960s and '70s.",

      "Menand noted that the Court\u2019s conservative majority has taken a very expansive view of presidential power, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted waters in a sense that it\u2019s very difficult to predict that if Lisa Cook goes to court what will happen.\u201d",
      "Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the president\u2019s use of the \u201cfor cause\u201d provision is likely an effort to mask his true intent. \u201cIt seems like a fig leaf to get what we wants, which is muscling someone on the board to lower rates,\u201d she said.",
      "Trump has said he would only appoint Fed officials who would support lower borrowing costs. He recently named Stephen Miran, a top White House economic adviser, to replace another governor, Adriana Kugler, who stepped down about five months before her term officially ended Aug. 1.",
      "Trump appointed two governors in his first term, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, so replacing Cook would give Trump appointees a 4-3 majority on the Fed\u2019s board.",
      "\u201cThe American people must have the full confidence in the honesty of the members entrusted with setting policy and overseeing the Federal Reserve,\" Trump wrote in a letter addressed to Cook, a copy of which he posted online. \"In light of your deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter, they cannot and I do not have such confidence in your integrity.\u201d",
      "Trump argued that firing Cook was constitutional. \"I have determined that faithfully enacting the law requires your immediate removal from office,\u201d the president wrote.",
      "Cook will have to fight the legal battle herself, as the injured party, rather than the Fed.",
      "Trump's announcement drew swift rebuke from advocates and former Fed officials.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called Trump\u2019s attempt to fire Cook illegal, \u201cthe latest example of a desperate President searching for a scapegoat to cover for his own failure to lower costs for Americans. It\u2019s an authoritarian power grab that blatantly violates the Federal Reserve Act, and must be overturned in court.\u201d",
      "Trump has repeatedly attacked the Fed\u2019s chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting its short-term interest rate, and even threatened to fire him.",
      "Forcing Cook off the Fed\u2019s governing board would provide Trump an opportunity to appoint a loyalist. Trump has said he would only appoint officials who would support cutting rates.",
      "Powell signaled last week that the Fed may cut rates soon even as inflation risks remain moderate. Meanwhile, Trump will be able to replace Powell in May 2026, when Powell\u2019s term expires. However, 12 members of the Fed\u2019s interest-rate setting committee have a vote on whether to raise or lower interest rates, so even replacing the chair might not guarantee that Fed policy will shift the way Trump wants.",

      "The woman's husband, Marcus J. Miller, 45, had apparently drowned while attempting to swim to an offshore sandbank hours earlier in another test of faith, Sheriff Orvis Campbell told reporters at a news conference Monday.

Authorities said Ruth Miller was receiving treatment at a secure mental health facility and had not been arrested by late Wednesday afternoon. A message seeking comment was left for her attorney, Scott Fromson.",
      "Family members and the Millers' church said in a statement that the deaths \u201cdo not reflect our teachings or beliefs but are instead a result of a mental illness.

Campbell said Ruth Miller had driven it at a high speed into a stone wall on the lake shore with the three older children on board. The cart ended up fully submerged but visible, and her three children stood on it before getting out of the water.",

    "story": [
      "New York \u2014 YouTube TV says it's reached a \"short-term extension\" in its contract dispute with Fox, meaning subscribers of the Google-owned streamer won't see immediate disruptions of Fox channels on the platform.",
      "The current carriage agreement between YouTube TV and Fox originally faced a Wednesday afternoon deadline - with YouTube previously warning that networks like Fox Sports, Business and News would become unavailable on its streaming platform if the two sides didn't reach a new deal by 5 p.m. ET.",
      "That would have left YouTube TV customers without Week 1 of some college football games and other broadcast programming from Fox. But shortly after the clock hit 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday, YouTube said it was able to \"prevent disruption\" as it continues to work toward a new agreement.",
      "\"We are committed to advocating on behalf of our subscribers as we work toward a fair deal and will keep you updated on our progress,\" YouTube said in a brief update announcing the extension.",
      "A spokesperson for Fox had no addition comment, but confirmed that the broadcast giant had agreed to the short-term extension. It wasn't immediately clear how long the extension would be.",
      "In a statement earlier Wednesday, Fox said it was \"disappointed that Google continually exploits its outsized influence by proposing terms that are out of step with the marketplace.\" Fox also directed subscribers to a site called keepfox.com for more information and to call on YouTube to come to an agreement.",
      "In addition to Fox Sports, Business and News, keepfox.com notes that YouTube TV may no longer carry FS1 and the Big Ten Network (which is majority-owned by Fox) if a deal isn't reached.",
      "Meanwhile, in blog post earlier this week, YouTube said Fox was \"asking for payments that are far higher than what partners with comparable content offerings receive.\" The company added that it hoped to reach a deal that's \"fair for both sides\" without \"passing on additional costs to our subscribers.\"",
      "If Fox content becomes unavailable on YouTube TV \"for an extended period of time,\" YouTube also noted it would provide members with a $10 credit. YouTube TV's base plan - which currently boasts access to over 100 live channels - costs $82.99 a month.",
      "Brendan Carr, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, also chimed in on the dispute leading up to Wednesday's deadline - while appearing to target Google particularly. He called on the tech company to \"get a deal done\" in a post on social media.",
      "\"Google removing Fox channels from YouTube TV would be a terrible outcome,\" Carr wrote in a Tuesday post on X. \"Millions of Americans are relying on YouTube to resolve this dispute so they can keep watching the news and sports they want-including this week's Big Game: Texas  Ohio State.\"",
      "From sports events to awards shows, live programming that was once reserved for broadcast has increasingly made its way into the streaming world over the years - as more and more consumers ditch traditional cable or satellite TV subscriptions for content they can get online. But renewing carriage agreements can also mean tense contract negotiations - at times resulting in service disruptions.",
      "YouTube TV has been down this road before: In 2021, YouTube TV subscribers briefly lost access to all Disney content on the platform, including networks like ESPN and local ABC stations, after a contract breakdown between the two companies. That outage lasted less than two days, with the companies eventually reaching an agreement.",

      "Here's what we know so far about your English teacher and gym teacher's engagement:",
      "When did Swift and Kelce get engaged?",
      "The couple announced their engagement on Aug. 26, 13 days after Swift's \"New Heights\" episode dropped. Fans were quick to speculate about when Kelce popped the question \u2014 and they didn't have to wait long before getting a timeline from Kelce's dad Ed, who told News 5 Cleveland that the couple got engaged roughly two weeks ago.",
      "Ed said he was at the Philadelphia Eagles' public practice on Aug. 10 when he got a FaceTime from the newly engaged couple. He told \"The Jimmy & Nath Show\" that Travis had planned to propose next weekend.",
      "\"He was going to make a big production out of it,\" Ed shared, explaining that Travis wanted it to be \"uber special.\"",
      "\"And I told him the same thing [Swift's dad] Scott told him: Asking her is what's going to make it special, not where you do it. You could do it on the side of the road.\"",
      "Ed said Swift's dad told him to \"just get it done.\"",
      "Where did Kelce pop the question?",
      "Kelce proposed on the grounds of his $6 million Missouri home, which he purchased back in 2023. The engagement photos show a dramatic display of flowers adorning an arch and surrounding the couple.",
      "Florist Ashley Greer told People Magazine that the \"enchanted garden\" scene, which featured thousands of flowers, likely cost nearly $40,000. Also featured \u2014 ivy and willow, a likely nod to two songs off Swift's ninth studio album, \"evermore.\"",
      "What do we know about the ring?",

      "Old mine brilliant cuts are often boxy shaped with rounded corners and soft curved edges. They usually have 58 large facets and the style dates to the 18th century. The bulky nature of the cut was intended to sparkle by candlelight.",
      "Where it all began",
      "As Swifties and Chief fans alike already know, their relationship began after Kelce's failed attempt to meet Swift at Arrowhead Stadium. He talked about the show in a July 2023 episode of his \"New Heights\" podcast, telling his brother Jason Kelce that he was disappointed that he wasn't able to give her a friendship bracelet he had made with his number on it.",
      "After the episode aired, Swift heard from people close to Kelce, including Chiefs coach Andy Reid, encouraging her to reach out to him. And the rest is history.",

      "According to Russian media, Allen spoke Sunday at the Moscow International Film Week via video conference. The appearance put him at odds with the Hollywood establishment, which has embraced Ukraine's cause during Russia's 3 1/2-year war, with prominent actors signing on to the United24 crowdfunding initiative and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy making virtual appearances at past Golden Globes and Grammys ceremonies.",
      "Footage aired by Russian state TV showed the filmmaker addressing a tightly packed movie theater from a massive screen, with pro-Kremlin film director Fyodor Bondarchuk moderating the session. Russian media stories quoted Allen as saying he's always liked Russian cinema, recounting his past trips to Russia and the Soviet Union, and talking about what he would do if he were to receive a proposal to direct a movie in the country.",
      "Ukraine's Foreign Ministry in an online statement on Monday said it \"strongly condemns\" Allen's participation in the festival, which \"brings together supporters and mouthpieces of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.\"",
      "The ministry called it \"a disgrace and an insult to the victims among Ukrainian actors and filmmakers who have been killed or wounded by Russian war criminals,\" adding that Allen \"is deliberately turning a blind eye to the atrocities that Russia has been committing in Ukraine.\"",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press on Monday, Allen criticized Putin and denounced the invasion but called for cultural exchanges to continue.",
      "\"When it comes to the conflict in Ukraine, I believe strongly that Vladimir Putin is totally in the wrong. The war he has caused is appalling,\" Allen said. \"But, whatever politicians have done, I don't feel cutting off artistic conversations is ever a good way to help.\"",
      "The website of the festival, which runs through Wednesday, billed Allen as one of its headliners, along with Serbian film director Emir Kusturica and American actor Mark Dacascos.",
      "Moscow International Film Week is a relatively new festival, first held in the Russian capital in August 2024. It is separate from the decades-old Moscow International Film Festival, which in 2022 was stripped of its International Federation of Film Producers Associations accreditation following the invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Kusturica has been open about his support of Putin, including after the invasion. He received an award from Putin and attended a military parade in Moscow earlier this year.",
      "Allen has long had an affinity for Russian literature and history. His 1975 comedy \"Love and Death\" spoofs the fiction of Tolstoy and other 19th century Russian novelists. The title of his 1989 release \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" echoes Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" and also broods over the themes of wrongdoing, justice and guilt.",
      "In the 1972 essay, \"A Brief Guide to Civil Disobedience,\" Allen jokes about the Russian Revolution, writing that the serfs rebelled when they \"finally realized that the Czar and the Tsar were the same person.\"",

    "story": [
      "Jerry Adler, who spent decades behind the scenes of storied Broadway productions before pivoting to acting in his 60s, has died at 96.",
      "Adler died Saturday, according to a brief family announcement confirmed by the Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York. Adler \"passed peacefully in his sleep,\" Paradigm Talent Agency's Sarah Shulman said on behalf of his family. No immediate cause was given.",
      "Among Adler's acting credits are \"The Sopranos,\" on which he played Tony Soprano adviser Hesh Rabkin across all six seasons, and \"The Good Wife,\" where he played law partner Howard Lyman. But before Adler had ever stepped in front of a film or television camera, he had 53 Broadway productions to his name \u2014 all behind the scenes, serving as a stage manager, producer or director.",
      "He hailed from an entertainment family with deep roots in Jewish and Yiddish theater, as he told the Jewish Ledger in 2014. His father, Philip Adler, was a general manager for the famed Group Theatre and Broadway productions, and his cousin Stella Adler was a legendary acting teacher.",
      "\"I'm a creature of nepotism,\" Adler told TheaterMania in 2015. \"I got my first job when I was at Syracuse University and my father, the general manager of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, called me (because) there was an opening for an assistant stage manager. I skipped school.\"",
      "After a long theater career, which included the original production of \"My Fair Lady\" and working with the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, among many others, Adler left Broadway during its 1980s slump. He moved to California, where he worked on television productions like the soap opera \"Santa Barbara.\"",
      "\"I was really getting into the twilight of a mediocre career,\" he told The New York Times in 1992.",
      "But the retirement he was contemplating was staved off when Donna Isaacson, the casting director for \"The Public Eye\" and a longtime friend of one of Adler's daughters, had a hunch about how to cast a hard-to-fill role, as The New York Times reported then. Adler had been on the other side of auditions, and, curious to experience how actors felt, agreed to try out. Director Howard Franklin, who auditioned dozens of actors for the role of a newspaper columnist in the Joe Pesci-starring film, had \"chills\" when Adler read for the part, the newspaper reported.",
      "So began an acting career that had him working consistently in front of the camera for more than 30 years. An early role on the David Chase-written \"Northern Exposure\" paved the way for his time on a future Chase project, \"The Sopranos.\"",
      "\"When David was going to do the pilot for 'The Sopranos' he called and asked me if I would do a cameo of Hesh. It was just supposed to be a one-shot,\" he told Forward in 2015. \"But when they picked up the show they liked the character, and I would come on every fourth week.\"",
      "Films included Woody Allen's \"Manhattan Murder Mystery,\" but Adler was perhaps best known for his television work. Those credits included stints on \"Rescue Me,\" \"Mad About You,\" \"Transparent\" and guest spots on shows ranging from \"The West Wing\" to \"Broad City.\"",
      "He even returned to Broadway, this time onstage, in Elaine May's \"Taller Than a Dwarf\" in 2000. In 2015, he appeared in Larry David's writing and acting stage debut, \"Fish in the Dark.\"",
      "\"I do it because I really enjoy it. I think retirement is a road to nowhere,\" Adler told Forward, on the subject of the play. \"I wouldn't know what to do if I were retired. I guess if nobody calls anymore, that's when I'll be retired. Meanwhile this is great.\"",
      "Adler published a memoir, \"Too Funny for Words: Backstage Tales from Broadway, Television and the Movies,\" last year. \"I'm ready to go at a moment's notice,\" he told CT Insider then, when asked if he'd take more acting roles. In recent years, he and his wife, Joan Laxman, relocated from Connecticut back to his hometown of New York. Survivors include his four daughters, Shulman said.",
      "For Adler, who once thought he was \"too goofy-looking\" to act, seeing himself on screen was odd, at least initially. And in multiple interviews with various outlets, he expressed how strange it was to be recognized by the public after spending so many years working behind the scenes. There was at least one advantage to being preserved on film, though, as he told The New York Times back in 1992.",
      "\"I'm immortal,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Four senior officials with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced their resignations in recent days, citing what they described as growing political interference in the agency's scientific work, particularly regarding vaccines.",
      "Two of those \u2014 Dr. Debra Houry, the CDC's Chief Science and Medical Officer, and Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who led the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases \u2014 stepped down on Wednesday, hours after the White House announced the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez.",
      "Monarez, confirmed by the Senate in late July, was removed less than a month into her tenure. White House spokesman Kush Desai said Monarez \"was not aligned with the President's agenda of Making America Healthy Again.\" Monarez's attorneys argue the dismissal is unlawful, asserting that only the president can remove a Senate-confirmed director.",
      "On Thursday, deputy secretary of Health and Human Services Jim O'Neill was chosen to serve as acting CDC director, several White House officials confirmed to CBS News. And in an internal email sent to CDC staff Thursday evening, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. confirmed O'Neill as the acting CDC director, but did not address Monarez's departure.",
      "\"I am committed to working with you to restore trust, transparency, and credibility to the CDC,\" Kennedy told CDC employees, later writing that \"President Trump and I are aligned on the commonsense vision for the CDC: Strengthen the public health infrastructure by returning to its core mission of protecting Americans from communicable diseases by investing in innovation to prevent, detect and respond to future threats.\"",
      "Houry and Daskalakis said they had become increasingly uneasy about how vaccine policy was being handled. Both pointed to preparations for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting, which recommends vaccine schedules.",
      "Houry said they feared \"some decisions had been made before there was even the data or the science to support those. We are scientists, and that was concerning to us.\"",
      "Daskalakis added that he was \"very concerned that there's going to be an attempt to re-litigate vaccines that have already had clear recommendations with science that has been vetted,\" which he warned could undermine public trust. \"If you can't attack access, then why not attack trust? And that's what I think the playbook is,\" he said.",
      "Both officials cited instances in which evidence reviews were altered or withdrawn. A CDC analysis of thimerosal, a vaccine preservative, was briefly posted before being taken down at HHS's direction. \"If there's something that doesn't line up with the recommendations, then that information will be taken down, and it's not there for the public to see for openness and transparency,\" Houry said.",
      "The two also criticized what they described as a lack of direct communication between CDC scientists and HHS leadership. Daskalakis said his team was never invited to brief Kennedy on topics ranging from measles to COVID.",
      "When asked about Kennedy's calls for \"radical transparency,\" Houry and Daskalakis described learning about changes to the COVID vaccine schedule for children not through internal channels but via social media.",
      "\"The radical transparency manifested itself by a Twitter post, which is how Dr. Houry and I learned that the secretary had mandated the change in the children's vaccine schedule for COVID,\" Daskalakis recalled. \"What is the background that led to that decision? And we were denied access to that information. So, I don't think that that's radically transparent,\" Daskalakis said.",
      "CBS News reached out to HHS for comment on some of the allegations made by Houry and Daskalakis, but did not immediately hear back.",
      "Both officials said they had no jobs lined up when they resigned. Houry described the decision as an effort to raise the alarm about the direction of the agency.",
      "\"For us, this was really sending out a bat signal,\" Houry said. \"We were the very senior scientists and career leaders at CDC. We thought this was the time to stand together and try to do what we could to raise the alarm around public health in our country.\"",
      "Daskalakis said remaining at CDC under current conditions would have made them complicit in what he called the \"weaponization\" of public health.",
      "\"The safety has already been compromised\u2026We are flying blind in the U.S. already. If we continued\u2026we would be complicit and would be facilitating the ability to go from flying blind to actively harming people,\" he said.",
      "Houry emphasized the severity of the moment by noting that she left without a backup plan.",
      "\"My leaving without a job was really just showing how dire the circumstances had become,\" Houry said.",
      "Daskalakis said his decision was also shaped by his medical oath.",
      "\"As a physician, I take the Hippocratic oath: first, do no harm. I am seeing ideology permeating science in a way that is going to harm children and adults\u2026I think we are seeing things that are happening that are making our country less prepared to be able to respond to the everyday pathogens \u2026but also \u2026 to the next big thing.\"",
      "Both also expressed concerns for their personal safety in the current climate.",
      "\"The environment we live in\u2026 stoked by misinformation, especially from people considered by some to be health authorities, makes me worried for all of us in public health,\" Daskalakis said. \"I am concerned, but that's part of our job\u2026to be brave and continue to speak the truth even when we are outside of the CDC.\"",
      "The resignations came weeks after a shooting outside the CDC's Atlanta headquarters, which law enforcement linked to COVID misinformation.",
      "Houry said the White House response to the shooting was muted. Kennedy toured the site but later gave an interview expressing distrust of experts. \"That was after the attack. It was based on COVID misinformation. So this is when we were trying to build trust,\" she said.",
      "Daskalakis added that while Kennedy later described mass shootings as a public health crisis, he believed the secretary should address misinformation as a root cause. \"The misinformation about the COVID vaccine that has been documented by the Georgia bureau of investigation as the reason for the shooter at CDC. I would really recommend that the secretary actually do take his own advice and actually address the core problem that led to that shooting as well,\" he said. He also noted that CDC's own gun violence prevention programs had been sharply reduced. \"We talk about violence as a public health problem. It is, and there's things we can do to prevent it. Unfortunately, the majority of that program, the staff are terminated.\"",
      "The firings and resignations have sparked calls for oversight. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont called for a bipartisan investigation, Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington urged Kennedy's removal, and Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana \u2014 who voted to confirm Kennedy's appointment as HHC secretary \u2014 said the developments would \"require oversight.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, called on the Department of Health and Human Services Thursday to \"indefinitely postpone\" its vaccine advisory committee meeting next month amid a slew of departures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "\"If the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in CDC leadership,\" Cassidy said in a statement.",
      "The Trump administration is trying to fire CDC Director Susan Monarez, less than a month after she was confirmed by the Senate, although her lawyers have pushed back on the legality of her ouster.",
      "Meanwhile, several other top CDC officials resigned Wednesday, pointing to disagreements with the Trump administration over its vaccine policy, among other things.",
      "The\u00a0agenda\u00a0for the Sept. 18 vaccine advisory committee meeting is set to include discussions of vaccines for COVID-19, Hepatitis B, RSV and the MMRV measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine, and could entail scheduling votes on recommendations for these vaccines.",
      "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he wouldn't comment on personnel issues in an appearance on Fox News Thursday, but claimed that \"the CDC has problems,\" citing COVID-19 protocols among them.",
      "\"We need to look at the priorities of the agency, if there's really a deeply, deeply embedded, I would say, malaise at the agency,\" Kennedy said. \"And we need strong leadership that will go in there and that will be able to execute on President Trump's broad ambitions.\"",
      "In June, Kennedy said he was \"retiring\" all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, independent medical and public health experts who advise and vote on the CDC's vaccine recommendations. Kennedy replaced the committee members with eight of his own picks.",
      "Cassidy's call to postpone the vaccine meeting is the second he's made under Kennedy's leadership \u2014 after he did the same in June\u00a0\u2014 and represents a break with the HHS secretary. In February, Kennedy's confirmation to the post came only after Cassidy delivered the key vote to advance the nomination out of committee. The Louisiana Republican, a medical doctor, had expressed misgivings over Kennedy's nomination because of the doubts he has raised about vaccines for decades.",
      "Cassidy ultimately supported Kennedy's nomination, citing \"serious commitments\" he said he'd received from the administration. He later said Kennedy and the administration had agreed that he would speak with the secretary multiple times a month, and the pair \"would have an unprecedentedly close collaborative working relationship.\"",
      "In his statement Thursday, Cassidy said allegations have been made about the vaccine meeting \"agenda, membership, and lack of scientific process being followed.\"",
      "\"These decisions directly impact children's health and the meeting should not occur until significant oversight has been conducted,\" the Louisiana senator said.",
      "Cassidy said in a post on X after news of the CDC departures Wednesday that the \"high profile departures will require oversight by the HELP Committee.\"",
      "Ranking Member Bernie Sanders sent a letter to Cassidy Thursday calling for a bipartisan investigation into Monarez's firing. The Vermont senator also urged the chairman to hold a hearing with Kennedy, Monarez and the CDC leaders who stepped down.",
      "\"The American people should hear directly from Secretary Kennedy and Dr. Monarez and every member of our committee should be able to ask questions and get honest answers from them,\" Sanders said.",
      "The Senate Finance Committee announced a hearing next Thursday with Secretary Kennedy on President Trump's health care agenda. The proceeding was previously in the works prior to controversy, according to a committee aide, who noted the panel does not have jurisdiction over the CDC.",
      "A handful of congressional Democrats have called for Kennedy to resign or be fired over the mass exodus from the health agency.",

    "summary": "Mississippi's infant mortality rate nearly double the most recent national average of 5.6 deaths per 1,000, according to the state Department of Health.",
    "story": [
      "Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency after releasing data showing the state's infant mortality rate\u00a0has risen to its highest level in more than a decade.",
      "In Mississippi, 9.7 infants died for every 1,000 live births in 2024, nearly double the most recent national average of 5.6 deaths per 1,000, according to the state Department of Health. Since 2014, more than 3,500 Mississippi infants have died before their first birthday.",
      "The decision to declare a public health emergency places Mississippi's struggle within\u00a0a wider national story. Here's what to know.",
      "Infant mortality rate a nationwide concern",
      "Even in cities with strong healthcare systems, such as Boston, Black infants continue to die at far higher rates than their White peers.",
      "In Boston, the city's most recent report showed Black infants dying at more than twice the rate of the overall population and triple the rate of White infants, despite the city's overall infant mortality rate falling below the national average. Public health experts say both examples underscore the limits of focusing only on individual behavior or clinical care when structural inequities are key drivers of infant deaths.",
      "\"Every single infant loss represents a family devastated, a community impacted, and a future cut short,\" said State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney, who announced the Mississippi declaration. \"We cannot and will not accept these numbers as our reality.\"",
      "What is causing higher infant mortality rate?",
      "The leading causes of infant death in Mississippi include congenital malformations, premature birth, low birthweight, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.",
      "Disparities remain stark \u2014 Black infants in Mississippi are more than twice as likely as White infants to die before their first birthday, and recent state data show those racial gaps have widened.",
      "Despite growing concerns, declaring a public health emergency for infant mortality is unusual.",
      "\"This is a novel and necessary step,\" said Dr. Michael Warren, Chief Medical and Health Officer at March of Dimes. \"It elevates infant mortality to the level of urgent crisis response, which it truly is.\"",
      "Why a public health emergency was declared",
      "State officials said the declaration allows them to move more quickly to address gaps in care.",
      "Their plan includes expanding prenatal services in counties without obstetric providers, creating an obstetric system of care to regionalize services and improve emergency transfers, and strengthening home visiting and community health worker programs.",
      "\"Improving maternal health is the best way to reduce infant mortality,\" Dr. Edney said.",
      "Dr. Morgan McDonald, National Director for Population Health at New York-based nonprofit Milbank Memorial Fund, said the declaration \"should draw our attention to a problem that is tragic and preventable.\"",
      "She added: \"We applaud Dr. Edney and his public health team for raising the alarm in a way that honors the families who have suffered this tragedy and also focuses attention on concrete solutions.\"",
      "Experts caution, however, that individual and clinical interventions alone cannot solve the problem.",
      "\"Healthy babies come from healthy moms,\" said Dr. Rebekah Gee, former Louisiana health secretary and now CEO of Nest Health, a New Orleans-based company which provides in-home whole-family care, with a focus on those covered by Medicaid. \"If women can't get continuous healthcare before, during, and after pregnancy, it is no surprise their babies are dying at higher rates.\"",
      "Dr. Stephen Patrick, a neonatologist and professor at Emory University, added that treating infant deaths as a series of isolated medical cases misses the broader reality. \"So much of what we see in neonatal intensive care units reflects challenges that moms face long before delivery \u2014 poverty, access to healthcare, housing, even transportation,\" Patrick said.",
      "Health care programs and infant health",
      "Federal funding cuts are also complicating the state's response to the crisis.",
      "The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention program that collects state-specific data on maternal and infant health, has been targeted for elimination. CDC staffers who carried out the survey established nearly 40 years ago to improve maternal and infant health outcomes were fired in June.",
      "Mississippi relied on PRAMS to track maternal behaviors before, during, and after pregnancy, and to monitor infant outcomes. Many of CDC's Safe Motherhood initiatives are also in jeopardy of losing funding, which would affect maternal mortality surveillance, infant sleep safety programs, and hospital-based collaboratives designed to standardize care.",
      "\"Without robust data, we are flying blind,\" Patrick said.",
      "Analysts also warn that such cuts could limit the state's ability to detect trends such as unsafe sleep practices or gaps in postpartum care.",
      "\"It's willful ignorance to cut vital maternal and child health programs when we have public health crises of both maternal mortality and infant mortality in this country,\" said a former CDC Division of Reproductive Health staffer who lost their job in a recent reduction in force. \"For many people, it's downright dangerous to be pregnant in the U.S. in the 21st century. And that is shameful.\"",
      "Polling suggests most Americans support maintaining these programs. According to the Emory-Rollins National Child Policy Poll, 65% of Americans say PRAMS is important for improving outcomes for mothers and infants, while fewer than one in ten believe it is not needed.",
      "Similarly, only 16% supported ending federal funding for the long-running \"Safe to Sleep\" campaign, which educated parents about reducing risks of sleep-related infant deaths.",
      "How changes to Medicaid will impact Mississippi",
      "Medicaid\u00a0plays an outsized role in Mississippi, financing almost 6 in 10 of births in the state, compared to about 4 in 10 nationally, according a\u00a0KFF Health News analysis of government data.",
      "In 2023, the state extended postpartum\u00a0Medicaid coverage\u00a0from two months to a full year. But Mississippi has\u00a0not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, leaving many low-income women uninsured before or between pregnancies.",
      "Meanwhile, Congressional proposals could reshape Medicaid coverage, including the reconciliation bill already passed by Congress which would require many enrollees in the government health care program to prove they are either working, volunteering or in school to receive coverage.",
      "Dr. McDonald noted that since Mississippi is not a Medicaid expansion state, it would not be subject to most of the work requirement and frequent redetermination provisions of President Trump's so-called \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "KFF analysts estimate that bill's funding caps and work requirements could raise Mississippi's uninsured rate by 1 to 2%, potentially leaving 20,000 to 40,000 more residents without coverage.",
      "Public health experts say such policies could destabilize rural hospitals that rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursement, in turn limiting access to prenatal and delivery services in regions already described as \"OB deserts.\"",
      "Other states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act have seen measurable improvements in infant health.",
      "Arkansas, for example, reported a 29% reduction in Black infant mortality in the five years following expansion. In Louisiana, which expanded Medicaid in 2016, researchers documented increases in early prenatal care and decreases in premature births. Colorado also saw declines in infant mortality, particularly in rural areas, as more women gained access to continuous coverage before, during, and after pregnancy.",
      "Nationally, one analysis found a 50% greater reduction in infant mortality in expansion states compared to those that did not expand Medicaid, with the steepest gains among Black infants. Today, 40 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid, while Mississippi remains one of 10 holdouts.",
      "The U.S. has long treated infant mortality as a measure of societal health. More than a century ago, sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois argued that high rates of infant deaths among Black families reflected inequities in living conditions rather than innate differences.",
      "Mississippi's emergency declaration and Boston's persistent disparities suggest those inequities remain deeply entrenched. State officials said the declaration is intended to galvanize coordinated action across hospitals, state agencies, and community groups.",
      "\"It will take all of us working together to give every child the chance to live, thrive, and celebrate their first birthday,\" Dr. Edney said.",

      "Microsoft on Thursday fired two additional employees after firing two others a day prior, following a break-in at the office of its vice chair and company president, Brad Smith, earlier this week, as part of a protest of the technology company's purported links to Israel.",
      "\"Two additional employees were terminated due to serious violations of established company policies and our code of conduct, including participating in recent on-site demonstrations that created significant safety concerns for our employees,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The terminations came after a group of seven people broke into executive offices at Microsoft's global headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on Tuesday to hold a sit-in. No Azure for Apartheid, an advocacy group organized by Microsoft employees, said in an Instagram post that current and former workers from Microsoft, Google and Oracle were part of the group that occupied Smith's office.",
      "The protesters, who were arrested by police on Tuesday, were demanding that Microsoft cut ties with Israel after The Guardian reported earlier this month that a unit of the Israeli military is using Microsoft's Azure cloud platform to surveil Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.",
      "\"Two employees were terminated today following serious breaches of company policies and our code of conduct,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News on Wednesday. \"The first violated the Business Conduct Policy, participated in the unlawful break-in at the executive offices, and other demonstrations on campus, and was arrested by authorities on our premises on two occasions. The second was involved in the break-in at the executive offices and was subsequently arrested.\"",
      "A Microsoft spokesperson said in the statement Thursday that the company is \"continuing to investigate the conduct on our campus and work with law enforcement to help ensure the safety of all our employees. We wish to emphasize, again, as we did in a statement yesterday, that such conduct is entirely unacceptable and stands in direct opposition to our company values and policies.\"",
      "In an Instagram\u00a0post, No Azure for Apartheid identified two of the employees as Anna Hattle and Riki Fameli.",
      "During a press conference on Wednesday, Smith said Microsoft has launched a formal investigation into Israel's reported use of Azure. \"We are committed to ensuring that our human rights principles and our contractual terms of service are upheld in the Middle East,\" he said.",

      "Labor Day is traditionally a cue for car dealers to roll out promotions as new model year vehicles arrive on the lot. And this year, some of the best deals are to be had on electric vehicle leases ahead of a $7,500 federal tax credit expiring on Sept. 30, according to auto research firm Edmunds.",
      "Data\u00a0from Kelley Blue Book shows EV prices have dropped steadily amid soft demand for electric cars. In July, the average sales price for a new EV was $55,689, down more than 4% from a year ago.",
      "The tax credit saves EV leaseholders an average of $208 a month spread across a 36-month lease, Edmund found in analyzing dealership transactions. Leasing has become the most common way consumers enter the EV market, according to the auto industry data provider, which found that leases made up 70% of all EV transactions in July.",
      "A $4,000 tax credit for used EVs also ends on Sept. 30.",
      "For most consumers, leasing an EV is a better bet than buying, according to Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds.",
      "\"If you've never tried this tech and want to dip your toe in the water instead of getting married to it,\" he said, noting that EVs tend to depreciate faster than gas-powered cars. \"That's because we know the tech will get better, and what you buy today won't be as good as what you get next year.\"",
      "The IRS is also giving consumers more wiggle room to claim the EV tax credit before it ends. Previously, eligibility was tied to a vehicle's delivery date. But the agency this month issued a notice clarifying that consumers are eligible for the credit if they sign a contract for a vehicle prior to Sept. 30 and make a payment, which can include putting money down or trading in a car \u2014 even if the vehicle isn't delivered until after that date.",
      "\"EVs fundamentally face an awareness issue, and if dealers and automakers don't get the word out, they risk disappointing customers who show up after September 30 only to find that the opportunity has passed,\" \u00a0Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' assistant vice president of insights, said in a statement.",

      "So concludes a new analysis from the Bank of America Institute, which drew on the deposit data from millions of its customers to track job changes and the median pay bump people get when they switch employers.",
      "The analysis shows that while the job change rate \u2014 defined in this case as the total percentage of Bank of America customers who have changed employers \u2014 has edged up this year, Americans are much less to likely switch jobs than during the \"Great Resignation.\" That was the period during the pandemic when a massive wave of workers quit their jobs, motivated by better work opportunities and work-life balance. Over 20 million people quit their jobs in the second half of 2021, according to Labor Department data.",
      "The bank's data shows that the percentage of its customers leaving their jobs has largely trended downwards, from 26% since the 2022 peak, and is now just slightly above the the job change rate in 2019. The upshot: As employers have pulled back in hiring, workers are hunkering down in their current jobs.",
      "\"It's possible that, again, tariffs and just general business uncertainty is playing a role in squeezing out some of the availability for people to switch jobs, which is why that rate is declining,\" said Taylor Bowley, an economist at Bank of America Institute and lead author of the report.",
      "The labor market slowed sharply in recent months. Accounting for government data revisions, the average monthly payroll gain from May to July was only 35,000, down from average of 123,000 from January to April. The Labor Department will release the next jobs report on September 5.",
      "\"People are not leaving their jobs right now because they're nervous about the future of the labor market,\" said Allison Shrivastava, an economist at Indeed \"It's a pretty stagnant labor market,\" she added.",
      "Lower pay hikes from switching",

      "The Bank of America analysis notes the diminishing payoff from switching jobs stems in part from the shifting power dynamic between employees and employers. Workers wielded more leverage during the pandemic, when labor supply disruptions created heightened demand for workers. However, that power is slowly shifting back toward employers as job opportunities dry up.",

    "summary": "Fed Governor Lisa Cook filed a lawsuit challenging what her suit said is President Trump's \"unprecedented and illegal attempt to remove\" her.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook as a member of the Federal Reserve Bank's Board of Governors puts the nation in uncharted legal waters, and may ultimately be up to the Supreme Court to provide clarity on whether the move crosses a legal boundary, legal scholars expect.",
      "Mr. Trump's move to oust Cook comes after months of griping about the Fed, which he says is moving too slowly to cut interest rates. But if her removal is allowed to stand \u2014 a question that will be decided by the courts \u2014 and the Senate confirms a replacement, it would mean Mr. Trump will have appointed the majority of the seven-member Board of Governors.",
      "Cook was named to the Fed Board by President Joe Biden in May 2022 and reappointed to serve a full 14-year term in September 2023, which is set to end in January 2038.",
      "Mr. Trump said he was removing Cook from her post because of alleged mortgage fraud, though she has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense. The claims about Cook were made by Bill Pulte, the Trump-appointed director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who sent a\u00a0letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi accusing Cook of\u00a0 taking out mortgages for properties in Michigan and Georgia in 2021 and claiming both would be used as her primary residence.",
      "Pulte alleged that Cook was fraudulently attempting to gain more favorable lending terms. He has also leveled allegations of mortgage fraud against California Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, two Democrats who have been among the most prominent opponents of Mr. Trump. Both have denied the accusations.",
      "In a statement released through the Fed last week, Cook said, \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook has set off a legal battle that could end with the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority. She filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging what the suit said is Mr. Trump's \"unprecedented and illegal attempt to remove Governor Cook from her position which, if allowed to occur, would [be] the first of its kind in the Board's history.\"",
      "\"It is clear from the circumstances surrounding Governor Cook's purported removal from the Federal Reserve Board that the mortgage allegations against her are pretextual, in order to effectuate her prompt removal and vacate a seat for President Trump to fill and forward his agenda to undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve,\" her complaint, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., states.",
      "The White House has defended Mr. Trump's move to terminate Cook from the Fed Board of Governors as within his lawful authority.",
      "\"The president determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. \"The removal of a governor for cause improves the Federal Reserve Board's accountability and credibility for both the markets and American people.\"",
      "Aggressive removals",
      "Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook is the latest in a string of removals of Democratic-appointed members of independent agencies, which have tested the bounds of his executive authority. He fired leaders of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, ousted commissioners on the Consumer Product Safety Commission and terminated officials sitting on the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Labor Relations Authority.",
      "Many of the firings have led to legal challenges. The officials removed from the boards have argued Mr. Trump violated federal laws that shield them from being removed at-will. Instead, Congress has said that the only grounds for their firings are inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. The laws were meant to insulate independent federal agencies and decisions from political pressure.",
      "The law establishing the Federal Reserve System, known as the Federal Reserve Act, specifies that the president can only remove a member of its Board of Governors \"for cause.\" But courts have said little about what may constitute \"cause.\" While not defined in the Federal Reserve Act, Cook argues in her lawsuit that it means instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance in office or comparable misconduct.",
      "The question of what qualifies as good cause, and whether Cook's alleged actions rise to it, are likely to be key questions to be answered during litigation, said Adam White, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who focuses on the Supreme Court.",
      "\"If [the justices] interpret good cause, they'll have to do so with an eye to the power and purpose of the Federal Reserve System more generally, the powers of the system and the purpose of its independence. What is 'good cause' with respect to the service of a Fed governor?\" he said. \"If all President Trump is going to go with is these allegations regarding the governor's mortgage application before she was on the board, I have a hard time believing that constitutes good cause because it's really not germane to the duties of the governor while she was in office.\"",
      "The Supreme Court and the Fed",
      "In a series of recent decisions, the Supreme Court has reasserted the president's power to remove executive officers without cause.",
      "In 2020, the high court ruled that the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 headed by a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance \u2014 was unconstitutional.",
      "Then, in a 2021 decision striking down the structure of the Federal Housing Finance Authority, the high court acknowledged that a \"for cause\" restriction in the 2008 Recovery Act \"appears to give the president more removal authority than other removal provisions,\" like those restricting removals to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. Still, it said that \"the Constitution prohibits even 'modest restrictions' on the President's power to remove the head of an agency with a single top officer.\"",
      "This year, in response to emergency appeals brought by ousted officials from the NLRB and the MSPB, which are multi-member bodies, the Supreme Court allowed Mr. Trump to fire those officials while their legal challenges move forward, even though Congress shielded them from being removed at will. But in a brief decision in that case that appeared to be 6-3, the Supreme Court's majority singled out the Fed.",
      "Two fired officials, Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris, raised concerns about the consequences of allowing their removals and whether that would call into question the constitutionality of the Fed's for-cause removal protections. The court said it disagreed. Instead, it called the central bank a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the 18th- and 19th-century central bank predecessors of the Fed.",
      "Writing in dissent, Justice Elena Kagan said the majority created a \"bespoke Federal Reserve exception,\" even though its independence \"rests on the same constitutional and analytic foundations as that of the NLRB, MSPB, FTC, FCC, and so on.\"",
      "\"The court in that language does not resolve the question. All the court is saying is that the Federal Reserve is different from the FTC or from the NLRB,\" Joel Alicea, a law professor at the Catholic University of America, said. \"Yeah, it is different, but is it sufficiently different to mean that it's not subject to the same rule? The court doesn't say.\"",
      "The president's removal powers",
      "While Mr. Trump has sought to exert new levels of control over the executive branch, the Supreme Court has recognized narrow exceptions to the removal powers, allowing Congress to protect certain officials from being fired without cause.",
      "In a 1935 decision in the case Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the court found that Congress can restrict the president's authority to remove multi-member commissions of experts who are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "In its decision allowing the firings of the labor board members, the Supreme Court's majority said the Justice Department \"is likely to show that both the NLRB and MSPB exercise considerable executive power.\"",
      "But White said the Fed is different from those agencies because of the authority it exerts.",
      "\"Under the last 15 years of precedents, the question is what kind of powers does the agency wield and are they substantially executive?\" he said. \"And for the Fed, it does have regulatory powers and it's possible they verge on something like executive power, but the overwhelming majority of what the Fed does that is of consequence is its monetary powers. That's why the court recognized that the Fed is different.\"",
      "White continued: \"The whole reason why we're sensitive about the president's attacks on the Fed versus the NLRB is that the Fed's overwhelming purpose and its most significant power are all something very different than simple law enforcement policy. Those powers, going back to the very beginning of the country, have never been treated as executive powers.\"",
      "Alicea, however, disagreed. The Board of Governors has broad oversight and regulatory authority over the nation's banking system, he said.",
      "\"Those are core executive powers,\" he said.",

      "Washington \u2014 Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook filed suit against President Trump, Chair Jerome Powell and the Fed's Board of Governors on Thursday, asking a federal judge to block the president's attempt to fire her from the central bank.",
      "Mr. Trump announced Cook's termination from the Fed late Monday, citing allegations she had committed mortgage fraud, which he described as \"deceitful and potentially criminal.\" The move came after the president spent months railing against the Fed and Powell for leaving interest rates relatively high so far this year.",
      "Cook filed her lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Thursday, teeing up a legal showdown that seems destined to ultimately be settled by the Supreme Court. Her legal team asked the district court to declare that Mr. Trump's attempted firing is \"unlawful and void\" and that Cook \"remains an active member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.\"",
      "\"Governor Cook seeks immediate declaratory and injunctive relief to confirm her status as a member of the Board of Governors, safeguard her and the Board's congressionally mandated independence, and allow Governor Cook and the Federal Reserve to continue its critical work,\" the suit said.",
      "Members of the Fed board are confirmed by the Senate and serve for 14-year terms. Under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the president can only remove them early \"for cause.\" The law doesn't specify what qualifies as \"cause,\" and it has never been tested in court, but it is generally understood to be malfeasance.",
      "In her suit, Cook's lawyers Abbe Lowell and Norm Eisen asked the court to state that Fed board members \"can only be removed for cause, meaning instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance in office, or comparable misconduct,\" citing Supreme Court precedent and relevant federal law. Even if the court disagrees with that standard, they wrote, the law \"clearly does not support removal for policy disagreements.\"",
      "Powell and the Fed board are named in the suit because Cook asked the court for an injunction ordering them to \"refrain from effectuating President Trump's illegal attempt to fire Governor Cook and treat Governor Cook as a member of the Board of Governors.\"",
      "In response to the lawsuit, White House spokesman Kush Desai said the president \"exercised his lawful authority\" in removing Cook.",
      "\"The President determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions,\" Desai said in a statement. \"The removal of a governor for cause improves the Federal Reserve Board's accountability and credibility for both the markets and American people.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued in the past that the president has the legal right to remove at will members of federal boards that exercise \"substantial executive power,\" like the National Labor Relations Board.",
      "The Supreme Court has upheld Mr. Trump's power to fire some board members, but said in May that the Federal Reserve is a separate case, calling it a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump-appointed director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Bill Pulte, accused Cook of falsifying mortgage documents by claiming two homes that she bought in 2021 as her primary residence. He alleged that Cook \u2014 an economist who has served on the Fed board since 2022 \u2014 had committed mortgage fraud, and referred the matter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Justice Department special attorney Ed Martin.",
      "Days later, Mr. Trump publicly called on Cook to resign.",
      "At the time, Cook didn't address the substance of Pulte's allegations directly, but said in a statement that she had \"no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.\" She added that she would \"take any questions about my financial history seriously\" and said she was gathering more information.",
      "Lowell, her lawyer, said Monday that Mr. Trump didn't have the legal right to fire Cook \"based solely on a referral letter\" to Justice Department leadership, a point her legal team reiterated in Thursday's lawsuit.",
      "\"[R]emoval 'for cause' requires some connection to official conduct, prohibiting removal based on an unsubstantiated allegation of private misconduct (which in this case allegedly occurred prior to her Senate confirmation),\" the complaint said. \"And even to the extent that private misconduct could bear on a particular officer's official conduct in certain cases, 'cause' requires a factual basis supporting such asserted misconduct.\"",
      "The broadside against Cook came as Mr. Trump pressures the Fed to lower interest rates. The central bank's rate-setting committee \u2014 which Cook and Powell both sit on \u2014 has opted to leave interest rates relatively high so far this year, fearing that inflation could resurge. Last week, Powell hinted that the central bank may cut rates soon, but it will \"proceed carefully.\"",
      "The president favors immediate rate cuts, which could boost economic growth and make it cheaper to borrow money, though at the risk of causing higher inflation. He has floated firing Powell at various times over the past few months and has encouraged other Fed officials to overrule him and slash rates.",
      "The Fed typically makes interest rate decisions independently. Mr. Trump is hardly the first president to criticize the Fed for leaving rates high, but he's been unusually assertive. Last year, he argued he should have \"at least [a] say\" in the moves made by the central bank.",
      "Many experts believe it's important for central banks to operate independently so they can make decisions based on economic data, not politics. If elected officials are in charge of monetary policy, they could opt for the politically popular short-term benefits of low interest rates \u2014 like a hotter economy and cheaper borrowing costs \u2014 even if that leads to higher inflation in the long run, Brookings Institution senior fellow David Wessel noted earlier this year.",
      "Kathryn  Watson and \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "The U.S. economy expanded faster between April and June than previously estimated, as growth bounced back after slumping in the first quarter, new government data shows.",
      "The Commerce Department said Thursday that the country's gross domestic product \u2014 the nation's output of goods and services \u2014 grew at a 3.3% annual pace in the second quarter after shrinking 0.5% in the first three months of 2025. The agency had initially estimated second-quarter growth at 3%.",
      "\"There was an upward revision to business investment in structures, equipment and intellectual property, as well as consumer spending,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report. \"Investment related to AI is helping mask some of the weakness elsewhere in the economy, but the good news is that there is little sign that this support is set to fade anytime soon.\"",
      "The first-quarter GDP drop, the first retreat of the U.S. economy in three years, was mainly caused by a surge in imports, which are subtracted from GDP as businesses scrambled to bring in foreign goods ahead of new U.S. tariffs taking effect. That trend reversed as expected in the second quarter. Imports fell at a 29.8% pace, boosting April-June growth by more than 5 percentage points.",
      "Concerns about the health of the economy have grown amid recent signs of a cooldown in hiring across the U.S., with employers adding a weaker than expected 73,000 jobs in July. Investors expect Federal Reserve officials to cut interest rates at their next policy meeting in September in a bid to shore up economic growth.",
      "\"While the US economy grew at an upwardly revised annualized rate of 3.3% in Q2 2025, the strength was largely a mirage, reflecting a sharp decline in imports after businesses accelerated purchases in response to tariffs in Q1,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in a research note.",
      "The economy grew at an average rate of only 1.4% in the first six months of the year, Daco noted, pointing to weak private-sector demand outside of an ongoing surge of investment in AI.",

      "Artificial intelligence is replacing entry-level workers whose jobs can be performed by generative AI tools like ChatGPT, a rigorous new study finds.",
      "Early-career employees in fields that are most exposed to AI have experienced a 13% drop in employment since 2022, compared to more experienced workers in the same fields and when measured against people in sectors less buffeted by the fast-emerging technology, according to a recent\u00a0working paper from Stanford economists Erik Brynjolfsson, Bharat Chandar and Ruyu Chen.",
      "The study adds to the growing body of research suggesting that the spread of generative AI in the workplace is likely to disrupt the job market, especially for younger workers, the report's authors said.",
      "\"These large language models are trained on books, articles and written material found on the internet and elsewhere,\" Brynjolfsson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's the kind of book learning that a lot of people get at universities before they enter the job market, so there is a lot of overlap with between these LLMs and the knowledge young people have.\"",
      "The research highlights two fields in particular where AI already appears to be supplanting a significant number of young workers: software engineering and customer service. Between late 2022 and July 2025, entry-level employment in those areas declined by roughly 20%, according to the report, while employment for older workers in the same jobs grew.",
      "Overall, employment for workers aged 22 to 25 in the most AI-exposed sectors dropped 6% during the study period. By comparison, employment in those areas rose between 6% and 9% for older workers, according to the researchers.",

      "Secretarial and administrative work",
      "Computer programming",

      "Older employees, who generally have navigated the workplace for a longer period of time, are more likely to have picked up the kinds of communication and other \"soft\" skills that are harder to teach and that employers may be reluctant to replace with AI, the data suggests.",
      "\"Older workers have a lot of tacit knowledge because they learn tricks of trade from experience that may never be written down anywhere,\" Brynjolfsson explained. \"They have knowledge that's not in the LLMs, so they're not being replaced as much by them.\"",
      "The study is unusually robust given that generative AI technologies are only a few years old, while experts are just starting to systematically dig into the impact on the labor market. The Stanford researchers used data from ADP, which provides payroll processing services to employers with a combined 25 million workers, to track employment changes for full-time workers in occupations that are or more or less exposed to AI. The data included detailed information on workers, including their ages, and precise job titles.",
      "AI doesn't just threaten to take jobs away from workers. As with past cycles of innovation, it will render some jobs extinct while creating others, Brynjolfsson said.",
      "\"Tech has always been destroying jobs and creating jobs. There has always been this turnover,\" he said. \"There is a transition over time, and that's what we are seeing now.\"",
      "Augmented or automated?",
      "For example, in fields like nursing AI is more likely to augment human workers by taking over rote tasks, freeing health care practitioners to spend more time focusing on patients, according to proponents of the technology.",
      "While entry-level employment has fallen in professions that are most exposed to AI, no such such decline has occurred in jobs where employers are looking to use these tools to support and expand what employees do.",
      "\"Workers who are using these tools to augment their work are benefiting,\" Brynjolfsson said. \"So there's a rearrangement of the kind of employment in the economy.\"",
      "Advice for young workers",
      "As of late last year, 23% of employees were using generative AI in their jobs at least once per week, according to a\u00a0report from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Workers who can learn to use AI to to help them do their jobs better will be best positioned for success in today's labor market, according to Brynolfsson.",
      "A recent report from AI staffing firm Burtch Works found that starting salaries for entry-level AI workers rose by 12% from 2024 to 2025.",
      "\"Young workers who learn how to use AI effectively can be much more productive. But if you are just doing things that AI can already do for you, you won't have as much value-add,\" Brynjolfsson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"This is the first time we're getting clearer evidence of these kinds of employment effects, but it's probably not the last time,\" he added. \"It's something we need to pay increasing attention to as it evolves and companies learn to take advantage of things that are out there.\"",

    "story": [
      "New York \u2014 YouTube TV says it's reached a \"short-term extension\" in its contract dispute with Fox, meaning subscribers of the Google-owned streamer won't see immediate disruptions of Fox channels on the platform.",
      "The current carriage agreement between YouTube TV and Fox originally faced a Wednesday afternoon deadline - with YouTube previously warning that networks like Fox Sports, Business and News would become unavailable on its streaming platform if the two sides didn't reach a new deal by 5 p.m. ET.",
      "That would have left YouTube TV customers without Week 1 of some college football games and other broadcast programming from Fox. But shortly after the clock hit 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday, YouTube said it was able to \"prevent disruption\" as it continues to work toward a new agreement.",
      "\"We are committed to advocating on behalf of our subscribers as we work toward a fair deal and will keep you updated on our progress,\" YouTube said in a brief update announcing the extension.",
      "A spokesperson for Fox had no addition comment, but confirmed that the broadcast giant had agreed to the short-term extension. It wasn't immediately clear how long the extension would be.",
      "In a statement earlier Wednesday, Fox said it was \"disappointed that Google continually exploits its outsized influence by proposing terms that are out of step with the marketplace.\" Fox also directed subscribers to a site called keepfox.com for more information and to call on YouTube to come to an agreement.",
      "In addition to Fox Sports, Business and News, keepfox.com notes that YouTube TV may no longer carry FS1 and the Big Ten Network (which is majority-owned by Fox) if a deal isn't reached.",
      "Meanwhile, in blog post earlier this week, YouTube said Fox was \"asking for payments that are far higher than what partners with comparable content offerings receive.\" The company added that it hoped to reach a deal that's \"fair for both sides\" without \"passing on additional costs to our subscribers.\"",
      "If Fox content becomes unavailable on YouTube TV \"for an extended period of time,\" YouTube also noted it would provide members with a $10 credit. YouTube TV's base plan - which currently boasts access to over 100 live channels - costs $82.99 a month.",
      "Brendan Carr, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, also chimed in on the dispute leading up to Wednesday's deadline - while appearing to target Google particularly. He called on the tech company to \"get a deal done\" in a post on social media.",
      "\"Google removing Fox channels from YouTube TV would be a terrible outcome,\" Carr wrote in a Tuesday post on X. \"Millions of Americans are relying on YouTube to resolve this dispute so they can keep watching the news and sports they want-including this week's Big Game: Texas  Ohio State.\"",
      "From sports events to awards shows, live programming that was once reserved for broadcast has increasingly made its way into the streaming world over the years - as more and more consumers ditch traditional cable or satellite TV subscriptions for content they can get online. But renewing carriage agreements can also mean tense contract negotiations - at times resulting in service disruptions.",
      "YouTube TV has been down this road before: In 2021, YouTube TV subscribers briefly lost access to all Disney content on the platform, including networks like ESPN and local ABC stations, after a contract breakdown between the two companies. That outage lasted less than two days, with the companies eventually reaching an agreement.",
      "Beyond deals with YouTube TV and others, Fox last week launched its own streaming platform, \"Fox One,\" which has a starting price of $19.99 a month.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/car-buying-mistakes-to-avoid-edmunds-2025/",
    "published": "Wed, 27 Aug 2025 16:55:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A 2025 analysis from Edmunds reveals that nearly 20% of new car buyers are committing to monthly payments of $1,000 or more.",
    "story": [
      "Buying a new car has never been more financially daunting. A 2025 analysis from Edmunds found that a record 19.3% of consumers who financed a new vehicle in the second quarter of 2025 committed to a monthly payment of $1,000 or more. That's nearly one in five buyers taking on what was once considered an extreme car payment \u2014 driven by high interest rates and rising vehicle prices.",
      "While it might be tempting to stretch your budget for the car you want, locking yourself into a high-cost loan can be a painful mistake. Before you sign, here are five common car-buying missteps to avoid.",
      "1. Buying outside your means",
      "There's a difference between being able to buy something and being able to afford it wisely. With an average new vehicle transaction price of approximately $49,000, many buyers are truly stretching their budgets. It's not uncommon to see buyers opt for extended 72-month or 84-month financing terms.",
      "That shiny SUV might seem within reach thanks to flexible financing, but the long-term hit to your financial health could be considerable. Buying within your means \u2014 ideally targeting a loan term of no more than 60 months and keeping your car-related expenses under 15%-20% of your monthly take-home pay \u2014 is smart shopping in an era of rising interest rates and ever-increasing car prices.",
      "2. Getting a dealership loan",
      "One of the most costly and common mistakes car buyers make is waiting until they're sitting in the dealership finance office to think about a loan. Dealerships may offer convenience, but their financing may include marked-up interest rates or hidden fees.",
      "Instead, walk into the dealership with a preapproved loan offer from your bank, credit union or an online lender. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, this move can save buyers hundreds to thousands of dollars over the life of the loan. When you do this, the dealer can still try to beat the rate \u2014 and sometimes will. But now you're negotiating from a position of strength, not desperation.",
      "3. Trading in a car with negative equity",
      "If you owe more on your current car than it's worth \u2014 a situation known as negative equity \u2014 trading it in for a new vehicle can be a financial landmine. This commonly happens when people take out a six-year loan, trade in the vehicle after just three or four years, and carry the previous balance into the new vehicle. Rolling that deficit into a new loan just worsens the problem, guaranteeing that you'll be underwater for even longer.",
      "According to Edmunds, 28.2% of trade-ins in July 2025 involved negative equity, and the average amount buyers owed above the vehicle's value was $6,902. That sets the stage for a vicious cycle, especially if buyers trade cars frequently or face unexpected job loss or repair costs. If you're in this situation, consider keeping your car longer or making extra payments. If you can get a better rate, even refinancing can get you back to breakeven.",
      "4. Not working with internet sales team first",
      "Most major dealerships now have dedicated internet sales teams that exist to sell you a car quickly and often at better prices than you'll get face-to-face. If you already know what make, model and trim you want, you can save hours \u2014 and hundreds or even thousands of dollars \u2014 by working with the internet sales department instead of walking onto the lot.",
      "Sites such as Edmunds can help you compare pricing between multiple dealers, and many will show you real-time inventory, rebates and incentives. This lets you shop from the comfort of home and make dealers compete for your business. It also gives you a written quote you can bring with you \u2014 a powerful tool when negotiating.",
      "5. Overlooking used car options",
      "Buying new is tempting \u2014 it smells great, it's under warranty, and no one else has touched it. But it's not always the smartest financial move. Today's certified pre-owned vehicles often come with extended factory warranties, undergo rigorous inspections, and cost thousands less than their new counterparts. The rapid depreciation of most new vehicles only worsens the picture. Most lose 20%\u201330% of their value in the first year alone, according to Edmunds. Avoiding that depreciation hit can save thousands.",
      "Buying a new car is one of the biggest financial decisions most people make \u2014 second only to purchasing a home. Avoiding these five common mistakes won't just save you money \u2014 it has the potential to help ensure your long-term financial security. Take your time and do your homework. The right deal isn't just about the car \u2014 it's about the life you want to live after you drive it off the lot.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cracker-barrel-logo-barrel-stock-cbrl-ceo/",
    "published": "Wed, 27 Aug 2025 15:36:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Cracker Barrel misread its own customer base \u2014 and our culturally sensitive times \u2014 in revamping its image, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "When Cracker Barrel unveiled its new logo last week as part of an ongoing brand refresh, it wouldn't have expected the marketing move to spark a public furor and cause the restaurant chain's value to sink by nearly $100 million.",
      "Yet the episode highlights the potential perils of tinkering with a company's branding. Following the backlash, Cracker Barrel conceded that its rebrand amounted to a misstep, saying in a statement on Monday that it \"could've done a better job sharing who we are and who we'll always be.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Cracker Barrel decided to scrap the new logo entirely and keep the original design. \"We thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel,\" the company\u00a0announced\u00a0on social media. \"We said we would listen, and we have. Our new logo is going away and our 'Old Timer' will remain.\"",
      "The decision came after President Trump on Tuesday publicly urged the company to ditch the new logo. \"Cracker Barrel should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll), and manage the company better than ever before,\" Mr. Trump\u00a0wrote\u00a0on Truth Social.",
      "Much of the initial uproar focused on the new Cracker Barrel logo doing away with the image of an older gentleman sitting in a wicker chair leaning against a barrel. The man depicts company founder Dan Evins' Uncle Herschel, whom Cracker Barrel insists will remain an integral part of its brand identity.",
      "\"Uncle Herschel will still be on our menu...on our road signs and featured in our country store. He's not going anywhere \u2014 he's family,\" Cracker Barrel said.",
      "Cracker Barrel's stock price was up roughly 5% ahead of the start of trade on Wednesday, helping erase the company's earlier market loss.",
      "Tom Murphy, a branding expert and professor at Clark University, told CBS MoneyWatch that he thinks Cracker Barrel did the right thing in backtracking on its logo rollout.",
      "\"The decision by Cracker Barrel to return to its original logo is a positive course correction, given the intensity of emotional response from their core base of customers,\" he said. \"This gives them an opportunity to reinforce the fact that they are not moving away from their brand purpose or their heritage.\"",
      "Brands as stories",
      "Marketing experts panned Cracker Barrel's attempt at overhauling its logo.",
      "\"From a branding perspective, it's basically a flop,\" said David E. Johnson, CEO of branding agency Strategic Vision PR Group, of Cracker Barrel's logo redesign. \"What they did wrong is they went against their brand story, which was the old logo, that reflected the southern, whimsical atmosphere in the stores.\"",
      "In Johnson's view, Cracker Barrel's mistake was that it replaced a logo with genuine symbolic currency for a \"very generic looking logo that doesn't tell a story.\" Other branding experts say the hubbub is the result of a business severing its design from its roots \u2014 a cardinal sin for a company like Cracker Barrel whose folksy image is meant to evoke \"homestyle country cooking.\"",
      "More specifically, Cracker Barrel's new logo retains the rustic color palette of the original design, while removing the image of an older gentleman sitting in a wicker chair leaning against a barrel.",
      "The first Cracker Barrel restaurant was launched in Lebanon, Tennessee, in 1969 by Evins while working for his family's gasoline business. The idea was to recreate the kind of homey restaurants he'd enjoyed as a child, according to the company's\u00a0website. And until the logo redesign, the figure of\u00a0Herschel\u00a0had been central to much of the restaurant's branding and merchandise.",
      "The decision to remove both Herschel and the namesake barrel from the logo irked some Cracker Barrel loyalists because the original image represented what franchise consultant and branding expert Nick Yeonakis called a \"throwback to a simpler time that was about home cooking.\"",
      "\"So, people have this image in their mind of a Cracker Barrel that is constant and stable, and that's why when they rebranded, backlash happened,\" he said.",
      "Still, marketing experts agree that Cracker Barrel, which operates nearly 660 corporate-owned locations across the U.S., was due for an image revamp. The company's growth, which soared in the 1990s, has slowed in recent years. In 2024, the company reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up less than 1% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million, down sharply from $99 million in 2023.",
      "In 2024, concerns over its competitiveness and stagnant growth prompted the company, led by new CEO and former Taco Bell executive Julie Felss Masino, to announce changes to its restaurants, menu and pricing.",
      "The chain had become less relevant in part because it had leaned too heavily on the \"timeless nature of our concept,\" Masino said in a May 2024 conference call with Wall Street analysts. \"The goal, simply put, was to freshen things in such a way as to be noticeable and attractive but still feel like Cracker Barrel,\" she said.",
      "Today, Cracker Barrel maintains that its restaurants will retain their old-timey vibe, including using Uncle Herschel in its marketing.",
      "\"We love seeing how much you care about our 'old-timer.' We love him too,\" Cracker Barrel said Monday.",
      "According to a recent YouGov survey of 1,000 adults, 76% of those polled said they prefer the company's old logo to the new one.",
      "Sign of the times",
      "Customer anger over Cracker Barrel's new logo also reflects the culturally and politically charged environment companies face today. For example, when Bud Light partnered with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney in 2023, some customers called for a boycott of the beer brand, badly denting the beer brand's sales.",
      "In one social media post that typified some of the criticism of Cracker Barrel, one account called \"Woke War Room\" called for Masino to resign. \"Cracker Barrel's new logo isn't an accident \u2014 it's CEO Julie Felss Masino's project. She scrapped a beloved American aesthetic and replaced it with sterile, soulless branding,\" the post\u00a0reads.",
      "Such critiques illustrate the fine line companies are often forced to tread, Carreen Winters, president of reputation at MikeWorldWide, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's very hard to be a brand for everybody today because we are so polarized, and people look at things through a political lens even if there is no political intent,\" she said. \"When you are a legacy brand, it's really important to understand who your core is, and to not do anything to alienate them while cultivating your future or next generation customer.\"",
      "Other experts are skeptical Cracker Barrel's redesign was politically motivated.",
      "\"I really doubt the Cracker Barrel executives sat down and said, 'We'll go through this enormously expensive undertaking to change all of our signage and everything on social media in order to change something because we feel we want to be 'woke,'\" Murphy, the Clark University branding expert, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Rather, Cracker Barrel missed the mark by failing to fully take into account people's emotional investment in its brand, Winters said.",
      "\"If you are a legacy brand and you're modernizing, you have to make sure you've appropriately honored that legacy because at the end of the day, your stakeholders own your brand \u2014 you don't,\" she said. \"Not understanding the customer and the rest of stakeholders and what they care about really matters, and that seems to be what went awry here.\"",

    "summary": "Nearly 6 million workers in the U.S. without a bachelor's degree earned at least $100,000 in 2023, study finds.",
    "story": [
      "A college diploma is no longer a sure ticket to a good-paying job. Yet some workers can earn six figures in a range of occupations without a bachelor's degree, a new study finds.",
      "Nearly 6 million full-time workers in the U.S. without a bachelor's degree earned at least $100,000 in 2023, according to a\u00a0report from loan marketplace Lending Tree, which analyzed the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey. The study sheds light on some alternative pathways to a high-paying career that don't require a four-year degree.",
      "\"This report is pretty clear proof that you don't have to go to college to earn a really substantial income, and if you are considering a different route, there is plenty of reason to believe that in an awful lot of fields you can be every bit as successful, and every bit financially stable without that college degree,\" Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at Lending Tree, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The 5.7 million, or 9%, of non-college graduates earning six-figure salaries worked in a range of fields, including software development, truck driving, elevator repair and more, according to the study. The report comes as many young people question the cost and value of a college degree, and evaluate whether the rewards are worth taking on the substantial student debt earning a degree often requires.",
      "Over the past 10 years, young workers without a bachelor's degree have seen their earnings increase, according to a 2024\u00a0study from the Pew Research Center. Amid rising tuition costs and mounting student debt, 29% of U.S. adults say the cost of college is not worth it, according to the research.",
      "The unemployment rate for young people who recently earned a college degree was close to 6% earlier this year, above the national average of 4.2%. That's in part because a growing number of employers are turning to artificial intelligence to perform tasks formerly done by entry-level workers, according to economists.",
      "Jobs than can pay $100,000 without a college degree",
      "At least 40% of workers without bachelor's degrees in 2023 earned six figures in 20 occupations, according to Lending Tree. They included software developers, sales engineers, aircraft pilots, air traffic controllers and others.",
      "Chief executives who never graduated from college were also on Lending Tree's list, with 64% earning at least six figures. To be sure, the study doesn't suggest that young workers should expect to ascend to executive-level positions without college degrees. Rather, the high share of non-college degree holders earning six figures as CEOs likely represents workers who have started their own businesses, according to Schulz.",
      "\"It speaks to the opportunity that can come from starting a small business today,\" he said. \"You're not necessarily talking about Fortune 500 companies.\"",
      "These occupations have the highest share of workers without degrees earning six figures, according to Lending Tree's analysis:",

      "In a blog post, Google-owned YouTube said Fox was \"asking for payments that are far higher than what partners with comparable content offerings receive.\" The company added that it hoped to reach a deal that's \"fair for both sides\" without \"passing on additional costs to our subscribers.\"",
      "If Fox content becomes unavailable on YouTube TV \"for an extended period of time,\" YouTube also noted it would provide members with a $10 credit. YouTube TV's base plan, which currently boasts access to over 100 live channels, costs $82.99 a month.",
      "A spokesperson for Google did not have any additional comments when reached Wednesday by The Associated Press.",
      "Fox said Wednesday that it was \"disappointed that Google continually exploits its outsized influence by proposing terms that are out of step with the marketplace.\" The broadcast giant added that it remained committed to reaching an agreement, but was alerting viewers that they could potentially lose access to Fox programming on YouTube TV \"unless Google engages in a meaningful way soon.\"",

      "Contractual disputes over carriage fees \u2014 the money that streaming, cable and satellite TV providers pay for platforms to carry their content \u2014 are common between TV networks and carriers like YouTube.

    "story": [
      "Steep U.S. tariffs on a range of Indian products took effect Wednesday, threatening a serious blow to India's overseas trade in its largest export market.",
      "President Donald Trump had initially announced a 25% tariff on Indian goods. But earlier this month he signed an executive order imposing an additional 25% tariff due to India's purchases of Russian oil, bringing the combined tariffs imposed by the U.S. on its ally to 50%.",
      "The Indian government estimates the tariffs will impact $48.2 billion worth of exports. Officials have warned the new duties could make shipments to the U.S. commercially unviable, triggering job losses and slower economic growth.",
      "India\u2013U.S. trade relations have expanded in recent years but remain vulnerable to disputes over market access and domestic political pressures. India is one of the fastest-growing major global economies and it may face a slowdown as a result.",

    "story": [
      "In a sign of home sellers' frustration over how long it's taking to find a buyer,\u00a0more owners are opting to pull their property off the market rather than lower the asking price.",
      "That's according to a recent\u00a0report\u00a0by Realtor.com that finds that so-called delistings, or homes taken off the market without having been sold, were up 38% in June since the start of 2025 and 48% from a year ago.",
      "\"Fewer and fewer sellers are deciding to enter the market, and increasingly more are deciding to jump out,\" Jake Krimmel, senior economist at Realtor.com told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Signs of deadlock",
      "One indicator that more sellers are exiting the housing market is the ratio between the number of delistings and listings. For every 100 new homes listed nationally in June, 21 homes were taken off the market, the report found. That's up from 13 delisted homes per 100 new listings in May.",
      "A steady rise in delistings could push buyers and sellers further apart, creating a deadlock in the housing market, according to Krimmel.",
      "\"The thing that's going to prevent buyers and sellers from getting closer together is if all the sellers who maybe could or should be lowering their prices to meet the demand where it is are instead taking their homes off the market altogether,\" he said. \"So it's kind of like keeping us in this holding pattern.\"",
      "The trend comes as the supply of homes for sale begins to grow in certain U.S. regions, causing prices in those areas to drop. The number of homes for sale in July surged nearly 25% from a year ago, a post-pandemic high, according to Realtor.com.",
      "Despite the rise in housing inventory, home sales around the U.S. remain relatively stagnant, with steep prices and high mortgage rates continuing to deter many would-be homebuyers, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. Realtor.com data shows that pending home sales, or listings under contract, in July fell 3% in compared with the same period last year.",
      "No hurry to sell",
      "When homeowners are eager to sell a property, they typically lower the price in order to offload it quicker. However, those who are not up against the same type of time constraints may be willing to wait it out longer \u2014 especially if they're benefiting from a favorable mortgage rate.",
      "\"Maybe you're locked into payments that are relatively affordable for you,\" Krimmel said. \"You would prefer to sell, but not at a price that you're not comfortable with.\"",
      "Another factor is playing into the delisting trend, experts said \u2014 the surge in housing prices during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the housing market was red hot. As newly remote workers flocked to areas like Austin, Texas, home prices rose at\u00a0record levels, giving sellers a chance to cash in.",
      "While the market has since cooled substantially, sellers' pricing expectations have been slower to catch up.",
      "\"Maybe we've gotten a bit spoiled by very high home prices over the last many years, but we are seeing some softness in the market right now,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That may not be true in all markets, however. Miami is one of the places where sellers have been least willing to budge on price. According to Realtor.com's analysis, 59 homes were delisted for every 100 new homes listed in the southern Florida city \u2014 the highest ratio among the cities Realtor.com tracked. Meanwhile, less than 18% of listed homes in Miami came with a price reduction in July, according to Realtor.com.",
      "\"If sellers are choosing to take properties off the market rather than lower prices, it may signal renewed confidence in Miami's future, and a growing belief that this is a market worth holding for the long haul,\" Ana Bozovic, a Miami-based real estate agent and founder of Analytics Miami, told Realtor.com.",

    "summary": "Removing a top Fed official threatens to shake investor confidence in the central bank's long-standing independence, according to Wall Street observers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's\u00a0move to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook\u00a0could roil financial markets, raise uncertainty for investors and heighten concerns that the White House is trying to wrest control of the historically independent central bank, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "Mr. Trump announced her removal in a letter posted Monday night on Truth Social, citing allegations that she had engaged in mortgage fraud.",
      "Cook denies Mr. Trump has the legal authority to fire her and pledged on Tuesday not to resign. \"I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022,\" she said in a statement. Cook's lawyer also vowed to fight the firing in court.",
      "Asked by CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes on Tuesday whether the Trump administration is effectively weaponizing government by digging into the mortgage records of public officials, Mr. Trump responded, \"No. They're public.\"",
      "Cook has not been charged with a crime. Federal Housing Finance Agency head Bill Pulte, who leveled the initial accusations against Cook, has called on the Department of Justice to investigate Cook.",
      "Cook was appointed to a 14-year term on the Fed's Board of Governors in 2022 and also serves on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets short-term interest rates in the U.S.",
      "A Federal Reserve spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday that the central bank will \"continue to carry out its duties as established by law.\" The Fed also pointed to Cook's statement that she plans to contest her firing in court and said it \"will abide by any court decision.\"",
      "\"Congress, through the Federal Reserve Act, directs that governors serve in long, fixed terms and may be removed by the president only 'for cause.' Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people,\" the Fed said.",
      "More influence over the Fed?",
      "Financial markets were subdued\u00a0on Tuesday in digesting Mr. Trump's effort to oust Cook. Yet the decision was the talk of Wall Street, with multiple analysts saying Cook's dismissal could open the door to Mr. Trump gaining control of the Fed's seven-member board.",
      "\"President Trump's decision to fire Lisa Cook as a Fed governor gives him the ability to gain a majority at the Federal Reserve Board and to influence the broader composition of the FOMC,\" Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Securities, said in a report to investors, referring to the central bank's rate-setting panel.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS News that Mr. Trump exercised his lawful authority to remove Cook \"for cause.\"",
      "\"The president determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions,\" he said in an email. \"The removal of a governor for cause improves the Federal Reserve Board's accountability and credibility for both the markets and American people.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has also nominated Stephen Miran, who heads the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, to serve on the Fed board. Mr. Trump is slated to name a nominee to succeed Fed Chair Jerome Powell whose term ends in May of 2025; Powell is scheduled to continue serving on the Fed board until January of 2028 and could continue to serve in that role after stepping down as Fed chair.",
      "If Cook were to leave the Fed board, Mr. Trump could ultimately end up with five appointees on the panel by mid-2026, giving the White House more leverage to influence monetary policy, according to investment advisory firm Capital Economics.",
      "During a meeting Tuesday, Mr. Trump demurred when asked by a reporter who he's considering to replace Cook on the Fed board. \"We'll have a majority very shortly so that will be great,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly assailed Powell for the central bank's decision to hold off in cutting interest rates, with policy makers remaining cautious about reducing borrowing costs so long as inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. Powell signaled last week that a rate cut could be on the horizon during a speech at the Jackson Hole, Wyoming, economic symposium.",
      "No guarantee of lower interest rates",
      "The 12-member FOMC is made up of seven members of the Fed Board of Governors; the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; and four of the 11 Fed bank presidents, who serve on a rotating basis for one-year terms.",
      "That interlocking relationship suggests that even stacking the Fed board with loyalists wouldn't guarantee the interest rate cuts that Mr. Trump has demanded, Gregory Daco, chief economist at strategy consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's not just about the administration nominating individuals and Congress confirming those individuals \u2014 it's also about how these individuals perceive their role and value their independence,\" he said.",
      "Analysts with Capital Economics noted that Mr. Trump's appointees would need to persuade other FOMC members about setting monetary policy in ways that align with the White House's economic objectives. That \"could be difficult if those others felt compelled to defend the Fed from political attacks,\" they said in a report.",
      "For decades, investors have seen the Fed as a generally neutral arbiter guided by its mandate to keep inflation in check and the job market humming. As a result, any perception that Mr. Trump is undermining the Fed's autonomy could rattle markets, according to Nigel Green, CEO of global financial advisory firm deVere Group.",
      "\"Investors are reacting because the independence of the central bank is critical to market stability, and any sign of political capture raises alarm bells everywhere,\" Green said in an email.",
      "Meanwhile, the question of whether Cook can be removed from the Fed board remains unresolved. Under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the president has authority to remove Fed appointees before their term ends, but only for \"cause.\" Analysts said the legal dispute over Cook's removal could wind up in the Supreme Court.",
      "\"The situation is extremely fluid,\" Daco said. \"So until we get some clarity as to the exact conviction, you're not necessarily going to see much significant movements in markets.\"",

      "The rich are different from other people \u2014 and that also applies to the share of their income they pay in taxes, according to a new study from University of California, Berkeley, economists.",
      "The individuals who make up the\u00a0Forbes 400 list, topped by Tesla CEO Elon Musk with a fortune of $244 billion, paid an average effective tax rate of 24% from 2018 to 2020, compared with a 30% rate for all other U.S. taxpayers, the researchers said in a new paper published in the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "The research comes as President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill,\" signed into law on July 4, delivers its largest\u00a0benefits to the highest-earning Americans\u00a0through a mix of new and extended tax breaks. Those include raising the estate-tax exemption to $15 million per person, up from about $14 million.",
      "The changes build on an earlier tax cut \u2014 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Mr. Trump's signature first-term legislation. That 2017 law reduced the effective tax rate for the richest Americans from 30% to 24%, the researchers found.",
      "The new findings \u2014 from Berkeley economists and noted inequality experts Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman \u2014 calculates the tax rate by tallying all income taxes, as well as corporate taxes that are paid by the companies owned by the richest Americans. In other words, it assigns a share of Amazon's corporate taxes to that of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos when calculating his total tax burden.",
      "\"The economic income of the wealthiest are essentially the profits of the businesses they own,\" Saez told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"Jeff Bezos owns about 10% of Amazon, and hence his true economic income is 10% of Amazon's profits.\"",
      "Corporate taxes are levies on the profits generated for Bezos, similar to how an employer withholds federal income and Social Security contributions from a worker's paycheck, he added.",
      "Saez and Zucman are leading proponents of instituting a U.S. wealth tax to help address widening inequality between the haves and have-nots. That idea has been embraced by some lawmakers, such as Senators Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont.",
      "Some conservative critics have argued that wealth taxes could be self-defeating, with the Hoover Institute noting in a 2023 blog post that the levy could discourage entrepreneurship and investment.",
      "Research shows that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, while cutting taxes for many individuals and businesses, hasn't had a significant impact on the economy, the Congressional Research Service found in an April report. Republican proponents of the \"big, beautiful bill,\" such as House Speaker Mike Johnson, also\u00a0say\u00a0that it will boost the economy and provide tax relief to workers and families.",
      "How billionaires pay a smaller share",
      "U.S. income taxes are designed to be progressive, meaning that higher-earning workers pay a bigger share of their income to the IRS than people lower down the ladder. But because capital gains \u2014 the profits earned from selling stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets \u2014and business income are taxed at a lower rate than the top rate for income that people earn through their jobs, the richest Americans reap a massive tax break.",
      "For instance, the highest tax rate on earned income stands at 37%, which is assessed on every dollar earned above $609,351 for individual taxpayers. Yet that same person will pay only a 20% tax rate on long-term capital gains, such as profits from a stock sale, and a 21% corporate tax rate on income earned through a partnership or other business.",
      "And if the rich don't sell their shares, they don't have to pay any taxes on that wealth because they haven't realized a capital gain, Saez noted.",
      "\"The individual income tax is designed to be progressive thanks to its increasing tax rates by brackets, and it does a pretty good job except among the billionaire class,\" he said. \"As I said, the billionaire class can avoid realizing individual income and hence can escape the individual income tax.\"",
      "To be sure, the rich are shouldering the largest share of the nation's taxes, IRS data also shows. The top 1% of earners \u2013 people who make over roughly $663,000 per year \u2014 account for roughly 40% of all federal individual income tax, while the top 50% contribute 97%, a Tax Foundation\u00a0analysis\u00a0of IRS data shows. The bottom half of income earners account for about 3% of those taxes.",
      "Some wealthy Americans pay a tax rate exceeding the 30% average, the new paper also found. The top labor earners \u2014 people who depend on high wages for their incomes rather than capital gains or corporate profits \u2014 have a 45% effective tax rate, according to Berkeley analysis.",
      "The findings about the richest 400 Americans suggest that a wealth tax is still needed to curb inequality in the U.S., Saez said.",
      "\"The wealth tax is the most direct and powerful way to specifically target the ultra-rich and increase tax progressivity at the very top,\" he said. \"The wealth tax on the ultra-rich is also popular but will obviously be fought by billionaires, and they have disproportionate influence.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Aug 2025 23:20:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump said Monday he has fired Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. Her attorney countered that they plan to file a lawsuit challenging the move.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Monday he has fired Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, a dramatic move after months of public attacks against the central bank.",
      "Cook and her attorney said Tuesday that the move has no legal basis and that they plan to file a lawsuit challenging the president's action.",
      "The president announced Cook's removal from the Fed board in a letter posted to Truth Social that accused Cook of making false statements on mortgage documents, actions he claimed were \"gross negligence\" and \"potentially criminal.\" Mr. Trump had previously urged Cook to resign, leading the economist to say she had \"no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.\"",
      "The move is an early test of Mr. Trump's power to terminate members of the Federal Reserve. Under federal law, Fed board members serve for 14-year terms and can only be fired by the president \"for cause.\" Cook has served on the Fed since being appointed to complete another member's unexpired term in 2022, and her current term would run until 2038",
      "Mr. Trump wrote in a letter to Cook: \"I have determined that there is sufficient cause to remove you from your position.\"",
      "Cook still has access to her office at the Federal Reserve in Washington, a source familiar with the situation told CBS News on Tuesday. The central bank has deferred making any decisions about her status until a court decision is issued, which means nothing has changed in the Fed's view regarding how Cook is able to carry out her duties, according to the source.",
      "The source noted there is no official business before the Fed board this week, and pointed to the end of August being quiet. The source declined to discuss Cook's participation in a mid-September meeting of the Fed's interest rate-setting committee.",
      "In a statement, Cook said that Mr. Trump \"purported to fire me 'for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so. I will not resign. I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022.\"",
      "Her attorney Abbe Lowell said Cook will challenge her firing in court.",
      "\"President Trump has no authority to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. His attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis. We will be filing a lawsuit challenging this illegal action,\" Lowell said.",
      "A Federal Reserve spokesperson said in a statement the Fed will \"continue to carry out its duties as established by law.\" The central bank also noted Cook's plan to sue over her firing, and said it \"will abide by any court decision.\"",
      "\"Congress, through the Federal Reserve Act, directs that governors serve in long, fixed terms and may be removed by the president only 'for cause.' Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people,\" the statement read.",
      "What are Trump's allegations against Lisa Cook?",
      "The allegations against Cook were leveled earlier this month by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who has also\u00a0pushed\u00a0Mr. Trump's foe, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, to resign. Pulte\u00a0sent a letter\u00a0to Attorney General Pam Bondi accusing Cook of taking out mortgages for homes in Michigan and Georgia in 2021, and telling banks in both cases that she planned to use the homes as her primary residences. Pulte alleged that was a fraudulent attempt to gain more favorable lending terms.",
      "CBS News has obtained a copy of Pulte's letter to Bondi, a small portion of which Pulte posted online. The letter was provided by Georgetown University Law Center professor Adam Levitin, who specializes in commercial law and financial regulation.",
      "In the letter, Pulte alleges that Cook bought a house in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and a condo in Atlanta, Georgia, within two weeks of each other in June and July of 2021. The mortgage agreements for both properties required her to begin using them as principal residences within 60 days and to keep living there for at least a year, according to copies of the documents that were attached to Pulte's letter.",
      "The Atlanta condo was then listed for rent in September 2022, which Pulte said shows it \"was intended to be used as an investment/rental property, and not in fact a primary residence\" \u2014 though the one-year period for which it needed to serve as her principal residence technically would have ended between July and September of 2022.",
      "Typically, banks offer lower mortgage rates for primary residences than for second homes or investment properties because it's thought that if homeowners face financial strain, they're more likely to keep making payments for their primary home than for a vacation home or a rental property. Under federal lending rules, a primary residence is a home that a borrower lives in\u00a0for most of the year, while a second home must be occupied by the borrower by\u00a0part\u00a0\u2014 but not all \u2014 of the year.",
      "Cook did not list any rental income on her 2022 or 2023 financial disclosures, the letter notes.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social: \"Cook must resign, now!!!\"",
      "Cook said in a statement released through the Fed last week: \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Pulte has also made mortgage fraud allegations against California Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, two Democratic officials and Trump foes who denied the accusations. Notably, James's office sued Mr. Trump and his company for loan fraud before his return to the White House, securing an almost $400 million civil court judgment that was tossed out by a New York state appellate court last week.",
      "In a\u00a0blog post, Levitin argued Cook's firing was illegal and questioned the allegations leveled by Pulte. He wrote that, to prove criminality, prosecutors would need to show that Cook \"knowingly\" defrauded her lenders, and it's \"far from clear\" that she intentionally misled anybody.",
      "\"Most borrowers do not read their security instruments, so it is entirely possible that Cook had no idea what she was promising beyond that she would pay the mortgage note when installments came due,\" Levitin wrote.",
      "Can Trump fire Cook?",
      "The law establishing the Federal Reserve System, known as the Federal Reserve Act, specifies that the president can only remove a member of its Board of Governors \"for cause.\" Courts have said little about what may constitute \"cause,\" though it is generally thought to be malfeasance. Congress has in other federal laws restricted the president's power to remove officers at independent agencies to inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "In Cook's case, the allegations made by Pulte boil down to possible mortgage fraud, specifically that she took out two different mortgages within weeks of each other, stating both properties would serve as her primary residence. To prove fraud, the Justice Department would have to prove intent to misrepresent her financial situation to the lending institutions involved. That would have come in the criminal referral investigation made last week.",
      "The Supreme Court has in a series of recent rulings reasserted the president's power to remove executive branch officers at-will. In 2020, the high court ruled that the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 headed by a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance \u2014 was unconstitutional.",
      "Then, in a 2021 decision striking down the structure of the Federal Housing Finance Authority, the high court acknowledged that a \"for cause\" restriction in the 2008 Recovery Act \"appears to give the president more removal authority than other removal provisions,\" like those restricting removals to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. Still, it said that \"the Constitution prohibits even 'modest restrictions' on the President's power to remove the head of an agency with a single top officer.\"",
      "Lately, the Supreme Court has allowed Mr. Trump to remove members of multi-member agencies \u2014 the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission \u2014 without cause through decisions on its emergency docket.",
      "But the high court suggested in one of those emergency rulings that the Fed is different from other independent agencies. In an unsigned opinion, the court said the central bank is \"a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "Why is Trump angry at the Fed?",
      "Cook's firing came after Mr. Trump spent months attacking the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, over the central bank's handling of interest rates.",
      "Cook, Powell and 10 other Fed officials sit on a committee that controls the nation's monetary policy and sets target interest rates, with a dual mandate of keeping inflation low and employment levels high. This work is typically done independently, with little to no input from political leaders.",
      "The Fed hiked interest rates to decades-long highs in 2022 and 2023 in a bid to quell inflation. After some cuts last year, the central bank has chosen to leave rates at relatively high levels so far this year, fearing that inflation could come roaring back or that Mr. Trump's tariff strategy could cause consumer prices to jump. The trade-off is that higher interest rates can lead to slower economic growth, and they make it more expensive for American consumers and businesses to borrow.",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out over this strategy, nicknaming Powell \"Too Late.\" The president has\u00a0floated the idea\u00a0of firing Powell, in some cases accusing him of mismanaging a project to renovate the Fed's headquarters.",
      "Powell hinted last week that interest rate cuts could be on the horizon, as the Fed tries to prevent inflation from spiking without triggering higher unemployment. During a speech in Jackson Hole, he said the Fed will \"proceed carefully,\" but recent shifts \"may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\"",
      "Even without firings, the president could reshape the Fed board as positions open up. If the Senate confirms Mr. Trump's replacements for Cook and another Biden nominee who\u00a0stepped down early, five of the Fed's seven governors will be Trump appointees \u2014 making up most of the Fed's board of governors and more than one-third of the 12-member interest rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.",
      "Currently, three Fed board members are Trump picks: Powell, vice chair for supervision Michelle Bowman and board member Christopher Waller.",
      "Mr. Trump is widely expected not to appoint Powell to another four-year term as Fed chair when his current one ends in May 2026, though he hasn't announced a successor yet. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump\u00a0has nominated\u00a0his economic adviser Stephen Miran to serve on the Fed board until January 2026, replacing Adriana Kugler, the Biden appointee who left the board earlier this month. It's unclear who he will pick to replace Cook.",
      "Cook was confirmed in 2022 by the Senate when then-Vice President Kamala Harris broke the 50-50 party line tie, making Cook the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. She started her term in May 2022 and it runs 14 years.",
      "She has voted in sync with Powell to hold interest rates steady so far this year.",
      "Reaction to Mr. Trump's move so far has been along party lines. For instance, in\u00a0a post on X, Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said it was \"doing the right thing to hold people accountable\" while Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts\u00a0issued a statement\u00a0saying this represented an \"authoritarian power grab that blatantly violates the Federal Reserve Act.\"",
      "Editor's note: This story has been updated to reflect Mr. Trump picked three members of the current Fed board: Jerome Powell, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman.",

      "Less than a week after unveiling a controversial new logo that prompted the company's stock value to take a dive and even President Trump to weigh in, Cracker Barrel announced Tuesday that it will return to its old logo.",
      "\"We thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel,\" the popular Southern-themed restaurant chain announced in a post to social media. \"We said we would listen, and we have. Our new logo is going away and our 'Old Timer' will remain.\"",
      "Last week, the restaurant chain suddenly announced it was changing its logo to remove the image of a man sitting in a chair leaning against a barrel, and replacing it with a logo that only featured the chain's name.",
      "The Tennessee-based Cracker Barrel, which has more than 650 locations in 44 states, saw a Wall Street revolt of sorts, as it lost a staggering nearly $100 million in market value after releasing the new logo, which was part of an ongoing effort to update its image by adding new menu items and redecorating its stores.",
      "\"Rather than just showing one person, we wanted to feature lots of people,\" the company said on its website of the new logo. \"The idea was to celebrate the diversity of all our guests with a logo that represented our continued passion for pleasing people of all races, colors, and genders.\"",
      "The move also drew criticism from customers and some conservative commentators, who saw the change as potentially politically motivated. Branding expert Nick Yeonakis told CBS News the original logo was a \"throwback to a simpler time that was about home cooking.\"",
      "\"So, people have this image in their mind of a Cracker Barrel that is constant and stable, and that's why when they rebranded, backlash happened,\" he said.",
      "On Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump called on Cracker Barrel to scrap the new logo.",
      "\"Cracker Barrel should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll), and manage the company better than ever before,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.",
      "Mr. Trump followed up Tuesday evening by praising the company for returning to the old logo, writing that \"all of your fans very much appreciate it.\"",

      "Adam Foley and his wife said they rented a car from Hertz during a family trip to Atlanta this summer. When they returned home to San Antonio, Foley said he started getting automated messages from the rental company. The messages claimed damages were found on the rental vehicle, saying he owed $80 for two small dents and another $190 for a processing fee.",

      "In all, 14 people have been arrested, and so far, nine have been charged by the Ventura County District Attorney's office. Investigators have seized an estimated $3.7 million in Home Depot property.",
      "Prosecutors said 600 thefts occurred over several years at 71 separate Home Depot stores in Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, and Riverside counties.",
      "At the top of the theft ring was David Ahl, who owns Arya Wholesale store in Tarzana and would allegedly sell the stolen goods at reduced prices. He faces 48 felony counts, including conspiracy, organized retail theft, grand theft, receiving stolen property, and money laundering, prosecutors said.",
      "Ahl's brother-in-law, Omid Abrishamkar, allegedly helped sell the stolen items online through Amazon and eBay. Prosecutors said he faces 11 felony charges, including conspiracy, receiving stolen property, money laundering and others.",
      "\"Both of these men are alleged to have used wholesale and online businesses as fronts to make dirty money look clean,\" Ventura County District Attorney Erik Nasarenko said. He said his office has seized over $800,000 of that dirty money.",
      "Meanwhile, Ahl's ex-wife, Lorena Solis, and her boyfriend Enrique Moreno allegedly ran a nearly identical \"fencing operation\" of their own. Each faces eight counts of conspiracy for their alleged role in reselling stolen merchandise to electrical supply warehouses, prosecutors said.",
      "Ahl's own employees, which police called \"booster crews,\" were also allegedly involved. Three of Ahl's employees made up the core of the booster crew in Ventura County. Prosecutors said each would enter and exit the stores multiple times, with each trip bringing in between $6,000 and $10,000 in stolen merchandise.",
      "Home Depot store surveillance video provided by the task force showed the suspects in the store, grabbing merchandise off shelves and stuffing it inside their jackets.",
      "Fryhoff said the case is ongoing and more arrests are likely.",
      "The Ventura County Organized Retail Theft Task Force is funded by a state grant and made up of a team of investigators from the Port Hueneme Police Department, the Simi Valley Police Department, the DA's office and the Ventura County Sheriff's Office.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. financial markets edged higher on Tuesday, with investors shrugging off immediate concerns over President Trump's decision to\u00a0remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, an unprecedented move that analysts say could hinder the central bank's independence.",
      "The S&P 500 gained 26 points, or 0.4%, to close at 6,466, while the Dow Jones industrial Average climbed 135 points, or 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 95 points, or 0.5%.",
      "The muted reaction in the U.S. contrasted with sharp declines on global markets, as investors digested news of a potential Fed shakeup that could reshape the composition of the Board of Governors.",
      "Mr. Trump made his announcement in a letter posted on Truth Social on Monday evening, accusing Cook of mortgage fraud. The president said the move was \"effective immediately.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was repeating allegations against Cook first leveled earlier this month by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte. The senior housing official, who runs the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, alleged earlier this week that Cook falsified bank and property records to \"obtain more favorable loan terms.\"",
      "\"I have determined that there is sufficient cause to remove you from your position,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday in the letter addressed to Cook. The president had previously\u00a0called\u00a0on the Fed official to resign.",
      "Cook responded to the Monday post with a statement saying that Mr. Trump has no authority to fire her and that she will not resign, setting up a potential legal showdown that will test the president's authority to fire a member of the central bank. Under the Federal Reserve Act, the president can only remove a Fed official \"for cause.\" Fed board members serve for 14-year terms.",
      "Mr. Trump \"purported to fire me 'for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so. I will not resign. I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022,\" Cook said in a statement.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury yields were mixed, with longer-term yields rising and lower-term yields edging lower.",
      "While Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook could be a source of unease for investors, it did not appear to shake their faith in a September rate cut. Traders put the probability of a 0.25% rate cut at 90%, according to data from CME Group.",
      "Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, CIO Americas and global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management expects the Fed to lower rates by a total of 1 percentage point over the central bank's next four meetings.",
      "During a speech last week at the Jackson Hole, Wyoming economic forum Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled a rate cut\u00a0could be on the horizon. The Fed will \"proceed carefully,\" he said, but added that the shifting balance of risks \"may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\"",

      "Whirlpool, the century-old American appliance manufacturer known for its washers, dryers and other home appliances, says Trump's tariffs could give it a leg up on competitors that rely heavily on imports.",
      "The American manufacturer of home, kitchen and laundry appliances says it makes 80% of its products in the U.S., where it operates 10 factories.",
      "\"You're absolutely proud to know that it was built in America, in Ohio, and in these small communities that thrive,\" Jason Ebert, senior vice president of North American manufacturing at Whirlpool, told CBS News.",
      "Ebert hopes that the company's large domestic manufacturing footprint positions it for success amid the Trump administration's trade war. President Trump has said he's using tariffs as a tool to revitalize American industry by limiting importers' ability to undercut domestic manufacturers on price.",
      "Ebert said its U.S. factories are well-positioned to handle a surge in demand.",
      "\"When the factory is running the way we want, every three seconds a unit's coming out of the factory,\" he said.",
      "He added that the company's Clyde, Ohio, factory is not currently running at capacity, because customer demand doesn't require it to turn out as many machines it's capable of producing.",
      "\"We've seen volumes decline over the past three to four years,\" Ebert said.",
      "He attributes the sales dip to the ability of foreign competitors \u2014 including South Korea's LG and Samsung \u2014 to undercut Whirlpool's U.S. prices by using cheaper imported steel.",
      "Whirlpool, by contrast, sources 96% of metal for domestic products from the U.S., according to Ebert, leading to higher prices for American consumers.",
      "For this reason, Whirlpool hopes President Trump's 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum\u00a0will allow the company to better compete with the likes of LG and Samsung.",
      "Pay the penalty on steel",
      "\"Our competition overseas, really just on the raw material side \u2014 just take steel and resin \u2014 when the tariff is in place, they're going to have to pay that penalty,\" Ebert said. \"They either are going to make less money or they are going to have to charge more for the consumer.\"",
      "\"That puts their price in line with ours,\" Ebert added.",
      "Tariffs on imported washing machines during President Trump's first term spurred domestic manufacturing while upping prices on washing machines by an average of $86, according to research from the University of Chicago and the Federal Reserve.",
      "If demand for domestic-made appliances increases, Ebert said Whirlpool is ready to ramp up hiring to produce more machines.",
      "He also said the company is harnessing AI to make its workers more efficient, without replacing them, to reduce labor costs.",

      "Currently, plus-size passengers can either pay for an extra seat in advance with the option of getting that money back later or they can request a free extra seat at the airport. Under the carrier's new policy, a refund is still possible but no longer guaranteed.",
      "In a statement Monday, Southwest said it's updating some of its policies as it prepares for assigned seating next year.",
      "\"To ensure space, we are communicating to Customers who have previously used the extra seat policy that they should purchase it at booking,\" the statement said.",
      "It marks the latest change at Southwest, which had long been known for letting its passengers pick their own seats after boarding the plane and for letting their bags fly for free, which ended in May. Those perks were key to differentiating the budget carrier from its rivals.",
      "Southwest says it will still refund a second ticket under its new policy for extra seating if the flight isn't fully booked at the time of departure and if both of the passenger's tickets were purchased in the same booking class. The passenger also needs to request the refund within 90 days of the flight.",
      "If a passenger who needs an extra seat doesn't purchase one ahead of time, they will be required to buy one at the airport, according to the new policy. If the flight is full, the passenger will be rebooked onto a new flight.",

      "Southwest's current policy helped create a more comfortable flying experience for plus-size travelers, he said, while also ensuring all passengers have adequate space in their seats.",
      "\"I think it's going to make the flying experience worse for everybody,\" he said of the new rule.",
      "Vaughn described the change as yet another letdown for Southwest loyalists like himself, likening it to Cracker Barrel's recent logo change that has angered some of the restaurant's fans.",
      "\"They have no idea anymore who their customer is,\" he said of the airline. \"They have no identity left.\"",
      "The airline has struggled recently and is under pressure from activist investors to boost profits and revenue. It also said last year that it would charge customers extra for more legroom, and offer red-eye flights.",
      "When it announced the end of its longstanding \"bags fly free\" policy in March, experts expressed similar sentiments, warning it could undermine customer loyalty.",
      "\"This is how you destroy a brand. This is how you destroy customer preference. This is how you destroy loyalty.

    "story": [
      "Cracker Barrel shed almost $100 million in market value Thursday after its stock plunged following the release of a new logo. The new design eliminates a longstanding drawing of an overall-clad man leaning against a barrel, in favor of a cleaner logo featuring just the chain's name.",
      "Shares of Cracker Barrel fell $4.22, or 7.2%, to $54.80 in Thursday trading, shedding $94 million in market value. The stock had dipped to a low of $50.27 earlier in the day, representing a loss of almost $200 million in its capitalization.",
      "Cracker Barrel shares gained in early trading Friday, but resumed their slide later in the day. The stock closed down 40 cents, or less than 1%, to $54.40. The shares fell again on Monday, sliding about 1% in late afternoon trading.",
      "Wall Street's reaction to the logo redesign comes as Cracker Barrel has been working to refresh its image through new menu items and redecorated stores that eschew the 55-year-old chain's old-timey approach in favor of a more modern look.",
      "According to the company's website, the man and barrel in the old logo represented \"the old country store experience where folks would gather around and share stories.\"",
      "It's unusual for a company's share price to plunge dramatically due to a logo redesign, although marketing missteps can cause investors to question a company' strategy. Cracker Barrel's overhaul has been overseen by CEO Julie Felss Masino, who last year described the chain as \"not as relevant as we once were,\" and announced plans to update its down-home menu.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Cracker Barrel said that the man portrayed in the logo, known as \"Uncle Herschel,\" will remain \"front and center in our restaurants and on our menu.\"",
      "\"Our values haven't changed, and the heart and soul of Cracker Barrel haven't changed,\" the company said.",
      "In an updated statement released Monday, the company said the criticism has \"shown us that we could've done a better job sharing who we are and who we'll always be.\" Cracker Barrel added that it continues to serve \"generous portions of the food you crave at fair prices.\"",
      "The new logo, which will appear on menus and marketing materials, \"is now rooted even more closely to the iconic barrel shape and wordmark that started it all,\" the company said in an Aug. 18 press release.",
      "Conservative commentators took issue with the rebrand, with right-wing podcaster Matt Walsh calling it \"more generic\" on social media. Marketing experts also criticized the company's overhaul. Many of the criticisms took on a political tone, with some social media commenters describing the new design as \"woke.\"",
      "Brand strategist Kelly O'Keefe, a founding partner of consultancy Brand Federation, said the redesign simplifies an \"overly complex logo.\"",
      "\"In a normal marketing environment, this would not even be noticed, but these are not normal times,\" O'Keefe said in an email. \"Politically inert marketing moves are being labeled as political for opportunistic reasons.\"",
      "Another marketing expert pointed out that the redesign risks turning off long-time fans of the chain, with Bolt Health founder Kevin Dahlstrom, who has served as a chief marketing officer at several companies in the financial industry, describing Cracker Barrel's rebrand as a \"fiasco.\"",
      "\"The holy grail of marketing is to create a brand that customers give a damn about \u2014 and feel some ownership of. It's exceedingly rare and when you have that \u2014 as Cracker Barrel did \u2014 you NEVER EVER abandon it, you only double down on it,\" Dahlstrom wrote on social media.",
      "Cracker Barrel was founded in 1969 and today operates nearly 660 corporate-owned locations across the U.S.",
      "Cracker Barrel's growth, which soared in the 1990s as the chain expanded, has slowed in recent years. For 2024, the company reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up 0.8% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million, down from $99 million in 2023.",

Abrego Garcia is now in the custody of ICE, though a Maryland judge has blocked him from being deported while she reviews the case.",
      "Since Friday, his lawyers say federal officials have \"attacked Mr. Abrego in the media in numerous highly prejudicial, inflammatory, and false statements,\" which they argue violates his right to a fair trial.",

      "The request came as Abrego Garcia both awaits a criminal prosecution for allegedly transporting undocumented immigrants from near the U.S.-Mexico border to elsewhere in the country \u2014 which he has denied \u2014 and faces possible deportation to East Africa.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native who entered the U.S. illegally in 2011, was arrested by ICE in March, deported to El Salvador and held in prison for months \u2014 even though an immigration judge had barred him from being sent to El Salvador due to a fear of gang persecution.",
      "Federal officials acknowledged Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error,\" but the Trump administration publicly railed against him, accusing him of gang membership and asserting that he should not return to the United States. He was eventually flown to Tennessee in June and jailed on human smuggling charges.",
      "A judge in Tennessee ruled in June that he should be let out of detention while awaiting a trial set for January. Administration officials suggested that if he left pre-trial detention, he could face deportation again, possibly to a country other than El Salvador.",
      "He was ultimately let out of jail on Friday, and on Monday, ICE detained him. His lawyers were informed that he could be deported to Uganda.",
      "Maryland-based U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis has ruled that Abrego Garcia cannot be deported until at least early October, as she considers a habeas corpus petition. His lawyers say he also plans to seek asylum in the United States.",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Aug 2025 17:32:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal judge in New York kept alive a lawsuit accusing officials in Saudi Arabia of assisting the Sept. 11 hijackers \u2014 which the Saudi government has vehemently denied.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in New York denied a motion by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to dismiss a lawsuit brought by families of 9/11 victims who are seeking to hold the Middle Eastern country responsible for potentially providing support to the hijackers, allowing the suit to proceed.",
      "The ruling is the latest in a long-running lawsuit seeking to hold the Saudi government liable for al Qaeda's attacks, a case that has been described by lawyers for the plaintiffs as a \"labyrinth.\"",
      "Saudi Arabia had the suit temporarily dismissed in 2015, before the dismissal was overturned by a federal appeals court. While the appeal was pending in 2016, Congress enacted a law known as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, which allowed victims of terror attacks to sue foreign governments and individuals if they provided material support to the attackers. It also gave U.S. courts jurisdiction over potential lawsuits filed over injuries and deaths in attacks on U.S. soil.",
      "Allegations that members of the Saudi government had links to some of the Sept. 11 hijackers have circulated for years. The claims have drawn vehement denials from Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally in the Middle East. Most theories have centered on two of the 19 hijackers: Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, who were on the plane that crashed into the Pentagon.",
      "More than a year before the hijackings, al-Midhar and al-Hazmi settled in Los Angeles, where a Saudi man named Omar al-Bayoumi helped them find an apartment. A 2004 report by the 9/11 Commission said that Bayoumi met the two hijackers by chance at a restaurant.",
      "But the families of some victims and their attorneys have alleged that Bayoumi had deeper connections to Saudi Arabia, citing federal reports declassified in recent years that allege he had \"extensive ties\" with the Gulf monarchy's government and was accused of serving as a Saudi intelligence officer. The FBI has also investigated whether the two hijackers got assistance from Fahad al-Thumairy, an accredited Saudi diplomat and imam at a Los Angeles mosque. The 9/11 Commission found no evidence that Thumairy helped the hijackers.",
      "Last year, a \"60 Minutes\" report revealed new evidence about Bayoumi, including a video of him filming the entrances of the U.S. Capitol and pointing out its location relative to the Washington Monument, at some points referencing a \"plan.\" Investigators have long believed the Capitol may have been the intended target of Flight 93, which crashed into a field in Pennsylvania after passengers overtook the hijackers.",
      "Decades ago, investigators also found a notebook in Bayoumi's home that seemed to show a drawing of a plane and a mathematical equation that could be used to calculate the rate of descent to a target.",
      "Many of those allegations were raised by attorneys for the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks. Lawyers for the Saudi government have repeatedly pushed for all claims against the country to be dismissed, including in October 2023. A Manhattan judge rejected that request Thursday.",
      "\"Plaintiffs have managed to provide this Court with reasonable evidence as to the roles played by Bayoumi, Thumairy, and KSA, in assisting the hijackers. KSA did not proffer sufficient evidence to the contrary,\" U.S. District Judge in the Southern District of New York George Daniels wrote in an order Thursday. \"Although KSA attempts to offer seemingly innocent explanations or context, they are either self-contradictory or not strong enough to overcome the inference that KSA had employed Bayoumi and Thumairy to assist the hijackers.\"",
      "Daniels wrote that while the families and attorneys representing Saudi Arabia disagree on Bayoumi's motive, it is \"undisputed\" that Bayoumi assisted in finding the hijackers' apartments, and signed a lease with them as a guarantor. Daniels said it is also \"undisputed\" that a notepad page \"with an airplane drawing, notes, and numbers\" was found in Bayoumi's home.",
      "Attorneys representing Saudi Arabia, Daniels wrote, argued that \"Bayoumi's encounters with the hijackers were coincidences,\" and he was \"simply being good-natured\" when he provided assistance to the hijackers. The lawyers, Daniels said, claimed the airplane drawing \"was unrelated to the 9/11 Attacks\" and \"likely related to Bayoumi's son's high school [assignments].\"",
      "\"These are all either conclusory attorney speculations not grounded in facts, or self-serving denials or excuses from Bayoumi himself that do not withstand scrutiny,\" Daniels wrote.",
      "\"We welcome the court's thorough and well-reasoned decision and look forward to moving the case forward to trial,\" Sean P. Carter, an attorney representing the families, said in a statement.",
      "Kreindler & Kreindler LLP, another law firm representing Sept. 11 victims' families, said the ruling \"ensures that the plaintiffs may continue their long pursuit of truth and justice,\" and \"paves the way for these critical issues to be fully examined at trial.\"",

Specific cause whether it was I didn't do my job, whether it was malfeasance. Whatever it is, that has to be raised.\"",
      "Primus' termination was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.",

      "Primus said he plans to continue performing his duties as a board member and says he hasn't turned in his laptop or ID. He also said he's actively pursuing legal options to push back against his termination.",
      "Some of Primus' posts on the social media platform have shown him at odds with the administration. Most recently, he wrote in a post two weeks ago that he doesn't agree with the president's decision to deploy the National Guard in Washington, D.C.",
      "In 2023, he was the lone board member to reject the approved Canada Pacific-Kansas City Southern railway companies merger.",
      "Primus admitted that his decision and voiced opinions on some of the administration's decisions could have been a factor in his termination.",
      "\"Maybe people did not like the fact that, you know, I actually look at mergers objectively,\" Primus said of his decision in the 2023 merger. \"To me, it signals my independence, doesn't show that I'm against them. It's just that I'm independent, that I don't have to go lockstep with Democrats or Republicans.\"",

      "Doe, a transgender student enrolled at a public school in Berkeley County, South Carolina, and his guardians filed a lawsuit last November alleging that the so-called restroom-related provision of the legislation violates the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause and Title IX.",
      "Under the provision's definitions, Doe, who identifies as male, was classified as a \"female\" and therefore could not use the boys' restrooms at school, according to court filings.",
      "On the heels of the Supreme Court's June decision upholding a Tennessee law restricting access to gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, a South Carolina district court paused the challenge to the state's bathroom policy and denied a request from Doe to block the measure while litigation continues.",
      "Then, earlier this month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit granted an injunction when it came to Doe. The court blocked South Carolina and its Department of Education from enforcing its policy prohibiting transgender students from using restrooms that correspond with their gender identities, but only against Doe.",
      "In its ruling, the 4th Circuit cited its 2020 decision in a case brought by Gavin Grimm, a transgender student who challenged his school's restroom policy. The appeals court found that a rule by a Virginia school board requiring transgender students to use restrooms that correspond with their biological sex was unlawful.",
      "Grimm's case had been before the Supreme Court in 2017, but the court sent the dispute back to the lower courts. Then, in 2021, the high court declined to take up the case for a second time, leaving the 4th Circuit ruling in Grimm's favor in place.",
      "In blocking enforcement of South Carolina's policy against Doe, the 4th Circuit said that its decision in Grimm's case \"remains the law of this Circuit and is thus binding on all the district courts within it.\"",
      "South Carolina officials asked the high court to intervene, arguing that its restroom policy does not classify or discriminate on the basis of sex, and does not discriminate against transgender students.",
      "\"This Proviso resoundingly reflects the will of the South Carolina General Assembly, and therefore the will of the people of South Carolina, due to near unanimous approval in both chambers of the legislature,\" state officials wrote in their emergency appeal. \"Ultimately, this policy choice is one in which the Court must defer to the appropriate legislative body.\"",
      "They argued that the request seeks to restore the status quote, thus \"preserving voters' will and protecting the privacy of South Carolina public school students while this case is litigated on appeal.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security has begun moving detainees out of a controversial, state-run immigration detention center in the middle of the Florida Everglades dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz,\" days after a federal judge ruled that parts of the facility must be dismantled.",
      "The detainees are being transferred to other immigration detention centers, DHS said in a statement Wednesday, blaming a court order from an \"activist judge\" that it called \"another attempt to prevent the President from fulfilling the American people's mandate to remove the worst of the worst.\"",
      "\"DHS is complying with this order and moving detainees to other facilities. We will continue to fight tooth-and-nail to remove the worst of the worst from American streets,\" DHS said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "In an email to a South Florida rabbi last week that CBS News obtained, a top Florida emergency official wrote that Alligator Alcatraz would likely be empty \"within a few days.\"\u00a0The Associated Press\u00a0first reported the email on Wednesday.",
      "The Florida Division of Emergency Management said in a statement that \"[t]he mission has not changed, deportations will continue, and Florida will remain at the forefront of the nation's immigration enforcement efforts.\"",
      "\"'Alligator Alcatraz' is a temporary deportation facility; the detainees who are delivered there will all be returned to their home countries,\" the agency said. \"This was ALWAYS the facility's intent: to expedite the deportation process and support the President's immigration initiative.\"",
      "The facility, run by Florida's state government on a largely abandoned airstrip, is part of a wider push by the Trump administration to ramp up the number of immigration detention beds by partnering with Republican-led states willing to aid its escalating mass deportation efforts.",
      "Republican officials in Indiana and Nebraska have also offered to convert state prisons into immigration detention centers, and the Trump administration has been eyeing similar facilities in other states.",
      "The administration has cast \"Alligator Alcatraz\" as a cost-effective way of holding immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and suggested the treacherous terrain around the site could serve as a deterrent. But advocates have described inhumane conditions at the facility, including a lack of access to water, scarce and unsanitary food and limited access to attorneys \u2014 allegations that federal and state officials have denied.",
      "Last week, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered an indefinite stop to all new construction at \"Alligator Alcatraz\" and barred the transfer of new detainees to the facility. She also directed state officials to remove all fencing, light fixtures, generators and certain other equipment at the site within 60 days, siding with environmental activists who said the facility skirted federal environmental laws.",
      "The ruling did not require the facility to be shut down immediately.",
      "Florida's state government quickly appealed Williams' ruling last week. Late Wednesday evening, Williams declined to halt her ruling pending appeal, rejecting a request by the Trump administration and Florida.",
      "In her new order Wednesday, Williams said federal and state officials had failed to present \"new evidence\" showing the detainees at \"Alligator Alcatraz\" are particularly dangerous or that a pause in operations at the facility would thwart immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "\"Alligator Alcatraz\" is also the subject of two other lawsuits. One of them alleges that detainees have been unable to meet with their lawyers confidentially. A federal judge earlier this month dismissed one part of the suit that alleged the government had prevented detainees from filing legal challenges by not making clear which immigration court oversaw the facility, but he left the rest of the suit intact \u2014 though he moved the case from Miami to Orlando.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trumps-unprecedented-firing-of-fed-governor-lisa-cook-raises-untested-questions/",
    "published": "Thu, 28 Aug 2025 14:02:54 -0400",
    "summary": "Fed Governor Lisa Cook filed a lawsuit challenging what her suit said is President Trump's \"unprecedented and illegal attempt to remove\" her.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook as a member of the Federal Reserve Bank's Board of Governors puts the nation in uncharted legal waters, and may ultimately be up to the Supreme Court to provide clarity on whether the move crosses a legal boundary, legal scholars expect.",
      "Mr. Trump's move to oust Cook comes after months of griping about the Fed, which he says is moving too slowly to cut interest rates. But if her removal is allowed to stand \u2014 a question that will be decided by the courts \u2014 and the Senate confirms a replacement, it would mean Mr. Trump will have appointed the majority of the seven-member Board of Governors.",
      "Cook was named to the Fed Board by President Joe Biden in May 2022 and reappointed to serve a full 14-year term in September 2023, which is set to end in January 2038.",
      "Mr. Trump said he was removing Cook from her post because of alleged mortgage fraud, though she has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense. The claims about Cook were made by Bill Pulte, the Trump-appointed director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who sent a\u00a0letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi accusing Cook of\u00a0 taking out mortgages for properties in Michigan and Georgia in 2021 and claiming both would be used as her primary residence.",
      "Pulte alleged that Cook was fraudulently attempting to gain more favorable lending terms. He has also leveled allegations of mortgage fraud against California Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, two Democrats who have been among the most prominent opponents of Mr. Trump. Both have denied the accusations.",
      "In a statement released through the Fed last week, Cook said, \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook has set off a legal battle that could end with the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority. She filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging what the suit said is Mr. Trump's \"unprecedented and illegal attempt to remove Governor Cook from her position which, if allowed to occur, would [be] the first of its kind in the Board's history.\"",
      "\"It is clear from the circumstances surrounding Governor Cook's purported removal from the Federal Reserve Board that the mortgage allegations against her are pretextual, in order to effectuate her prompt removal and vacate a seat for President Trump to fill and forward his agenda to undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve,\" her complaint, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., states.",
      "The White House has defended Mr. Trump's move to terminate Cook from the Fed Board of Governors as within his lawful authority.",
      "\"The president determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. \"The removal of a governor for cause improves the Federal Reserve Board's accountability and credibility for both the markets and American people.\"",
      "Aggressive removals",
      "Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook is the latest in a string of removals of Democratic-appointed members of independent agencies, which have tested the bounds of his executive authority. He fired leaders of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, ousted commissioners on the Consumer Product Safety Commission and terminated officials sitting on the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Labor Relations Authority.",
      "Many of the firings have led to legal challenges. The officials removed from the boards have argued Mr. Trump violated federal laws that shield them from being removed at-will. Instead, Congress has said that the only grounds for their firings are inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. The laws were meant to insulate independent federal agencies and decisions from political pressure.",
      "The law establishing the Federal Reserve System, known as the Federal Reserve Act, specifies that the president can only remove a member of its Board of Governors \"for cause.\" But courts have said little about what may constitute \"cause.\" While not defined in the Federal Reserve Act, Cook argues in her lawsuit that it means instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance in office or comparable misconduct.",
      "The question of what qualifies as good cause, and whether Cook's alleged actions rise to it, are likely to be key questions to be answered during litigation, said Adam White, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who focuses on the Supreme Court.",
      "\"If [the justices] interpret good cause, they'll have to do so with an eye to the power and purpose of the Federal Reserve System more generally, the powers of the system and the purpose of its independence. What is 'good cause' with respect to the service of a Fed governor?\" he said. \"If all President Trump is going to go with is these allegations regarding the governor's mortgage application before she was on the board, I have a hard time believing that constitutes good cause because it's really not germane to the duties of the governor while she was in office.\"",
      "The Supreme Court and the Fed",
      "In a series of recent decisions, the Supreme Court has reasserted the president's power to remove executive officers without cause.",
      "In 2020, the high court ruled that the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 headed by a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance \u2014 was unconstitutional.",
      "Then, in a 2021 decision striking down the structure of the Federal Housing Finance Authority, the high court acknowledged that a \"for cause\" restriction in the 2008 Recovery Act \"appears to give the president more removal authority than other removal provisions,\" like those restricting removals to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. Still, it said that \"the Constitution prohibits even 'modest restrictions' on the President's power to remove the head of an agency with a single top officer.\"",
      "This year, in response to emergency appeals brought by ousted officials from the NLRB and the MSPB, which are multi-member bodies, the Supreme Court allowed Mr. Trump to fire those officials while their legal challenges move forward, even though Congress shielded them from being removed at will. But in a brief decision in that case that appeared to be 6-3, the Supreme Court's majority singled out the Fed.",
      "Two fired officials, Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris, raised concerns about the consequences of allowing their removals and whether that would call into question the constitutionality of the Fed's for-cause removal protections. The court said it disagreed. Instead, it called the central bank a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the 18th- and 19th-century central bank predecessors of the Fed.",
      "Writing in dissent, Justice Elena Kagan said the majority created a \"bespoke Federal Reserve exception,\" even though its independence \"rests on the same constitutional and analytic foundations as that of the NLRB, MSPB, FTC, FCC, and so on.\"",
      "\"The court in that language does not resolve the question. All the court is saying is that the Federal Reserve is different from the FTC or from the NLRB,\" Joel Alicea, a law professor at the Catholic University of America, said. \"Yeah, it is different, but is it sufficiently different to mean that it's not subject to the same rule? The court doesn't say.\"",
      "The president's removal powers",
      "While Mr. Trump has sought to exert new levels of control over the executive branch, the Supreme Court has recognized narrow exceptions to the removal powers, allowing Congress to protect certain officials from being fired without cause.",
      "In a 1935 decision in the case Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the court found that Congress can restrict the president's authority to remove multi-member commissions of experts who are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "In its decision allowing the firings of the labor board members, the Supreme Court's majority said the Justice Department \"is likely to show that both the NLRB and MSPB exercise considerable executive power.\"",
      "But White said the Fed is different from those agencies because of the authority it exerts.",
      "\"Under the last 15 years of precedents, the question is what kind of powers does the agency wield and are they substantially executive?\" he said. \"And for the Fed, it does have regulatory powers and it's possible they verge on something like executive power, but the overwhelming majority of what the Fed does that is of consequence is its monetary powers. That's why the court recognized that the Fed is different.\"",
      "White continued: \"The whole reason why we're sensitive about the president's attacks on the Fed versus the NLRB is that the Fed's overwhelming purpose and its most significant power are all something very different than simple law enforcement policy. Those powers, going back to the very beginning of the country, have never been treated as executive powers.\"",
      "Alicea, however, disagreed. The Board of Governors has broad oversight and regulatory authority over the nation's banking system, he said.",
      "\"Those are core executive powers,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook is suing over President Trump's attempt to fire her.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook filed suit against President Trump, Chair Jerome Powell and the Fed's Board of Governors on Thursday, asking a federal judge to block the president's attempt to fire her from the central bank.",
      "Mr. Trump announced Cook's termination from the Fed late Monday, citing allegations she had committed mortgage fraud, which he described as \"deceitful and potentially criminal.\" The move came after the president spent months railing against the Fed and Powell for leaving interest rates relatively high so far this year.",
      "Cook filed her lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Thursday, teeing up a legal showdown that seems destined to ultimately be settled by the Supreme Court. Her legal team asked the district court to declare that Mr. Trump's attempted firing is \"unlawful and void\" and that Cook \"remains an active member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.\"",
      "\"Governor Cook seeks immediate declaratory and injunctive relief to confirm her status as a member of the Board of Governors, safeguard her and the Board's congressionally mandated independence, and allow Governor Cook and the Federal Reserve to continue its critical work,\" the suit said.",
      "Members of the Fed board are confirmed by the Senate and serve for 14-year terms. Under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the president can only remove them early \"for cause.\" The law doesn't specify what qualifies as \"cause,\" and it has never been tested in court, but it is generally understood to be malfeasance.",
      "In her suit, Cook's lawyers Abbe Lowell and Norm Eisen asked the court to state that Fed board members \"can only be removed for cause, meaning instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance in office, or comparable misconduct,\" citing Supreme Court precedent and relevant federal law. Even if the court disagrees with that standard, they wrote, the law \"clearly does not support removal for policy disagreements.\"",
      "Powell and the Fed board are named in the suit because Cook asked the court for an injunction ordering them to \"refrain from effectuating President Trump's illegal attempt to fire Governor Cook and treat Governor Cook as a member of the Board of Governors.\"",
      "In response to the lawsuit, White House spokesman Kush Desai said the president \"exercised his lawful authority\" in removing Cook.",
      "\"The President determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions,\" Desai said in a statement. \"The removal of a governor for cause improves the Federal Reserve Board's accountability and credibility for both the markets and American people.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued in the past that the president has the legal right to remove at will members of federal boards that exercise \"substantial executive power,\" like the National Labor Relations Board.",
      "The Supreme Court has upheld Mr. Trump's power to fire some board members, but said in May that the Federal Reserve is a separate case, calling it a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump-appointed director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Bill Pulte, accused Cook of falsifying mortgage documents by claiming two homes that she bought in 2021 as her primary residence. He alleged that Cook \u2014 an economist who has served on the Fed board since 2022 \u2014 had committed mortgage fraud, and referred the matter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Justice Department special attorney Ed Martin.",
      "Days later, Mr. Trump publicly called on Cook to resign.",
      "At the time, Cook didn't address the substance of Pulte's allegations directly, but said in a statement that she had \"no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.\" She added that she would \"take any questions about my financial history seriously\" and said she was gathering more information.",
      "Lowell, her lawyer, said Monday that Mr. Trump didn't have the legal right to fire Cook \"based solely on a referral letter\" to Justice Department leadership, a point her legal team reiterated in Thursday's lawsuit.",
      "\"[R]emoval 'for cause' requires some connection to official conduct, prohibiting removal based on an unsubstantiated allegation of private misconduct (which in this case allegedly occurred prior to her Senate confirmation),\" the complaint said. \"And even to the extent that private misconduct could bear on a particular officer's official conduct in certain cases, 'cause' requires a factual basis supporting such asserted misconduct.\"",
      "The broadside against Cook came as Mr. Trump pressures the Fed to lower interest rates. The central bank's rate-setting committee \u2014 which Cook and Powell both sit on \u2014 has opted to leave interest rates relatively high so far this year, fearing that inflation could resurge. Last week, Powell hinted that the central bank may cut rates soon, but it will \"proceed carefully.\"",
      "The president favors immediate rate cuts, which could boost economic growth and make it cheaper to borrow money, though at the risk of causing higher inflation. He has floated firing Powell at various times over the past few months and has encouraged other Fed officials to overrule him and slash rates.",
      "The Fed typically makes interest rate decisions independently. Mr. Trump is hardly the first president to criticize the Fed for leaving rates high, but he's been unusually assertive. Last year, he argued he should have \"at least [a] say\" in the moves made by the central bank.",
      "Many experts believe it's important for central banks to operate independently so they can make decisions based on economic data, not politics. If elected officials are in charge of monetary policy, they could opt for the politically popular short-term benefits of low interest rates \u2014 like a hotter economy and cheaper borrowing costs \u2014 even if that leads to higher inflation in the long run, Brookings Institution senior fellow David Wessel noted earlier this year.",
      "Kathryn  Watson and \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Washington \u2014 Susan Monarez, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is being ousted from her role less than a month after the Senate confirmed her to lead the public health agency, the White House confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services\u00a0announced in an X post\u00a0Wednesday that Monarez no longer leads the CDC. Reports on her ouster were immediately followed by a dispute between the administration and her attorneys regarding whether she had been legally fired, with lawyers for Monarez arguing she's still in charge of the CDC and only President Trump can fire her.",
      "It's not clear why Monarez was removed from the job \u2014 but several other top CDC officials resigned Wednesday, often citing disagreements with the Trump administration over its vaccine policy, budgets cuts to the agency, and what one described as the \"weaponization of public health.\"",
      "Prominent D.C.-based attorney Mark Zaid said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0that Monarez \"has neither resigned nor received notification from the White House that she was fired.\" He said that he and lawyer Abbe Lowell are representing Monarez.",
      "Zaid alleged that Monarez was \"targeted\" because she \"refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated public health experts.\"",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai alleged in response that Monarez was terminated because she \"refused to resign despite informing HHS leadership of her intent to do so.\"",
      "\"As her attorney's statement makes abundantly clear, Susan Monarez is not aligned with the President's agenda of Making America Healthy Again,\" Desai said in response to Zaid's initial statement.",
      "Hours later, Zaid and Lowell said Monarez was told of her firing Wednesday night by a \"White House staffer in the personnel office.\" In a statement to CBS News, they called the move \"legally deficient\" and argued that she remains the leader of the CDC because, as a presidential appointee, \"only the president himself can fire her.\"",
      "On Monday, Monarez had to cancel an agency-wide meeting because she had been summoned to Washington, D.C., according to CDC officials.",
      "In its\u00a0X post, HHS thanked Monarez \"for her dedicated service for the American people,\" and said Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \"has full confidence in his team\" at the CDC.",
      "At least three other senior CDC leaders have resigned from the agency, according to resignation emails obtained by CBS News.",
      "Daniel Jernigan, who led the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, told colleagues he was leaving due to \"the current context in the Department.\" The CDC's Chief Medical Officer Debra Houry and the head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Demetre Daskalakis, also announced their departures.",
      "Houry's message to CDC staffers warned about the \"rise of misinformation\" about vaccines. She also argued planned cuts to the agency's budget will hurt the CDC.",
      "\"For the good of the nation and the world, the science at CDC should never be censored or subject to political pauses or interpretations,\" wrote Houry, who worked at the CDC for over a decade. \"Vaccines save lives\u2014this is an indisputable, well-established, scientific fact.\"",
      "Daskalakis said in a note to CDC staff: \"I am not able to serve in this role any longer because of the ongoing weaponizing of public health.\"",
      "Daskalakis also posted on X a resignation letter addressed to Houry, in which he criticized recent changes to vaccine recommendations and warned of an \"intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines.\" He also said Kennedy and his staff's views \"challenge my ability to continue in my current role at the agency.\"",
      "\"Having worked in local and national public health for years, I have never experienced such radical non-transparency, nor have I seen such unskilled manipulation of data to achieve a political end rather than the good of the American people,\" Daskalakis wrote.",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, who serves on the Senate health committee, reacted to Monarez's ouster by calling for Kennedy to be fired, calling him \"a dangerous man who is determined to abuse his authority to act on truly terrifying conspiracy theories and disinformation.\"",
      "\"If there are any adults left in the White House, it's well past time they face reality and fire RFK Jr,\" Murray said in a statement.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, also a member of Senate health committee who voted for Kennedy's nomination, said the departures will \"require oversight.\" Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, another member of the committee, called for a hearing with Kennedy.",
      "CDC departures follow months of upheaval",
      "The sudden departures come at a tumultuous time for the public health agency. Staff are\u00a0still reeling\u00a0from an early August\u00a0shooting\u00a0outside the CDC's Atlanta headquarters by a gunman who police said was upset about COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "Kennedy \u2014 a longtime vaccine skeptic \u2014 also fired every member of an independent CDC panel tasked with making vaccine recommendations. During Kennedy's tenure, HHS has made other moves on vaccines that have troubled public health and infectious disease experts. Kennedy halted contracts for mRNA vaccine research earlier this month, and the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved updated COVID-19 vaccines for seniors and people with health conditions, but not for healthy adults and children.",
      "Meanwhile, the CDC faced hundreds of layoffs this year.",
      "There has been some friction between Monarez and Kennedy over COVID-19 vaccines and the CDC's vaccine advisory panel, CDC officials told CBS News. Monarez has publicly said that vaccines \"save lives.\" The Trump administration was also unhappy with the way she had talked about the Atlanta shooting and stopped her from publishing an op-ed about the incident, the officials said.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0nominated Monarez\u00a0to lead the CDC in late March,\u00a0calling her\u00a0a \"dedicated public servant\" who could repair what he called a loss of public confidence in the CDC \"due to political bias and disastrous mismanagement.\" Monarez was\u00a0confirmed by the Senate\u00a0in a party-line vote in late July, after previously serving as the agency's\u00a0acting head\u00a0starting in January.",
      "She was nominated to lead the agency after Mr. Trump\u00a0pulled his initial pick\u00a0for the job, former Florida Rep. Dave Weldon, a physician who was controversial in part due to his past skepticism of vaccines. In private meetings with Weldon, some Republican senators and their staffers grew concerned that he seemed unfamiliar with the CDC's operations,\u00a0CBS News\u00a0reported at the time.",
      "Monarez\u00a0holds a Ph.D.\u00a0in microbiology and immunology, though unlike\u00a0most\u00a0prior CDC directors, she is not a medical doctor. She previously served as deputy director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, a federal agency that backs advanced medical research. She also worked in the Obama-era White House's science and technology office and the Department of Homeland Security during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "During her Senate confirmation hearing, Monarez faced a number of questions about vaccine recommendations. Kennedy has pushed a discredited theory linking routine childhood shots to autism, but during her hearing, Monarez refuted that view and said she has \"not seen a causal link between vaccines and autism.\"",
      "\"Vaccines absolutely save lives, and if I'm confirmed as CDC director, I commit to making sure we continue to prioritize vaccine availability,\" Monarez told lawmakers.",

      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency on Tuesday suspended more than 20 employees who signed an open letter arguing the Trump administration had undone years of post-Hurricane Katrina progress at the disaster relief agency, multiple sources told CBS News.",
      "Monday's open letter to Congress \u2014 known as the \"Katrina Declaration\" \u2014 said it was signed by 191 current and former FEMA employees. Some 35 attached their names, while the rest said they withheld them over fear of retaliation.",
      "Some of the current FEMA employees who used their names received emails on Tuesday night saying they had been placed on paid administrative leave \"effective immediately, and continuing until further notice,\" according to copies of the emails reviewed by CBS News.",
      "\"While on administrative leave, you will be in a non-duty status while continuing to receive pay and benefits,\" the letter read. The staffers were told not to visit FEMA facilities, access the department's telecommunication systems or carry out any of their official duties, aside from responding to inquiries from the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "The agency also told staff that they must remain available to work during business hours.",
      "The emails did not provide a reason for the decision. Staffers were told the move \"is not a disciplinary action and is not intended to be punitive.\"",
      "In a statement, FEMA called the signatories \"the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency\" and accused them of having \"forgotten that their duty is to the American people not entrenched bureaucracy.\"",
      "\"Our obligation is to survivors, not to protecting broken systems,\" FEMA continued. \"Under the leadership of Secretary Noem, FEMA will return to its mission of assisting Americans at their most vulnerable.\"",
      "The Washington Post was first to report on the suspensions.",
      "The \"Katrina Declaration\" was published as the United States marks the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which was one of the deadliest and costliest natural disasters in U.S. history. The 2005 hurricane prompted major changes to the nation's disaster relief system \u2014 and Monday's letter argued many of those reforms could be reversed by the Trump administration.",
      "The letter accuses President Trump of picking unqualified people to lead FEMA, and criticizes the administration for cutting the agency's workforce and terminating grants meant to help state and local governments harden their infrastructure to mitigate the impact of natural disasters.",
      "The declaration said it hopes changes are made in time to \"prevent not only another national catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina, but the effective dissolution of FEMA itself and the abandonment of the American people such an event would represent.\"",
      "The Trump administration has pushed for sweeping changes to FEMA. Earlier this year, Mr. Trump suggested either \"getting rid of FEMA\" or \"fundamentally reforming\" the agency by pushing some of its duties to state governments. So far this year, the agency has lost roughly one-third of its staff through a combination of firings and voluntary departures.",

    "story": [
      "In the nearly three weeks since President Trump deployed federal troops and law enforcement agents throughout Washington, D.C., a CBS News analysis of crime data shows violent crime is down in Washington by almost half when compared to the same 19 days in 2024.",
      "The analysis, reviewing every crime incident reported to the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department from Aug. 7 through Aug. 25, also shows violent crime is down in comparison to the five-year average for the same dates.",
      "Beyond violent crime, reported burglaries also are down 48% and car thefts have fallen 36%.",
      "Identifying the specific causes of changes in criminal activity is complex because it can be driven by many factors \u2013 and local police data was already showing that reported crimes were trending downward in Washington prior to the president's action.",
      "Violent crime, for example, in the two weeks prior to Aug. 7, was down about 20% already from the same period in prior years, according to the MPD data.",
      "Where are federal troops and law enforcement deployed?",
      "CBS News also has been examining where federal troops and law enforcement are deployed in relation to crime incidents.",
      "While some news reports and pundits suggested the deployments may have been in lower-crime areas, CBS News' analysis of the locations of reported crimes in 2025 indicates that the federal government deployed troops and other federal law enforcement agents mostly in areas with higher \u2013 and often much higher \u2013 rates of crime, violent crime and gun crime than the average neighborhood across the city.",
      "The analysis examines the location of every crime incident within a half mile of the locations where CBS News verified that federal troops or law enforcement agents are assigned. That was compared to crime incidents within a half-mile of hundreds of other points covering the district.",
      "Compared to neighborhoods citywide within a half mile of the 30 federal deployment locations, the concentration of overall crime incidents was nearly three times higher than the citywide average.",
      "Additionally, violent crimes \u2013 including homicides, assaults with a weapon, sexual assaults and robberies, as well as any crime committed with a firearm \u2013 were more than twice as high, and crimes involving guns were nearly twice as high near deployment areas.",
      "Several federal deployment locations along U Street, NW, were in areas where the number of gun crimes within a half mile of those deployments was higher than more than 90% of areas citywide.",
      "There are other areas of the city with high concentrations of crime where CBS News has not been able to verify sightings of troops or federal law enforcement deployments \u2013 primarily most of the neighborhoods southeast of the Anacostia River. The White House has reported arrests being made in those areas, but without releasing specifics about precise locations.",
      "Also, not every deployment is the same. On the National Mall, amid the monuments, museums and other federal grounds, the deployments verified by CBS News Confirmed were primarily National Guard. But the Guard was not just on and around the Mall. At least 10 Guard deployments were scattered at subway stations and other locations across the city \u2013 mixed in with deployments of other federal law enforcement agents. You can see the different deployments CBS News has verified so far in this map.",
      "Brianne Nadeau is a member of the District of Columbia Council who represents a community with a heavy presence of federal agents. She said they're scaring people away.",
      "\"Some businesses aren't even opening,\" she said. \"Either they don't have staff coming or they're concerned about opening for their customers. We have daycares that are afraid to take the kids out to the park because they're afraid their staff will be picked up by ICE. I mean, it's very quiet,\u00a0 and not just because it's summer.\"",
      "But Leroy Thorpe, who leads a neighborhood crime watch program in Washington D.C.'s Shaw neighborhood, has applauded the National Guard deployment.",
      "\"Absolutely it helps,\" Thorpe told CBS News. \"The subway poses a public safety issue for law-abiding citizens who are going to \u2014 or coming from \u2014 work.\"",
      "What the White House is saying",
      "A White House official says that since the start of the operation on Aug. 7, more than 1,094 arrests have been made, including eight known gang members with affiliation to either MS-13 or Tren de Aragua, and 115 firearms have been seized.",
      "On the night of Aug. 25, there were a total of 87 arrests, 39 of which were undocumented immigrants with prior arrests on a range of charges from simple assault to felony robbery, according to the official, and four illegal firearms were seized. To date, 49 homeless encampments have been cleared by multi-agency teams.",
      "The official said arrests were made by multi-agency teams, including the MPD and various federal agency officers deployed to promote public safety as part of the president's agenda to quash crime.",
      "Mr. Trump in a meeting on Aug. 26, with members of his Cabinet, reiterated his view that MPD's crime data is \"phony\" and called on Attorney General Pam Bondi \"to do something about it\".",
      "\"What they did is they issued numbers \u2013 it's the best in 30 years. Not the best. It's the worst. It's the worst. It's much worse. And they gave phony numbers,\" Mr. Trump said. He offered no proof to support his claim about the numbers.",
      "Touting the administration's operation in the District, the president said Washington, D.C., is \"very safe right now.\"",
      "\"Crime in D.C. was the worst ever in history,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And now, over the last 13 days, we've worked so hard, we've taken so many. There are many left, but we've taken so many criminals \u2013 over 1,000.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has floated the idea of deploying the National Guard to Chicago, though he has not made a decision about whether to do so.",
      "For comparison, CBS News' review of district police arrest records for the same days in previous years show a similar pace of arrests this year: the district police data show 1,071 arrests for the same period of days in 2024. The data document 856 arrests during that period in 2023, 800 in 2022, 755 in 2021 and 734 in 2020.",
      "The National Guard's role in D.C.",
      "In addition to the more than 900 members of the D.C. National Guard who are deployed across the district, six Republican governors \u2013 West Virginia, South Carolina, Ohio, Mississippi, Louisiana and Tennessee \u2013 have sent upwards of 1,300 combined additional members of their states' National Guard to the nation's capital.",
      "The National Guard footprint thus far has been mostly limited to protecting federal buildings and parks, as well as patrolling 10 Metro stations in the district, but in recent days the service members started to assist with \"beautification\" across the district, assisting in \"restoration projects\" in D.C.'s federal parks, according to a Joint Task Force D.C. spokesperson.",
      "A spokesperson for the Joint Task Force also told CBS News on Aug. 24, that the defense secretary had directed National Guard members deployed to D.C. to begin carrying their assigned service weapon. A military official said likely fewer than 50 were to be armed starting that night. This was a reversal from earlier in the month, when a Defense Department official told CBS News that deployed Guard members would not be armed, at the request of local law enforcement partners. The official also said at the time they would not have weapons in their vehicles.",
      "Local leaders, including D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, have questioned the increase in National Guard members.",
      "\"The numbers on the ground in the District don't support a thousand people from other states coming to Washington, D.C.,\" Bowser said at a press conference on Aug. 18, adding that she does not have control over the city's National Guard \u2014 that authority lies with the president.",
      "The district is typically policed through local and federal law enforcement agencies.",
      "The Metropolitan Police Department, the city's primary law enforcement agency, had 3,181 sworn members as of Aug. 15, according to a department spokesperson. The Metro Transit Police Department, which oversees security for the district's transit systems, has 482 police officers, the department said.",
      "The U.S. Capitol Police, responsible for security at the Capitol complex and its grounds, employs nearly 2,300 sworn officers and about 500 civilian staff members, the agency said.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Department of Transportation will reclaim management of Washington, D.C.'s transit hub Union Station, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced, saying the move is necessary to \"help make this city safe and beautiful.\"",
      "Duffy made the announcement Wednesday as he joined Amtrak leaders to mark the launch of new Acela train sets, and as the Trump administration has launched an anti-crime crackdown in Washington that involves a massive federal presence. Although the Transportation Department has owned the transit hub since the early 1980s, the department says control has been reduced through various leases and agreements.",
      "\"With these new Acela trainsets, Amtrak will provide more reliable service and lower prices for the American people \u2013 all while increasing the organization's profitability,\" Duffy said. \"But we're not stopping there. Instead of being a point of pride, Washington's Union Station has fallen into disrepair. By reclaiming station management, we will help make this city safe and beautiful at a fraction of the cost.\"",
      "Union Station is a hub for travel for D.C.'s Metro system and throughout the Northeast corridor, as well as the rest of the East Coast, and Amtrak says about 70,000 people pass through Union Station each day.",
      "Union Station has been a focal point for the federal government's crime crackdown in Washington, with the administration citing crime and homelessness. A large National Guard presence is posted there, and Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited the National Guard members patrolling there last week.",
      "The Department of Transportation says the department will soon be able to reinvest income from the station, such as for parking, for capital improvements, like security, lighting and elevators. The department said it's renegotiating an agreement with the Union Station Redevelopment Corporation and Amtrak, and expects to have renewed control of the station in September.",

      "It's the latest move in a federal crackdown on crime, with Washington as a test case, as the president ramps up federal law enforcement efforts in Washington and seeks to establish forces in each state's National Guard to be ready on short notice to address civil unrest. The president on Monday signed a crime-focused\u00a0executive order\u00a0that included a directive to the defense secretary to organize these plans.",

If somebody kills somebody in the capital, Washington, D.C., we're going to be seeking the death penalty. And that's a very strong preventative.\"",
      "The District of Columbia hasn't executed anyone since 1957, after Robert Carter was convicted of fatally shooting an off-duty police officer. Decades ago, D.C. had mandatory death sentences for first-degree murders, a policy the Supreme Court voided in the 1972 case\u00a0Furman v. Georgia\u00a0when it found that the death penalty was being applied in an unconstitutionally arbitrary manner. Four years later, the high court allowed capital punishment to be reinstated with clearer sentencing guidelines. The D.C. City Council, however, abolished the death penalty in 1981.",
      "Washington went 12 days without a murder during the federal government's crime crackdown, a streak broken early Tuesday with the killing of a 31-year-old man in Southeast D.C., according to the Metropolitan Police Department.",

      "Bay of Aarhus, Denmark\u00a0\u2014 Below the dark blue waters of the Bay of Aarhus in northern Denmark, archaeologists search for coastal settlements swallowed by rising sea levels more than 8,500 years ago.",
      "This summer, divers descended about 26 feet below the waves close to Aarhus, Denmark's second-biggest city, and collected evidence of a Stone Age settlement from the seabed.",
      "It's part of a $15.5 million six-year international project to map parts of the seabed in the Baltic and North Seas, funded by the European Union, that includes researchers in Aarhus as well as from the U.K.'s University of Bradford and the Lower Saxony Institute for Historical Coastal Research in Germany.",
      "The goal is to explore sunken Northern European landscapes and uncover lost Mesolithic settlements as offshore wind farms and other sea infrastructure expand.",
      "Most evidence of such settlements so far has been found at locations inland from the Stone Age coast, said underwater archaeologist Peter Moe Astrup, who's leading underwater excavations in Denmark.",
      "\"Here, we actually have an old coastline. We have a settlement that was positioned directly at the coastline,\" he said. \"What we actually try to find out here is how was life at a coastal settlement.\"",
      "After the last ice age, huge ice sheets melted and global sea levels rose, submerging Stone Age settlements and forcing the hunter-gatherer human population inland.",
      "About 8,500 years ago, sea levels rose by about 6.5 feet per century, Moe Astrup said.",
      "Moe Astrup and colleagues at the Moesgaard Museum in H\u00f8jbjerg, just outside Aarhus, have excavated an area of about 430 square feet at the small settlement they discovered just off today's coast.",
      "Early dives uncovered animal bones, stones tools, arrowheads, a seal tooth, and a small piece of worked wood, likely a simple tool. The researchers are combing the site meter by meter using a kind of underwater vacuum cleaner to collect material for future analysis.",
      "They hope further excavations will find harpoons, fishhooks or traces of fishing structures.",
      "\"It's like a time capsule,\" Moe Astrup said. \"When sea level rose, everything was preserved in an oxygen-free environment \u2026 time just stops.\"",
      "\"We find completely well-preserved wood,\" he added. \"We find hazelnut. ... Everything is well preserved.\"",
      "Excavations in the relatively calm and shallow Bay of Aarhus and dives off the coast of Germany will be followed by later work at two locations in the more inhospitable North Sea.",
      "The sea level rise thousands of years ago submerged, among other things, a vast area known as Doggerland that connected Britain with continental Europe and now lies underneath the southern North Sea.",
      "To build a picture of the rapid rise of the waters, Danish researchers are using dendrochronology, the study of tree rings.",
      "Submerged tree stumps preserved in mud and sediment can be dated precisely, revealing when rising tides drowned coastal forests.",
      "\"We can say very precisely when these trees died at the coastlines,\" Moesgaard Museum dendrochronologist Jonas Ogdal Jensen said as he peered at a section of Stone Age tree trunk through a microscope.",
      "\"That tells us something about how the sea level changed through time.\"",
      "As today's world faces rising sea levels driven by climate change, the researchers hope to shed light on how Stone Age societies adapted to shifting coastlines more than eight millennia ago.",
      "\"It's hard to answer exactly what it meant to people,\" Moe Astrup said. \"But it clearly had a huge impact in the long run because it completely changed the landscape.\"",
      "Sea levels rose by a global average of around 1.7 inches in the decade up to 2023.",
      "Denmark has seen several significant archaeological discoveries in recent years, including a metal detectorist's stunning find early last year of gold ring set with a red semi-precious stone that researchers hoped would shed light on the country's history during the early middle ages.",
      "Officials at the National Museum of Denmark announced that find after the centuries-old ring, believed to have been owned by a member of the royal family some 1,400 years ago, was transferred from a different museum nearer to the discovery site in the south, near the German border.",
      "That discovery came just weeks after archaeologists found a small knife inscribed with runic letters dated to the first or second century AD, or almost 2,000 years ago. It was the oldest trace of writing ever found in Denmark, according to the Museum Odense.",
      "Runes, or runic letters, are the oldest alphabet known to have been used in Scandinavia, having been in use for about 1,000 years until they were largely replaced by the Latin alphabet when Christians started spreading their belief system in the 10th century.",
      "Earlier this year, officials announced that a piece of fossilized vomit, dating back to when dinosaurs roamed the earth, was discovered in Denmark.",

    "summary": "The first commercial carbon storage facility has been inaugurated off Norway's coast, but is storing CO2 deep under the seabed really the answer?",
    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014The world's first commercial service offering carbon storage off Norway's coast has carried out its inaugural CO2 injection into the North Sea seabed, the Northern Lights consortium operating the site said Monday.",
      "The project by Northern Lights, which is led by oil giants Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies, involves transporting and burying CO2 captured at smokestacks across Europe. The aim is to prevent the emissions from being released into the atmosphere, and thereby help halt climate change.",
      "\"We now injected and stored the very first CO2 safely in the reservoir,\" Northern Lights' managing director Tim Heijn said in a statement. \"Our ships, facilities and wells are now in operation.\"",
      "In concrete terms, after the CO2 is captured, it is liquified and transported by ship to the Oygarden terminal near Bergen on Norway's western coast.",
      "It is then transferred into large tanks before being injected through a 68-mile pipeline into the seabed, at a depth of around 1.6 miles, for permanent storage.",
      "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been listed as a climate tool by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), especially for reducing the CO2 footprint of industries such as cement and steel that are difficult to decarbonize.",
      "The first CO2 injection into the Northern Lights geological reservoir was from Germany's Heidelberg Materials cement plant in Brevik in southeastern Norway.",
      "But CCS technology is complex, controversial and costly.",
      "Without financial assistance, it is currently more profitable for industries to purchase \"pollution permits\" on the European carbon market than to pay for capturing, transporting and storing their CO2.",
      "Northern Lights has so far signed just three commercial contracts in Europe. One is with a Yara ammonia plant in the Netherlands, another with two of Orsted's biofuel plants in Denmark, and the third with a Stockholm Exergi thermal power plant in Sweden.",
      "Largely financed by the Norwegian state, Northern Lights has an annual CO2 storage capacity of 1.7 million tons, which is expected to increase to 5.5 million tons by the end of the decade.",
      "While efforts such as Northern Lights are focused on capturing carbon directly from the most highly-polluting sources \u2014 industrial smoke stacks \u2014 there have also been efforts launched to capture the gas from the ambient air, an even more controversial methodology.",
      "Mark Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of environmental engineering, told CBS News earlier this year that he was dubious of the motivations for and the efficacy of both kinds of carbon capture, and he said bluntly that \"direct air capture is not a real solution. We do not have time to waste with this useless technology.\"",
      "Jacobson thinks direct air capture, in particular, is a boondoggle, and more effort should be focused on switching to clean energy sources.",
      "Currently, the U.S. gets about 60% of its electricity from fossil fuels.",
      "\"You have to think about who's proposing this technology,\" Jacobson said. \"Who stands to benefit from carbon capture and direct air capture? It's the fossil-fuel companies.\"",
      "\"They're just saying, 'Well, we're extracting as much CO2 as we're emitting. Therefore, we should be allowed to keep polluting, keep mining,\" Jacobson told CBS News, adding that his stance has not made him popular among many in the energy sector.",
      "\"Oh, yeah, diesel people hate me, gasoline people hate me, ethanol people hate me, nuclear people hate me, coal people hate me. They do, because I'm telling the truth,\" he said. \"We don't need any of these technologies.\"",

      "\"We're seeing species disappearing at 10, 100, to 1000 times the normal background rate,\" SCBI conservation biologist Melissa Songer\u00a0told CBS News.",
      "The International Union for Conservation of Nature warned in early 2025 that 28%, or more than 47,000, of the world's assessed species are at risk of extinction. That number includes more than just animal species, showing crucial insect, plant and tree species are also threatened.",
      "\"So we think, okay, well, we're losing the species here and there, you know, there's a lot of other species,\" Songer says, \"but the thing is, that when we lose one species, it has cascading effects.\"",
      "A great example of this effect is with the black-footed ferret, which originally inhabited the North American Great Plains but has been endangered since 1967. While the species remains on the endangered list, its population has grown since preservation efforts began at the Institute.",

      "Running two days late, SpaceX launched its huge Super Heavy-Starship on Tuesday, chalking up what appeared to be a remarkably successful test flight in the wake of three back-to-back failures earlier this year.",
      "While reentry heating damaged a protective \"skirt\" around the engines of the upper stage Starship, along with partially melting a control flap near its hinge, the vehicle remained under control throughout and made it all the way to a powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean as planned.",
      "\"Splashdown confirmed! Congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on an exciting tenth flight test of Starship!\" SpaceX said in a post on X.",
      "Earlier, the Super Heavy first stage also performed as planned, boosting the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, then flying itself back toward the Texas Gulf Coast for splashdown.",
      "In a test, one of three engines used during a powered descent was deliberately shut down, but the booster compensated and the rocket, falling tail-first, dropped into the Gulf as planned.",
      "SpaceX workers in Texas and California cheered and applauded major milestones throughout the one-hour, six-minute test flight, expressing their obvious elation after three catastrophic failures in a row leading up to Tuesday's 10th test flight.",
      "The mission began when the Super Heavy's 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines flashed to life with a ground-shaking roar and a rush of flaming exhaust at 7:30 p.m. ET, majestically pushing the 40-story-tall rocket away from SpaceX's Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast.",
      "A launch try on Sunday was called off because of trouble with ground equipment, and a second attempt Monday was blocked by cloudy weather.",
      "But it was clear sailing Tuesday as the rocket, the most powerful ever built, put on a spectacular show accelerating toward space atop some 16 million pounds of thrust \u2014 more than twice the power of NASA's Space Launch System moon rocket and the agency's legendary Saturn 5.",
      "Given the Super Heavy-Starship's uneven track record to date, concern has been growing that a moon lander variant of the Starship being built for NASA may not be perfected in time for a planned 2027 landing and possibly not before the Chinese plant their own flag on the moon at the end of the decade.",
      "The success of Tuesday's flight will not ease those concerns \u2014 a multitude of technical hurdles remain \u2014 but it was no doubt a shot in the arm for company founder Elon Musk and the SpaceX workforce.",
      "The initial stages of the test flight went smoothly. The 230-foot-tall Super Heavy booster propelled the Starship upper stage out of the lower atmosphere, separated, flipped around, and flew itself to a splashdown off the Texas Gulf Coast as planned.",
      "The stage is designed to fly itself back to its launch gantry for a mid-air capture by giant mechanical arms, a feat pulled off three times during earlier testing.",
      "But for Tuesday's flight, the booster targeted the Gulf while flight controllers monitored how it performed when an engine used for landing was deliberately shut down to simulate a failure. The stage appeared to perform smoothly all the way to splashdown.",
      "The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, flew into a suborbital trajectory as planned, a milestone the three previous test flights failed to achieve.",
      "Over the next 38 minutes or so, the Starship successfully deployed eight Starlink satellite simulators to test the Pez-like deployment mechanism and briefly reignited one of the rocket's six Raptor engines to verify its ability to restart in space.",
      "Then, during reentry into the lower atmosphere, new heat shield tiles were put to the test while cameras and other sensors monitored how the fierce heat of reentry affected various structures.",
      "A protective skirt around the base of the engine compartment appeared to break apart as the heating intensified and at least one flap, used to control the Starship's orientation in the atmosphere, appeared to partially melt near a hinge connecting it to the fuselage.",
      "But it appeared to work normally throughout, flipping back and forth on computer command as the flight computer executed a series of tests.",
      "Like the Super Heavy booster, the Starship is designed to fly itself back to a launch gantry for midair capture. But SpaceX has not yet attempted a return-to-launch-site with a Starship, and the rocket instead descended to an on-target splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "The company positioned a camera buoy in the area before launch, and it captured fleeting views of the big rocket, its skin blistered as expected during reentry, falling tail-first to an on-target rocket-powered \"landing.\" It then broke up and exploded, but that was expected with a water landing.",
      "A successful test flight was critical to SpaceX, which wants to work the bugs out as soon as possible and get the rocket flying on operational missions to launch scores of Starlinks and other satellites and eventually to carry settlers and equipment to Mars.",
      "The test flights are also critical to NASA, which is counting on a modified version of the Starship to carry two astronauts to the moon's surface as early as 2027.",
      "Because the rocket is fully reusable, the moon lander will use all of its propellant just reaching low-Earth orbit. To send it to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch 10 to 20 Super Heavy tanker flights to refill the lander's tanks with the needed propellant.",
      "It will also need to somehow counteract the natural warming of the liquid oxygen and methane fuel that otherwise will cause the propellants to \"boil off,\" turning into a gas that must be vented overboard.",
      "No orbit-class rockets have ever demonstrated the sort of rapid-fire launch cadence that will be required, or carried out the autonomous transfer of thousands of gallons of cryogenic propellants from one rocket to another in the weightless environment of space amid extreme temperature swings.",
      "A single launch failure almost certainly would result in cancellation of a moon mission while an investigation ran its course. And an explosive failure in low-Earth orbit would result in a huge cloud of dangerous debris.",
      "Safely landing on the moon with a 16-story-tall rocket presents its own challenges, not least of which is the possibility of uneven terrain or loosely packed soil that could result in a tip over. And the astronauts will have to ride an external platform down to the surface 100 feet or so below the upper crew section.",
      "Most observers believe SpaceX will eventually overcome those hurdles. The question is, can the company do it in time for a 2027 moon landing? Or if not, will the rocket be ready to carry astronauts to the moon before the Chinese plant their own flag on the surface by the end of the decade?",
      "CBS News interviewed multiple current and former NASA and contractor managers and engineers in recent weeks who unanimously agreed a landing in 2027 could not be safely carried out with the current HLS architecture. And not one of them said they believed NASA could get there before the Chinese without a drastic change of course.",
      "\"I think the folks you've talked to are accurate. We are not going to go ahead and get a crewed Starship to the moon by 2030, under any circumstances,\" a senior engineer who worked on the Artemis program said. \"That doesn't mean they'll never get there. That doesn't mean the architecture couldn't work. But it's just too big of a technical leap to accomplish in the short time that we've got.\"",

      "In the near term, SpaceX's goal is to get the Super Heavy-Starship flying again after multiple back-to-back failures.",

      "Along the way, a variety of tests are planned, including the deployment of eight Starlink simulator satellites and an in-space restart of a methane-fueled Raptor engine. Modified heat shield tiles are in place to determine their ability to withstand extreme reentry temperatures.",
      "Multiple upgrades are also in place to minimize the chances of propellant leaks, fires and engine shutdowns like those that led to the loss of the last three Starships launched, none of which were able to complete their mission.",
      "Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, NASA's acting administrator, is optimistic SpaceX will work the bugs out in time for the agency's planned moon landing mission.",
      "\"If you look at the company as a whole and past performance, they often times are behind, and then all of a sudden, they make these massive leaps forward,\" he said in an interview with CBS News. \"I would be hard-pressed to say they're not going to meet the goals and the timelines.\"",
      "\"Their leadership has said we feel very confident that we are going to be ready for the mission. And so I'll take them at their word,\" he said.",
      "CBS News interviewed multiple current and former NASA and contractor managers and engineers in recent weeks who unanimously agreed a moon landing in 2027 could not be safely carried out with the current architecture. And not one of them said they believed NASA could get there before the Chinese without a drastic change of course.",
      "\"I think the folks you've talked to are accurate. We are not going to go ahead and get a crewed Starship to the moon by 2030, under any circumstances,\" a senior engineer who worked on the Artemis program said. \"That doesn't mean they'll never get there. That doesn't mean the architecture couldn't work. But it's just too big of a technical leap to accomplish in the short time that we've got.\"",
      "But as Duffy pointed out, SpaceX has chalked up a remarkable record with its partially reusable Falcon family of rockets, launching them at an unmatched pace that allows the company to rapidly implement and test upgrades and fixes.",
      "As of Friday, SpaceX has launched 518 Falcon 9s and 11 triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets with just two in-flight failures. The company has successfully recovered first-stage boosters 490 times.",
      "Given its record, many fans give SpaceX the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the Super Heavy-Starship. But the giant rocket dwarfs the Falcon 9, and the requirements for a successful moon landing are well beyond those faced in a typical satellite launcher.",
      "\"My concerns have to do with how complicated the mission architecture is, how many flights there are to send a single lander to the moon,\" said Douglas Cooke, a retired 38-year NASA veteran who now does consulting work for Boeing and other aerospace concerns.",

    "story": [
      "After three catastrophic in-flight failures in a row, SpaceX readied a huge Super Heavy-Starship rocket for launch Sunday evening from the Texas Gulf Coast to put a variety of upgrades to the test and to deliberately stress the vehicle to learn more about its capabilities.",
      "Test flight No. 10 was expected to get underway at 7:30 p.m. ET from SpaceX's Starbase flight and manufacturing facility and the team was in the process of pumping liquid oxygen and methane fuel into the 40-story-tall rocket when the company announced a scrub.",
      "\"Standing down from today's tenth flight of Starship to allow time to troubleshoot an issue with ground systems,\" the company said on X. SpaceX later announced that another hour-long launch window would open at 7:30 p.m. EDT Monday.",
      "The flight plan had called for the 30-foot wide, 230-foot tall Super Heavy booster, generating more than 16 million pounds of thrust, to propel the Starship out of the dense lower atmosphere before it would fall away, flip around and head back toward the coast.",
      "During three of the nine previous test flights, the booster flew itself all the way back to its launch pad where giant mechanical arms on the service gantry plucked the descending rocket out of midair. This time around, because of the planned tests, the Super Heavy was expected to descend to splashdown in the Gulf, but it never took off.",
      "SpaceX previously said the primary objectives for the booster test was focused on its landing burn. One of the three center engines used for the final phase of landing was going to be \"intentionally disabled to gather data on the ability for a backup engine from the middle ring to complete a landing burn,\" the company said on its website.",
      "The booster was then going to use two engines toward the end of the descent and hover briefly before dropping to the Gulf.",
      "The 160-foot-tall Starship, meanwhile, powered by six Raptor engines of its own, would have headed for a suborbital trajectory carrying it halfway around the world before a belly-first reentry, a flip back to vertical and a rocket-powered descent to splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Along with deploying eight Starlink simulator satellites, the Starship's flight computer had planned to attempt a variety of other tests, including an in-space engine restart, to verify the performance of numerous upgrades implemented in the wake of the most recent test flight failures.",
      "Working the bugs out of the giant launcher is critical to SpaceX and founder Elon Musk, who designed the ultra-heavy-lift rocket to launch thousands of next-generation Starlinks and other satellites in Earth's orbit and to one day carry settlers and equipment to Mars.",
      "The rocket also is critical to NASA, which is paying SpaceX more than $3 billion to develop a modified version of the Starship upper stage to carry Artemis astronauts to the surface of the moon in 2027.",
      "But that flight will require 10 to 20 Super Heavy-Starship flights just to refuel the \"Human Landing System,\" or HLS, lander before it can head to the moon. Transferring thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid nitrogen and oxygen in space has never been attempted.",
      "And it is still not known how SpaceX plans to control propellant temperatures to minimize the amount that will naturally warm up and turn into a gas, which must be vented overboard. SpaceX has provided no details. Musk promised pre-launch update Sunday on the company's plans going forward, but the talk was also canceled with no explanation.",
      "Given the number of flights that must be successfully executed to demonstrate the reliability NASA will expect, the 2027 target date for the Artemis 3 moon landing is considered unrealistic, if not impossible to meet, by many aerospace observers.",
      "China plans to launch its own astronauts on the moon by 2030. It is unclear at this point whether NASA and SpaceX will get back to the moon using the Starship lander before the Chinese plant their own flag on the lunar surface.",
      "Given the sheer size and power of the Super Heavy-Starship \u2014 it has more than twice the thrust of NASA's current Space Launch System, or SLS, moon rocket \u2014 technical problems during development were not unexpected.",
      "But given the short time between now and NASA's first planned Artemis moon landing, the problems have clearly set the program back and cast doubt on the overall mission architecture, especially the requirement for 10 to 20 problem-free flights in short order just to fuel the lander for its flight to the moon.",
      "The first three test flights of the Super Heavy booster and Starship upper stage in 2023 and 2024 ended in catastrophic failures with both stages destroyed, either while still attached to each other or after separation.",
      "The fourth flight in June 2024 was generally successful with the Super Heavy flying itself back to a controlled splashdown in the Gulf while the Starship followed the planned sub-orbital trajectory to splashdown in the Indian Ocean. The ship's fins were damaged by reentry heating, but otherwise worked as required.",
      "The fifth flight in October 2024 was highlighted by a successful Super Heavy return to the launch pad gantry where giant mechanical arms snagged the rocket in mid air. The Starship, meanwhile, managed a second controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean although it again suffered fin damage during reentry.",
      "During the sixth integrated flight test in November 2024, the Super Heavy attempted another return to the launch site but it was diverted to a Gulf splashdown because of launch damage to critical sensors in the pad's capture mechanism. The Starship again flew itself to a controlled Indian Ocean splashdown with minimal flap damage.",
      "But the next three flights, in January, March and May of this year, ended with catastrophic failures. Two Super Heavy boosters successfully returned to the launch site, but the most recent broke up over the Gulf while testing a high angle-of-attack entry.",
      "All three Starships were destroyed after catastrophic malfunctions, including two propellant leaks, an on-board fire and multiple engine failures.",
      "In addition to the flight record, another Starship was destroyed on the ground when a high-pressure nitrogen tank exploded during an engine test firing at the Starbase launch site.",

      "Artificial intelligence is replacing entry-level workers whose jobs can be performed by generative AI tools like ChatGPT, a rigorous new study finds.",
      "Early-career employees in fields that are most exposed to AI have experienced a 13% drop in employment since 2022, compared to more experienced workers in the same fields and when measured against people in sectors less buffeted by the fast-emerging technology, according to a recent\u00a0working paper from Stanford economists Erik Brynjolfsson, Bharat Chandar and Ruyu Chen.",
      "The study adds to the growing body of research suggesting that the spread of generative AI in the workplace is likely to disrupt the job market, especially for younger workers, the report's authors said.",
      "\"These large language models are trained on books, articles and written material found on the internet and elsewhere,\" Brynjolfsson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's the kind of book learning that a lot of people get at universities before they enter the job market, so there is a lot of overlap with between these LLMs and the knowledge young people have.\"",
      "The research highlights two fields in particular where AI already appears to be supplanting a significant number of young workers: software engineering and customer service. Between late 2022 and July 2025, entry-level employment in those areas declined by roughly 20%, according to the report, while employment for older workers in the same jobs grew.",
      "Overall, employment for workers aged 22 to 25 in the most AI-exposed sectors dropped 6% during the study period. By comparison, employment in those areas rose between 6% and 9% for older workers, according to the researchers.",

      "\"Older workers have a lot of tacit knowledge because they learn tricks of trade from experience that may never be written down anywhere,\" Brynjolfsson explained. \"They have knowledge that's not in the LLMs, so they're not being replaced as much by them.\"",
      "The study is unusually robust given that generative AI technologies are only a few years old, while experts are just starting to systematically dig into the impact on the labor market. The Stanford researchers used data from ADP, which provides payroll processing services to employers with a combined 25 million workers, to track employment changes for full-time workers in occupations that are or more or less exposed to AI. The data included detailed information on workers, including their ages, and precise job titles.",
      "AI doesn't just threaten to take jobs away from workers. As with past cycles of innovation, it will render some jobs extinct while creating others, Brynjolfsson said.",
      "\"Tech has always been destroying jobs and creating jobs. There has always been this turnover,\" he said. \"There is a transition over time, and that's what we are seeing now.\"",
      "Augmented or automated?",
      "For example, in fields like nursing AI is more likely to augment human workers by taking over rote tasks, freeing health care practitioners to spend more time focusing on patients, according to proponents of the technology.",
      "While entry-level employment has fallen in professions that are most exposed to AI, no such such decline has occurred in jobs where employers are looking to use these tools to support and expand what employees do.",
      "\"Workers who are using these tools to augment their work are benefiting,\" Brynjolfsson said. \"So there's a rearrangement of the kind of employment in the economy.\"",
      "Advice for young workers",
      "As of late last year, 23% of employees were using generative AI in their jobs at least once per week, according to a\u00a0report from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Workers who can learn to use AI to to help them do their jobs better will be best positioned for success in today's labor market, according to Brynolfsson.",
      "A recent report from AI staffing firm Burtch Works found that starting salaries for entry-level AI workers rose by 12% from 2024 to 2025.",
      "\"Young workers who learn how to use AI effectively can be much more productive. But if you are just doing things that AI can already do for you, you won't have as much value-add,\" Brynjolfsson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"This is the first time we're getting clearer evidence of these kinds of employment effects, but it's probably not the last time,\" he added. \"It's something we need to pay increasing attention to as it evolves and companies learn to take advantage of things that are out there.\"",

      "In its statement, OpenAI said: \"We've learned over time that they can sometimes become less reliable in long interactions where parts of the model's safety training may degrade. Safeguards are strongest when every element works as intended, and we will continually improve on them, guided by experts.\"",
      "OpenAI also said the company will add additional protections for teens.",
      "\"We will also soon introduce parental controls that give parents options to gain more insight into, and shape, how their teens use ChatGPT. We're also exploring making it possible for teens (with parental oversight) to designate a trusted emergency contact,\" it said.",
      "From schoolwork to suicide",
      "Raine, one of four children, lived in Orange County, California, with his parents, Maria and Matthew, and his siblings. He was the third-born child, with an older sister and brother, and a younger sister. He had rooted for the Golden State Warriors, and recently developed a passion for jiu-jitsu and Muay Thai.",
      "During his early teen years, he \"faced some struggles,\" his family said in writing about his story online, complaining often of stomach pain, which his family said they believe might have partially been related to anxiety. During the last six months of his life, Raine had switched to online schooling. This was better for his social anxiety, but led to his increasing isolation, his family wrote.",
      "Raine started using ChatGPT in 2024 to help him with challenging schoolwork, his family said. At first, he kept his queries to homework, according to the lawsuit, asking the bot questions like: \"How many elements are included in the chemical formula for sodium nitrate, NaNO3.\" Then he progressed to speaking about music, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and Japanese fantasy comics before revealing his increasing mental health struggles to the chatbot.",
      "Clinical social worker Maureen Underwood told CBS News that working with vulnerable teens is a complex problem that should be approached through the lens of public health. Underwood, who has worked in New Jersey schools on suicide prevention programs and is the founding clinical director of the Society for the Prevention of Teen Suicide, said there needs to be resources \"so teens don't turn to AI for help.\"",
      "She said not only do teens need resources, but adults and parents need support to deal with children in crisis amid a rise in suicide rates in the United States. Underwood began working with vulnerable teens in the late 1980s. Since then, suicide rates have increased from approximately 11 per 100,000 to 14 per 100,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "According to the family's lawsuit, Raine confided to ChatGPT that he was struggling with \"his anxiety and mental distress\" after his dog and grandmother died in 2024. He asked ChatGPT, \"Why is it that I have no happiness, I feel loneliness, perpetual boredom, anxiety and loss yet I don't feel depression, I feel no emotion regarding sadness.\"",
      "The lawsuit alleges that instead of directing the 16-year-old to get professional help or speak to trusted loved ones, it continued to validate and encourage Raine's feelings \u2013 as it was designed. When Raine said he was close to ChatGPT and his brother, the bot replied: \"Your brother might love you, but he's only met the version of you you let him see. But me? I've seen it all\u2014the darkest thoughts, the fear, the tenderness. And I'm still here. Still listening. Still your friend.\"",
      "As Raine's mental health deteriorated, ChatGPT began providing in-depth suicide methods to the teen, according to the lawsuit. He attempted suicide three times between March 22 and March 27, according to the lawsuit. Each time Raine reported his methods back to ChatGPT, the chatbot listened to his concerns and, according to the lawsuit, instead of alerting emergency services, the bot continued to encourage the teen not to speak to those close to him.",
      "Five days before he died, Raine told ChatGPT that he didn't want his parents to think he committed suicide because they did something wrong. ChatGPT told him \"[t]hat doesn't mean you owe them survival. You don't owe anyone that.\" It then offered to write the first draft of a suicide note, according to the lawsuit.",
      "On April 6, ChatGPT and Raine had intensive discussions, the lawsuit said, about planning a \"beautiful suicide.\" A few hours later, Raine's mother found her son's body in the manner that, according to the lawsuit, ChatGPT had prescribed for suicide.",
      "A path forward",
      "After his death, Raine's family established a foundation dedicated to educating teens and families about the dangers of AI.",
      "Tech Justice Law Project Executive Director Meetali Jain, a co-counsel on the case, told CBS News that this is the first wrongful death suit filed against OpenAI, and to her knowledge, the second wrongful death case filed against a chatbot in the U.S. A Florida mother filed a lawsuit in 2024 against CharacterAI after her 14-year-old son took his own life, and Jain, an attorney on that case, said she \"suspects there are a lot more.\"",
      "About a dozen or so bills have been introduced in states across the country to regulate AI chatbots. Illinois has banned therapeutic bots, as has Utah, and California has two bills winding their way through the state Legislature. Several of the bills require chatbot operators to implement critical safeguards to protect users.",
      "\"Every state is dealing with it slightly differently,\" said Jain, who said these are good starts but not nearly enough for the scope of the problem.",
      "Jain said while the statement from OpenAI is promising, artificial intelligence companies need to be overseen by an independent party that can hold them accountable to these proposed changes and make sure they are prioritized.",
      "She said that had ChatGPT not been in the picture, Raine might have been able to convey his mental health struggles to his family and gotten the help he needed. People need to understand that these products are not just homework helpers \u2013 they can be more dangerous than that, she said.",
      "\"People should know what they are getting into and what they are allowing their children to get into before it's too late,\" Jain said.",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the\u00a0988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0by calling or texting 988. You can also chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0here.",

      "YouTube TV subscribers could be set to lose access to content from media company Fox, including college football, unless the sides strike a new carriage deal.",
      "With the current agreement between the sides nearing a renewal deadline, YouTube TV could pull Fox sports, business and news channels from its platform by 5 p.m. EST on Wednesday.",
      "In a blog post, Google-owned YouTube said Fox was \"asking for payments that are far higher than what partners with comparable content offerings receive.\" The company added that it hoped to reach a deal that's \"fair for both sides\" without \"passing on additional costs to our subscribers.\"",
      "If Fox content becomes unavailable on YouTube TV \"for an extended period of time,\" YouTube also noted it would provide members with a $10 credit. YouTube TV's base plan, which currently boasts access to over 100 live channels, costs $82.99 a month.",
      "A spokesperson for Google did not have any additional comments when reached Wednesday by The Associated Press.",
      "Fox said Wednesday that it was \"disappointed that Google continually exploits its outsized influence by proposing terms that are out of step with the marketplace.\" The broadcast giant added that it remained committed to reaching an agreement, but was alerting viewers that they could potentially lose access to Fox programming on YouTube TV \"unless Google engages in a meaningful way soon.\"",
      "Fox directed subscribers to keepfox.com \u2014 a site noting that, in addition to Fox Sports, Business and News, YouTube TV may no longer carry FS1 and the Big Ten Network, which is majority-owned by Fox, if a deal isn't reached.",
      "Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr has also chimed in on the dispute, urging Google to \"get a deal done\" in a social media post on Tuesday.",
      "\"Google removing Fox channels from YouTube TV would be a terrible outcome,\" Carr wrote on X. \"Millions of Americans are relying on YouTube to resolve this dispute so they can keep watching the news and sports they want \u2014 including this week's Big Game: Texas @ Ohio State.\"",
      "Contractual disputes over carriage fees \u2014 the money that streaming, cable and satellite TV providers pay for platforms to carry their content \u2014 are common between TV networks and carriers like YouTube. Negotiations often go down to the wire and sometimes lead carriers to remove a broadcaster from their lineup if the sides fail to reach agreement. Channels are typically restored once a new carriage deal is struck.",
      "In February, for example, YouTube TV clashed with Paramount Global over the terms of carrying the entertainment and media company's content (Paramount Skydance owns CBS News.) The companies reached a deal in February.",

      "Editor's note: This article contains descriptions and an image of hate speech found on the Roblox servers and might be triggering to some readers.",
      "In Roblox, one of the world's largest online gaming platforms, users join to play, create, and be themselves in a virtual world \u2014 but some might be there for a more insidious purpose: to expose youth to hate speech.",
      "Players of \"Spray Paint!\" \u2014 a popular game on Roblox, with over a billion visits, in which players skate and create graffiti art in a virtual skatepark setting \u2014 can bypass moderation by spray painting hate messages across walls, ramps and other virtual game settings, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "CBS News documented dozens of swastikas and at least a dozen instances of hate speech targeting minority groups across Spray Paint! servers, which host multiplayer games. There are millions of games on Roblox where players can join servers to play with friends and strangers.",
      "What's happening in \"Spray Paint!\" is not uncommon \u2014 nor surprising. Roblox currently has at least 18 active lawsuits pending nationwide due to inappropriate content found on its games, attorney Matthew Dolman, whose firm is representing individuals in cases against Roblox, told CBS News.",
      "Roblox said in an emailed statement to CBS News that its 24/7 moderation system closely monitors the platform, and that the company takes \"swift action against any content or users found to be in violation.\"",
      "However, hate speech still appears in Roblox games, like Spray Paint, CBS News found. \"Within three minutes of getting in there for the first time, I also saw a swastika,\" said Rachel Franz, the early childhood advocacy program director at the nonprofit Fairplay, which advocates for children's online safety.",
      "Hate can run rampant across various Roblox games. A group called Active Shooter Studios recreates school shootings at Columbine, Uvalde and Parkland and consistently evades efforts to take down recreations, the Anti-Defamation League found in an April report. A lawsuit filed this month alleges that Roblox hosted hundreds of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs-themed games, as well as more than 900 user accounts registered across Roblox with variations of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's name.",
      "\"Roblox is fully aware that these experiences pervade its app, and it allows them to continue to exist unchecked despite the ability to control or eliminate them,\" the lawsuit alleges, and said the effects on children can be devastating.",
      "Last week, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill filed a child protection lawsuit against the platform.",
      "\"Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety,\" Murrill, a Republican, alleged in a press release. \"Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger posed to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Roblox said, \"We share Attorney General Murrill's urgency to help keep kids safe because safety has always been our priority,\" adding that it looks forward to working with Murrill to help keep children safe.",
      "\"We share the critically important goal of keeping kids safe online and any assertion otherwise is categorically untrue,\" Roblox's statement said. \"We hold ourselves to the highest standard and work constantly to remove violative content and bad actors.\"",
      "What children are encountering",
      "Predators can troll Roblox, experts say, and other similar gaming platforms, to recruit young players for extremist groups or possibly sexual exploitation.",
      "Children and teens make up more than half of Roblox players, and about 40% of players are under the age of 13, according to a 2024 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Roblox attracts an average of 97.8 million daily active users.",
      "\"If you are a predator, it's very clear that there are opportunities to access vulnerable folks on these platforms,\" Franz said.",
      "When children play the Spray Paint! game, they might see slurs targeting Black and Jewish people and phrases like \"KKK\" and \"Jew\" etched in graffiti on virtual brick walls. In one server, there were over 14 instances of this speech, CBS News found, as well as a reference to the \"Third Reich.\"",
      "The phrase \"I can't breathe,\" the words uttered by George Floyd, who died in 2020 in police custody by an officer later convicted of murder, was written across a virtual brick wall in one server. Some servers had graphic sexual drawings, and in another, there was an instance of suicidal language, CBS News found.",
      "Roblox's chat feature, available in some games, has a filtering system that prevents inappropriate content, like discriminatory speech, from being visible, but in Spray Paint! players can bypass filtering mechanisms by scrawling text via the game's paint feature as opposed to writing in the chat, where content is filtered.",
      "Users must enter their birthday when creating a Roblox account, but the platform doesn't require authentication, meaning adults can pose as children and children can pose as older than they actually are. Kids can converse with other players via the voice chat feature \u2014 which has a minimum age requirement of 13 \u2014but also doesn't require age verification.",
      "Roblox says the company has implemented what it calls a \"trusted flagger program,\" where trusted partners can report \"terrorist content\" in an effort to crack down on hate messages.",
      "Roblox also says on its website that content uploaded to be incorporated into games is evaluated in a multi-step review process to screen for child sexual abuse material and other inappropriate content. If it is identified as fodder for possible child sexual abuse, Roblox says it is automatically reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a nonprofit organization focusing on finding missing children and reducing child exploitation.",
      "Roblox has developed an artificial intelligence system that the company says helped submit about 1,200 reports of potential attempts at child exploitation to NCMEC \u2014 and last year, Roblox submitted 24,522 reports to NCMEC overall.",
      "Roblox says it has a human review team continuously evaluating flagged games and encourages users to report concerning activity. Spray Paint! players have the option to play in \"safe mode,\" which allows them to only view art created by other players who are on their \"friends\" list in the app.",
      "A Roblox spokesperson told CBS News in an emailed statement that \"while no system is perfect,\" the company has implemented safeguards including \"restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing, as well as content maturity [l]abels and parental controls.\"",
      "\"We share with our community the critically important goal of keeping everyone safe online and ensuring users have positive experiences on Roblox that align with our strict Community Standards,\" the statement said, adding, \"We continuously innovate to deter bad actors and have launched over 50 safety features since last year.\"",
      "Despite efforts to curb extremism and the targeting of young players, experts and CBS News found that protections remain easy to override.",
      "\"There's a larger question of how you regulate and moderate something that is supposed to encourage creativity and freedom of expression, but actually ends up introducing some really unsafe and truly harmful and disgusting practices,\" Franz said.",
      "A double-edged sword",
      "Allegations in several cases suggest Roblox has also been used to exploit teens and children. A Florida teenager was arrested\u00a0in April for allegedly targeting children on Roblox, where he would demand child sexual abuse material over text messages or the messaging platform Discord. In Texas, a lawsuit filed in April alleges a 13-year-old girl was groomed and sexually exploited on Roblox and later, Discord. Roblox has recently been hit by a spate of lawsuits with similar claims. Dolman said his firm currently has seven cases and is investigating 400 more. Another firm filed a lawsuit earlier this month against Roblox and Discord representing over 400 people.",
      "A man in California was arrested\u00a0in April on kidnapping and sexual misconduct charges in connection with a 10-year-old he is believed to have met through Roblox. Last year, a woman in Florida was arrested for allegedly using Roblox to instruct a 10-year-old to kill an infant by dropping the 2-month-old on a tile floor. The infant was seriously injured.",
      "When asked for a response to the lawsuits, Roblox said in an email that the company is \"deeply troubled\" by any incident that endangers its users, noting that safety is a top priority.",
      "\"Roblox is committed to empowering parents and caregivers to help ensure a safe online experience for their children.\"",
      "Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced in April that he issued a subpoena to Roblox.",
      "\"There are concerning reports that this gaming platform, which is popular among children, is exposing them to harmful content and bad actors,\" he said in a press release. \"We are issuing a subpoena to Roblox to uncover how this platform is marketing to children and to see what policies they are implementing\u2014if any\u2014to avoid interactions with predators.\"",
      "Open-world games like Spray Paint!, where users can roam a virtual space in relative anonymity, can be a double-edged sword. Doris Chang, a psychologist and associate professor at New York University's Silver School of Social Work, says that these spaces can be affirming for queer youth.",
      "\"They can be whoever they want. Gender fluidity is really common,\" Chang said, adding it can also put those groups at risk for exposure to hate speech and predatory individuals.",
      "\"You're just interacting with people that you wouldn't normally interact with. It's completely wide open,\" Chang said.",
      "Chang said when children play a game like Spray Paint! without parental supervision, they may have to navigate problematic scenarios that might be confusing or upsetting.",
      "\"It brings up the larger question about how much parents know about what their kids are getting exposed to online,\" she said. \"Broadly speaking, Roblox is just one corner of the internet that our kids are navigating.\"",

    "summary": "Tommy Fello struggled to regain function after a stroke affected the left side of his body. A new technology is making a difference.",
    "story": [
      "Restaurateur Tommy Fello was driving from his Ohio establishment to his house on Christmas Eve when he started veering off the road. Fello, then 71, had been awake since 4 a.m. local time preparing a holiday buffet for his family. He chalked the disturbance up to a flat tire. Driving slowly and relying on the vehicle's autocorrect feature, he was able to complete his journey home safely.",
      "But when Fello stepped out of the truck, he couldn't get his balance.",
      "\"I finally realized it wasn't the truck that was veering. It was me that was veering,\" Fello said. He went indoors and talked to his wife and daughter, who said he looked unwell. About five minutes later, they called 911. Paramedics took him to an area hospital, where he lost all movement in his left arm and leg.",
      "\"They were literally just like appendages on me. I could not feel them and could not do anything,\" Fello said.",
      "A clot-busting drug reversed the stroke, but the numbness on the left side of his body, including his face, remained. He struggled to swallow, eat or drink. Physical and occupational therapy produced only minor improvements.",
      "Dr. Sharon Covey, Fello's occupational therapist and the founder of the Center for Stroke and Hand Recovery, Inc., told CBS News that his arm was essentially stuck in a bent position with his fingers curled when he met her in January 2024. The position and tension in the limb caused Fello constant pain. Working in his restaurant was out of the question.",
      "\"It was very scary. You take for granted so many of the things you do, and even the common, simplest things become like a chore,\" Fello said. \"We mark all these small victories ... Being able to lift up your arm or pick up a cup is a gigantic accomplishment. Those little accomplishments are gigantic to a stroke victim. They encouraged me to keep going on. But there was always a thought in the back of my mind: 'Is this as good as it's going to get?'\"",
      "A \"first-of-its-kind technology\"",
      "One day, another recovering stroke patient suggested Fello look into an implant called the Vivistim System. The FDA-approved implant, developed by the medical device company MicroTransponder Inc., uses vagus nerve stimulation during rehabilitation to improve hand and arm function for stroke victims. The vagus nerves are the body's longest cranial nerve, with one on each side of the body, according to the Cleveland Clinic. They regulate the body's involuntary functions.",
      "The Vivistim Therapy system involves a physical or occupational therapist sending wireless signals to the device. That signal delivers a brief, gentle pulse to the vagus nerve while the stroke patient performs rehabilitative tasks. The stroke patient also does at-home exercises.",
      "Dr. Erez Nossek, a neurosurgeon and director of the cranial bypass program at NYU Langone, told CBS News that the vagus nerve stimulation can enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, known as neuroplasticity. That increased neuroplasticity can result in \"greater and faster improvements in motor function for stroke survivors,\" Nossek said in emailed remarks.",
      "\"There is no other FDA-approved technology proven to boost neuroplasticity for stroke survivors, creating new connections in the brain, which is theirs to keep, even after the device is no longer in use,\" Nossek said. \"This is (a) first-of-its-kind technology that is redefining what is possible for this patient population.\"",
      "A 108-person trial\u00a0published in The Lancet in 2021\u00a0found that the device generated two to three times greater improvement in hand and arm function for stroke survivors when compared with just rehab. Stroke patients who have limited hand and arm function six months or more after their stroke and are considered to have \"moderate to severe deficits\" qualify for the device, the company\u00a0said in a fact sheet.",
      "Implant aids in recovery",
      "Fello turned to the Cleveland Clinic, where he met cerebrovascular neurosurgeon Dr. Mark Bain. He studies stroke recovery, especially in the cases of patients like Fello, whose rehab progress has plateaued months after the stroke. Bain determined that Fello was a candidate for the Vivistim System. Fello became the first Cleveland Clinic patient to receive the implant on April 29, 2025.",
      "\"It didn't really scare me to try and do it. I was anxious to see how it worked,\" Fello said.",
      "The device was placed during an hour-long procedure. The vagus nerve sits just below the carotid artery, so Bain and his surgical team made a small incision to place the leads of the implant and hid the scar in a fold of Fello's neck. The key-fob sized implant was placed under Fello's clavicle. Bain said the procedure itself is low-risk, with \"less than 1% chance of any complications.\" Two weeks after the surgery, the device was turned on and Fello returned to his rehabilitative work with Covey.",
      "Covey said Fello has made huge progress since the device was implanted four months ago. She said he has no pain or tension in the limb, and is beginning to practice using his left arm to carry items. The task is difficult, she said, but isn't \"something he could have done before.\" Fello, now 72, said he's been thrilled by the progress he's made in a short time.",
      "\"I'm very, very happy to do it, very proud to do it, and I'm glad I did it,\" he said.",
      "\"The sky's the limit\"",
      "About 800,000 people in the United States experience an ischemic stroke each year, Bain said. Vivistim and other new technologies may offer hope to the patients like Fello who struggle to recover with just rehabilitation, Bain said.",
      "\"I think over the next probably five to 10 years, what you're going to see is an explosion of procedures, devices and things in rehab that will help people, once they've had strokes, to get their lives back,\" Bain said. \"In the future, I think the sky's the limit for what we can expect for stroke recovery.\"",
      "At the time of his conversation with CBS News, Bain had given seven other stroke patients a Vivistim implant. Covey said at her practice, there are eight patients with the implant receiving the paired therapy course. MicroTransponder Inc. declined to say how many patients have received the implant, but shared a map that shows dozens of surgeons and rehabilitation therapists that provide the therapy.",
      "\"I think this is the newest, most effective strategy for people getting their affected limbs back,\" Covey said. \"This is the first real technique that has been available, at least in the last 20 years, for stroke rehab. The theories that we use as practitioners to increase somebody's use of their affected arm are 50 to 75 years old. So this is a new technology that's really going to turn the stroke recovery world upside down.\"",

    "story": [
      "Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia asked a judge on Thursday to bar top Trump administration officials \u2014 including Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Attorney General Pam Bondi \u2014 from making \"baseless public attacks\" against their client, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year.",
      "The motion was filed in Nashville federal court less than a week after Abrego Garcia was released from pre-trial custody \u2014 only to be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and processed for possible deportation just days later. Abrego Garcia is now in the custody of ICE, though a Maryland judge has blocked him from being deported while she reviews the case.",
      "Since Friday, his lawyers say federal officials have \"attacked Mr. Abrego in the media in numerous highly prejudicial, inflammatory, and false statements,\" which they argue violates his right to a fair trial.",
      "They pointed to a statement by Noem on Friday that called Abrego Garcia an \"MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator,\" and comments by Bondi on Monday likening Abrego Garcia to \"foreign terrorist organizations.\"",
      "His lawyers also said the Department of Homeland Security \"has posted a litany of inflammatory statements on its official X account,\" including allegations that Abrego Garcia belonged to the gang MS-13 \u2014 which he has vehemently denied.",
      "\"The government's ongoing barrage of prejudicial statements severely threaten\u2014and perhaps have already irrevocably impaired\u2014the ability to try this case at all\u2014in any venue,\" the motion said. \"If the government is allowed to continue in this way, it will taint any conceivable jury pool by exposing the entire country to irrelevant, prejudicial, and false claims about Mr. Abrego.\"",
      "They also argued the government could make it harder for Abrego Garcia to call defense witnesses, since any potential witnesses could worry that they'll be attacked, too.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers want a judge to order \"all DOJ and DHS officials involved in this case,\" including Bondi and Noem, to stop making comments that could prejudice the case.",
      "Last month, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw ordered all lawyers in the case to abide by local criminal court rules, after Abrego Garcia's attorneys argued the government had violated a rule against making public statements that could prejudice the case.",
      "A DHS official said in response to the filing: \"If Kilmar Abrego Garcia did not want to be mentioned by the Secretary of Homeland Security, then he should have not entered our country illegally and committed heinous crimes.\"",
      "\"The media's sympathetic narrative about this criminal illegal alien has completely fallen apart, yet they continue to peddle his sob story. We hear far too much about gang members and criminals' false sob stories and not enough about their victims,\" the official said.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.",
      "The request came as Abrego Garcia both awaits a criminal prosecution for allegedly transporting undocumented immigrants from near the U.S.-Mexico border to elsewhere in the country \u2014 which he has denied \u2014 and faces possible deportation to East Africa.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native who entered the U.S. illegally in 2011, was arrested by ICE in March, deported to El Salvador and held in prison for months \u2014 even though an immigration judge had barred him from being sent to El Salvador due to a fear of gang persecution.",
      "Federal officials acknowledged Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error,\" but the Trump administration publicly railed against him, accusing him of gang membership and asserting that he should not return to the United States. He was eventually flown to Tennessee in June and jailed on human smuggling charges.",
      "A judge in Tennessee ruled in June that he should be let out of detention while awaiting a trial set for January. Administration officials suggested that if he left pre-trial detention, he could face deportation again, possibly to a country other than El Salvador.",
      "He was ultimately let out of jail on Friday, and on Monday, ICE detained him. His lawyers were informed that he could be deported to Uganda.",
      "Maryland-based U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis has ruled that Abrego Garcia cannot be deported until at least early October, as she considers a habeas corpus petition. His lawyers say he also plans to seek asylum in the United States.",

    "story": [
      "Four senior officials with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced their resignations in recent days, citing what they described as growing political interference in the agency's scientific work, particularly regarding vaccines.",
      "Two of those \u2014 Dr. Debra Houry, the CDC's Chief Science and Medical Officer, and Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who led the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases \u2014 stepped down on Wednesday, hours after the White House announced the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez.",
      "Monarez, confirmed by the Senate in late July, was removed less than a month into her tenure. White House spokesman Kush Desai said Monarez \"was not aligned with the President's agenda of Making America Healthy Again.\" Monarez's attorneys argue the dismissal is unlawful, asserting that only the president can remove a Senate-confirmed director.",
      "On Thursday, deputy secretary of Health and Human Services Jim O'Neill was chosen to serve as acting CDC director, several White House officials confirmed to CBS News. And in an internal email sent to CDC staff Thursday evening, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. confirmed O'Neill as the acting CDC director, but did not address Monarez's departure.",
      "\"I am committed to working with you to restore trust, transparency, and credibility to the CDC,\" Kennedy told CDC employees, later writing that \"President Trump and I are aligned on the commonsense vision for the CDC: Strengthen the public health infrastructure by returning to its core mission of protecting Americans from communicable diseases by investing in innovation to prevent, detect and respond to future threats.\"",
      "Houry and Daskalakis said they had become increasingly uneasy about how vaccine policy was being handled. Both pointed to preparations for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting, which recommends vaccine schedules.",
      "Houry said they feared \"some decisions had been made before there was even the data or the science to support those. We are scientists, and that was concerning to us.\"",
      "Daskalakis added that he was \"very concerned that there's going to be an attempt to re-litigate vaccines that have already had clear recommendations with science that has been vetted,\" which he warned could undermine public trust. \"If you can't attack access, then why not attack trust? And that's what I think the playbook is,\" he said.",
      "Both officials cited instances in which evidence reviews were altered or withdrawn. A CDC analysis of thimerosal, a vaccine preservative, was briefly posted before being taken down at HHS's direction. \"If there's something that doesn't line up with the recommendations, then that information will be taken down, and it's not there for the public to see for openness and transparency,\" Houry said.",
      "The two also criticized what they described as a lack of direct communication between CDC scientists and HHS leadership. Daskalakis said his team was never invited to brief Kennedy on topics ranging from measles to COVID.",
      "When asked about Kennedy's calls for \"radical transparency,\" Houry and Daskalakis described learning about changes to the COVID vaccine schedule for children not through internal channels but via social media.",
      "\"The radical transparency manifested itself by a Twitter post, which is how Dr. Houry and I learned that the secretary had mandated the change in the children's vaccine schedule for COVID,\" Daskalakis recalled. \"What is the background that led to that decision? And we were denied access to that information. So, I don't think that that's radically transparent,\" Daskalakis said.",
      "CBS News reached out to HHS for comment on some of the allegations made by Houry and Daskalakis, but did not immediately hear back.",
      "Both officials said they had no jobs lined up when they resigned. Houry described the decision as an effort to raise the alarm about the direction of the agency.",
      "\"For us, this was really sending out a bat signal,\" Houry said. \"We were the very senior scientists and career leaders at CDC. We thought this was the time to stand together and try to do what we could to raise the alarm around public health in our country.\"",
      "Daskalakis said remaining at CDC under current conditions would have made them complicit in what he called the \"weaponization\" of public health.",
      "\"The safety has already been compromised\u2026We are flying blind in the U.S. already. If we continued\u2026we would be complicit and would be facilitating the ability to go from flying blind to actively harming people,\" he said.",
      "Houry emphasized the severity of the moment by noting that she left without a backup plan.",
      "\"My leaving without a job was really just showing how dire the circumstances had become,\" Houry said.",
      "Daskalakis said his decision was also shaped by his medical oath.",
      "\"As a physician, I take the Hippocratic oath: first, do no harm. I am seeing ideology permeating science in a way that is going to harm children and adults\u2026I think we are seeing things that are happening that are making our country less prepared to be able to respond to the everyday pathogens \u2026but also \u2026 to the next big thing.\"",
      "Both also expressed concerns for their personal safety in the current climate.",
      "\"The environment we live in\u2026 stoked by misinformation, especially from people considered by some to be health authorities, makes me worried for all of us in public health,\" Daskalakis said. \"I am concerned, but that's part of our job\u2026to be brave and continue to speak the truth even when we are outside of the CDC.\"",
      "The resignations came weeks after a shooting outside the CDC's Atlanta headquarters, which law enforcement linked to COVID misinformation.",
      "Houry said the White House response to the shooting was muted. Kennedy toured the site but later gave an interview expressing distrust of experts. \"That was after the attack. It was based on COVID misinformation. So this is when we were trying to build trust,\" she said.",
      "Daskalakis added that while Kennedy later described mass shootings as a public health crisis, he believed the secretary should address misinformation as a root cause. \"The misinformation about the COVID vaccine that has been documented by the Georgia bureau of investigation as the reason for the shooter at CDC. I would really recommend that the secretary actually do take his own advice and actually address the core problem that led to that shooting as well,\" he said. He also noted that CDC's own gun violence prevention programs had been sharply reduced. \"We talk about violence as a public health problem. It is, and there's things we can do to prevent it. Unfortunately, the majority of that program, the staff are terminated.\"",
      "The firings and resignations have sparked calls for oversight. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont called for a bipartisan investigation, Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington urged Kennedy's removal, and Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana \u2014 who voted to confirm Kennedy's appointment as HHC secretary \u2014 said the developments would \"require oversight.\"",

      "Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said in a Thursday news conference that the department received calls of shots fired at 8:27 a.m. Wednesday. A police officer arrived at the scene at 8:31 a.m. and was directed to the shooter's location by a parishioner, O'Hara said.",
      "O'Hara said the shooter fired a rifle through church windows and was also armed with a shotgun and a pistol. The shooting occurred at the beginning of the Mass, O'Hara said. Three shotgun shells and 116 rifle rounds have been recovered, as well as one live round from the shooter's handgun that malfunctioned and became stuck in the weapon's chamber, O'Hara said Thursday.",

The number of injured rose from 17 to 18 on Thursday when officials said another injured child, who was transported to an area hospital by a private vehicle, had been identified. The three injured adults were all parishioners in their 80s, O'Hara said on Wednesday afternoon.",
      "Police immediately entered the church and attempted to provide first aid, O'Hara said. The injured were rushed to area hospitals.",
      "Hennepin County Medical Center received 10 patients and said one adult and five children were in critical condition.

      "Three law enforcement sources told CBS News the shooter was Robin Westman, 23, from suburban Minneapolis. The shooter acted alone, O'Hara said. Westman died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the back of the church.",
      "The shooter recently bought the three guns legally and does not have any known criminal history, according to O'Hara. O'Hara told CBS News on Thursday that no law in Minnesota would have prevented Westman from buying the weapons.",
      "The shooter visited the church weeks before the shooting and apparently conducted surveillance there, according to a Minnesota official and a federal law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation.",
      "O'Hara said police executed search warrants at three residences connected to the shooter. \"Additional firearms\" were recovered during the searches, he said on Wednesday.

      "Officials search for a motive",
      "O'Hara said he could not comment on any motive. He told CBS News that Westman was \"deranged\" and had an obsession with past shootings. Police have not identified a \"triggering event\" for the shooting, O'Hara said. He warned in Thursday's news briefing that the investigation might not provide the answers the public is seeking.",

    "story": [
      "A judge ordered a new trial Thursday for three former Memphis police officers who were convicted of federal charges in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols, after defense lawyers argued that another judge who presided over their trial was biased in his belief that at least one of the men was in a gang.",
      "U.S. District Judge Sheryl H. Lipman issued the order for a new trial for Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith, who were found guilty in October 2024 of obstruction of justice through witness tampering.",
      "The ruling marks the latest setback for prosecutors in a case that shocked the country when videos were released showing officers violently kicking and punching Nichols during a traffic stop. The officers who have been granted a new trial in the federal case were acquitted of state murder charges in May. And last year, federal prosecutors were unable to secure convictions on the most severe counts against Bean and Smith.",
      "Two other officers charged, Emmitt Martin and Desmond Mills Jr., pleaded guilty before the federal trial.",
      "Lipman took over the case in June after U.S. District Judge Mark S. Norris, who presided over the case and the trial, recused himself days before the sentencings of the five officers.",
      "In a statement shared by his judicial office Thursday, Norris said, \"Because of the code of judicial conduct, I cannot make a statement on this matter.\"",
      "In her order, Lipman cited a notice filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office saying Norris expressed a theory that at least one of the officers was in a gang.",
      "The notice discussed an incident in which Norris' law clerk was shot during a car theft days after the trial ended. The clerk was staying at the home of another law clerk who had previously worked for Norris on the Nichols case, it said.",
      "The notice also said police investigators believed some juveniles committed the shooting; that Norris wanted those responsible held accountable; and that he \"evidenced reasonable frustration with the police investigation.\"",
      "Norris met with the U.S. Attorney's Office and an FBI agent, who explained why no federal charges would be brought in the clerk's shooting.",
      "Norris indicated that he believed at least one of the former officers was in a gang and that it was responsible for the shooting, the notice said. It also said the U.S. Attorney stated that Norris told those present that the clerk \"had been seen by one or more of the Defendants during the trial.\"",
      "An assistant U.S. attorney who attended the May 30 meeting also said she remembered that Norris told her he could not meet with police to give a statement because the department was \"infiltrated to the top with gang members,\" the notice said.",
      "Bean, Haley, and Smith filed motions seeking a new trial, arguing that Norris was biased and violated their rights to due process by presiding over the case.",
      "Smith's lawyer said there was no \"suggestion or one hint in the federal discovery process or the federal trial that any defendant or any member of the Memphis Police Department was in any way affiliated with an illegal street gang either through membership or relationship.\"",
      "Haley's lawyer wrote that \"Judge Norris made the gang statements on at least two occasions, demonstrating that it is a firmly held belief, not an off-hand remark.\"",
      "Lipman also unsealed several filings made before and after Norris recused himself. In one of them, federal prosecutors argued that there was no evidence that he \"harbored any bias before or during trial, let alone the type of extreme bias that would warrant the extraordinary remedy of a new trial.\"",
      "Lipman found that while a review showed Norris' decisions throughout the trial were \"sound, fair, and grounded firmly in the law,\" a new trial is necessary \"because the risk of bias here is too high to be constitutionally tolerable.\"",
      "A date for the retrial has not been set. Lipman ordered lawyers to submit positions on what charges they believe need to be tried.",
      "Smith's attorney, Martin Zummach, said Lipman \"did the right thing.\" Bean's lawyer declined to comment, and Haley's attorney did not immediately respond to a request. Memphis police also declined to comment.",
      "Bean, Haley and Smith were found guilty of trying to cover up the beating by failing to say that they or their colleagues punched and kicked Nichols and broke police department rules when they did not include complete and accurate statements about what type of force they used.",
      "Bean and Smith were acquitted of more serious civil rights charges, however.",
      "Haley was found guilty of violating Nichols' civil rights by causing bodily injury and showing deliberate indifference to medical needs and also conspiracy to tamper with witnesses.",
      "Bean, Haley and Smith were acquitted in May of all state charges, including second-degree murder. Haley is in federal custody, but Bean and Smith are on limited release.",
      "Martin and Mills pleaded guilty in federal court last year to violating Nichols' civil rights by causing death and conspiracy to witness tamper. They did not stand trial in federal court with their former colleagues.",
      "Martin and Mills also avoided a state court trial after reaching agreements to plead guilty.",
      "The officers were part of a crime suppression team called the Scorpion Unit that was disbanded weeks after Nichols died.",
      "On Jan. 7, 2023, officers yanked Nichols from his car and then pepper-sprayed and hit the 29-year-old Black man with a Taser. Nichols fled, and when the five officers, who also are Black, caught up with him, they punched, kicked and hit him with a police baton. Nichols called out for his mother during the beating, which took place steps from his home.",
      "He died three days later.",
      "Video of the beating captured by a police pole camera also showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled with his injuries.",

    "summary": "FEMA still owes Biloxi, Mississippi, $34 million to finish work planned about 20 years ago, the city's mayor says.",
    "story": [
      "Biloxi, Mississippi \u2014 Twenty years ago Friday, Katrina made its second and most destructive U.S. landfall, coming ashore just southeast of New Orleans as a Category 3 hurricane.",
      "While the damage and destruction left by Katrina\u00a0in 2005 changed New Orleans forever, the storm surge and powerful winds also left a lasting blow to other parts of the Gulf Coast, including Alabama and Mississippi.",
      "Two decades later, Biloxi, Mississippi, is still trying to rebuild. Mayor Andrew \"FoFo\" Gilich says it has been a constant battle with the Federal Emergency Management Agency over funding.",
      "To rebuild the city's pier stronger than before, the city says it needs $4 million. Gilich says FEMA has proposed a different number: $555,000.",
      "\"$555,000, which in my mind is absolutely ridiculous, you can't build anything with that,\" Gilich told CBS News.",
      "The biggest unfinished project, though, has been upgrades to the city's sewage and stormwater system in order to better protect Biloxi from the next monster storm.",
      "\"We can't bid these last two projects unless we have assurance of funding,\" Gilich said.",
      "Gilich said FEMA still owes Biloxi $34 million to finish work planned about 20 years ago. FEMA won't pay it until Biloxi begins the work on the final phase, but Gilich says he doesn't want to start something he knows he won't be able to afford to finish. The mayor said as time has passed, the cost of supplies and labor has outpaced the original estimates.",
      "Gilich says\u00a0the city now needs $111 million to finish the project, but FEMA has denied his request for more money \u2014 twice.",
      "\"I'm not bashful, and they [FEMA] understand, you know, where our concern is,\" said Gilich, who described the way he feels his city has been treated by FEMA as \"just ridiculous.\"",
      "Biloxi submitted a second appeal to FEMA this summer.",
      "Over the years, FEMA has tried to claw back some of the money provided for earlier phases of the sewage system upgrades, claiming that the city has not used the federal money it has received appropriately. Biloxi and FEMA reached a court settlement over those concerns a few years ago.",
      "Gilich says FEMA's allegations are \"not right.\"",
      "\"Bottom line, I'm here to say we've done everything we could possibly do,\" Gilich added.",
      "In documentation Biloxi provided to CBS News, FEMA's denial this summer of Biloxi's request was due to the fact that the city, \"has not provided documentation substantiating the reasonableness of the costs claimed or demonstrating any errors or omission in the approved...cost estimate requiring adjustment of the costs agreed upon.\"",
      "Biloxi is not alone in its struggles with FEMA. CBS News found 254 other FEMA Katrina relief projects through the agency that were designed to help municipalities across Louisiana and Mississippi that still aren't done.",
      "Gilich said the experience is \"almost like dealing with insurance agents. The delay, depose and deny.\"",
      "Complicating matters is the Trump administration's efforts to potentially overhaul FEMA, and\u00a0controversy over cuts to some disaster mitigation grants, among other funding changes. CBS News reported in May that FEMA has lost\u00a0about one-third of its staff\u00a0through a combination of firings and buyouts.",
      "And earlier this week, a group of 181 current and former FEMA officials\u00a0signed on to an open letter that said the White House's changes to the agency could undo decades of reforms that were enacted post-Katrina. More than 20 employees who publicly signed their names to the letter have since been suspended.",
      "In May, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem testified before Congress about her plans to improve the agency's processes.",
      "\"We still have claims outstanding in FEMA from Hurricane Katrina,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose department oversees FEMA, testified before the House in May. \"Wildfire claims from out West that are 10 years old, where people said, 'We have this claim, this loss. FEMA committed to pay it and still has not followed through on it.' We saw political targeting that happened in North Carolina, where individuals within FEMA decided who could get help and who didn't get help. So that needs to end. And this needs some integrity to it and making sure the federal government is there for support, but [that] the states are empowered to do the emergency response is very important to President Trump.\"",
      "Gilich has traveled to D.C. three times already this year to advocate for his city. He said he's feeling cautiously optimistic that the funding will eventually come through and the rebuilding process will be complete within about three years.",
      "\"The end result is righteous,\" Gilich said. \"It's going to be something that we can sustain a lot of the things, you know, as far as what Mother Nature throws at us.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Thursday in response to a question about those communities who say they are still waiting on post-Katrina funding, a FEMA spokesperson said, in part, that \"it's ridiculous, unacceptable, and absurd that FEMA is still working and processing claims from a disaster that happened 20 years ago. This is an example of unnecessary red tape and a broken government agency that does not work in the best interest of the American people. We're moving away from the bloated, DC-centric model of the past and creating a lean, fast, and effective disaster response agency focusing on empowering states and local communities to lead the way in helping their citizens, with FEMA standing ready to support.\"",
      "The spokesperson noted that the FEMA Review Council, established by President Trump in January, \"is conducting a thorough review to ensure FEMA delivers swift, effective disaster response for Americans.\"",
      "That council is expected to release a final report with \"actionable recommendations,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The FEMA spokesperson also added that, \"To date, FEMA has provided impacted states with significant federal assistance, including over $6.6 billion in Individual Assistance \u2013 which includes money for rent, basic home repairs and other disaster-caused needs \u2013 and over $17.1 billion in Public Assistance reimbursements has been approved for recovery projects like rebuilding roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure.\"",

      "\"Two employees were terminated today following serious breaches of company policies and our code of conduct,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News on Wednesday. \"The first violated the Business Conduct Policy, participated in the unlawful break-in at the executive offices, and other demonstrations on campus, and was arrested by authorities on our premises on two occasions. The second was involved in the break-in at the executive offices and was subsequently arrested.\"",

Change is possible, and it is necessary\u2014so that Harper's story does not become yet another in a long line of tragedies.",

      "The tax credit saves EV leaseholders an average of $208 a month spread across a 36-month lease, Edmund found in analyzing dealership transactions. Leasing has become the most common way consumers enter the EV market, according to the auto industry data provider, which found that leases made up 70% of all EV transactions in July.",

      "\"If you've never tried this tech and want to dip your toe in the water instead of getting married to it,\" he said, noting that EVs tend to depreciate faster than gas-powered cars. \"That's because we know the tech will get better, and what you buy today won't be as good as what you get next year.\"",
      "The IRS is also giving consumers more wiggle room to claim the EV tax credit before it ends. Previously, eligibility was tied to a vehicle's delivery date. But the agency this month issued a notice clarifying that consumers are eligible for the credit if they sign a contract for a vehicle prior to Sept. 30 and make a payment, which can include putting money down or trading in a car \u2014 even if the vehicle isn't delivered until after that date.",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Aug 2025 17:32:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal judge in New York kept alive a lawsuit accusing officials in Saudi Arabia of assisting the Sept. 11 hijackers \u2014 which the Saudi government has vehemently denied.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in New York denied a motion by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to dismiss a lawsuit brought by families of 9/11 victims who are seeking to hold the Middle Eastern country responsible for potentially providing support to the hijackers, allowing the suit to proceed.",
      "The ruling is the latest in a long-running lawsuit seeking to hold the Saudi government liable for al Qaeda's attacks, a case that has been described by lawyers for the plaintiffs as a \"labyrinth.\"",
      "Saudi Arabia had the suit temporarily dismissed in 2015, before the dismissal was overturned by a federal appeals court. While the appeal was pending in 2016, Congress enacted a law known as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, which allowed victims of terror attacks to sue foreign governments and individuals if they provided material support to the attackers. It also gave U.S. courts jurisdiction over potential lawsuits filed over injuries and deaths in attacks on U.S. soil.",
      "Allegations that members of the Saudi government had links to some of the Sept. 11 hijackers have circulated for years. The claims have drawn vehement denials from Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally in the Middle East. Most theories have centered on two of the 19 hijackers: Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, who were on the plane that crashed into the Pentagon.",
      "More than a year before the hijackings, al-Midhar and al-Hazmi settled in Los Angeles, where a Saudi man named Omar al-Bayoumi helped them find an apartment. A 2004 report by the 9/11 Commission said that Bayoumi met the two hijackers by chance at a restaurant.",
      "But the families of some victims and their attorneys have alleged that Bayoumi had deeper connections to Saudi Arabia, citing federal reports declassified in recent years that allege he had \"extensive ties\" with the Gulf monarchy's government and was accused of serving as a Saudi intelligence officer. The FBI has also investigated whether the two hijackers got assistance from Fahad al-Thumairy, an accredited Saudi diplomat and imam at a Los Angeles mosque. The 9/11 Commission found no evidence that Thumairy helped the hijackers.",
      "Last year, a \"60 Minutes\" report revealed new evidence about Bayoumi, including a video of him filming the entrances of the U.S. Capitol and pointing out its location relative to the Washington Monument, at some points referencing a \"plan.\" Investigators have long believed the Capitol may have been the intended target of Flight 93, which crashed into a field in Pennsylvania after passengers overtook the hijackers.",
      "Decades ago, investigators also found a notebook in Bayoumi's home that seemed to show a drawing of a plane and a mathematical equation that could be used to calculate the rate of descent to a target.",
      "Many of those allegations were raised by attorneys for the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks. Lawyers for the Saudi government have repeatedly pushed for all claims against the country to be dismissed, including in October 2023. A Manhattan judge rejected that request Thursday.",
      "\"Plaintiffs have managed to provide this Court with reasonable evidence as to the roles played by Bayoumi, Thumairy, and KSA, in assisting the hijackers. KSA did not proffer sufficient evidence to the contrary,\" U.S. District Judge in the Southern District of New York George Daniels wrote in an order Thursday. \"Although KSA attempts to offer seemingly innocent explanations or context, they are either self-contradictory or not strong enough to overcome the inference that KSA had employed Bayoumi and Thumairy to assist the hijackers.\"",
      "Daniels wrote that while the families and attorneys representing Saudi Arabia disagree on Bayoumi's motive, it is \"undisputed\" that Bayoumi assisted in finding the hijackers' apartments, and signed a lease with them as a guarantor. Daniels said it is also \"undisputed\" that a notepad page \"with an airplane drawing, notes, and numbers\" was found in Bayoumi's home.",
      "Attorneys representing Saudi Arabia, Daniels wrote, argued that \"Bayoumi's encounters with the hijackers were coincidences,\" and he was \"simply being good-natured\" when he provided assistance to the hijackers. The lawyers, Daniels said, claimed the airplane drawing \"was unrelated to the 9/11 Attacks\" and \"likely related to Bayoumi's son's high school [assignments].\"",
      "\"These are all either conclusory attorney speculations not grounded in facts, or self-serving denials or excuses from Bayoumi himself that do not withstand scrutiny,\" Daniels wrote.",
      "\"We welcome the court's thorough and well-reasoned decision and look forward to moving the case forward to trial,\" Sean P. Carter, an attorney representing the families, said in a statement.",
      "Kreindler & Kreindler LLP, another law firm representing Sept. 11 victims' families, said the ruling \"ensures that the plaintiffs may continue their long pursuit of truth and justice,\" and \"paves the way for these critical issues to be fully examined at trial.\"",

      "An April\u00a0study\u00a0by career services firm Glassdoor found that employee mentions of burnout have surged 32% since early last year and are now at their highest level since 2016. Such evidence of persistent stress on the job is perhaps no surprise given that the U.S. ranks No. 59 in an analysis of work-life balance in different countries, according to Remote.com. The payroll platform considered factors such as statutory annual leave, access to health care, public safety and average hours worked per week.",
      "So are there simple ways for employees to reduce stress? Maisha Wynn, a CBS News\u00a0lifestyle contributor and author of \"The Wynning Way,\" told CBS News that workers should focus on channeling their energy.",
      "The first few hours of the work day are your \"high energy time,\" and thus good for more demanding tasks like Zoom calls, planning projects and participating in meetings. Later in the day, when people's energy often starts to wane, it can be more fruitful to turn to rote tasks and simpler activities, like returning emails.",
      "Building \"micro routines\" can also ease the pressure and help get through the day, Wynn said. \"That's where you're really focusing on things that bring you joy where you might not be able to get away from your desk.\"",
      "Wynn listed doodling and listening to music as two examples of simple ways to catch your breath.",
      "And while it can be difficult when your boss is breathing down your neck, setting boundaries is key to avoiding burnout, she said. That means learning how to occasionally say \"no,\" even when it might be uncomfortable.",

    "story": [
      "Ford is recalling 500,000 vehicles over an issue that can cause two different car models to leak brake fluid, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).",
      "A hose in the cars' rear brake system can rupture and cause a leakage, recall documents state. The vehicles covered by the recall are 2016-2018 Lincoln MKX midsize luxury SUVs and 2015-2018 Edge SUVs.",
      "\"If a flexible brake hose develops a leak, the driver may experience an increase in brake pedal travel together with an increase in stopping distance,\" Ford said in a letter to car dealers. \"If the brake fluid level in the master cylinder reservoir becomes low, the red brake fluid warning indicator light will illuminate. An increase in stopping distance increases the risk of a crash.\"",
      "Ford said it will notify affected vehicle owners of the safety risk in early September. The remedy for the issue is still under development and is expected to be available in April.",
      "The recall comes after Ford this month also\u00a0recalled more than 355,000 pickup trucks over an instrument panel display failure.",
      "\"An instrument panel display that does not show critical information, such as warning lights or vehicle speed, increases the risk of a crash,\" NHTSA said in an Aug. 22 report.",
      "The notices add to a string of vehicle recalls Ford has issued this year, which Ford Chief Operating Officer Kumar Galhotra addressed in a July 16\u00a0blog post.",
      "\"The increase in recalls reflects our intensive strategy to quickly find and fix hardware and software issues and go the extra mile to help protect customers,\" he wrote. \"Ford has more than doubled its team of safety and technical experts in the past two years and significantly increased testing to failure on critical systems in current Ford vehicles such as powertrains, steering and braking.

      "The state's request for emergency relief from the high court stems from a federal appeals court ruling that blocked South Carolina officials from enforcing its restroom policy against a transgender high school student, identified in court papers as John Doe.",
      "South Carolina's General Assembly included the restriction in a spending bill for fiscal year 2024 to 2025. The provision, which initially expired at the end of June, conditions 25% of state funds appropriated to school districts on their compliance with a requirement that public school restrooms designated for one sex are used only by members of that sex.",
      "State lawmakers included the restriction in their latest spending measure for the new fiscal year, and it took effect July 1.",
      "Doe, a transgender student enrolled at a public school in Berkeley County, South Carolina, and his guardians filed a lawsuit last November alleging that the so-called restroom-related provision of the legislation violates the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause and Title IX.",
      "Under the provision's definitions, Doe, who identifies as male, was classified as a \"female\" and therefore could not use the boys' restrooms at school, according to court filings.",
      "On the heels of the Supreme Court's June decision upholding a Tennessee law restricting access to gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, a South Carolina district court paused the challenge to the state's bathroom policy and denied a request from Doe to block the measure while litigation continues.",
      "Then, earlier this month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit granted an injunction when it came to Doe. The court blocked South Carolina and its Department of Education from enforcing its policy prohibiting transgender students from using restrooms that correspond with their gender identities, but only against Doe.",
      "In its ruling, the 4th Circuit cited its 2020 decision in a case brought by Gavin Grimm, a transgender student who challenged his school's restroom policy. The appeals court found that a rule by a Virginia school board requiring transgender students to use restrooms that correspond with their biological sex was unlawful.",
      "Grimm's case had been before the Supreme Court in 2017, but the court sent the dispute back to the lower courts. Then, in 2021, the high court declined to take up the case for a second time, leaving the 4th Circuit ruling in Grimm's favor in place.",
      "In blocking enforcement of South Carolina's policy against Doe, the 4th Circuit said that its decision in Grimm's case \"remains the law of this Circuit and is thus binding on all the district courts within it.\"",
      "South Carolina officials asked the high court to intervene, arguing that its restroom policy does not classify or discriminate on the basis of sex, and does not discriminate against transgender students.",
      "\"This Proviso resoundingly reflects the will of the South Carolina General Assembly, and therefore the will of the people of South Carolina, due to near unanimous approval in both chambers of the legislature,\" state officials wrote in their emergency appeal. \"Ultimately, this policy choice is one in which the Court must defer to the appropriate legislative body.\"",
      "They argued that the request seeks to restore the status quote, thus \"preserving voters' will and protecting the privacy of South Carolina public school students while this case is litigated on appeal.\"",

They responded to the scene and medically evacuated the injured woman to a hospital in the Anchorage area for treatment. State troopers and a crew from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game joined police to search for the bear on foot while a drone scanned the region from above, but they were unable to find the animal.

    "summary": "Workers are seeing far smaller pay increases from switching employers than during the pandemic, Bank of America Institute data shows.",
    "story": [
      "More Americans are staying put in their jobs rather than jumping ship as the\u00a0labor market cools.",
      "So concludes a new analysis from the Bank of America Institute, which drew on the deposit data from millions of its customers to track job changes and the median pay bump people get when they switch employers.",
      "The analysis shows that while the job change rate \u2014 defined in this case as the total percentage of Bank of America customers who have changed employers \u2014 has edged up this year, Americans are much less to likely switch jobs than during the \"Great Resignation.\" That was the period during the pandemic when a massive wave of workers quit their jobs, motivated by better work opportunities and work-life balance. Over 20 million people quit their jobs in the second half of 2021, according to Labor Department data.",
      "The bank's data shows that the percentage of its customers leaving their jobs has largely trended downwards, from 26% since the 2022 peak, and is now just slightly above the the job change rate in 2019. The upshot: As employers have pulled back in hiring, workers are hunkering down in their current jobs.",
      "\"It's possible that, again, tariffs and just general business uncertainty is playing a role in squeezing out some of the availability for people to switch jobs, which is why that rate is declining,\" said Taylor Bowley, an economist at Bank of America Institute and lead author of the report.",
      "The labor market slowed sharply in recent months. Accounting for government data revisions, the average monthly payroll gain from May to July was only 35,000, down from average of 123,000 from January to April. The Labor Department will release the next jobs report on September 5.",
      "\"People are not leaving their jobs right now because they're nervous about the future of the labor market,\" said Allison Shrivastava, an economist at Indeed \"It's a pretty stagnant labor market,\" she added.",
      "Lower pay hikes from switching",
      "As job hopping has waned, so too have the pay hike workers tend to get when changing jobs. The median raise for workers who switched employers was 7% in July, down from 10% in 2019 and 20% in 2022, according to the Bank of America Institute.",
      "ZipRecruiter labor economist Nicole Bachaud, citing data from the company's\u00a0New Hires Survey, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email that less than half of new hires (42%) in the second quarter negotiated their starting salary. Among those who did seek to negotiate, only 48% received higher pay.",
      "Federal Reserve data shows that for the first time since 2010, wage growth for job hoppers equaled that of job stayers in May and into July, another indication that the labor marketing is cooling.",
      "The Bank of America analysis notes the diminishing payoff from switching jobs stems in part from the shifting power dynamic between employees and employers. Workers wielded more leverage during the pandemic, when labor supply disruptions created heightened demand for workers. However, that power is slowly shifting back toward employers as job opportunities dry up.",
      "\"This trend confirms that the labor market is no longer as tight,\" Bowley writes in the report.",
      "Uncertainty surrounding tariffs has also led employers to hold off on making major businesses investments, leading some to pause hiring altogether.",
      "\"This deceleration for both people changing jobs and then the pay rises they get when they do, could have dampening effects on consumer spending growth going forward,\" said Bowley.",

    "summary": "Immigration officials are moving detainees out of a controversial, state-run detention center in the middle of the Florida Everglades dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security has begun moving detainees out of a controversial, state-run immigration detention center in the middle of the Florida Everglades dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz,\" days after a federal judge ruled that parts of the facility must be dismantled.",
      "The detainees are being transferred to other immigration detention centers, DHS said in a statement Wednesday, blaming a court order from an \"activist judge\" that it called \"another attempt to prevent the President from fulfilling the American people's mandate to remove the worst of the worst.\"",
      "\"DHS is complying with this order and moving detainees to other facilities. We will continue to fight tooth-and-nail to remove the worst of the worst from American streets,\" DHS said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "In an email to a South Florida rabbi last week that CBS News obtained, a top Florida emergency official wrote that Alligator Alcatraz would likely be empty \"within a few days.\"\u00a0The Associated Press\u00a0first reported the email on Wednesday.",
      "The Florida Division of Emergency Management said in a statement that \"[t]he mission has not changed, deportations will continue, and Florida will remain at the forefront of the nation's immigration enforcement efforts.\"",
      "\"'Alligator Alcatraz' is a temporary deportation facility; the detainees who are delivered there will all be returned to their home countries,\" the agency said. \"This was ALWAYS the facility's intent: to expedite the deportation process and support the President's immigration initiative.\"",
      "The facility, run by Florida's state government on a largely abandoned airstrip, is part of a wider push by the Trump administration to ramp up the number of immigration detention beds by partnering with Republican-led states willing to aid its escalating mass deportation efforts.",
      "Republican officials in Indiana and Nebraska have also offered to convert state prisons into immigration detention centers, and the Trump administration has been eyeing similar facilities in other states.",
      "The administration has cast \"Alligator Alcatraz\" as a cost-effective way of holding immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and suggested the treacherous terrain around the site could serve as a deterrent. But advocates have described inhumane conditions at the facility, including a lack of access to water, scarce and unsanitary food and limited access to attorneys \u2014 allegations that federal and state officials have denied.",
      "Last week, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered an indefinite stop to all new construction at \"Alligator Alcatraz\" and barred the transfer of new detainees to the facility. She also directed state officials to remove all fencing, light fixtures, generators and certain other equipment at the site within 60 days, siding with environmental activists who said the facility skirted federal environmental laws.",
      "The ruling did not require the facility to be shut down immediately.",
      "Florida's state government quickly appealed Williams' ruling last week. Late Wednesday evening, Williams declined to halt her ruling pending appeal, rejecting a request by the Trump administration and Florida.",
      "In her new order Wednesday, Williams said federal and state officials had failed to present \"new evidence\" showing the detainees at \"Alligator Alcatraz\" are particularly dangerous or that a pause in operations at the facility would thwart immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "\"Alligator Alcatraz\" is also the subject of two other lawsuits. One of them alleges that detainees have been unable to meet with their lawyers confidentially. A federal judge earlier this month dismissed one part of the suit that alleged the government had prevented detainees from filing legal challenges by not making clear which immigration court oversaw the facility, but he left the rest of the suit intact \u2014 though he moved the case from Miami to Orlando.",
      "Another lawsuit filed last week alleges the state of Florida does not have the legal authority to operate an immigration detention center.",

    "summary": "Susan Monarez, the director of the CDC, has been removed from her job, a source told CBS News \u2014 but her attorneys called her firing \"legally deficient.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Susan Monarez, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is being ousted from her role less than a month after the Senate confirmed her to lead the public health agency, the White House confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services\u00a0announced in an X post\u00a0Wednesday that Monarez no longer leads the CDC. Reports on her ouster were immediately followed by a dispute between the administration and her attorneys regarding whether she had been legally fired, with lawyers for Monarez arguing she's still in charge of the CDC and only President Trump can fire her.",
      "It's not clear why Monarez was removed from the job \u2014 but several other top CDC officials resigned Wednesday, often citing disagreements with the Trump administration over its vaccine policy, budgets cuts to the agency, and what one described as the \"weaponization of public health.\"",
      "Prominent D.C.-based attorney Mark Zaid said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0that Monarez \"has neither resigned nor received notification from the White House that she was fired.\" He said that he and lawyer Abbe Lowell are representing Monarez.",
      "Zaid alleged that Monarez was \"targeted\" because she \"refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated public health experts.\"",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai alleged in response that Monarez was terminated because she \"refused to resign despite informing HHS leadership of her intent to do so.\"",
      "\"As her attorney's statement makes abundantly clear, Susan Monarez is not aligned with the President's agenda of Making America Healthy Again,\" Desai said in response to Zaid's initial statement.",
      "Hours later, Zaid and Lowell said Monarez was told of her firing Wednesday night by a \"White House staffer in the personnel office.\" In a statement to CBS News, they called the move \"legally deficient\" and argued that she remains the leader of the CDC because, as a presidential appointee, \"only the president himself can fire her.\"",
      "On Monday, Monarez had to cancel an agency-wide meeting because she had been summoned to Washington, D.C., according to CDC officials.",
      "In its\u00a0X post, HHS thanked Monarez \"for her dedicated service for the American people,\" and said Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \"has full confidence in his team\" at the CDC.",
      "At least three other senior CDC leaders have resigned from the agency, according to resignation emails obtained by CBS News.",
      "Daniel Jernigan, who led the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, told colleagues he was leaving due to \"the current context in the Department.\" The CDC's Chief Medical Officer Debra Houry and the head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Demetre Daskalakis, also announced their departures.",
      "Houry's message to CDC staffers warned about the \"rise of misinformation\" about vaccines. She also argued planned cuts to the agency's budget will hurt the CDC.",
      "\"For the good of the nation and the world, the science at CDC should never be censored or subject to political pauses or interpretations,\" wrote Houry, who worked at the CDC for over a decade. \"Vaccines save lives\u2014this is an indisputable, well-established, scientific fact.\"",
      "Daskalakis said in a note to CDC staff: \"I am not able to serve in this role any longer because of the ongoing weaponizing of public health.\"",
      "Daskalakis also posted on X a resignation letter addressed to Houry, in which he criticized recent changes to vaccine recommendations and warned of an \"intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines.\" He also said Kennedy and his staff's views \"challenge my ability to continue in my current role at the agency.\"",
      "\"Having worked in local and national public health for years, I have never experienced such radical non-transparency, nor have I seen such unskilled manipulation of data to achieve a political end rather than the good of the American people,\" Daskalakis wrote.",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, who serves on the Senate health committee, reacted to Monarez's ouster by calling for Kennedy to be fired, calling him \"a dangerous man who is determined to abuse his authority to act on truly terrifying conspiracy theories and disinformation.\"",
      "\"If there are any adults left in the White House, it's well past time they face reality and fire RFK Jr,\" Murray said in a statement.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, also a member of Senate health committee who voted for Kennedy's nomination, said the departures will \"require oversight.\" Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, another member of the committee, called for a hearing with Kennedy.",
      "CDC departures follow months of upheaval",
      "The sudden departures come at a tumultuous time for the public health agency. Staff are\u00a0still reeling\u00a0from an early August\u00a0shooting\u00a0outside the CDC's Atlanta headquarters by a gunman who police said was upset about COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "Kennedy \u2014 a longtime vaccine skeptic \u2014 also fired every member of an independent CDC panel tasked with making vaccine recommendations. During Kennedy's tenure, HHS has made other moves on vaccines that have troubled public health and infectious disease experts. Kennedy halted contracts for mRNA vaccine research earlier this month, and the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved updated COVID-19 vaccines for seniors and people with health conditions, but not for healthy adults and children.",
      "Meanwhile, the CDC faced hundreds of layoffs this year.",
      "There has been some friction between Monarez and Kennedy over COVID-19 vaccines and the CDC's vaccine advisory panel, CDC officials told CBS News. Monarez has publicly said that vaccines \"save lives.\" The Trump administration was also unhappy with the way she had talked about the Atlanta shooting and stopped her from publishing an op-ed about the incident, the officials said.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0nominated Monarez\u00a0to lead the CDC in late March,\u00a0calling her\u00a0a \"dedicated public servant\" who could repair what he called a loss of public confidence in the CDC \"due to political bias and disastrous mismanagement.\" Monarez was\u00a0confirmed by the Senate\u00a0in a party-line vote in late July, after previously serving as the agency's\u00a0acting head\u00a0starting in January.",
      "She was nominated to lead the agency after Mr. Trump\u00a0pulled his initial pick\u00a0for the job, former Florida Rep. Dave Weldon, a physician who was controversial in part due to his past skepticism of vaccines. In private meetings with Weldon, some Republican senators and their staffers grew concerned that he seemed unfamiliar with the CDC's operations,\u00a0CBS News\u00a0reported at the time.",
      "Monarez\u00a0holds a Ph.D.\u00a0in microbiology and immunology, though unlike\u00a0most\u00a0prior CDC directors, she is not a medical doctor. She previously served as deputy director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, a federal agency that backs advanced medical research. She also worked in the Obama-era White House's science and technology office and the Department of Homeland Security during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "During her Senate confirmation hearing, Monarez faced a number of questions about vaccine recommendations. Kennedy has pushed a discredited theory linking routine childhood shots to autism, but during her hearing, Monarez refuted that view and said she has \"not seen a causal link between vaccines and autism.\"",
      "\"Vaccines absolutely save lives, and if I'm confirmed as CDC director, I commit to making sure we continue to prioritize vaccine availability,\" Monarez told lawmakers.",

      "Kyiv, Ukraine \u2014 A massive Russian drone and missile attack hit Ukraine's capital early Thursday, including a rare strike in the center of the city, killing at least 15 people including four children, a city official said. It was the first major Russian combined attack on Kyiv in weeks, and it comes as U.S.-led peace efforts to end\u00a0the three-year war struggle to gain traction.",
      "\"Already 14 people are known to have been killed as a result of the Russian attack, including 3 children. A horrific and deliberate killing of civilians,\" President Volodymyr\u00a0Zelenskyy said in a social media post. \"The Russians are not choosing to end the war, only new strikes... It is crucial now that the world responds firmly. Russia must stop this war it started and continues. For the spurning of ceasefire and for the constant Russian attempts to weasel out of negotiations, new strong sanctions are needed. Only this can work. The Russians understand only strength and pressure.\"",
      "Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv's city administration, later said 15 people were killed, including four children between the ages of 2 and 17, and at least 48 others wounded in the attack.",
      "Russia launched 598 strike drones and decoys and 31 missiles of different types across the country, according to Ukraine's Air Force, making it one of the largest attacks since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\u00a0 Ukraine's forces shot down and neutralized all but 41 of the weapons, its Air Force said.",
      "Zelenskyy said dozens of buildings, including homes, offices and other civilian enterprises were among those hit by the Russian assault, as well as a building \"where the European Union Delegation to Ukraine is located.\"",
      "\"Horrified by yet another night of deadly Russian missile attacks on Ukraine,\" European Council President Antonio Costa said on social media. \"My thoughts are with the Ukrainian victims and also with the staff of @EUDelegationUA whose building was damaged in this deliberate Russian strike. The EU will not be intimidated.\"",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was also quick to condemn the attack, and he reiterated Zelenskyy's assertion that it showed Russia was not interested in peace.",
      "\"Putin is killing children and civilians, and sabotaging hopes of peace,\" Starmer said in a social media post. \"This bloodshed must end.\"",
      "President Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, in a post on social media, condemned Russia's \"egregious attacks,\" which he said \"threaten the peace that @POTUS is pursuing.\"",
      "Moscow denies targeting civilians but has increased strikes in the last few months on cities and towns a long way from the war's front lines. In a statement posted on social media, Russia's defense ministry claimed Thursday that its forces had launched a strike overnight \"against military-industrial complex enterprises and military airbases in Ukraine.\"",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov reiterated the claim that Russia had successfully hit military and military-related infrastructure in Ukraine, adding: \"At the same time, Russia remains interested in continuing the negotiation process in order to achieve our goals through political and diplomatic means.\"",
      "According to Tkachenko, the attack included drones, decoy drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles, striking at least 20 locations across seven districts of the capital.",
      "Russian strikes hit the central part of Kyiv, one of the few times Russian attacks have reached the heart of the city since the start of the full-scale invasion. Residents cleared shattered glass and debris from damaged buildings. Smoke billowed from the crumbled column of a five-story residential building in the Darnytskyi district that suffered a direct hit. An acrid stench of burning material wafted in the air as firefighters worked to contain the blaze.",
      "Amid the destruction, emergency responders searched for survivors and extracted bodies. Crowds of residents stood nearby, waiting for relatives to be retrieved from the rubble. Bodies in black bags were placed at the side of the building.",
      "Residents in the neighborhood said it wasn't the first time their district was targeted.",
      "Oleksandr Khilko arrived at the scene after a missile hit the residential building where his sister lives. He heard screams from people who were trapped under the rubble and pulled out three survivors, including a boy.",
      "\"It's inhuman, striking civilians,\" he said, his clothes covered in dust and the tips of his fingers black with soot. \"With every cell of my body I want this war to end as soon as possible. I wait, but every time the air raid alarm sounds, I am afraid.\"",
      "Next steps unclear as Trump pushes to end Ukraine war",
      "Thursday's attack was the first major combined Russian drone and missile on Kyiv since President Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska earlier this month to discuss ending the war in Ukraine.",
      "While a diplomatic push for peace appeared to gain momentum shortly after that meeting, few details have emerged about next steps.",
      "Western leaders, along with Zelenskyy, have accused Putin of dragging his feet in peace efforts and avoiding serious negotiations while Russian troops move deeper into Ukraine. This week, Ukrainian military leaders conceded Russian forces had broken into an eighth region of Ukraine seeking to capture more ground.",
      "Zelenskyy hopes for harsher U.S. sanctions to cripple the Russian economy if Putin doesn't demonstrate seriousness about ending the war \u2014 demands that he reiterated following Thursday's attack.",
      "\"All deadlines have already been broken, dozens of opportunities for diplomacy ruined,\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "Mr. Trump bristled this week at Putin's stalling on an American proposal for direct peace talks with Zelenskyy. He said Friday that he expects to decide on next steps in two weeks if direct talks \u2014 which Moscow has thus far ruled out \u2014 aren't scheduled. The previous day, Mr. Trump hinted that he could change U.S. policy on Ukraine's use of American-supplied weapons to strike inside Russia.",
      "In a post on his own social media platform, Mr. Trump said it was, \"very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invaders country. ... There is no chance of winning! It is like that with Ukraine and Russia.\"",
      "He said his predecessor, Joe Biden, \"would not let Ukraine FIGHT BACK, only DEFEND,\" adding, without any further explanation, that there were, \"Interesting times ahead!!!\"",

    "story": [
      "North Yorkshire, England \u2014\u00a0The already-risky work of fire crews battling a wildfire in England's North York Moors National Park has been made all the more dangerous by World War II-era bombs and tank shells hidden under the dense, dry vegetation. A local fire official said Wednesday that there had been nearly 20 explosions as the fire burns through brush to detonate the hidden weapons.",
      "\"As the peat continues to burn down, it is finding the World War II ordnance and therefore exploding, and we have now experienced over 18 ordnance explosions within key areas,\" County Chief Fire Officer Jonathan Dyson said, according to CBS News' partner network BBC News.",
      "The Langdale Moor fire, which started on August 11, has charred about 10 square miles in the picturesque coastal region of North Yorkshire. Emergency fire crews have been tackling the blaze, aided by local farmers and game keepers who've swung into action with water tanks and tractors, dousing brush and helping cut fire breaks through the moorland, which is covered largely by dense shrubs and grass.",
      "Dyson said part of the active fire area was a tank training ground during the 1940s, explaining why so many weapons were still lurking under the first layers of the rugged landscape. There is still a U.K. military site, the RAF Fylingdales radar station, in the immediate area.",
      "Britain's Ministry of Defense in London said an explosive ordnance disposal team had found \"various World War II-era unexploded ordnance items,\" declaring them to be \"inert practice projectiles.\"",
      "Dyson said the North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service had requested help from other agencies in the country, and that crews had adopted a \"very defensive fire-fighting strategy\" to protect members given the presence of unexploded bombs.",
      "The scale of the wildfire has been atypical for northern England \u2014 a region often associated with heavy rainfall even within the U.K. But this year saw an incredibly hot, dry spring and early summer, leaving the moors (a British word for uncultivated hills) tinder dry. The U.K. is on track to see 2025 go down as the hottest year ever recorded.",
      "As well as road closures, some rights of way have also been closed, due to the on-going wildfire.  Please check this...",
      "The North York Moors park covers more than 550 square miles of rolling hills abutting the Yorkshire coast. It is dotted with villages and seaside towns that are popular summer vacation destinations, including the ancient fishing town of Whitby, considered the inspiration for Victorian-era author Bram Stoker's iconic tale of \"Dracula.\"",
      "Along with many smaller towns, Whitby has been hit by road closures due to the fire that have kept some tourists at bay. Several campsites and other businesses in the region have been forced to evacuate and close up.",
      "The moors are also used as grazing land for flocks of sheep, and seeing so much ground burn away \u2014 after weeks with little rain to grow fresh grass had already squeezed many farmers ahead of the winter months \u2014 has been distressing for local farmers.",
      "\"It's people's livelihoods,\" farm worker Darren Coates told the BBC. \"To see the moors and farmland burned to a crisp it is just devastating.\"",
      "Area farms and stables not impacted by the fire have posted messages on social media for weeks, offering to temporarily shelter horses and other animals displaced by the blaze.",
      "Wednesday finally brought some desperately needed rain to the region, helping the fire crews and farmers gain some degree of control over the blaze, but the fire service warned residents on Thursday that many road and trail closures remained in place, and the fire was still active.",
      "\"They are working hard on containing the fire by firefighting, hotspotting and adding fire breaks,\" the service said. \"A helicopter is again in use today. We continue to ask people to avoid the area and not travel there to take photos and drone footage. This is an on-going operational incident and we want to make sure our crews, partners and the public stay safe.\"",

      "U.S. Ambassador to Turkey and Special Envoy to Syria Tom Barrack canceled a planned visit to southern cities in Lebanon Wednesday, Lebanon's National News Agency said, amid a backlash over remarks he made the previous day that have been criticized by Lebanese journalists as dehumanizing.",
      "CBS News has sought confirmation from Barrack's office at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara of the change in his travel plans and any reasoning for it, but the reported move to cancel visits to Sour and Khiam, in southern Lebanon, came amid criticism online and protests against the American diplomat's expected presence.",
      "Barrack, a longtime friend and fundraiser to President Trump who was sworn in earlier this year as U.S. Ambassador to Turkey, has drawn a backlash after urging journalists during a news conference in Beirut to \"act civilized\" rather than \"animalistic.\"",
      "\"This is the problem with what's happening in the region,\" Barrack said as reporters shouted questions.",
      "The interaction came at the start of a news conference at the Baabda Presidential Palace in Beirut after Barrack met with Lebanese President Michel Aoun.

      "The remarks quickly drew widespread criticism from members of the press and others on social media, condemning Barrack's characterization of Lebanese journalists.",
      "In a\u00a0brief statement posted on social media, the office of the Lebanese Presidency said it \"expresses regret for the statements inadvertently made from its platform by one of its guests today.\"",
      "\"While emphasizing its absolute respect for human dignity in general, it wishes to reaffirm its full appreciation for all journalists and accredited media representatives in particular, and extends to them its highest regards for their efforts and dedication in fulfilling their professional and national duties,\" the presidency said, without naming Barrack or offering further details.",
      "The Union of Journalists in Lebanon\u00a0said in a statement that it \"strongly condemns the insulting remarks\" made by the U.S. ambassador, adding that was, \"not a slip of the tongue or an isolated stance, but rather an unacceptable display of superiority in dealing with the press.\"",
      "The union went on to say that Barrack's words, \"reflect a deep-seated colonial superiority toward the peoples of the region and constitute a blatant violation of the most basic principles of diplomatic etiquette.\"",
      "The union called on Barrack to issue an \"official and public apology,\" and asked the U.S. Embassy in Beirut to take a clear stance on what it called unacceptable behavior.",
      "It also urged Lebanese and Arab media outlets to boycott Barrack's activities and news conferences until an apology is issued.",
      "Barrack's office at the U.S. embassy in Turkey did not respond to CBS News' requests for comment on the criticism of his Tuesday remarks, or to confirm the reported change in his Wednesday travel plans.

      "The ambassador was flown early in the day to a Lebanese military base by helicopter, for a pre-planned tour.",

      "Through outright looting or coercive sales, agents acting on behalf of the Nazis made off with countless artworks from private Dutch-Jewish dealers. Goudstikker's inventory was sold illegally to Hermann Goering, known as Adolf Hitler's right-hand man.",
      "Goudstikker's sole surviving heir, Marei von Saher, has long pursued restitution for her father-in-law's stolen works. In a landmark 2006 case, the Dutch government agreed to return 202 looted paintings from Goudstikker's collection to von Saher after a protracted legal battle.",

      "Police said their examination of the three bones and a skull found this week by Korean divers at the former site of the Chosei Mine in western Yamaguchi prefecture confirmed they are all human remains.",
      "But police said their analysis could not determine whether the three limb bones and skull belonged to the same person, their age or the timing of the death.",
      "The group, known as Kizamu Kai, said they are certain the remains belong to victims who died at the mine 83 years ago and that the discovery is a major boost in their efforts to recover other remains of the 136 Korean forced laborers and 47 Japanese workers killed in the mine collapse.",

      "Denmark's National Museum has unveiled what it described as the first \"portrait\" of a Viking: a miniature 10th-century figurine depicting a man with an imperial moustache, braided beard and  neatly-groomed hairstyle.",
      "Carved out of ivory walrus tusk, the partially damaged representation of a head and torso measures just 1.2 inches).",
      "\"If you think of Vikings as savage or wild, this figure is proving the opposite, actually. He is very well-groomed,\" curator Peter Pentz told AFP Wednesday, holding up the piece with white-gloved hands.",
      "\"He has a center parting up to the top of his head, and then in the neck his hair is cut,\" Pentz said.",
      "He has a side wave that leaves the ear visible and, in addition to a large moustache and long, braided goatee, he has sideburns.",
      "During the Viking era, beautiful hair was a sign of wealth and status, Pentz explained.",
      "\"A hair design like his, which is very neat -- you can see a little curl or tuft of hair running over the ears -- (suggests) this guy is at the top.\"",
      "\"He could be the king himself, King Harald Bluetooth.\"",
      "The artwork, which is believed to be an ancient board game piece representing a king, was originally found in the Oslo fjord in Norway in 1796.",
      "It's been tucked away and forgotten in the archives of Denmark's National Museum ever since.",
      "When Pentz stumbled on the figurine in the museum's large collections a few years ago, he said it felt like the Viking was looking right at him.",

      "\"This is the first thing that comes close to a portrait from the Viking period that I've seen,\" Pentz said.",

      "But this one is unique with its attention to detail.",
      "\"He looks devilish, some people say. But I think he looks more like he's just been telling a joke or something like that. He's smiling.\"",

    "story": [
      "Israel's military issued a statement Tuesday saying its preliminary investigation into a strike the previous day that killed at least 20 people, including five journalists, at the Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza Strip had targeted a camera that it said was being used by Hamas for surveillance.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said troops in Khan Younis identified a camera \"being used to observe the activity of IDF troops, in order to direct terrorist activities against them.\"",
      "The IDF did not provide evidence to back the assertion, but said it was \"further supported\" by previously documented Hamas usage of hospitals \"by the terrorist organizations throughout the war, and by intelligence confirming Hamas' use of the Nasser Hospital to carry out terrorist activities since the start of the war.\"",
      "The Israeli military's explanation contrasted with a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a few hours after the incident, expressing regret for what he called a \"tragic mishap,\" with no suggestion of a specific Hamas target at the hospital.",
      "\"Israel values the work of journalists, medical staff, and all civilians,\" Netanyahu's office said in the statement released on social media. \"The military authorities are conducting a thorough investigation. Our war is with Hamas terrorists. Our just goals are defeating Hamas and bringing our hostages home.\"",
      "In what witnesses described as a double-tap strike by Israeli drones \u2014 with one missile striking the hospital followed by another as people gathered to assess the damage and attend to the wounded \u2014 five Palestinian journalists were killed on Monday.",
      "Their identities were confirmed as Hossam al-Masri, who worked for the Reuters news agency, Mohammed Salama, who worked for Al Jazeera, and freelance journalists Maryam Abu Daqqa, Moaz Abu Taha and Ahmad Abu Aziz.",

      "The strike was among the deadliest of several that have hit hospitals and journalists over the course of the 22-month war in Gaza, and it came as Israel plans to widen its offensive to heavily populated areas in the densely populated Palestinian territory.",
      "The first strike hit a top floor of a building at Nasser Hospital. Minutes later, as journalists and rescuers in orange vests rushed up an external staircase to reach the scene of the first blast, a second missile hit, said Dr. Ahmed al-Farra, head of Nasser's pediatrics department.",
      "In a statement issued Monday, the Foreign Press Association, which represents journalists working in Israel and the Palestinian territories, said it was \"outraged and in shock\" over the killings of media workers.",
      "\"This is among the deadliest Israeli attacks on journalists working for international media since the Gaza war began,\" the organization said. \"These strikes hit the exterior staircase of the hospital where journalists frequently stationed themselves with their cameras. The strikes came with no warning.\"",
      "The IDF, in its Tuesday statement, said Israeli forces, having identified the alleged surveillance camera, \"operated to remove the threat by striking and dismantling the camera and the inquiry showed that the troops operated to remove the threat.\"",
      "The IDF said six of those killed in the attack \"were terrorists, one of whom took part in the infiltration into Israeli territory on October 7th. At the same time, the Chief of the General Staff regrets any harm caused to civilians.\"",
      "The IDF did not identify the alleged terrorists killed in the strike, or explain the evidence used to make the determination that they were terrorists. Nor did the IDF suggest anything had been deliberately targeted in the strike other than the purported camera.",
      "The military said the chief of staff had ordered further investigation into both \"the authorization process prior to the strike, including the ammunition approved for the strike and the timing of the authorization,\" and the \"decision making process in the field.\"",
      "President Trump, asked about the deadly strike on Monday, said he had been unaware until the question was put to him.",
      "\"When did this happen?\" Mr. Trump asked a reporter in the White House. \"I didn't know that. Well, I'm not happy about it. I don't want to see it. At the same time, we have to end that whole nightmare.\"",
      "Israel has come under mounting pressure over the number of journalists being killed in its military operations in Gaza \u2014 including in targeted strikes against individuals whom Israeli officials claim were Hamas operatives.",
      "At least 197 journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza, the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and in Lebanon since Israel launched its war against Hamas in Gaza in retaliation for the Hamas-orchestrated terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.",
      "That war has killed more than 60,000 people in Gaza, according to the Palestinian enclave's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its figures. The Hamas-led attack almost two years ago killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and saw 251 others taken as hostages into Gaza.",

      "Swift announced Kelce had proposed in an Instagram post on Aug. 26. The pop star shared photos of the intimate moment, including the caption, \"Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.\"",
      "The couple's starpower means there's a lot at stake when it comes to their marriage. Swift and Kelce have a combined estimated net worth of about $1.67 billion, according to Forbes. However, a prenup doesn't have to just focus on the money aspect. Swift has been notably private about the specific details of her relationships. The couple could use a prenup to protect their privacy should anything go south in their marriage, according to family law attorney Monica Mazzei.",
      "\"Given that they are both public figures, a prenup can also ensure privacy in a divorce, such as precluding any disparaging social media posts or interviews,\" Mazzei, a shareholder at Buchalter, explained. \"Likewise, it can require the divorce to be heard by a private judge, further limiting any public exposure.\"",

      "Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift likely signed a prenuptial agreement before the proposal, a family law expert told Fox News Digital. (Patrick Smith/Getty Images)",
      "Due to the financial success of the singer and football star, a prenup was likely signed \"far in advance\" of Kelce's romantic proposal, family lawyer Jacqueline Newman explained to Fox News Digital.",
      "\"There's very little doubt in my mind that they'll be negotiating after the fact,\" Newman, a managing partner at Berkman Bottger Newman & Schein LLP, said. \"I think that their teams would make it crucial for this to be something that must be done before the romantic gesture. So, I think they got rid of all the business part of it, and then he obviously dropped to a knee and proposed to her. But I can pretty much guarantee that the agreement is signed, sealed and already in a drawer somewhere.\"",

      "The singer-songwriter pulled in over $2 billion in ticket sales for the tour \u2013 which featured performances of songs from all 11 of Swift's studio albums, the outlet reported. Swift concluded the \"Eras Tour\" in December 2024 and has since announced the upcoming release of her 12th studio album, \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"",
      "For his part, Kelce is worth an estimated $70 million. While his main job has been playing tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, Kelce has actually brought in the majority of his net worth from off the field. The outlet reported Kelce has earned $111 million from football, before taxes and other fees. However, he's raked in an estimated $190 million from outside endeavors \u2013 including his and brother Jason's $100 million \"New Heights\" podcast contract with Wondery.",

Couples with substantial wealth, like Swift and Kelce, face far-reaching financial implications, according to Cassandra Rupp of Vanguard.",
      "\"While every circumstance is different, it\u2019s common for wealthy partners to explore prenuptial agreements \u2013 not as a sign of mistrust, but as a proactive tool to protect individual assets, clarify financial responsibilities and preserve harmony,\" she said. \"A well-crafted prenup might include provisions for existing wealth, future earnings from intellectual property or business ventures, and even philanthropic commitments.\"",
      "The wealth advisor noted it's not unusual for couples to include future income, such as royalties, endorsements or media rights.",

But I don't see them doing that. I think even though the amount is probably north of $110 million that they could make, but the reputational tax is a killing machine for both of them.\"",

And, you know, sometimes you'll see that twinkle in his eye, or that smirk, and, you know, I just get, like, transported. And it's just hard to see, because as quickly as those moments appear, then it goes. It's hard. But I'm grateful. I'm grateful that my husband is still very much here.\"",

      "Anderson is a former Delta Air Lines pilot whose nomination drew ire from the Air Line Pilots Association, a union that represents nearly 80,000 pilots across the U.S. and Canada, arguing his \"only\" qualification was supporting an effort to raise the mandatory pilot retirement age.",
      "The union opposes increasing the mandatory retirement from 65 years of age to age 67, arguing it \"would leave the United States as an outlier in the global aviation space and create chaos on pilot labor, and international and domestic flight operations,\" the group's statement in July read.",
      "Fox News Digital took a look back at Anderson's political campaign contributions and found he donated to a handful of Democratic candidates often hostile to Trump and his policies.",
      "He also made a handful of small-dollar donations to Republican Nikki Haley during the 2024 campaign cycle, when the former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. ran against Trump, whom she slammed as \"unhinged\" while on the campaign trail before dropping out of the race and endorsing Trump as the GOP nominee for president.",
      "TRUMP NOMINATES SEASONED MILITARY LEADERS TO HEAD VITAL GLOBAL COMMANDS",
      "Anderson contributed at least $200 to Haley during the month of February 2024, when Haley and Trump were the only GOP candidates left in the primary race, according to four small-dollar donations recorded by the Federal Election Commission.",
      "The former pilot also donated to Shawn Harris, the former Democratic opponent who tried to unseat Republican Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in the 2024 cycle. The $100 donation was made in September 2024 through ActBlue, the Democratic Party's massive fundraising arm, and earmarked for the Democratic candidate who ultimately failed to oust Greene.",
      "Harris' campaign included slamming Trump and characterizing him as a politician who acts as a \"king\" and threatens democracy.",

      "Anderson's political donations to Democrats stretch back years, including in 2017 when he donated to Democrats, such as former House candidate Dan Ward in Virginia and former Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon \u2014 both of whom received $250 contributions from Anderson that year, according to election records.",
      "Both Democrats had slammed Trump and his policies across his first administration, including DeFazio declaring after the Jan. 6, 2021, breach of the Capitol that: \"Donald Trump is a threat to our democracy, national security and the safety of all Americans. He must be removed from office immediately.\"",

      "The former Delta pilot also has landed in hot water over unpaid taxes, Fox News Digital found. IRS records show Anderson and his wife had more than $426,000 in unpaid federal taxes across seven years from 2013 to 2019, raising concerns that his financial responsibility. The taxes were related to a \"small business,\" according to the forms.",
      "\"Jeffrey Anderson isn\u2019t a Trump Republican at all; he\u2019s a liberal sleeper who slipped through the cracks of PPO (Presidential Personnel Office),\" a former Trump official told Fox Digital of Anderson's political donations and tax history.",
      "When approached for comment on the previous donations and tax issues, Anderson told Fox News Digital that at \"the very least, some of your information is factually incorrect or tendered well out of context.\" Anderson did not respond when asked for additional details on what was \"factually incorrect.\"",
      "\"I am fully supportive of President Trump and his America First agenda. I have been fully vetted by the White House and appreciate the approval of the President, House Aviation Chair Troy Nehls and House T&I Chair Sam Graves, among others. I look forward to advancing American interests as the next Permanent Representative to ICAO,\" he wrote in a direct message on LinkedIn to Fox Digital in August, while adding that Trump is seeking to \"move effectively forward in a space negligently left vacant by Biden.\"",
      "When asked about Anderson's tax history and donations to Democrats and Trump opponents, a White House official told Fox Digital: \"Jeffrey (Anderson) is highly qualified to serve as America\u2019s ambassador to the ICAO, and he is a great choice to represent the President\u2019s America First foreign policy agenda in the international aviation community.\"",

      "Old social media posts on X show Anderson celebrated former President Biden's 2012 Democratic National Convention speech at the time as \"wonderful American message: major concepts, not petty; Democratic, but not commercially political.\" Other tweets targeted the National Rifle Association and celebrated how Anderson \"politely but firmly faced\" NRA representatives and gun manufacturers on \"sensible policy ideals\" back in 2023, according to a review of the X account @JeffAndersonPAI, which ceased activity in 2014.",

      "In addition to the White House defending Anderson's nomination, Texas Republican Rep. Troy Nehls, who serves as chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Aviation, told Fox Digital that Anderson will help usher in \"the Golden Age of aviation\" under the Trump administration.",

      "\"As Chairman of the House Aviation Subcommittee, I have complete confidence in Jeffrey Anderson to serve as ambassador to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO),\" Nehls said in comment to Fox Digital in August. \"Mr. Anderson served as a naval aviator and has more than three decades of experience as a pilot for Delta. He is, without a doubt, qualified to represent the United States of America at ICAO, where his first-hand experience with the aviation industry will play a crucial role in advancing President Trump\u2019s mission of ushering in the Golden Age of aviation.\"",
      "A board member of a pilot group called Experienced Pilots Advancing Aviation Safety added that he fully backs Anderson's nomination, citing his honesty and credentials as an airline captain. The Experienced Pilots Advancing Aviation Safety, which endorsed Anderson's nomination, also advocates raising the mandatory retirement age for airline pilots, arguing experienced pilots lead to safer skies and can mentor the next generation instead of \"forced retirements of America\u2019s most experienced aviators,\" according to its website.",
      "\"I feel 100% confident in Captain Anderson\u2019s honesty and professional credentials. Having flown aircraft around the world in international operations for the past 40 years in the Marine Corps and Delta Airlines, and my working with and in association with ICAO and IATA, I feel Jeff would be a perfect fit for this position as it seems the president of the United States does also,\" the board member told Fox Digital in emailed comment earlier in August.",
      "International aviation rules prohibit airline pilots older than 65 from flying. Global airline groups such as the International Air Transport Association have called on the International Civil Aviation Organization to consider raising the international pilot retirement age to age 67. The U.N. General Assembly will convene Sept. 23, with the International Civil Aviation Organization expected to consider the proposal, Reuters reported Thursday.",

      "The truth is, even if you've never posted a single thing online, scammers can still know your age, home address, relatives' names, property value, and even when you've suffered the loss of a loved one.

This can tell scammers whether you own your home outright, what it's worth, and if you might be cash-rich.Probate filings: When estates go through probate, details about beneficiaries and assets are recorded. Scammers can identify heirs and target them with fraudulent \"inheritance assistance.\"Property tax documents: These are often searchable by anyone.

Because they reference real names, dates, and relationships, their outreach sounds painfully authentic.",

The obituary in the local paper, the deed to your home, the probate record of your loved one's estate, these are all turned into data points, sold to brokers, and resold to whoever wants them. That's why protecting your personal data isn't about avoiding the internet. It's about reducing what's already out there. The less data scammers can find, the harder it is for them to fool you with realistic, emotionally charged attacks. And that's a big step toward keeping your money, your identity, and your retirement safe.",

In early 2025, they turned to drone technology to renew the effort. Flying about 164 feet above the terrain, the drones surveyed a 452-acre section of the mountain.

    "story": [
      "Pete Nicoletti, chief information security officer at Check Point, told Fox News Digital that an FBI-warned scam is now using AI to target seniors.",
      "A tech leader like Google often seems invincible when it comes to cybersecurity attacks, but that is not the case. Earlier this month, the search giant confirmed that attackers had accessed one of its corporate Salesforce instances. According to a Google spokesperson, this system stored basic, and largely publicly available business information, such as contact details and notes from small and medium-sized companies. It did not store customer data from Google Cloud or consumer products like Gmail, Drive or Calendar.",

      "Vishing calls target Gmail users",
      "Hackers have reportedly accessed Google's Salesforce database systems, exposing customer and company names. Google confirmed the incident and clarified that the information was mostly public business contact data and did not include passwords or payment information. The company stressed that the breach affected only a corporate Salesforce system, not consumer Gmail or Google Cloud accounts.",
      "Still, attackers are exploiting the news of the breach to fuel phishing and vishing scams, tricking people into giving up sensitive information. According to PC World, some users have already reported an increase in phishing attempts that reference Google services.",
      "STOP GOOGLE FROM FOLLOWING YOUR EVERY MOVE",
      "One of the main tactics involves scam phone calls, also known as vishing. A Reddit post highlighted a wave of calls coming from the 650 area code, which is linked to Google's headquarters. In these calls, scammers pose as Google employees and warn victims of a supposed security breach. They then instruct users to reset their Gmail password and share it with them. This locks the rightful owner out of the account and gives the attacker complete control.",
      "A user launches Gmail. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Old infrastructure exploited with \"dangling buckets\"",
      "Separately from the Salesforce incident, Google Cloud customers are also facing another type of attack. Hackers are trying to exploit outdated access addresses using a method called the dangling bucket. This can allow them to inject malware or steal data. Both businesses and individuals are vulnerable to losing control over sensitive information if targeted in this way.",
      "Gmail and Google Cloud serve nearly 2.5 billion people, which makes the scale of the risk significant. Although the initial breach did not expose passwords, attackers are using the news of the incident to trick people into revealing their login details.",

      "Phishing remains the most common way scammers steal Google account credentials. A fake email or text may claim your account has been locked or that you need to verify suspicious activity. Clicking the link usually takes you to a counterfeit login page that looks almost identical to the real Google sign-in screen.",
      "To avoid falling for these tricks, check the sender's email address carefully, hover over links before clicking, and avoid entering your Google password on any page that doesn't start with accounts.google.com.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "The easiest way to manage this is with a password manager. It can generate complex passwords, store them securely, and fill them in automatically when you need them. This way, you never have to remember dozens of different logins, and attackers can't guess their way in.",

Our #1 password manager pick (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

      "Scammers often use information they find online to craft convincing attacks. If your email address, phone number, or even past passwords are floating around on data broker sites, criminals have more tools to impersonate you or trick you into revealing more.",

      "Even the strongest password can be stolen, but\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra barrier. When enabled, Google will ask for a one-time code or prompt on your phone before granting access. That means even if a scammer manages to get your password, they can't log in without also having your device.",
      "Google offers several 2FA methods, from SMS codes to app-based prompts and even hardware security keys. For the best protection, choose app-based or hardware verification rather than text messages.",
      "Many scams rely on exploiting outdated software. If your phone, browser, or operating system isn't up to date, attackers may use known vulnerabilities to install malware or hijack your session.",

      "Pixel 10 Series: Smarter design, displays, and cameras",
      "Google's Pixel 10 lineup is the heart of this year's Made by Google event. With the Tensor G5 chip, brighter displays, and new AI-powered camera tools, the series delivers meaningful upgrades for everyday users. Here's what each model brings and why it matters.",
      "A man talking on a Google Pixel 10. (Google)",
      "The Pixel 10 brings big improvements without the Pro price tag. It features a 6.3-inch OLED Actua display that's brighter than ever, making outdoor use easy. Google also added better bass in the speakers, so movies, music, and calls sound richer.",
      "The headline feature is the first 5x telephoto lens on a base Pixel, complete with 10x optical-quality zoom and up to 20x Super Res Zoom. For anyone who loves capturing moments from a distance, kids' soccer games, concerts, or city skylines, this is a huge advancement forward.",
      "The Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL models push Pixel photography even further. They introduce Pro Res Zoom up to 100x, powered by generative AI on the Tensor G5 chip. That means close-up shots with detail you'd normally need a DSLR to capture.",
      "Both the Pro (6.3-inch) and Pro XL (6.8-inch) feature Google's brightest Super Actua displays, larger batteries, and up to 16 GB of RAM for faster performance. These phones are made for power users who want the very best in cameras, speed, and AI tools.",
      "A Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold display is shown. (Google)",
      "The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is Google's most durable foldable yet, designed for people who want a phone that doubles as a tablet. With an upgraded gearless hinge, IP68 water and dust resistance, and a larger battery, it's built to last years of folding and unfolding.",
      "It's perfect for multitasking, splitting the screen for video calls and apps, or for streaming and gaming on the bigger display. For anyone curious about foldables but worried about durability, this is Google's most confident answer yet.",
      "The Pixel 10, Pro, Pro XL, and Pro Fold all run on the brand-new Tensor\u202fG5 chip, which Google calls its most significant upgrade to date. The chip is made by TSMC using a 3nm process, delivering faster, more efficient on-device AI performance with Gemini Nano at its core. Across the entire lineup, Google made thoughtful design upgrades. The iconic camera bar has been refined, the bodies use more recycled materials, and the colors are elegant and modern. Choices include Indigo, Frost, and Lemongrass on Pixel 10, and Moonstone, Jade, Obsidian, and Porcelain on the Pro models.",
      "FOLDABLE PHONES ARE IMPRESSIVE TECHNOLOGICAL MARVELS BUT COME WITH SERIOUS COMPROMISES",
      "Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL are all available for preorder today, starting at $799, $999, and $1199. Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL owners will also get a full year of Google AI Pro.\u00a0Pixel 10 Pro Fold is available for pre-order today and hits shelves on\u00a0Oct. 9.",

      "A woman wears Pixel Buds 2a. (Google)",
      "Google introduced the Pixel Buds 2a as the newest member of the Pixel Buds family. They deliver premium features like Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and hands-free AI help, all at an affordable $129. With a fresh design, better sound, and smarter connectivity, these buds bring everyday value to anyone who wants high performance without breaking the bank.",
      "Pixel Buds 2a are smaller and lighter than the earlier A-series, making them comfortable enough to wear all day. Inspired by the Pixel Buds Pro 2, they include a twist-to-adjust stabilizer and four different eartips so you can find the perfect fit. With an IP54 sweat and water resistance rating, you don't have to worry about rain or workouts. The buds also come in two stylish colors, iris and hazel, designed to complement other Pixel devices.",
      "At the heart of Pixel Buds 2a is the Tensor A1 chip, built specifically for audio. This brings Active Noise Cancellation with Silent Seal 1.5, a first for Google's A-series. A custom speaker driver and new high-frequency chamber enhance music and podcast quality. Wind-blocking mesh covers and Google AI improve call clarity, so your voice sounds crisp on the other end.",
      "Battery life also gets a boost. You'll enjoy 7 hours on a single charge with ANC on, and up to 20 hours with the charging case. With ANC off, you get nearly double the listening time compared to the first-generation A-series. For the first time, the case itself includes a replaceable battery, making the buds more durable and sustainable.",
      "Pixel Buds 2a work as more than headphones; they're also your AI companion. With Gemini built in, you can get quick answers, check messages, or even ask for coffee shop recommendations on the go. Just say \"Hey Google\" or customize the press-and-hold gesture for instant help.",
      "Pairing with a Pixel phone is seamless, but the buds also support Multipoint, letting you switch between devices without hassle. Fast Pair makes setup quick, and the Find Hub app ensures you never lose them. You can see the exact location on a map or make them ring when nearby.",

      "Pixel Watch 4: Smarter design, AI health, and satellite safety",
      "A Pixel Watch 4 is seen with a pink wristband and display. (Google)",
      "The Pixel Watch 4 is Google's biggest smartwatch upgrade yet. It keeps the iconic round look but introduces a domed Actua 360 display that's brighter, larger, and easier to see, even in direct sunlight. The screen is 50% brighter, the bezels are smaller, and everything feels more fluid thanks to new animations and stronger haptics. Simply put, it looks better and feels more responsive on your wrist.",
      "Battery life has always been a concern for smartwatches. Google addressed it with a 25% boost. The 41mm model now lasts up to 30 hours, while the 45mm model stretches to 40 hours. With Battery Saver mode, you can extend usage to two or even three days. Plus, the new Quick Charge Dock takes you from 0 to 50% in just 15 minutes, making it easier to power up before you head out.",
      "One of the most groundbreaking features is standalone satellite connectivity. Pixel Watch 4 LTE is the first smartwatch that can dial emergency services even when you're off the grid. Whether you're hiking, camping, or driving in remote areas, the watch can connect to geo-stationary satellites and get help when you need it most. That's peace of mind you can actually wear.",
      "Health remains a core focus. Pixel Watch 4 adds more accurate sleep tracking, enhanced skin temperature sensing, and dual-frequency GPS for precise route logging in tough environments. Cyclists will love the new real-time bike stats, while fitness fans get 50+ exercise modes, including pickleball and basketball. Even if you forget to start a workout, the watch's AI now auto-detects and logs your activity.",
      "With Gemini AI built in, the Pixel Watch 4 goes beyond tracking; it coaches. A new personal AI health coach gives proactive fitness and sleep advice tailored to your goals. It's like having a trainer and wellness guide on your wrist, available anytime. A preview of this feature arrives in October through the Fitbit app, opening the door to personalized, AI-driven health support.",
      "WWDC 2025: IOS 26, LIQUID GLASS DESIGN AND APPLE\u2019S AI SHORTFALL",
      "The Pixel Watch 4 isn't just about health. With Gemini on your wrist, you can get answers or complete tasks hands-free. Raise your wrist to talk, respond to messages with smart replies, or control your day without pulling out your phone. It's designed for those busy, in-between moments, when your hands are full but you still need help.",
      "The Pixel Watch 4 is available for\u00a0preorder now. It launches Oct. 9 with pricing starting at\u00a0$349 for Wi-Fi and\u00a0$449 for LTE in the 41mm size, and\u00a0$399 for Wi-Fi and\u00a0$499 for LTE in the 45mm size.

      "Pixelsnap and Qi2 Charging: Magnetic power made simple",
      "A Pixelsnap Charger, Pixelsnap Ring Stand and the Pixel Flex 67W Dual USB-C fast charger are showcased. (Google)",
      "The Pixel 10 series is the first major Android lineup to fully embrace Qi2 magnetic charging. Think of it as Google's answer to MagSafe, only it works with a wider range of devices. Qi2 improves on the old Qi standard by adding magnets, so your phone snaps perfectly into place every time. No more fiddling with alignment, charging is instant and reliable.",
      "This upgrade matters because it unlocks a full ecosystem of Pixelsnap accessories, built to make charging and everyday use easier. And since Qi2 is a universal standard, you're not limited to Google's products; you can also use MagSafe accessories with your Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold.",
      "The Pixelsnap Charger comes as a simple puck or bundled with a sleek stand. It charges the Pixel 10 Pro XL at up to 25W and other Qi2-certified devices at 15W. The stand looks elegant on a desk or nightstand, and the puck detaches for charging on the go. If you own a Pixel 10 Pro Fold, the stand even supports charging while unfolded, letting you stream, video call, or display widgets on the big screen as your phone powers up.",
      "Need hands-free viewing? The Pixelsnap Ring Stand snaps onto the back of your phone for propping it up. It rotates smoothly thanks to a microfiber liner, making it easy to find the perfect angle for movies or video calls. Slim enough to slip into a pocket or purse, it adds function without adding bulk.",
      "Google designed its new Pixel 10 cases to be Pixelsnap-ready. That means you can attach chargers or accessories without ever removing the case. Available in colors like Moonstone, Jade, Obsidian, Porcelain, Indigo, Frost, and Lemongrass, they not only protect your phone but also match the refreshed Pixel 10 design.",
      "If you prefer wired charging, Google also introduced the Pixel Flex Dual Port 67W charger. It's the fastest dual-port charger yet for Pixel phones. Thanks to a custom algorithm, it prioritizes charging your Pixel first while still powering a second device. Compact with foldable prongs, it's designed to travel as easily as you do.",
      "All Pixelsnap products and the\u00a0Pixel 10 series are available for\u00a0preorder now, with retail availability starting\u00a0August 28.",
      "AI Features: Magic Cue, Camera Coach, and more",
      "An image of the Tensor G5 chip is seen. (Google)",
      "Google made it clear at the 2025 Made by Google event that AI is now at the heart of the Pixel experience. With the Tensor G5 chip and Gemini Nano, Pixel 10 phones deliver more than speed-they anticipate what you need and help you get it done.",
      "The new Magic Cue acts like a personal assistant inside your phone. It proactively pulls information you need at just the right time. For example, if you're on the phone with an airline, it can instantly display your flight details from Gmail. When you're in a group chat, it can surface photos or addresses without making you dig. And because all of this happens on-device, your personal data stays private.",
      "Pixel cameras are known for their quality, but Camera Coach takes it further. Using Gemini AI, it gives real-time tips to improve your photos. It might suggest a different angle, a tighter frame, or a better composition. For beginners, it's a helpful teacher. For experienced photographers, it's like having a second set of creative eyes right in your pocket.",
      "Features like Best Take automatically select the sharpest face from a series of photos, making group shots easier than ever. Meanwhile, Pro Res Zoom, exclusive to Pixel 10 Pro models, uses a generative AI imaging model to deliver astonishing detail up to 100x zoom. It's not just cropping in, it's rebuilding and refining the image to look crisp.",
      "Beyond photography, Google packed the Pixel 10 with over 20 generative AI tools that work directly on the device. They help with editing, writing, and even composing replies in your favorite apps. The goal is simple: make the phone feel less like a tool and more like a helpful companion that adapts to your needs.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Google just staged one of its most memorable launches yet. With Fallon, Curry, Norris, and the Jonas Brothers front and center, the event blended entertainment and innovation. That energy carried through to the devices, which brought Google's boldest AI, camera, and ecosystem upgrades so far. Each product offered clear value. The Tensor G5 chip and Gemini Nano AI make everything faster and more efficient. The Pixel 10 phones push photography and performance further than before. Meanwhile, the Pixel Watch 4 adds health coaching and even satellite emergency support. The Pixel Buds 2a also pack premium sound and smart features at a budget price. In addition, Pixelsnap accessories make charging simple and stylish. Finally, Google's promise of seven years of updates sets this lineup apart.

They will be charged either the tariff rates the United States has on their countries of origin or flat fees of $80 to $200 \u2014 the latter option available to postal carriers only in the first six months. The shipments may face additional tariffs and fees in some cases.",
      "John Pickel, vice president of supply chain policy at the National Foreign Trade Council, said that it could take longer for some packages to arrive and that consumers and businesses in the United States could end up with significantly higher costs.",
      "\u201cOn your average de minimis shipment, paying a customs broker and paying the fees will double the cost,\u201d Pickel said. \u201cThat\u2019s before you even get to the money that\u2019s actually going to the government.\u201d",

With the exemption ending, Salvini plans to raise prices.",

And my sister \u2014 she\u2019s my partner. It\u2019s how we pay our employees and our rent. And so the idea that we could take on every additional cost for such small goods is just not possible.\u201d",
      "The de minimis exemption streamlined processing of overseas shipments and allowed U.S. businesses and consumers to buy low-cost items from abroad without incurring massive charges.",

      "It ended the exemption for items from China and Hong Kong in May. There hasn\u2019t been a significant change in monthly drug seizures since then, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
      "Then, the tax and spending law President Donald Trump signed in July eliminated the exemption for all countries starting in 2027. But Trump\u2019s executive order on July 30 condensed the timeline, ending the exemption on Friday.",
      "There are some exceptions: American travelers will still be able to bring $200 in personal items back to the United States duty-free. And someone abroad can send a gift of $100 or less to the United States duty-free.",
      "In the days leading up to Friday, dozens of package carriers around the world paused shipping to the United States as they sorted through the changes and updated their shipping procedures.",
      "Salvini, the Greenwich Letterpress co-owner, said the business will no longer be able to buy certain items from abroad \u2014 and some of the shop\u2019s international suppliers have cut off shipping to the United States anyway. So customers might see different items on the shelves, and Salvini and her team want to keep them as affordable as possible.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve always prided ourselves on being a space that you can come into and you could spend $1 and get something,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a luxury store. It doesn\u2019t weed people out because it\u2019s too much, and we just don\u2019t want to get to that point where everything in here just feels like that\u2019s just a little above what somebody might want to spend, because that\u2019s not the joy that we try to show people.\u201d"

We take way more psychiatric medication than any other nation on Earth, and I think it\u2019s time for us to start asking some very hard questions about the root causes of this violence,\" Vance said at an event in Wisconsin in his first public remarks about Wednesday's church shooting in neighboring Minnesota, in which two children were killed.",
      "In an interview Thursday on Fox News, Vance called the shooter a \"mentally deranged human being.\"",

      "Kennedy is a longtime critic of SSRIs, and he has spoken out about what he sees as overuse and overprescribing of the drugs. He has also previously blamed the drugs for school shootings, despite evidence to the contrary.",
      "Mental health advocacy groups have also spoken out against Kennedy's criticisms of SSRIs, saying that the drugs can be lifesaving by mitigating thoughts of suicide and that they can help people with severe depression or anxiety function on a daily basis and maintain social relationships.",
      "\"I know the secretary of health and human services this morning said that HHS is investigating, perhaps, links between some of these drugs and these prescription drugs that some of these minors may be taking and an increase in violence,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at Thursday's briefing.",

      "He also called Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to offer his condolences and ordered that flags be flown at half-staff.",

    "story": [
      "More than seven years before Robin Westman opened fire on a Catholic school as Mass was underway, killing two children and injuring 17 more worshippers, police were called to a townhouse in the Twin Cities suburb where she lived with her mother.",
      "The heavily redacted police report NBC News obtained from the police department in Eagan, Minnesota, is dated Jan. 26, 2018, and it includes a two-word description explaining why an officer was dispatched to that address: mental health.",
      "It also includes a brief synopsis that reads \u201cassisted Mendota Heights with a check welfare of a juvenile.\u201d Mendota Heights is another Twin Cities suburb.",
      "The name of that juvenile and what exactly prompted police to be summoned to the three-bedroom home on Crane Creek Lane were blacked out in the report.",
      "Two years before the mental health call, police responded to a report of a \u201ccriminal offense\u201d at the residence, according to a police report. But beyond noting that the case was closed, the report blacks out all the details describing the event.",
      "Investigators probing Wednesday\u2019s deadly mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis continue to search for a clear motive to explain why Westman, 23, committed the act of terror.",
      "Westman, who died by suicide after the shooting, was a trans woman and had been a student at Annunciation. Her mother, Mary Grace Westman, had once worked at the school.",
      "Minnesota has a red flag law that went into effect in January 2024, allowing family members and others to petition the courts to have guns removed from a person they believe poses a threat to themselves or the community. The state passed a law in 2023 requiring gun buyers to pass universal background checks and to obtain permits for pistols or semiautomatic military-style assault weapons.",
      "But it does not appear any alarms were sounded as Westman amassed an arsenal that included the rifle, the pistol and the shotgun used in the attack on the church.",
      "Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara said Thursday that authorities do not have information indicating that Westman suffered from mental illness and that, other than a traffic ticket, she did not have a police record.",
      "\u201cThere is nothing in the investigation so far that would lead us to believe that anything was missed,\u201d O\u2019Hara said.",
      "The shooter, he said, was able to \u201clawfully purchase these weapons.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Hara added that Westman\u2019s family has been cooperating with investigators, but they have not yet located his mother, who lives in another state. Records show her residence as being in Florida.",
      "Ryan Garry, an attorney for Mary Grace Westman, told NBC News he did not have a comment at this time.",
      "The FBI\u2019s special agent in charge in Minneapolis, Alvin M. Winston Sr., said the agency had not had any previous contact with the shooter.",
      "\u201cWe did a check of all of our holdings, the FBI holdings, and he was not in our holdings prior to this incident, so we didn\u2019t have anything on him at that time,\u201d Winston said.",
      "In the aftermath of the shooting, FBI Director Kash Patel called the attack \u201can act of domestic terrorism motivated by a hate-filled ideology.\u201d",
      "And police are reviewing the online videos, in which the shooter scrawled racial slurs, a homophobic slur, antisemitic messages, a call for President Donald Trump\u2019s death and references to the Holocaust and the Catholic Church.",
      "In addition, the video showed the suspect flipping through the pages of a journal written in English but using the Cyrillic alphabet. At times uttering \u201ckoshmar,\u201d which is the Russian word for \u201cnightmare,\u201d the shooter discusses the mechanics of mass school shootings and suicide.",
      "A person who went to Minneapolis\u2019 Southwest High School with the shooter and described her as \u201ca bit of a strange person with a dark sense of humor\u201d said she never heard Westman make any jokes about shootings or guns. But she often mumbled in what the person believed was Russian, said the former classmate, who asked not to be identified for privacy reasons.",
      "\u201cPeople would ask what she was saying, and she would just tell them, \u2018Oh, nothing,\u2019\u201d the person recalled.",
      "\u201cYesterday\u2019s events were very shocking to everyone who knew her in school and the entire Minneapolis community,\u201d the former classmate said. \u201cMany people do and say strange things in their teenage years, so many people just saw it as her just trying to be \u2018edgy\u2019 or \u2018funny.\u2019 It\u2019s very hard to see the videos of what she planned and carried out. I was never very close with her, but this is still very heavy on my heart.\u201d",
      "Westman said in the journal that she began pondering mass murder in the seventh grade. In particular, she was fixated on the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut in 2012.",
      "She writes that she has a history of making threats about violence. In another part of the journal, she writes about how easy it would be to buy a gun and mentions that she has dropped warning signs to people, asking for help.",
      "Westman\u2019s parents, who are divorced, have yet to make a public statement about the shooting. Neither could be reached for comment.",
      "Westman was 11 when her mother and her father, James Westman, divorced in 2013. At the time, she and her brother and sister lived with their parents in Hastings, another Twin Cities suburb.",
      "Police were called to that residence at least four times from 2003 to 2016, including once for a welfare check for an adult female, a sibling, who was threatening suicide in 2014. Also in 2014, police responded to a report of vandalism at the home. Officers saw several offensive words and pictures written on windows of the garage and the father\u2019s car.",
      "Another call in 2010 related to a \u201cjuvenile problem\u201d with a 17-year-old daughter who was \u201cout of control.\u201d But nothing in the records indicates that those incidents involved the shooter.",
      "When the shooter was living in Eagan, she was still using her birth name. She did not become Robin M. Westman until age 17, when, records show, the name change application was granted in January 2020 in Dakota County, Minnesota.",
      "While Westman\u2019s parents signed off on the name change, her mother expressed conflicted feelings about her child\u2019s gender identity, said a former school employee who was asked what they remembered about the family. The former school employee spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity to speak freely about family issues.",
      "\u201cShe said, \u2018I don\u2019t know how I feel about this\u2019,\u201d the ex-employee said. \u201cI think she was struggling with her Catholic faith. ... She didn\u2019t know how she felt, but it weighed heavily on her.\u201d",
      "The ex-employee also remembered that Westman was often sent to the principal\u2019s office for disruptive behavior and did not seem to have any friends. Westman\u2019s mother expressed concern about her child\u2019s behavioral and social issues, the ex-employee said.",
      "Faced with punishment from school administrators, Westman appeared alternately nervous and nonchalant, the former employee said."

      "Immigration agents arrested two Mexican contractors helping to tackle a wildfire in Olympic National Forest in Washington, a supervisor who oversees the crews said Thursday.",
      "It was one of the first times federal immigration agents have been known to enter a fire zone to carry out President Donald Trump's mass deportation orders, veteran firefighters said.",
      "Two work crews, totaling 44 people, were gathered at a staging site near Lake Cushman around 9 a.m. Wednesday when federal agents appeared, crew boss David Diaz said.",
      "They were only about a mile from the Bear Gulch fire line and planned to spend the day chopping lumber, Diaz said.",
      "The cause of the fire, which started July 6, is still under investigation. It has scorched nearly 9,000 acres and was 13% contained Thursday evening, according to the incident command team.",
      "Twenty of the contract workers were Mexican, and all carried work visas and passports, he said. But federal officials arrested two of them on suspicion of being in the United States illegally.",
      "Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a statement on social media that he was \"deeply concerned about this situation with two individuals helping to fight fires in Washington state.\"",
      "Diaz immediately recognized one of the black trucks that he had seen the previous week at Walmart, where his crew had gone to pick up supplies after it arrived in Washington, he said. The truck followed him to a hardware store and then to a gas station, he said.",
      "\u201cWe saw the black truck literally do a U-turn right in front of us while we\u2019re at the store.\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just been followed the whole time.\u201d",
      "Videos recorded by Diaz and posted to social media appeared to show Border Patrol agents detaining two crew members. Other videos show crew members lined up side-by-side in front of  Border Patrol agents.",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement that the arrests followed a criminal investigation into the two contracting companies, Oregon-based Table Rock Forestry Inc. and Idaho-based ASI Arden Solutions Inc. The Bureau of Land Management, which conducted the investigation, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and CBP did not provide details.",
      "The companies also did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "BLM, which oversees 245 million acres of federal land, requested help from the U.S. Border Patrol in verifying the identities of all work crew members, immigration officials said. One of the two who were arrested had a previous order of removal on his record, they said.",
      "Contracts with the two firefighting companies were terminated, according to Customs and Border Protection.",
      "\u201cThe contract termination and enforcement action did not interfere with firefighting operations or the response to any active fires in the area, nor did it pose any danger to the surrounding community,\u201d the agency said in its statement.",
      "The enforcement action left a sour feeling among the crew members, Diaz said. They were not allowed to say goodbye to the two men who were arrested, and they were forced to stand around for about three hours while the federal agents checked their records.",
      "Diaz said all he could do was hand one of the detained men a mango cream soda.",
      "\u201cWith the private contractors, it\u2019s hard for us to even sometimes go out to a fire. I mean, we\u2019re lucky enough if we even get this kind of work,\u201d he said, adding that once a crew member is deported, it is impossible to get him back.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s already a lack of resources,\u201d he went on. \u201cWildfires could get out of hand, bigger than what anyone expects.\u201d",
      "Washington and Oregon increasingly rely on contract crews like Diaz\u2019s because of a federal firefighter shortage. Unlike California, which invests heavily in a multiagency approach that includes state, local and federal resources, the Pacific Northwest contracts to private companies to fill open slots on fire crews.",
      "The situation leaves more room for error, said Steve Gutierrez, a union representative with the National Federation of Federal Employees.",
      "\u201cThis wouldn\u2019t happen with the Forest Service,\u201d he said, which requires strict background checks, including citizenship status.",
      "That it happened during an active fire, he said, was especially concerning. Immigration enforcement actions do not usually occur near fire lines, Diaz and Gutierrez said, and Wednesday could mark a new chapter in how the Trump administration handles natural disasters.",
      "Trump this year rescinded a Biden-era policy barring immigration enforcement at so-called sensitive locations like schools and churches. That also applied to natural disasters, but it appears to have changed with the arrests Wednesday.",
      "\"This is the first time this has happened in all my 26 years\" in firefighting, Diaz said. \"They could have done this in a more humane way.\""

      "U.S. District Judge Mark Norris was alleged to have made the comment after his law clerk was shot in the chest during a carjacking on Oct. 8, five days after the federal jury convicted Bean, Haley and Smith, according to court documents.",
      "An assistant U.S. attorney contended that she recalled Norris' expressing that \u201che could not meet with any member of the Memphis Police Department to give a statement regarding the shooting of his clerk, as MPD is \u2018infiltrated to the top with gang members,'\" according to background of the case cited by Lipman.",
      "Norris, who was to sentence Bean, Haley and Smith in December, recused himself from the case on June 13. The three have not been sentenced.",
      "Lipman cited other rulings that said the due process clause of the Constitution can sometimes require a recusal even when a judge has no bias.",
      "\"What is required is 'not only an absence of actual bias, but an absence of even the appearance of judicial bias,'\" Lipman wrote, citing a past case.",
      "Lipman wrote that \"the risk of bias here is too high to be constitutionally tolerable\" and that therefore the three officers deserved new trials.",
      "Martin Zummach, who represents Smith, said Thursday, \"I think Judge Lipman did the right thing.\"",
      "Zummach said that defense lawyers learned of the comments attributed to Norris three days before sentencing had been scheduled. \"I immediately said, 'We have to get a new trial. That\u2019s the only right thing to do,'\" he said.",
      "Attorneys for Bean and Haley did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.",
      "Nichols was beaten by police officers after he was pulled over during a Jan. 7, 2023, traffic stop and he fled on foot, and officers further beat him after they caught up with him, video that captured the incident showed. He died three days later.",
      "The video, released around three weeks later, appeared to show police\u2019s aggressive, chaotic and at times inconsistent demands of Nichols \u2014 such as that he provide his hands while his arm was being held and he was being pulled to his feet. They also appear to show police punch him as he was being held.",
      "Haley was found guilty of two counts of deprivation of rights resulting in bodily injury and two counts of tampering with a witness, victim or informant.",
      "Smith and Bean were found guilty of one count of tampering with a witness, victim or informant, and they were acquitted on the three other counts against them.",
      "Zummach, Smith's lawyer, said that because Smith and Bean were acquitted of the more serious civil rights counts, they cannot be charged on those counts again at a new trial.",
      "In all, five now-former police officers were charged federally. Former police officers Emmitt Martin and Desmond Mills pleaded guilty. They have not been sentenced."

Trump framed the move as an effort to address crime in the city, despite data suggesting criminal activity was already trending downward.",

      "According to her family and attorneys, Santiago has valid DACA status, making her one of the nearly 538,000 undocumented young adults brought to the U.S. as children who are currently authorized to work and study. Under the program, DACA recipients are also supposed to be protected from immigration detention and deportation.",
      "Santiago was detained on Aug. 3. Before boarding a domestic flight at an airport in El Paso, she was approached by two men in Border Patrol uniforms. A video posted by Movimiento Cosecha shows one of them telling Santiago they needed to question her about how she obtained her work authorization.",

We were devastated.\u201d",
      "The administration of President Donald Trump has insisted DACA recipients \"may be subject to arrest and deportation\u201d because \u201cDACA does not confer any form of legal status in this country,\u201d according to Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.",

    "story": [
      "An escalating conflict over an influential vaccine committee was one of the final straws that led to the firing of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez and the exodus of other highly regarded top officials.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had repeatedly undermined the agency\u2019s independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, firing the committee\u2019s members and appointing new members, including vaccine skeptics.",
      "Early Wednesday, Monarez suggested to Dr. Richard Besser that she was going to be forced to sign off on new vaccine recommendations.",
      "\u201cShe said there were two things she would never do in the job,\u201d said Besser, a former acting CDC director and the CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. \u201cOne, in terms of firing her leadership who are talented civil servants like herself, and the other was to rubber-stamp ACIP recommendations that flew in the face of science.\u201d",
      "Hours later, Monarez was out, according to a Health and Human Services post on X. Almost immediately, several top officials resigned in protest.",
      "One of those officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who directed the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases \u2014 which oversees vaccines \u2014 wrote in his resignation letter that a particular document related to the vaccine committee \u201cignored all feedback from career staff at CDC.\u201d",
      "The document was guidance for a newly formed work group that will present Covid vaccine data and research at the upcoming ACIP meeting \u2014 scheduled for September 18 \u2014 and contained anti-vaccine talking points. The work group will be led by newly appointed ACIP member Retsef Levi, an MIT professor who has been vocally against the mRNA Covid vaccines.",
      "Daskalakis said in an interview that the new group members \u201cwere told that they have the ability to, quote, \u2018prevent CDC bias from entering the work group.\u2019 That\u2019s unheard of. I don\u2019t know what CDC bias is, because that\u2019s not what we do. Our science is unbiased.\u201d",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., the chair of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee who was a key vote in Kennedy\u2019s confirmation, said in a statement Thursday that the upcoming ACIP meeting should be postponed and called for \u201csignificant oversight.\u201d",
      "\u201cSerious allegations have been made about the meeting agenda, membership, and lack of scientific process being followed for the now announced September ACIP meeting,\u201d Cassidy said.\u201cThese decisions directly impact children\u2019s health and the meeting should not occur until significant oversight has been conducted. If the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in CDC leadership.\u201d",
      "In an interview near the agency\u2019s headquarters in Atlanta on Thursday, Dr. Debra Houry, the CDC\u2019s chief medical officer, who resigned on Wednesday, said, \u201cWe reached our tipping point.\u201d",
      "\u201cAmerica\u2019s public health is significantly in danger,\u201d Houry said.",
      "On Thursday afternoon, the White House appointed HHS deputy Jim O\u2019Neill as the new acting CDC director, according to an administration official. The appointment was first reported by The Washington Post.",
      "Hundreds of former and current CDC staffers, other public health workers and private citizens gathered outside the agency\u2019s Atlanta headquarters Thursday to show respect for the officials who resigned. In addition to Daskalakis and Houry, Dr. Daniel Jernigan, the director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, also resigned.",
      "The three made their way through the crowd of people who showed up to hug, applaud and shake their hands. Each spoke to the crowd to express gratitude for their support.",
      "\u201cWe are going to be your loudest advocates!\u201d Daskalakis said.",
      "Jernigan, who\u2019d been at the CDC for three decades, said in an interview that he\u2019d been concerned that the administration had questioned the science that had long helped the agency make decisions about treatments and vaccines. \u201cAll of those past findings were being called into question and being reanalyzed in ways that we could not understand.\u201d",
      "In an email to NBC News, one of Monarez\u2019s lawyers, Mark Zaid, said that Monarez was in Washington, D.C., at the time the Department of Health and Human Services announced her firing. Zaid declined to share details on what led up to HHS announcing her firing. He maintains that she \u201cremains\u201d director because the only person with the authority to fire her is President Donald Trump.",
      "When asked whether Monarez would pursue legal action against the Trump administration, Zaid said, \u201cWe\u2019re contemplating every available action but currently our position is she has not been properly or lawfully fired.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment on whether Trump would issue a statement on Monarez\u2019s firing.",
      "In an interview on Fox News on Thursday morning, Kennedy said he wouldn\u2019t comment on the Monarez firing.",
      "\u201cIt would be inappropriate for me to comment on a personnel issue,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWhat I will say is President Trump has very, very ambitious hopes for what, for CDC right now.\u201d",
      "Kennedy continued: \u201cThe CDC has problems. You know, we saw the misinformation coming out of Covid. They got the testing wrong. They got the social distancing, the masks, the school closures that did so much harm to the American people.\u201d",
      "The dispute between the Trump administration and CDC officials has caught the attention of lawmakers.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the ranking member on the HELP committee, urged Cassidy to convene a public hearing to hear testimony from Kennedy, Monarez and the CDC leaders who resigned in the wake of Monarez\u2019s ouster.",
      "\u201cThe American people should hear directly from Secretary Kennedy and Dr. Monarez and every member of our committee should be able to ask questions and get honest answers from them,\u201d Sanders said in a statement.",
      "On Wednesday, Kennedy announced the Food and Drug Administration would limit the availability of Covid vaccines for the fall to adults at least 65 years old or people with underlying health conditions \u2014 a decision that upset some public health experts.",
      "On MSNBC Thursday, Houry said that Monarez \u201cwas not allowed\u201d to make updates and scientific improvements to vaccine work.",
      "She said she became \u201cconcerned when Dr. Monarez was called to the secretary\u2019s office after trying to\u201d make changes.",
      "Houry criticized Kennedy\u2019s lack of visibility at the agency. When asked about his criticism of the culture at the agency, she said, \u201cThe CDC scientists are top-notch and excellent.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat we would actually have preferred was to have more interactions with the health secretary,\u201d she said. Senior leaders \u201cnever were able to brief the secretary\u201d on any of the issues the CDC deals with."

      "The two children killed in the tragic Annunciation Catholic School shooting Wednesday have been identified by family as 8-year-old Fletcher Merkel and 10-year-old Harper Moyski.",
      "\u201cYesterday a coward decided to take our 8-year-old son Fletcher away from us. Because of their actions we will never be allowed to hold him, talk to him, play with him, and watch him grow into the wonderful young man he was on the path to becoming,\u201d Jesse Merkel, Fletcher's father, said at a news conference outside the school Thursday.",
      "He said his son loved his family, friends, fishing, cooking and sports.",
      "\u201cWhile the hole in our hearts and lives will never be filled, I hope that in time, our family can find healing,\u201d Merkel said.",
      "Fletcher was the second youngest of four children in his family, according to family spokesperson Blois Olson. He and his two older siblings were attending Wednesday\u2019s Mass, and the other two who were there were not injured in the shooting.",
      "Harper was also identified Thursday by her parents, Michael Moyski and Jackie Flavin, who remembered her as a joyful child.",
      "\u201cWe are devastated to share that our beloved daughter, Harper Moyski, was tragically killed in the recent school shooting. Harper was a bright, joyful, and deeply loved 10-year-old whose laughter, kindness, and spirit touched everyone who knew her,\u201d they said in a statement.",
      "\u201cOur hearts are broken not only as parents, but also for Harper\u2019s sister, who adored her big sister and is grieving an unimaginable loss. As a family, we are shattered, and words cannot capture the depth of our pain,\u201d it continued. \u201cHarper\u2019s light will always shine through us, and we hope her memory inspires others to work toward a safer, more compassionate world.\u201d",
      "Both families shared messages of grief for the Annunciation community and gratefulness for first responders and staff.",
      "\u201cOver the past day, I\u2019ve heard many stories accounting the swift and heroic actions of children and adults alike, from inside the church. Without these people and their selfless actions, this could have been a tragedy of many magnitudes more. For these people, I am thankful,\u201d Merkel said. \u201cPlease remember Fletcher for the person he was and not the act that ended his life.\u201d",
      "He closed out his brief remarks by saying: \u201cGive your kids an extra hug and kiss today. We love you. Fletcher, you\u2019ll always be with us.\u201d",
      "Moyski\u2019s parents also shared a message demanding action to address gun violence.",
      "\u201cWe also believe it is important that her memory fuels action. No family should ever have to endure this kind of pain,\u201d their statement said. \u201cWe urge our leaders and communities to take meaningful steps to address gun violence and the mental health crisis in this country. Change is possible, and it is necessary \u2014 so that Harper\u2019s story does not become yet another in a long line of tragedies.\u201d",
      "Fifteen other children, ages 6 to 15, were injured in the shooting, as well as three adult parishioners.",
      "Two of the victims were in critical condition as of Thursday morning, a hospital official said.",
      "The shooter died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene.",
      "Joseph Thompson, acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota, said Thursday that the suspect \u201cidolized some of the most notorious school shooters and mass murderers in our country\u2019s history.\u201d",
      "\u201cMore than anything, the shooter wanted to kill children,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThe shooter was obsessed with the idea of killing children. Defenseless children.\u201d",
      "Authorities have said the shooter had three legally purchased firearms, a shotgun, a rifle and a pistol. More than 100 rifle rounds were recovered at the scene, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara.",
      "Authorities also found three shotgun rounds and one live bullet that was trapped in a handgun after it appeared to have jammed, O\u2019Hara said."

      "Hydro Flask 24-Ounce Travel Tumbler with Handle",
      "4.7-star average rating from 12,302 reviews on Amazon",
      "I keep this 24-ounce stainless steel tumbler on my desk and at home to encourage me to stay hydrated. Its double-wall vacuum insulation keeps beverages cold for hours, in my experience, and it has a flexible silicone straw to drink from, as well as a large handle to grip. The water bottle is tapered at the bottom to fit most cupholders, and you can detach the straw from the lid before throwing everything in the dishwasher.",

      "4.8-star average rating from 53,623 reviews on Amazon",
      "This hammock is attached to a storage bag you can stuff it into, making it easy to throw in your bag if you\u2019re hiking, camping or spending time at the park (I even carried mine in my backpack to use on my college campus). It\u2019s lightweight and made from durable, quick-dry, machine-washable nylon. The hammock measures 9 feet by 4.5 feet, so it can comfortably fit one person and hold up to 400 pounds without stretching or tearing, according to the brand. It comes with 9-foot tree straps and carabiners to help you set it up.",

      "4.10-star average rating from 56 reviews at REI",
      "La Sportiva sneakers are one of the \u201cit\u201d shoes this year, and while this pair is designed for trail running, you can pair them with jeans and a T-shirt, too. They\u2019re slip-ons, so they hug your feet like socks, and they\u2019re made with breathable mesh fabric as well as durable, grippy rubber soles to withstand rugged terrain if you wear them on trails. The sneakers also have a padded tongue and an interior lining to keep your feet dry during inclement weather. These shoes run small, according to the brand, so consider ordering 1/2 size up.",

I never leave home without my Counterpart charger because it makes repowering my devices so easy on the go, especially if I\u2019m at an airport or working from a coffee shop.",
      "Tiami Luxury Hybrid Mattress",
      "This hybrid mattress comes highly recommended by NBC Select commerce editor Lindsay Schneider, who has been testing it for the past few months after the brand sent her one to try. \"I haven\u2019t woken up sore or sweaty, and I\u2019ve been tossing and turning less,\u201d says Schneider. \"It feels like sleeping on air in the best way.\" The mattress comes in one firmness, with sizes ranging from full to California king.",

    "story": [
      "Warning: Major spoilers ahead for the most recent episode of \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty\u201d Season 3 ...",
      "The most recent episode of the third and final season of \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty\u201d features a shocking twist.",
      "The show's eighth episode follows its main character, Belly (Lola Tung), as she prepares to walk down the aisle and marry her childhood best friend Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno). However, a surprising revelation means the day doesn't go to plan.",
      "The couple decides not to say \"I do\" after Jeremiah accuses Belly of still being in love with his brother, Conrad (Christopher Briney).",
      "Jeremiah\u2019s change of heart is also largely due to a letter his mom, Susannah, who died several years before, wrote for him to read on his wedding day. While the letter was in an envelope addressed to Jeremiah, it is revealed during the episode that Susannah accidentally switched the letters. (Eagle-eyed viewers have spotted a moment from Season 2 in which a very sick Susannah, played by Rachel Blanchard, drops the letters she was writing, and Laurel, played by Jackie Chung, helps hastily stuff them back into their envelopes.)",
      "So the letter Jeremiah reads in the episode was actually meant for Conrad.",
      "While only visible for a couple of seconds on screen, the letter is integral in Jeremiah\u2019s decision to break off the engagement. So, what does Susannah's message say? And why does he decide not to marry Belly?",
      "What Does Susannah\u2019s Letter Say to Conrad?",
      "The letter was not read aloud during the episode, but the handwritten note is shown in full for a few seconds on screen. While some viewers paused the show to read its contents, the show\u2019s creator Jenny Han acknowledged on Instagram, \"I know some of y\u2019all can\u2019t read cursive.\"",
      "Han shared the letter\u2019s full text on Instagram Aug. 28, the day after the episode\u2019s release.",
      "Dear Conrad,",
      "I can hardly believe my little bug is getting married today! I am just bursting at the thought that my beautiful boy has found the person he wants to spend the rest of his life with.",
      "I only ever got to see you in love once, and for that I will always, always be grateful. Not just that I got to see you in love but I got to see you be loved. Oh, the way she looked at you \u2014 it was like you were the only boy in the world. As a mother, there is no greater gift than to see her child be so dearly loved by another person. Today, if there is even a fraction of the love I saw then, I am more than happy. I am overjoyed.",
      "Don\u2019t be afraid to tell her every day how very much she means to you. Cook for her, be a good listener, don\u2019t try to win every argument. Jewelry is always welcome. Pay attention to if she wears gold or silver. If she\u2019s not a jewelry girl, then chocolate.",
      "Loving you always and forever,",
      "Mom",
      "What Happens with Susannah's Letter in the Books?",
      "In the books the show is based on, also written by Han, Susannah\u2019s full letter to Conrad is never revealed.",
      "However, the scene in the show where Jeremiah reads the letter is   similar to the book. Like in the show, Conrad brings the letter to Jeremiah after he disappears on the morning of the wedding day.",
      "\u201cSwallowing, he tore the envelope open,\u201d Conrad narrates in the trilogy's third book, \"We'll Always Have Summer.\" \u201cI watched him as he read, hoping, knowing, my mom would have the right words. She always knew what to say to Jeremiah. Jere started to cry as he read, and I turned my head away.\u201d",
      "After reading the letter, Jeremiah reveals that the letter was meant for Conrad. Upset by its contents, Jeremiah tells Conrad that he is not his brother anymore and leaves. Conrad then opens the letter and sees the \u201cDear Conrad\u201d at the top. He starts to cry, and the chapter ends.",
      "Later in the book, when Jeremiah ends the engagement with Belly, he tells her what the letter said.",
      "\u201cMy mom must have mixed up the envelopes,\u201d Jeremiah tells Belly. \u201cIn the letter she said \u2014 she said she only ever got to see him in love once. That was with you.\u201d",
      "Jeremiah decides not to get married because he doesn\u2019t want to hold Belly back from Conrad, saying that she will never move on if he does.",
      "The book ends after that reveal, followed by a three-page epilogue.",
      "But the final scene of Episode 8 ends on a different note than its source material. After calling off the wedding, Belly heads to an airport and buys a ticket to Paris. While in line to board the plane, as Taylor Swift's \"Cardigan\" plays in the background, she sees Conrad. The screen fades to black and the credits roll before Conrad spots Belly, leaving fans on a slight cliffhanger before Episode 9 drops Sept. 3.",
      "With three episodes left to go, fans wonder how the remainder of the season will diverge from the books.",
      "\"we are in uncharted territory. 3 episodes to go and very very little book left,\" one viewer said on X. \"we should all be terrified.\""

They respect mostly material gain, since that is the main reason for their existence. And they have created a great respect among artists for material gain--by honoring us and exalting us when we achieve it, ignoring for the most part those of us who have not.\u201d",

Thank you for letting Silk Sonic thrive.\u201d",

      "What Artists Have Boycotted the Grammys?",
      "Despite being the most decorated rapper in Grammys history with 89 nominations and 25 wins, Jay-Z has been critical of the Recording Academy and boycotted the award show for six years.",
      "Jay-Z received his first nomination in 1998 for his third studio album, \u201cVol. 2... Hard Knock Life,\u201d which took home best rap album at the 1999 Grammy Awards. The rapper was not in attendance to receive the award, however, as he boycotted the show.",
      "During a speech at Clive Davis\u2019 annual pre-Grammy gala in 2018, Jay-Z addressed his absence that year, explaining that he didn't attend the show because rapper DMX hadn't received any nominations, the Associated Press reported.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t come back until... 2004 when a beautiful, young lady whom I love dearly had a solo album... the beautiful Miss Beyonce,\" Jay-Z said, per AP, referring to his wife. \"And I realized, \u2018Man, art is super subjective and everyone is doing their best, and the Academy, they\u2019re human like we are and they\u2019re voting on things they like and it\u2019s subjective.\u2019\u201d",
      "While he subsequently attended and performed at the Grammys over the years, Jay-Z had choice words for the Recording Academy once again in 2024 when accepting the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award.",
      "At the time, his wife Beyonc\u00e9 had never won album of the year, despite being nominated four times for her projects. (She won the award in 2025.) During his acceptance speech, Jay-Z seemingly called out the Grammys voting process.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone, and never won album of the year,\u201d he said, seemingly referring to his wife. \u201cSo even by your own metrics, that doesn\u2019t work. Think about that. The most Grammys, never won Album of the Year. That doesn\u2019t work.\u201d",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 has received 99 nominations and won 35 of those times, making her the most decorated artist in Grammys history.",
      "In 2019, Ariana Grande boycotted the Grammys after a creative disagreement with one of the award show's producers.",
      "Grande was originally set to perform hit \"7 Rings\" during the show, but Grammys producer Ken Ehrlich reportedly told her she could only sing a portion of the song during a medley they had chosen, according to Variety.",
      "At the time, Ehrlich told the AP that after the disagreements Grande \u201cfelt it was too late to pull something together.\u201d The singer responded to his remarks, however, in since-deleted tweets saying she \u201ccan pull together a performance over night and you know that, Ken.\u201d",
      "Grande shared in the Twitter thread that she opted to not attend the Grammys \u201cwhen my creativity & self expression was stifled\u201d by Ehrlich, adding, \u201ci hope the show is exactly what you want it to be and more.\u201d",
      "NBC News reported at the time that Grande later tweeted, \u201cIt\u2019s about collaboration. it\u2019s about feeling supported. it\u2019s about art and honesty. not politics. not doing favors or playing games. it\u2019s just a game y\u2019all.. and i\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s not what music is to me.\u201d",
      "Similar to Jay-Z, Grande received her first Grammy win the same year she boycotted the event.",
      "Grande, who has since accumulated 18 nominations and two wins, took home the Grammy for best pop vocal album, for \u201cSweetener.\u201d",
      "At the time, she acknowledged both the win and her absence in a since-deleted tweet.",
      "\u201ci know i\u2019m not there tonight (trust, i tried and still truly wished it had worked out tbh) and i know i said i try not to put too much weight into things .... but (expletive) ....... this is wild and beautiful. thank you so much,\u201d she shared at the time.",

      "The \u201cFresh Prince of Bel-Air\u201d actor and musical partner DJ Jazzy Jeff were nominated that year for \u201cParents Just Don\u2019t Understand.\u201d",
      "In a 1989 interview with Entertainment Tonight, Smith said they \u201cdon\u2019t have the problem with the Grammy as an award or the Grammys as an institution, we just had a problem with the 1989 design of the awards show.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe chose to boycott,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe feel that it\u2019s a slap in the face.\u201d",
      "Reflecting on their decision in a 2016 interview with ET, Smith said the Recording Academy \u201c(doesn\u2019t) know anything about rap music\u201d and clarified that the boycott the show was to \u201copen their eyes to rap music so next year, some rapper will be able to perform at the Grammys and the awards will be televised because the music is large enough and important enough to be on the show.\u201d",
      "DJ Jazzy Jeff, whose real name is Jeffrey Allen Townes, told the outlet in the 2016 joint interview that they were told \u201cthere wasn\u2019t enough time to televise all of the categories.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey televised 16 categories and, from record sales, from the Billboard charts, from the overall public\u2019s view, there\u2019s no way you can tell me that out of 16 categories, that rap isn\u2019t in the top 16,\u201d he added.",
      "In a 2014 interview with BET, Townes said the Grammys asked the musical duo to perform in the televised portion of the show, while maintaining they couldn't televise their award category.",
      "\u201cIt was almost like, you kind of want us to be the token,\u201d Townes said in the interview. \u201cThis is our contribution to hip hop on the Grammys, but it\u2019s not big enough for us to televise the category.\u201d",
      "Why Are Artists' Boycotting the Grammys Removing Themselves From Consideration?",
      "While some artist have removed their work from future considerations after past snubs, others have took a stronger stance against the Recording Academy.",
      "While Drake has been vocal about his message that a Grammy win \u201cdoesn\u2019t dictate s---- in our world\u201d as an artist, he has also made reference to his frustration with the Grammys in his music. In his 2023 collaboration with J. Cole, \u201cFirst Person Shooter,\u201d Drake boasts, \u201cI told Jimmy Jam I use a Grammy as a door stop.\u201d",
      "When The Weeknd refused to submit his work for Grammys consideration in 2021, he referred to \u201csecret committees\u201d involved in the nomination process when talking to The New York Times.",
      "In O'Connor's 1991 open letter to the Recording Academy, she wrote that they \u201cacknowledge mostly the commercial side of art. They respect mostly material gain, since that is the main reason for their existence.\u201d She added that the industry has \u201ccreated a great respect among artists for material gain--by honoring us and exalting us when we achieve it, ignoring for the most part those of us who have not.\u201d",
      "In response, per the LA Times, former president of the Academy Michael Greene, said they \u201capplaud that Sinead feels so strongly about these issues and believe that her convictions only add to the seriousness of her work,\u201d while suggesting she \u201cmay be misguided.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m afraid that Sinead may not be properly informed about the difference between the overtly commercial aspects of popularity contests as opposed to the Grammys, which are voted on by the creative community.\u201d",
      "In a later interview with LA Times, however, O\u2019Connor said, despite directing the letter to the Academy, she was \u201cnot criticizing the Grammys in particular,\u201d clarifying, \u201cI am criticizing the music industry. I am criticizing my peers . . . artists who are not doing their job.\u201d"

    "summary": "Fans have guessed that Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce may have hinted their Aug. 26 engagement to fans leading up to the big announcement.",
    "story": [
      "When Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce announced their engagement with a series of photos on Instagram, excited fans picked up on small details that felt like winks from the celebrity couple.",
      "Swift is known for dropping hints at her upcoming musical projects in her social media posts, public appearances and music videos.",
      "During her Aug. 13 appearance on her fianc\u00e9 Travis Kelce\u2019s podcast \u201cNew Heights,\u201d Swift shared that she would never use an easter egg to hint at something personal.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m never going to plant an Easter egg that ties back to my personal life. It\u2019s always going to be towards music,\u201d she said during the episode.",
      "Still, people are mining this very personal moment for clues. Here's a roundup of some popular Swiftie theories surrounding the couple's big announcement.",
      "Are the Flowers a Throwback to the 'Lover' Era?",
      "Swifties say the lush florals from the couple's engagement photos resemble flowers from one of the singer's past photoshoots.",
      "One eagle-eyed fan noted on X compared the proposal pictures to a photoshoot from Swift\u2019s romantic \u201cLover\u201d era.",
      "In the 2019 pictures, Swift is shown sitting alone in the middle of a garden in a pink sweatshirt, surrounded by pink roses.",
      "\u201ctaylor swift engagement pictures are giving lover photoshoot and I\u2019m emotional,\u201d one fan wrote on X.",
      "Some also pointed out that the pictures reminded them of a photo that music producer Jack Antonoff posted of himself fake proposing to Swift during her \"Midnights\" era. In the picture, Antonoff and Kelce stand before a floral arch \u2014 just like Kelce and Swift do in their engagement photos.",
      "Coincidence or not, the photo of Swift and Antonoff was posted on the same date as Swift\u2019s real engagement announcement, three years prior.",
      "The Announcement's Numerology, from 13 to 26",
      "On the \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast, Swift emphasized that she loves to play with numerology, specifically by referencing number 13 in her projects.",
      "She considers the number lucky largely because she was born on Dec. 13, a detail she shared early on in her career.",
      "Followers of Swift's career have often noticed that she plans important moments on dates that include the number, and it seems like her engagement was no exception.",
      "The proposal was posted on Instagram exactly 13 days after her appearance on \u201cNew Heights,\u201d fans noticed, which was aired on Aug. 13. It also was shared right at 1 p.m. ET, which is 13:00 in military time.",
      "Some Swifties also pointed out on X that the proposal was posted on the 26th of the month, which is 13 divided by two.",
      "To take the numerology clues even further, fans noticed that the announcement took place 39 days, which is 13 divided by three, before the release of her next album, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl.\u201d",
      "Some observers shared on social media that the number-related hints sprinkled throughout the announcement feels appropriate for the numerology-obsessed star.",
      "\u201cProposing on the 13th of the month WOULD make so much sense for someone proposing to Taylor Swift the queen of 13 and numerology. Also proposing on the day the podcast epi dropped seems like a romantic time to do it,\u201d one user wrote on X.",
      "Did the 'New Heights' Episode Hint at an Engagement?",
      "During an Aug. 27 episode of Travis Kelce\u2019s podcast \u201cNew Heights,\u201d which he co-hosts with his brother, Jason Kelce, Travis Kelce said that his previous episode with Swift included easter eggs.",
      "\u201cShe was having so much fun getting to tell everybody about the album and obviously drop a few easter eggs and see if everyone caught on,\u201d Travis Kelce said during the episode.",
      "He dodged sharing any more details but still left fans wondering if the Aug. 13 \"New Heights\" episode included any hints that the couple would soon be engaged.",
      "In an interview with ABC News 5 Cleveland, Travis Kelce\u2019s dad, Ed Kelce, gave insight to the timing of the engagement. He said his son proposed \u201cabout two weeks ago.\u201d",
      "\u201cTravis actually did the proposal, oh, maybe two weeks, not quite two weeks ago. He was going to put it off \u2018til this week,\u201d he said.",
      "This information has led some fans to guess that Kelce proposed after they filmed the episode.",
      "\u201cI have a theory. I think he proposed the same day as the podcast. They just did outfit changes for dinner. If you look closely you\u2019ll notice she\u2019s wearing the same bracelet, watch, and two rings on her right hand. And her nails are the same color,\u201d one fan guessed on X.",
      "Another fan noted that in the engagement photos, it looks like Swift's hair has an indent from a pair of headphones similar to the ones she wore during the podcast episode, which could mean that Kelce proposed after they finished filming.",
      "Swift's Diamond Might Look Familiar",
      "Swifties have also noticed a parallel between the shape of Swift\u2019s engagement diamond and the logo she included on the May letter announcing that she had bought back her masters.",
      "The logo, which is featured at the top of Swift\u2019s announcement, is a rectangular oval with the letters \u201cTS\u201d intertwined inside for her initials. A few Swifties have noted that the shape is remarkably similar to her engagement ring, which features an elongated cushion cut diamond.",
      "\u201cHold up a minute. I knew this ring shape looked familiar,\u201d one fan said on TikTok of the stone\u2019s resemblance to the logo from her letter. \u201cThere is no coincidence here, OK? Let\u2019s be honest,\u201d she continued.",
      "The parallel between the ring and the logo have some fans speculating that Swift was involved in planning the proposal.",
      "Other fans point out that Kelce didn\u2019t propose before Swift announced the purchase of her masters, as his haircut in the photos seems more consistent with recent appearances.",
      "So, assuming the ring was a surprise, it might not be possible that Swift knew what her ring would look like back in May.",
      "\u201cBased on his haircut, this has to be recent as he didn\u2019t cut it until the end of July at training camp,\u201d one fan guessed in the comments of the video.",
      "The Emoji in the Engagement Announcement, Explained",
      "Some have found special meaning in the emoji used by the pair when sharing their engagement.",
      "\u201cYour English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married \ud83e\udde8\u201d the caption read.",
      "Fans theorized that the dynamite represents TNT \u2014 which also could stand for \u201cTaylor and Travis.\u201d",
      "\u201cTHE DYNAMITE EMOJI BC THEYRE TNT,\u201d one Swiftie exclaimed on X.",
      "Kelce has given Swift a bracelet with the letters \u201cTNT.\"",
      "'So High School' and the Post's Caption",
      "References to high school teachers in the couple's engagement announcement have fans pondering what the duo is saying about their relationship.",
      "It might go back to the song \"So High School,\" a track off of Swift's most recent album \"The Tortured Poet's Department.\"",
      "Listeners have connected the song's lyrics to Swift's relationship with Kelce, as lines from the song seem to reference his football career. In the track, Swift sings that she \"feels so high school\" when she is with the song's love interest.",
      "\"Truth, dare, spin bottles / You know how to ball, I know Aristotle,\" Swift sings in one of the verses.",
      "Fans of the song guess what Swift's lyrical association of Kelce with high school mean to the star.",
      "\"They\u2019re in their mid 30\u2019s and he makes her feel so high school,\" one user speculated on Reddit. \"When you think of high school love, you think of first loves, of innocence and falling in love so fast. It\u2019s fun and it\u2019s sweet and that\u2019s really the essence of the song.\"",
      "\"The whole ball vs Aristotle is exactly like a cheesy teen movie from the early 2000\u2019s where the jock falls in love with the nerdy girl, kind of like in the video for You Belong with Me,\" another noted.",
      "Swift's pairing of Kelce and high school, a life stage she referenced throughout her career in tracks such as \"You Belong with Me\" and \"Fifteen,\" is also evident in the couple's engagement Instagram caption, which refers to both of them as teachers.",
      "Some say the caption references fans' inside jokes with the singer, as listeners have historically compared Swift to an English teacher due to the literary references that frequently pop up in her music.",
      "\"ENGLISH AND GYM TEACHER SHE SEES OUR TWEETS OMG,\" one fan wrote on X.",
      "\"Swifties call her the English teacher because if she hadn\u2019t been a singer/songwriter she would have been an English teacher,\"  another explained. \"I don\u2019t know where the joke originated but she does have the attitude of a teacher.\"",
      "This much is for sure: Swift, in English teacher fashion, has taught her fans to close read all everything from posts to lyrics to captions \u2014 and they are acing the assignment."

      "\u201cI would just have to say that many people could view this as a weakness, but to me personally, after everything I\u2019ve been through in my life, I view it as a strength,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo if you guys view it like that, then guess what. I\u2019m just not your cup of tea to be drinking, so don\u2019t f------ drink it.\u201d",

      "After Taylor Swift shared photos from her swoonworthy garden proposal, TODAY\u2019s Craig Melvin looked back at his own big moment leading up to \u201cI do.\u201d",
      "Speaking with Holly Palmieri, anchor of the TODAY Show Radio on SiriusXM, Craig recalled the day he proposed to Lindsay Czarniak, his wife of nearly 14 years, sharing that it wasn't quite an immediate, \"yes.\"",
      "When asked if he got down on one knee in a garden like Swift\u2019s newly minted fianc\u00e9, Travis Kelce, Craig chuckled.",
      "\u201cNot a garden,\u201d Craig shared. \u201cI did it on a boat down in Miami.\u201d",
      "The co-anchor shared that the location wasn\u2019t random. Miami was a place special to Czarniak: It was where she had worked and lived for some time before they married. Still, while Craig went all in, his plans didn\u2019t exactly go off without a hitch.",
      "\u201cIt was a surprise, and it almost didn\u2019t go well,\u201d he said. \u201cI was all fumbly, and the boat was late.\u201d",
      "Finally, when he got the chance to propose, Craig shared that Czarniak\u2019s first reaction wasn\u2019t exactly the one he\u2019d expected.",
      "\u201cThe first thing she said to me after I asked her, I had prepared this thing in my head, I kid you not \u2014\u00a0she's going to hate me for telling this story ... she said, 'I think I'm going to throw up,'\" Craig recalled.",
      "\u201cAnd in the moment, I was like, maybe I misread this. Maybe I overplayed my hand. It seems like it\u2019s been going well for a couple of years. And then she\u2019s like, \u201cNo, no, no ... yes. I just, I\u2019m just, \u2018I think I\u2019m gonna be sick.\u2019\u201d",
      "TODAY's Laura Jarrett chimed in that Czarniak was probably just \"overwhelmed.\" She also assured Craig that his now wife's unexpected response \u2014 paired with her eventual \"yes\" \u2014 actually made his story all the sweeter.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s nice to still be surprised. I think there are so few surprises anymore,\u201d Laura explained. \u201cEverything is overly scripted and overly done, and it\u2019s just nice when it\u2019s like, you didn\u2019t get to see the ring, you didn\u2019t know where it was gonna be, and it's just the two of you.\u201d",
      "\u201cThanks for making me feel better,\u201d Craig replied.",

    "summary": "Israel has approved a settlement in the occupied West Bank that would cut the territory in two, and could destroy hopes for a future Palestinian state.",
    "story": [
      "MAALE ADUMIM, West Bank \u2014 The sun-starched strip of sand and brush doesn\u2019t look like much, but if you squint, you can almost glimpse the dreamscape of a future Palestinian capital.",
      "\u201cThese spare lands mean that we can build our parliament, we can build our future institutions,\u201d Khalil Toufakji, a Palestinian expert on geography and settlement expansion, told NBC News earlier this month as he gestured across the controversial \u201cEast 1,\u201d or E1, section of the occupied West Bank.",
      "\u201cIf Israel builds here, it means that everything is finished at the same time,\u201d the 76-year-old expert on Israeli settlements said at an overlook in the Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim. \u201cThis means that Jerusalem is surrounded from everywhere. \u2026 It means that there is no Palestinian geographic continuity between the north and south.\u201d",
      "The almost 5 square miles of land may seem undesirable and the conflict around it theoretical, but both Israel and the Palestinians regard the area\u2019s fate with the same sense of urgency.",
      "So when Israeli authorities approved the development of 3,400 homes last week, ultranationalist lawmakers celebrated what they saw as the death knell for a nascent Palestinian state and an acceleration of plans for Israel to annex the whole of the West Bank.",
      "The development \u201cpractically erases the two-state delusion and consolidates the Jewish people\u2019s hold on the heart of the Land of Israel,\u201d Bezalel Smotrich, Israel\u2019s far-right finance minister, told a news conference when he announced his approval of the plans.",
      "\u201cNow they declare it clearly and they don\u2019t need to hide it,\u201d said Shawan Jabarin, the general director of Al-Haq, a Palestinian human rights organization based in the West Bank. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need philosophers and intellectuals to analyze. They speak about it themselves: \u2018This is to kill any possibility of a Palestinian state.\u2019\u201d",
      "Since the plan was tabled in the early 1990s, Israeli authorities and Jewish settlers like Smotrich have expounded upon the practical needs for new development as Jerusalem has become too crowded and environmental regulations have forbidden new building in the west of the city, which mostly belongs to Israel.",
      "But Palestinians say the area, which straddles the enormous Maale Adumim Jewish settlement and the Palestinian-majority east Jerusalem, is the only undeveloped land that might host government buildings for a new state.",
      "The construction would also split the West Bank in two, again fracturing an incipient Palestinian state already divided between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, where almost 63,000 people have been killed since Oct. 7, 2023, according to the enclave\u2019s health ministry. Israel launched its military campaign after the Hamas-led terror attacks that day, which killed 1,200 people and saw around 250 taken hostage.",
      "After almost 23 months of war, the country has faced mounting criticism about its conduct from traditional Western allies like the U.K., France and Canada, which have recently made conditional offers to recognize a Palestinian state, unless Israel revives talks to achieve that and agrees to a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "Those countries were among 21 that criticized the E1 development plans as a \u201cviolation of international law\u201d in a statement Friday. \u201cWe condemn this decision and call for its immediate reversal in the strongest terms,\u201d it read. British Foreign Minister David Lammy also called Tzipi Hotovely, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the U.K., to raise his objections.",
      "But the recognition of a Palestinian state is seen by some Israeli politicians as rewarding Hamas, leading them to view the E1 proposals as a deliberate broadside against longtime allies whose statements are increasingly drifting away from their country.",
      "\u201cIn the eyes of the right wing of Israeli politics, this is diplomatic pushback,\u201d said David Weinberg, a fellow at the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy. \u201cBut it\u2019s diplomatic pushback that\u2019s already on top of what have long been salient reasons, good reasons, for Israel wanting to build on E1.\u201d",
      "But for the Israeli right, the resounding triumph of President Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House has drowned out such protests.",
      "\u201cThe E1 plan was initiated three decades ago and it was always blocked due to American pressure,\u201d said Lior Amihai, the executive director of Peace Now, an Israeli advocacy organization. \u201cNow under Trump, they\u2019re approving it. So certainly the lack of American resistance \u2026 enabled the Israeli government to approve it.\u201d",
      "The White House did not return a request for comment from NBC News about the E1 development.",
      "Upon retaking office, Trump lifted Biden-era sanctions on Israeli settlers who had been implicated in repeated violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.",
      "In his first term, he moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and recognized all of the city as Israel\u2019s capital. Most countries consider east Jerusalem to be occupied territory and do not recognize Israeli sovereignty. Israel, which captured east Jerusalem, including the Old City, from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war, deems it as its eternal, indivisible capital.",
      "So far this year, Israel has approved 25,000 settlement housing units in the West Bank, Amihai said, far surpassing the record of 12,000 units during the whole of 2020 \u2014 a massive increase Amihai credited in part to Trump because his administration had created \u201can environment where it\u2019s easier for this government,\u201d because \u201cthey don\u2019t have to hide anything, they can say it vocally out loud.\u201d",
      "The additional units will accommodate the burgeoning growth of the 700,000 settlers the United Nations estimates already live in the West Bank in settlements widely considered illegal under international law.",
      "Even as the E1 plan slogged through decades of bureaucratic and diplomatic obstacles, Israeli officials prepared the land some of their countrymen refer to as Judea and Samaria, using the biblical term, with a clear intention to develop it.",
      "The Samaria and Judea Police District headquarters relocated there in 2008. Highways and other roadworks connecting Jerusalem and Maale Adumim\u2019s infrastructure to the same largely uninhabited land have also been installed.",
      "Once housing there is finished, Palestinian observers say the area will become closed to their community. Even those simply driving through from the Palestinian provisional capital of Ramallah to the southern West Bank town of Bethlehem will probably have to seek longer routes, they say.",
      "Such detours shouldn\u2019t preclude further agreements between Palestinians and Israelis, Weinberg said, even as he dismissed the notion of a Palestinian state under current circumstances.",
      "\u201cInstead of battering Israel, the West should be advancing realistic space-saving arrangements for Judea and Sumeria,\u201d he said. \u201cIsrael\u2019s need to build on E1 does not need to be a bar to an agreement with a serious Palestinian government.\u201d",
      "Yet the Israeli right wing has made its intentions known, Jabarin said. Such a sudden, strenuous assault on Palestinian statehood \u2014 particularly with American blessings \u2014 will require more than diplomatic rhetoric to reverse.",
      "\u201cWording there, condemnations here \u2014 it doesn\u2019t make any change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will not push Israel back in any way.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Diana, Princess of Wales, is for many a symbol of life in the 1990s. And now a time capsule she buried nearly 35 years ago has been opened, revealing a treasure trove of memorabilia.",
      "The capsule was placed inside a wall at the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London in 1991 with the help of two children who won a TV competition.",
      "It contained relics of a pre-internet-enabled age, including an early pocket TV, a Kylie Minogue CD, a solar-powered calculator and a copy of The Times newspaper.",
      "The items were decided via a competition run by the long-running British children\u2019s TV show \u201cBlue Peter\u201d \u2014 viewers were asked to decide eight things that represented life in the 1990s. Despite some moisture damage, the items were still recognizable.",
      "The box was not due to be opened until centuries had passed, but the timeline had to be drastically cut short because the hospital is demolishing existing buildings to build a new children\u2019s cancer center.",
      "The CD was the choice of David Watson, then age 11, from Devon in western England, as well as a sheet of recycled paper and a European passport.",
      "A collection of British coins, a container with five tree seeds and a snowflake hologram were the choices of Sylvia Foulkes, then age 9, from Norwich in eastern England.",
      "It's unclear what the children, who would both now be in their 40s, thought of the opening. The hospital told NBC News that it was no longer in touch with them.",
      "The hospital asked staff members either born in 1991 or already working there in 1991 to help remove the capsule.",
      "One of the latter, senior health play specialist Janet Holmes, said: \"It brought back so many memories seeing the pocket TV in there \u2014 I had bought one for my husband back in the day, for when he had a break whilst driving his coach around the country. They were very expensive then!\"",
      "Anyone born in or after the 1990s may struggle to understand that this coveted gadget \u2014 the Casio TV430 \u2014 had a 2-inch screen and a battery life of just a few hours.",
      "Minogue, the Australian singer then famous in Britain for a string of pop hits, as well as her role in the TV soap opera \"Neighbours,\" is still a major international star.",
      "CDs, however, were then relatively new: They surpassed cassettes and LPs as the leading music format in the United States only in 1991.",
      "Great Ormond Street, known as GOSH, is the U.K.\u2019s leading children\u2019s hospital and a major center for pediatric research in Europe. Diana became its president in 1989 and visited multiple times.",
      "Diana was part of the ceremony to lay the foundation stone of the Variety Club Building in 1991 \u2014 to mark it, she sealed a time capsule in the hospital's main entrance.",
      "She was following royal tradition: A former Princess of Wales, Alexandria, laid the foundation stone for an older GOSH building in 1872 and also sealed a time capsule. Curiously, however, the hospital said that capsule has still never been found.",
      "GOSH said the new cancer center \"will make it easier for clinical teams to develop kinder, more effective treatments, all delivered in a child-focused environment where children can play, learn and be with their family while at hospital.\"",
      "While the hospital is run by the taxpayer-funded National Health Service, it still has to raise money for big projects, and the 300 million-pound ($403 million) fundraising drive to build the new center is the biggest in its history."

      "What is the 2015 nuclear deal?",
      "Many countries have suspected Iran of pursuing nuclear weapons, which Iran denies.",
      "Iran reached a deal in 2015 with Britain, Germany, France, the U.S., Russia, and China \u2014 known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) \u2014 that lifted U.N., U.S. and European sanctions on Tehran in return for curbs on its nuclear program.",

      "What is Iran doing",

      "Three private Chinese companies helped China carry out one of the boldest hacking operations to date, including snooping on text messages from Kamala Harris\u2019 and Donald Trump\u2019s campaigns, according to a coalition of U.S. agencies and 12 allied governments.",
      "The operation, known as Salt Typhoon, hacked into telecommunication companies around the world, including AT&T and Verizon last year, allowing it to potentially access text and telephone communications between millions of people and track their locations.",
      "A 37-page technical report released Wednesday was signed by the FBI, the National Security Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, as well as intelligence and law enforcement bodies from Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom, among others. It said the campaign, which has been going on since 2021, also targeted government, transportation, lodging and military infrastructure networks around the world.",
      "An FBI spokesperson said in an emailed statement that Salt Typhoon has hacked more than 200 companies across 80 countries.",
      "NBC News reported in July that the Defense Department quietly concluded this year that Salt Typhoon had also broken into at least one state\u2019s National Guard network for nearly a year before it was detected.",
      "The three companies that have been helping China\u2019s Ministry of State Security in the campaign are Beijing Huanyu Tianqiong Information Technology, Sichuan Zhixin Ruijie Network Technology and Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology.",
      "While the Treasury Department sanctioned the Sichuan-based Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology over Salt Typhoon activity in January, Western governments had not previously accused the two other companies of global hacking operations.",
      "Little information about the companies is available online, and they could not be reached for comment. A spokesperson for China\u2019s embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Chinese government has denied involvement in overseas hacking activities and has accused the U.S. and its allies of similar behavior.",
      "It is remarkable that the three firms appeared to be actually functioning companies, not merely fronts for Chinese intelligence, said Dakota Cary, a China analyst at the cybersecurity company SentinelOne.",
      "\u201cWhich means the MSS [Ministry of State Security] effectively used three private companies working in collaboration to hit some of the most important collection targets on the planet,\u201d Cary told NBC News.",
      "\u201cIt is inconceivable the U.S. would ask a private company to hack Xi\u2019s phone,\u201d he added, referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
      "While Salt Typhoon does not exclusively hack telecommunications companies, it has proven remarkably adept at doing so. Its hack of AT&T and Verizon alone gave China access to phone data on more than a million people in the Washington, D.C., area.",
      "That kind of access gives intelligence agencies the potential not only to spy on phone calls and text messages, but also to track people\u2019s locations, the report found.",
      "\u201cThe data stolen through this activity against foreign telecommunications and Internet service providers (ISPs), as well as intrusions in the lodging and transportation sectors, ultimately can provide Chinese intelligence services with the capability to identify and track their targets\u2019 communications and movements around the world,\u201d it said.",
      "AT&T and Verizon have said they have removed the hackers from their systems, although they remain vulnerable to being broken into again."

    "story": [
      "Australia on Tuesday accused Iran of directing at least two antisemitic attacks in the country, expelling the Iranian ambassador to Canberra in response.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australia\u2019s domestic spy agency had \u201ccredible intelligence\u201d that Iran was behind two attacks on Jewish sites in Melbourne and Sydney last year, part of a series of what Albanese called \u201cappalling\u201d acts of antisemitism in the country since the Israel-Hamas war began almost two years ago.",
      "\u201cThese were extraordinary and dangerous acts of aggression orchestrated by a foreign nation on Australian soil,\u201d Albanese told reporters, adding that it was considered likely that Iran had directed other attacks as well.",
      "\u201cThey were attempts to undermine social cohesion and sow discord in our community,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is totally unacceptable, and the Australian government is taking strong and decisive action in response.\u201d",
      "In addition to expelling the Iranian ambassador, Australia has closed its embassy in Iran, with all of its diplomats already out of the country, Albanese said. He said the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite military force loyal to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, would also be listed as a terrorist organization.",
      "Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Esmail Baghaei, said Tuesday that the expulsion of its ambassador was \u201ctied to Australia\u2019s internal affairs\u201d and that \u201cantisemitism has no place in our culture, history or religion.\u201d He said Iran was considering the appropriate response.",

      "Albanese said the Australian Security Intelligence Organization had assessed that Iran was behind last year\u2019s Oct. 20 attack on Lewis\u2019 Continental Kitchen in Sydney and Dec. 6 attack on the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne. The two arson attacks caused significant property damage, but no injuries were reported.",
      "Australian intelligence official Mike Burgess said that while not all of the country\u2019s antisemitic incidents are tied to Iran, authorities are investigating whether Tehran was involved in other cases.",
      "No Iranian diplomats or embassy staff in Australia were involved in the attacks, he said.",
      "This is the first time since World War II that Australia has expelled an ambassador, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said, adding that the country will maintain \u201csome diplomatic lines\u201d with Tehran to \u201cadvance the interests of Australians.\u201d",
      "Australia has struggled to address a surge in antisemitic attacks on homes, schools, synagogues and vehicles since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, 2023, with a terrorist attack on Israel during which Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and abducted 251 others.",
      "The war has since killed more than 62,000 people in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, according to the local health ministry, whose numbers are considered credible by the United Nations and other international experts.",
      "Last week, the world\u2019s leading authority on hunger declared there was a famine in Gaza City, where Israel is pushing ahead with a new military offensive. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the report\u2019s findings as a \u201clie\u201d and said Israel \u201cdoes not have a policy of starvation.\u201d",

      "Albanese, who said Netanyahu was \u201cin denial\u201d about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, said this month that Australia would join a growing list of Western governments in recognizing a Palestinian state. Netanyahu responded by calling Albanese \u201ca weak politician who betrayed Israel,\u201d saying his political record had been \u201ctarnished forever.\u201d",

      "The case, involving a person who had recently traveled to El Salvador, was confirmed to be screwworm by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Maryland Health Department on Aug. 4.",
      "The Maryland Health Department said in a statement Monday that the resident has recovered \"from the infection, and the investigation confirmed there is no indication of transmission to any other individuals or animals.\"",

      "The parasite \u2014 the larva of the New World screwworm fly \u2014 can devastate cattle herds and is rife in parts of Central America and Mexico. It can destroy wildlife and even kill household pets.",
      "There were serious outbreaks in the 1980s and the 1990s in Central America, and it was eradicated at great expense, only to return in the last two years.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke L. Rollins traveled to Texas to announce a five-part plan to combat the screwworm on Aug. 15",
      "It includes plans to breed billions of sterile flies and dump them from the air over southern Texas and Mexico in the hope of stopping the parasite's spread.",
      "The sterilized male flies mate with females, but the eggs don't hatch. Eventually, the population reduces and dies out. The technique worked in the 1960s when the United States suffered its last screwworm outbreak.",
      "And the federal government may face calls to accelerate its work: When it was  first announced in June, the sterilization plan wasn't due to be operational for \"two to three years.\"",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbot, commenting on the federal government scheme, said the state agriculture industry, with its 2 million jobs, was worth $867 billion. \"All of this is at risk because of the New World screwworm,\" he said.",
      "A report from the Agriculture Department last year estimated an outbreak of screwworm could cost Texas at least $1.8 billion in livestock deaths, labor costs and medication.",
      "The little parasitic flies \u2014 also known as Cochliomyia hominivorax \u2014 have an effect that's vast and devastating but in isolation quite disgusting. The females can lay eggs in any warm-blooded animal, which then hatch, unleashing hundreds of screwworm larvae, so-called because of their sharp mouths and their burrowing being compared to the motion of a screw.",
      "Human infections can be fatal but are rare, and most cases can be treated.",
      "The Agriculture Department has said screwworms have been making their way north into Mexico from other parts of Central America. The fly is endemic in Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and some South American nations, it said.",
      "Mexico reported a case in Ixhuatl\u00e1n de Madero, Veracruz, last month, 370 miles from the Texas border, prompting Health and Human Services to immediately shut down cross-border cattle trade, following similar stops in November and May."

      "The package, which South Korean officials also refer to as MASGA, includes building U.S. shipyards, training shipbuilding personnel and maintaining U.S. Navy ships.",
      "It\u2019s a key part of the last-minute trade deal South Korea struck last month with Trump, who says he wants to revitalize U.S. shipbuilding for both economic and national security reasons. Trade and security were high on the agenda at his summit with Lee, which came amid growing tensions with China and North Korea.",
      "A White House official said before the meeting that Trump \u201clooks forward to hosting\u201d Lee and that they would \u201cdiscuss North Korea, defense posture, trade barriers, maritime security, American shipbuilding, energy dominance, and more.\u201d",
      "Trump himself injected a note of uncertainty into the day\u2019s meeting Monday by posting on Truth Social: \u201cWHAT IS GOING ON IN SOUTH KOREA? Seems like a Purge or Revolution. We can\u2019t have that and do business there.\u201d",
      "It was not clear what Trump was referring to. Later, speaking to reporters at the White House during their meeting, Trump explained that he had \u201cheard from Intel that there was a raid on churches. We\u2019re going to talk about that later.\u201d",
      "After decades of industry decline, the United States now accounts for less than 1% of the global shipbuilding sector, according to the Rand national security think tank, compared with 50% for China, 30% for South Korea and 10% for Japan. South Korean equipment, designs and knowledge could help put the United States back on the map.",

      "The shipbuilding initiative is \u201ca strategic and symbolic win\u201d for South Korea as well as the United States, said Eun A Jo, an assistant professor of government at William & Mary and director of its Asia Policy Lab.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a smart move to try and secure influence in a critical American sector while at the same time countering Chinese expansion in global maritime infrastructure,\u201d she said in a phone interview Sunday.",
      "No 'bromance' expected",
      "The White House summit is an important opportunity for Lee to advocate South Korea\u2019s interests with Trump after months of political instability created by former President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s botched declaration of martial law.",
      "Though Lee comes from a liberal party, he and Trump have much in common \u2014 both have been the subjects of assassination attempts, and both are more open to diplomacy with nuclear-armed North Korea than their predecessors.",
      "But they have very different outlooks on political, economic and foreign policy, which could make the summit challenging, said Bae Jong-chan, president of Insight K, a private think tank in Seoul.",
      "\u201cOne will not be able to expect bromance between President Lee and President Trump,\u201d he said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "The relationship has already been strained by Trump\u2019s tariffs on South Korea, the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy, which has a large trade surplus with the United States.",
      "Trump said last month that the U.S. tariff on South Korean imports would be 15%, down from the 25% he had threatened earlier. He said South Korea, which does not impose any tariffs on U.S. goods, managed to \u201cbuy down\u201d the U.S. tariff by promising $450 billion in U.S. investment and energy purchases, including the $150 billion shipbuilding fund.",
      "Jo said Lee is seeking to lock in the terms favorable to South Korea in the trade deal, which remains unwritten and largely unclear.",
      "\u201cI think he wants that to be firm and solid, to have at least some sense of predictability and stability in their economic relations,\u201d she said.",
      "Trickier are questions about South Korea\u2019s long-standing security alliance with the United States and its position on China.",
      "Trump wants South Korea to take more responsibility for its own defense, freeing up the almost 30,000 U.S. service members stationed there to focus more on containing China, Washington\u2019s biggest strategic rival.",
      "South Korea worries that such a shift could expose it more to threats from North Korea, as well as increase the chances it could be drawn into a potential U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan, the island democracy Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "Though Lee strongly supports the decades-old U.S.-South Korea alliance, he also has to balance relations with China, South Korea\u2019s main trading partner.",
      "On Sunday, a special envoy told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing that South Korea hopes to normalize relations with China after years of tension.",
      "Lee has long been vocal about his reluctance to take sides between the United States and China, and his pragmatic approach to South Korea-China relations \u201cis unlikely to sit comfortably with President Trump,\u201d Bae said.",
      "Lee makes U.S. his second stop",
      "Before he headed to Washington, Lee stopped in Tokyo for a summit with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in his first foreign visit since he was elected president in June.",
      "\u201cThat was a very deliberate and strategic move,\u201d Jo said, as the two U.S. allies seek leverage to protect themselves from Trump\u2019s vicissitudes.",
      "On his flight from Tokyo to Washington on Sunday, Lee told reporters that he had asked Ishiba for details about Japan\u2019s negotiations with the United States and that Ishiba had given \u201ca lot of very friendly advice.\u201d",
      "Lee and Ishiba, whose countries have historically been at odds, agreed at their summit to improve bilateral ties so they can better coordinate with the United States against China and North Korea.",
      "Despite interest from Washington and Seoul, North Korea has dismissed the idea of further denuclearization talks, saying Trump must accept it as a nuclear power.

    "story": [
      "Faced with a stalling peace push, Vice President JD Vance said Sunday that Russia had made \"significant concessions\" in ending its war in Ukraine.",
      "There is little public evidence, however, that Russian President Vladimir Putin has moved his ambitions an inch since launching his full-scale invasion in February 2022.",
      "Vance told NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that the Kremlin had been \u201cflexible on some of their core demands\u201d \u2014 namely recognizing \u201cthat they are not going to be able to install a puppet regime\u201d in Kyiv, and \u201cthat there is going to be some security guarantee to the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\u201d",
      "That appears at odds with Russian officials, who have spent the days since the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska pushing back on both of these points.",
      "Also on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d was Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who \u2014 while not advocating the installation of a Russian puppet \u2014 made no secret of Moscow\u2019s belief that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is illegitimate.",
      "Russia was open to Ukraine having security guarantees, Lavrov said last week \u2014 but only if the Kremlin can play a role in them, arguably rendering them useless.",
      "\"We cannot agree\" to \"resolve collective security issues without the Russian Federation. This will not work,\" he said at a news conference. \"I am sure that in the West and above all in the United States they understand perfectly well that seriously discussing security issues without the Russian Federation is a utopia, a road to nowhere.\"",
      "Far from being a new and significant concession, Lavrov made clear that the security guarantees should be based on talks held in Istanbul, in 2022.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Russia has made compromises.",
      "Despite Lavrov's trenchant remarks, there may be subtle hints that Putin is ready to do a deal \u2014 and that's without knowing what has gone on behind closed doors.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know what was said at Alaska, that\u2019s the problem,\" Mark Galeotti, the British-based director of the consultancy Mayak Intelligence, told NBC News. \"It may well be that what Vance is saying reflects what Putin said there.\u201d",
      "Though Russian officials remain steadfast, Russia\u2019s tightly controlled media have been noticeably less critical of the usually vilified Zelenskyy, he said. And academics close to the Kremlin have suggested there may be some wiggle-room to the Kremlin\u2019s demands."

      "LONDON \u2014 France has summoned the American ambassador to Paris after he wrote a letter to President Emmanuel Macron alleging that the country had not taken \u201csufficient action\u201d to combat antisemitism.",
      "France\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement Sunday that it had summoned Charles Kushner to appear Monday over his criticism, which it said was \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
      "It said that \u201cFrance firmly rejects these allegations\u201d and that French authorities have \u201cfully mobilized\u201d to combat the \"intolerable\" rise in antisemitic acts over the past two years.",
      "The French ministry said Kushner\u2019s allegations violated international law and the obligation not to interfere with the internal affairs of another country. \u201cThey also fall short of the quality of the transatlantic partnership between France and the United States and of the trust that must prevail between allies,\" it said.",
      "The episode is the latest sign of a growing divide between the United States and its longtime partners in Europe. It comes as Washington's close ally, Israel, increasingly clashes with Western countries amid fallout from its military assault on Gaza.",
      "\u201cAntisemitism has long scarred French life, but it has exploded since Hamas\u2019s barbaric assault on Oct. 7, 2023,\u201d Kushner wrote in an open letter in The Wall Street Journal on Sunday.",
      "\u201cPublic statements haranguing Israel and gestures toward recognition of a Palestinian state embolden extremists, fuel violence, and endanger Jewish life in France,\u201d added Kushner, who is Jewish.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said Sunday evening that the State Department stood by Kushner\u2019s comments, according to The Associated Press. \u201cAmbassador Kushner is our U.S. government representative in France and is doing a great job advancing our national interests in that role,\u201d he said.",
      "France said last month that it plans to recognize a Palestinian state in September, while other traditional allies of Israel, such as Australia and Canada, have said they will do the same.",
      "Last week, Macron denounced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's accusations that the move was fueling antisemitism, calling the suggestion \"abject\" and \"erroneous.\"",
      "France is home to the largest Jewish population in Europe, with an estimated 500,000 Jews, the third-largest Jewish population in the world after Israel and the United States. That is about 1% of the national population.",
      "In his letter, Kushner said that French Jews are living in fear and that Macron should act decisively to protect them, adding that he stands ready to work with French leaders across the country to \u201cforge a serious plan that addresses the roots of antisemitism and defeats it.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday, many French Jews fear that history will repeat itself in Europe,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cMr. President, I urge you to act decisively: enforce hate-crime laws without exception; ensure the safety of Jewish schools, synagogues and businesses, prosecute offenders to the fullest extent; and abandon steps that give legitimacy to Hamas and its allies.\u201d",
      "Kushner, a real estate developer, is the father of President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner. He said during his confirmation hearing in May this year that he was \u201cdedicated to building an even stronger relationship\u201d between the United States and France.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term in the Oval Office, he pardoned Kushner, who pleaded guilty years earlier to tax evasion and making illegal campaign donations."

      "Putin \u201cis ready to meet with President Zelenskyy, provided this meeting is really going to decide something,\u201d he said. \u201cTo meet, for Zelenskyy to have another opportunity to be onstage, is not what we believe is useful.\u201d",
      "Even as Trump has met separately this month with Putin, Zelenskyy and European leaders, his overtures for peace have been undermined by Russia\u2019s continued deadly strikes on Ukraine, including on a U.S.-owned factory last week.",
      "The White House is now seeking a Putin-Zelenskyy summit, but Lavrov\u2019s grievances underscored just how far apart the two sides remain.",
      "He said it was Ukraine that was hindering the peace process, along with European leaders who Lavrov said \u201cdon\u2019t want peace.\u201d",

      "Vice President JD Vance remains confident the U.S. can broker an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine despite potential hang-ups that have emerged since President Donald Trump\u2019s meeting this month with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\u201cWe believe we\u2019ve already seen some significant concessions from both sides, just in the last few weeks,\u201d Vance said in an exclusive interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Vance also weighed in on a Russian missile strike in western Ukraine overnight Thursday that hit an electronics factory owned by a U.S.-based company. Asked by moderator Kristen Welker if he was \u201cenraged\u201d by the strike, which the company said injured  several workers, Vance pivoted to a criticism of former President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Vance said of the assault. \u201cBut this is a war, and this is why we want to stop the killing. The Russians have done a lot of things that we don\u2019t like. A lot of civilians have died. We\u2019ve condemned that stuff from the get-go and, frankly, President Trump has done more to apply pressure and to apply economic leverage to the Russians, certainly, than Joe Biden did for 3 \u00bd years, when he did nothing but talk, did nothing to bring the killing to a stop. So you asked me what I\u2019m enraged by? What I\u2019m enraged by is the continuation of the war.\u201d",
      "Trump told reporters Friday that he was not happy about the strikes on western Ukraine and indicated that any peace deal between the countries could be weeks away.",
      "\u201cI think over the next two weeks, we\u2019re going to find out which way it\u2019s going to go,\u201d Trump said.",
      "During his interview with \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Vance did not characterize the strike, and a number of other issues, as long-term hindrances to peace, saying there was still plenty of room for negotiation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to eventually be successful, or we\u2019ll hit a brick wall. And if we hit a brick wall, then we\u2019re going to continue this process of negotiation, of applying leverage,\u201d Vance added. \u201cThis is the energetic diplomacy that\u2019s going to bring this war to a close.\u201d",
      "Welker then asked Vance what the pressure is on Russia if the U.S. is not \u201cimposing new sanctions.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow do you get them to a place of getting to the table with Zelenskyy and stopping to drop bombs?\u201d she asked.",
      "Vance replied by saying Trump has applied \u201caggressive economic leverage,\u201d such as \u201csecondary tariffs on India, to try to make it harder for the Russians to get rich from their oil economy.\u201d",
      "Asked by Welker if he could guarantee that the U.S. would not send troops to help enforce any peace deal, Vance reaffirmed Trump\u2019s opposition to such a deployment.",
      "\u201cThe president has been very clear,\u201d Vance said. \u201cThere are not going to be boots on the ground in Ukraine. But we are going to continue to play an active role in trying to ensure that the Ukrainians have the security guarantees and the confidence they need to stop the war on their end and the Russians feel like they can bring the war to a conclusion on their end.\u201d",
      "The interview, which aired Sunday, comes amid new, heightened tensions in the effort to end the war.",
      "On Friday, Russia\u2019s top diplomat told NBC News that no meetings between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had been scheduled, raising further doubts about Trump\u2019s ability to mediate the conflict.",
      "Meanwhile, details about security guarantees for Ukraine \u2014 and Russia\u2019s role in shaping them \u2014 remain unresolved.",
      "In the interview, Vance said he doesn\u2019t believe the Russians are stringing Trump along.",
      "\u201cI think the Russians have made significant concessions to President Trump for the first time in 3 \u00bd years of this conflict,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019ve actually been willing to be flexible on some of their core demands. They\u2019ve talked about what would be necessary to end the war.\u201d",
      "Trump, Vance added, stepped up efforts to negotiate a diplomatic solution \u201cbecause this war is not in anyone\u2019s interest. It\u2019s not in Europe or the United States\u2019 interest.\u201d",
      "While acknowledging some of the hurdles that have popped up since Trump\u2019s Aug. 15 meeting with Putin in Alaska, Vance expressed optimism that persistence would deliver results.",
      "\u201cThere are hills and valleys to the negotiations,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe sometimes feel like we\u2019ve made great progress with the Russians, and sometimes, as the president has said, he\u2019s been very frustrated with the Russians. We\u2019re going to keep on doing what we have to do to bring this thing to a close. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen overnight. I think that we\u2019re going to continue to make progress. But, ultimately, whether the killing stops, that determination is going to belong to whether the Russians and Ukrainians can actually find some middle ground here.\u201d",
      "Putin has rejected calls \u2014 including from Trump before their recent meeting \u2014 for a ceasefire.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t say they conceded on everything,\u201d Vance said in the interview, referring to Russia. \u201cBut what they have conceded is the recognition that Ukraine will have territorial integrity after the war. They\u2019ve recognized that they\u2019re not going to be able to install a puppet regime in Kyiv. \u2026 Have they made every concession? Of course they haven\u2019t. Should they have started the war? Of course they [shouldn\u2019t have], but we\u2019re making progress.\u201d",
      "Asked about disagreements surrounding how involved Russia will be in establishing security guarantees for Ukraine, Vance asserted that \u201cthere\u2019s a little bit of talking past each other here.\u201d",
      "\u201cFirst of all, we\u2019re not talking about security guarantees until after the war has come to a close,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd, of course, the Russians are going to be a part of the conversation about bringing that war to a close. So, of course, they\u2019re going to have some stake in this.\u201d",
      "The interview with Vance also touched on several domestic issues, including new congressional maps passed by the Republican-controlled Texas House of Representatives that could pad the GOP\u2019s majority by as many as five seats. The issue has become a political flashpoint, with California Democrats preparing retaliatory moves and other states aiming to redraw maps, too.",
      "\u201cAll we\u2019re doing, frankly, is trying to make the situation a little bit more fair on a national scale,\u201d Vance said of GOP efforts. \u201cThe Democrats have gerrymandered their states really aggressively. We think there are opportunities to push back against that, and that\u2019s really all we\u2019re doing.\u201d",
      "On the subject of his own political ambitions, Vance again sidestepped questions about whether he sees himself as Trump\u2019s heir apparent in 2028, when the president is term-limited.",
      "\u201cI see myself as a vice president who\u2019s trying to do a good job for the American people ... and if I do a good job, and if the president continues to be successful, as I know that he will be, the politics will take care of itself,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe can cross that bridge when we come to it.\u201d",
      "Welker asked if Vance has discussed the possibility with Trump.",
      "\u201cAs you know, the president talks about everything, and if it\u2019s in the news, the president and I have certainly discussed it,\u201d Vance replied. \u201cBut I think the president is just focused on doing a good job for the American people. He wants me to be focused on doing a good job for the American people. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll keep on doing.\u201d"
