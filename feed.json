      "A doctor accused of supplying Matthew Perry with ketamine before his death is expected to plead guilty in federal court on Wednesday",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A doctor charged with giving Matthew Perry ketamine in the weeks leading up to the \u201cFriends\u201d star's overdose death is expected to plead guilty Wednesday.",
      "Dr. Salvador Plasencia would be the fourth of five people charged in connection with Perry's death to plead guilty.",
      "Plasencia was to have gone on trial in August until the doctor agreed last month to plead guilty to four counts of distribution of ketamine, according to the signed document filed in federal court in Los Angeles.",
      "He had previously pleaded not guilty, but in exchange for the guilty pleas prosecutors have agreed to drop three additional counts of distribution of ketamine and two counts of falsifying records.",
      "Plasencia's attorneys emphasized in an email after he reached his agreement that he \u201cwas not treating Matthew Perry at the time of his death and the ketamine that caused Mr. Perry\u2019s death was not provided by Dr. Plasencia.\u201d",
      "The remaining charges can carry a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison, and there is no guarantee he'll get less, but he's likely to. Plasencia has been free on bond since shortly after his arrest in August. He will not be sentenced until a future hearing.",
      "The only remaining defendant who has not reached an agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office is Jasveen Sangha, who prosecutors allege is a drug dealer known as the \u201cKetamine Queen\u201d and sold Perry the lethal dose. Her trial is scheduled to begin next month. She has pleaded not guilty.",
      "According to prosecutors and co-defendants who reached their own deals, Plasencia illegally supplied Perry with a large amount of ketamine starting about a month before his death on Oct. 28, 2023.",
      "According to a co-defendant, Plasencia in a text message called the actor a \u201cmoron\u201d who could be exploited for money.",
      "Perry's personal assistant, his friend, and another doctor all agreed to plead guilty last year in exchange for their cooperation as the government sought to make their case against larger targets, Plasencia and Sangha. None have been sentenced yet.",
      "Perry was found dead by the assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa. The medical examiner ruled that ketamine, typically used as a surgical anesthetic, was the primary cause of death.",

      "The actor had been using the drug through his regular doctor in a legal but off-label treatment for depression, which has become increasingly common. Perry, 54, began seeking more ketamine than his doctor would give him.",
      "Plasencia admitted in his plea agreement that another patient connected him with Perry, and that starting about a month before Perry's death, he illegally supplied the actor with 20 vials of ketamine totaling 100 mg of the drug, along with ketamine lozenges and syringes.",
      "He admitted to enlisting another doctor, Mark Chavez, to supply the drug for him, according to the court filings.",
      "\u201cI wonder how much this moron will pay,\u201d Plasencia texted Chavez, according to Chavez's plea agreement.",
      "After selling the drugs to Perry for $4,500, Plasencia allegedly asked Chavez if he could keep supplying them so they could become Perry\u2019s \u201cgo-to,\u201d prosecutors said.",
      "Perry struggled with addiction for years, dating back to his time on \u201cFriends,\u201d when he became one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004 on NBC\u2019s megahit.",

      "The larger-than-life frontman of the pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath Ozzy Osbourne has died",
      "NEW YORK -- There are pioneering music figures, and then there is Ozzy Osbourne, the larger-than-life frontman of Black Sabbath, whose personal mythology is eclipsed only by the strength and immortality of his songs.",
      "A godfather and force of heavy metal, Osbourne died Tuesday at 76, just weeks after his last performance.",
      "The English icon's idiosyncratic, throaty voice launched generations of metalheads, both through his work at the reins of Black Sabbath and in his solo career. Across his repertoire, there are songs with total global ubiquity and lesser-known innovations with his unique, spooky aesthetic quality.",
      "To celebrate Osbourne\u2019s life and legacy, we've selected just a few songs that made the man, from timeless tunes to a few left-of-center selections.",
      "Read on and then listen to all of the tracks on our Spotify playlist.",
      "It would be a challenge to name a more immediately recognizable guitar riff than the one that launches Black Sabbath's 1970 megahit \u201cIron Man.\u201d It transcends the metal genre \u2014 an all-timer heard around the world and in guitar stores everywhere.",
      "One of the great Vietnam War protest songs, Black Sabbath's \u201cWar Pigs\u201d is a rare moment where hippies and metalheads can agree: \u201cPoliticians hide themselves away / They only started the war / Why should they go out to fight?\u201d Osbourne sings in the bridge.",
      "Osbourne's heaviest performances are at least partially indebted to Black Sabbath's bassist and lyricist Terry \u201cGeezer\u201d Butler, and there is perhaps no better example than \u201cChildren of the Grave,\u201d the single from the band's 1971 album, \u201cMaster of Reality.\u201d \u201cMust the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?\u201d Osbourne embodies Butler's words, a sonic fist lifted in the air. \u201cCan they win the fight for peace or will they disappear?\u201d",
      "Black Sabbath were in a creative rut in the time period leading up to \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath,\u201d the opening track from their 1973 album of the same name. It's almost hard to believe now \u2014 the song features one of their best-known riffs, and its chorus features some truly ascendant vocals.",

      "Another classic cut from Osbourne's debut solo album, \u201cBlizzard Of Ozz\u201d \u2014 released one year after Osbourne was fired from Black Sabbath for his legendary excesses, \u2014 the arena rock anthem \u201cMr. Crowley\u201d pays tribute to the famed English occultist Aleister Crowley and features Deep Purple's Don Airey on keyboard.",
      "The title track and coda of Osbourne's second solo studio album, \u201cDiary of a Madman,\u201d runs over six minutes long, features big strings and a choir so theatrical it sounds like they're scoring a medieval war film. He wanted big, he wanted dramatic, and he nailed it.",
      "It wouldn't be inaccurate to call \u201cMama, I'm Coming Home\u201d a beautiful-sounding song. It's unlike anything on this list, a power ballad featuring lyrics written by the late Mot\u00f6rhead frontman Lemmy and a welcomed deviation.",
      "When Black Sabbath comes to mind, most fans jump to an unimpeachable run of albums released in the '70s and early \u201980s. But \u201cI,\u201d a cut from Black Sabbath's too often overlooked 16th studio album, \u201cDehumanizer,\u201d is worth your ear. And not only because it is the first Sabbath album to feature singer Ronnie James Dio and drummer Vinny Appice since 1981's \u201cMob Rules,\u201d though that's an obvious plus.",
      "Late in life Ozzy Osbourne was generous with his time and talent, often collaborating with younger performers who idolized the metal legend. One such example is Post Malone's \u201cTake What You Want,\u201d which also features the rapper Travis Scott. Osbourne gives the song a necessary gothic edge \u2014 validating the otherwise balladic song's use of a sprightly guitar solo.",

Payne died in October after falling from a hotel balcony in Argentina, not long after the show\u2019s production wrapped.",

      "The first batch of episodes premiered in early July and the last few episodes, including the finale, will drop Wednesday. The show ultimately follows six bands working to develop their group sound and performances \u2014 until only one band is left standing, winning the $500,000 prize.",
      "The show is hosted by McLean, with Pussycat Dolls frontwoman \u2014 and newly minted Tony winner \u2014 Nicole Scherzinger mentoring the bands and Destiny\u2019s Child star Kelly Rowland serving as a guest judge alongside Payne.",
      "The series opened with a dedication to Payne and his family, in which McLean said they \u201cnever imagined we'd soon be saying goodbye to our friend\u201d while filming the show.",
      "Payne first appears in the seventh episode for the showcase, where each band performs in front of a live audience and the judges, only about a week after they form.",
      "\u201cWe were amazing dancers, obviously, in One Direction,\u201d Payne joked in the episode while offering critiques to boy band Midnight \u2019til Morning, whose members expressed hesitations with dancing onstage. Band member Mason Watts then revealed his family had won tickets to sit front row at a One Direction concert when he was 11, stoking applause from the crowd and a heartfelt response from Payne.",
      "\u201cEver since that moment, I wanted to be in a group,\u201d Watts, originally from Australia, said in the episode. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a full-circle moment to be here with a group and performing in front of you. So, thank you, man.\u201d",

      "The decision to pull U.S. funding and participation from UNESCO comes two years after the Biden administration rejoined following a controversial, five-year absence that began during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term. The White House cited similar concerns as it did in 2018, saying it believes U.S. involvement is not in its national interest and accusing the agency of promoting anti-Israel speech.",
      "The decision, which won't go into effect until December 2026, will deal a blow to an agency known for preserving cultural heritage through its UNESCO World Heritage Sites program \u2014 which recognizes significant landmarks for protection, ranging from the Taj Mahal to Egypt's pyramids of Giza and the Grand Canyon National Park. The agency also empowers education and science across the globe.",
      "It is the Trump administration\u2019s latest move to pull support for U.N. agencies under a larger campaign to reshape U.S. diplomacy. Under the \"America First\" approach, the administration has pulled out of the U.N. World Health Organization and the top U.N. human rights body, while reassessing its funding for others. This has left the U.N., which is in the process of its own massive overhaul, reevaluating core programs and initiatives and what the international body would look like without support from the U.S. \u2014 its largest donor.",

      "She added that UNESCO\u2019s decision in 2011 \u201cto admit the \u2018State of Palestine\u2019 as a Member State is highly problematic, contrary to U.S. policy, and contributed to the proliferation of anti-Israel rhetoric within the organization.\u201d",

      "The NBA Summer League in Las Vegas has become more than just basketball",
      "LAS VEGAS -- While Bronny James and other young talent were lighting up the NBA Summer League court in Las Vegas, another game was being played just a few steps away: One with scripts, storyboards and studio buzz.",
      "Inside the Thomas & Mack Center, just as the league wrapped up Sunday, a different kind of crowd formed. Hollywood execs, producers and curious power players were slipping away from the basketball action to catch a slate of 34 film projects created by NBA stars past and present.",
      "More than just film screenings, it\u2019s an emerging playground where sports and the art of storytelling collide. From baseline to backlot, the Summer League Film Festival is generating off-court buzz \u2014 with the likes of Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett, actor-producer Mark Wahlberg and filmmaker Deon Taylor joining the mix. Conversations are building on turning this three-day showcase into a launchpad for athlete-filmmakers, backed by film industry veterans who understand both the creative and business sides of shaping ideas and grooming projects for the screen.",
      "\u201cThis definitely has legs,\u201d said retired NBA player Stacey Augmon after previewing \u201cUNLV: Kings of Vegas,\u201d a documentary chronicling the untold story of the Runnin\u2019 Rebels in the Strip View Pavilion. A 10-minute clip was screened before a packed audience, including Sundance Film Festival director Michelle Satter and production companies like the Wahlberg co-owned Unrealistic Ideas and Alcon Entertainment, the company behind \u201cThe Book of Eli\u201d and \u201cBlade Runner 2049.\u201d",
      "Like other entries, the \u201cKings of Vegas\u201d team showcased select footage, including interviews with high-profile names such as Snoop Dogg, Chuck D and Jimmy Kimmel, alongside UNLV legends Augmon, Larry Johnson, Greg Anthony and others. After the screening, the producers and cast discussed the film\u2019s origins, drawing a standing ovation from the crowd.",
      "The documentary remains in development, but Augmon says the film festival is already proving its worth.",
      "\u201cThis gives us another great avenue,\u201d said Augmon, who played on the Runnin' Rebels team that won the 1990 NCAA championship before his 15-season NBA career. His college teammate, Anderson Hunt, said sharing their authentic, real-life stories offer a major advantage like never before, unlocking new pathways to getting their projects financed and sold.",
      "\u201cWe have control of what's coming out,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cPeople might know about our stories through the internet. But stuff like this takes our platform to the next level. This is great for us, and Deon is like a golden child.\u201d",
      "The festival spotlighted stories produced by NBA stars past and present including Nikola Jokic, Luguentz Dort, Tony Allen, Nate Robinson, Kyle Anderson, Cole Anthony, Keyon Dooling and Udonis Haslem.",
      "Deon and Roxanne Avent Taylor of Hidden Empire Film Group were tapped to infuse the festival with seasoned filmmaking expertise, helping bridge the worlds of sports and entertainment. He played a key role in encouraging Hollywood insiders to show up, especially during the NBA Summer League's final stretch to keep the closing days as enticing as opening week.",
      "Taylor credited NBA Summer League co-founder Albert Hall for having the foresight to spark the collaboration.",
      "\u201cThis is all invaluable,\u201d said Hall, who cofounded the league with Warren LeGarie in 2004. \u201cThe players make money, no doubt about it. They invest in these projects. But they don\u2019t really know what the system can provide or how to approach it. Kind of like a young executive getting into the sport or a young player trying to be seen and get exposure. It\u2019s the same way. They have to be coached up.\u201d",
      "Hall said the partnership with Hidden Empire was a natural next step following their successful collaboration with the NFL and Skydance Sports, where they led film training sessions in March for more than 20 current and former NFL players. He added that having Wahlberg and Archie Gips of Unrealistic Ideas on board brings more industry muscle to strengthen the initiative and help drive it forward.",

      "Sundance already has an existing partnership with Taylor\u2019s Hidden Empire. She called the opportunity to collaborate on this new venture both exciting and aligned with Sundance\u2019s mission to uplift emerging voices in storytelling.",
      "Satter's late son, Michael Latt, had his documentary short \u201cHoops, Hopes & Dreams\u201d premiere at Sundance early this year. She said Sundance gets about 15,000 short film submissions each year, but there\u2019s room for compelling storytelling that opens up new perspective from an athlete\u2019s lens.",

      "Oliver spotlighted Minor League Baseball promotions and alternate nicknames during \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d on May 4. At the end of the segment, Oliver invited teams to send in proposals on why they should get rebranded by the show's staff.",
      "Forty-seven teams sent in pitches, including the Erie SeaWolves, the Double-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers.",
      "Erie president Greg Coleman sent a list of 11 reasons why they were the perfect candidate, including: \u201cThe SeaWolves play baseball nowhere near the sea.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo have so many teams expressing interest was really edifying. I think it kind of validates the fact that we thought there was something special about minor league baseball. We thought this would be a group of people that would respond to the ludicrous idea that we had,\u201d Oliver said.",
      "Erie was announced as the winner on May 18. After six weeks of research by Oliver and his staff, the Moon Mammoths were unveiled on June 29. That included the mascot named Fuzz, a purple woolly mammoth wearing a space helmet.",
      "\u201cErie did stand out to us as being, you know, uniquely eccentric. And I say that as both a compliment and an insult, which is the biggest compliment there is,\" Oliver said. \u201cThere was something about the Moon Mammoth that spoke to us for being particularly odd. It felt like it could make a baseball team's theme. You could almost see the logo in your head and it felt like something to be extra surprising.\u201d",
      "That this came together in less than three months is a minor miracle. It usually takes 16 months for a team to have an alternate identity approved and then take the field.",
      "\u201cI thought we had a good chance when I sent it in. And then when we were selected it was a little surreal,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cAnd since then working with the \u2018Last Week Tonight\u2019 team, they've been wonderful and detail oriented.\u201d",
      "The Moon Mammoths name was inspired by George Moon, who found the bone of a prehistoric mammoth while scuba diving in 1991. The remains are housed at the State Museum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg.",
      "Moon has become a regional celebrity since the rebranding was announced. He was at the game and caught the ceremonial first pitch from Oliver.",

      "Coleman said that since the Moon Mammoths were unveiled, the team has done the equivalent of four years' of online sales in three weeks. The line of people waiting to get into the team store, which was located in left field, stretched out to near home plate in the concourse area.",
      "Karyn Drombosky and Sean Mizerski drove from Pittsburgh and were wearing homemade tusks as they waited to get into the team store.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just great. We\u2019re big baseball fans. We see the Pirates all the time, and minor league games are fun. There\u2019s so much silliness,\u201d Drombosky said. \u201cWe watch John Oliver pretty regularly. We were like surprised but excited when we saw he picked the Erie team to take over.\u201d",

      "Erie trailed 6-3 going into the bottom of the ninth but got within one run on Kevin McGonigle's two-run double. Chesapeake's Yaqui Rivera struck out Josue Brice\u00f1o with the bases loaded to end the game.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere was great. Everything worked smoothly. It doesn\u2019t happen very often in minor league baseball to be able to have an event like that. It was a fun night for everyone,\u201d Erie manager Andrew Graham said.",
      "The Moon Mammoths will be back on Aug. 19 as well as Sept. 12 and 13. Coleman said there will be at least four Moon Mammoths games next season.",
      "\u201cI love minor league baseball. There is a special eccentricity to it,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cIt felt like a nice fit with our show because minor league baseball, as you know, is willing to try anything. That was proven by the fact that over half the league was willing to sight unseen, rebrand and put their trust in the hands of a group of people who are objectively untrustworthy. That\u2019s a bad decision, and it\u2019s that kind of bad decision making that I love about minor league baseball.\u201d",

      "Roger Norrington, a conductor acclaimed for historically informed performances during more than a half-century leading orchestras in Europe and the United States, has died. He was 91.",
      "Norrington died Friday at his home, his son Tom said Saturday. Norrington lived outside Exeter, England.",
      "Norrington conducted both period-instruments and modern orchestras, asking both types to play without vibrato and usually at faster tempi than modern practice.",
      "\u201cHe was an extraordinary dramatist. He made things happen emotionally,\u201d Myron Lutzke, an Orchestra of St. Luke\u2019s cellist who helped persuade Norrington to become music director, said Saturday. \u201cHe had his detractors, certainly, and some of them were some of my best friends. But for me, he got the music off the page. He made the concert experience transformative.\u201d",
      "Born on March 16, 1934, Norrington was the son of Arthur, president of Trinity College, Oxford, and the former Edith Carver. A violinist and boy soprano in his youth, Roger attended The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, Dragon School, Westminster School, Cambridge and the Royal College of Music, where he studied under conductor Adrian Boult.",
      "In 1962, Norrington founded the Sch\u00fctz Choir, originally dedicated to the works of Heinrich Sch\u00fctz. He became music director of Kent Opera from 1969-84, the Bournemouth Sinfonietta from 1985-89 and New York's Orchestra of St. Luke's from 1990-94.",

Smoking is now going, so maybe vibrato will too. ... I have discovered, all the way from Monteverdi to Mahler, is that when music is played as it should be, the sound is wonderful, the expression is wonderful and the instruments match together.\u201d",
      "Norrington was nominated for four Grammy Awards and won in 2001 for a recording of Nicholas Maw's Violin Concerto with Joshua Bell and the London Philharmonic. Norrington retired after conducting the Royal Northern Sinfonia in an all-Hadyn concert on Nov. 18, 2021.",

      "Coldplay's concert at Gillette Stadium on Wednesday took an unexpected turn when a couple caught on the jumbotron sparked debate online",
      "LONDON -- It started out as a routine bit of fun at a Coldplay concert: Lead singer Chris Martin asked the cameras to scan the crowd for his \u201cJumbotron Song,\u201d when he sings a few lines about the people the camera lands on.",
      "At a concert at Gillette Stadium in Massachusetts on Wednesday, a man wearing a birthday sash was up first. Two people in banana costumes were highlighted.",
      "But in between, something else ensued. For several seconds, a couple was shown on the big screen. They were cuddling and smiling, his arms wrapped around her, as she leaned back into him. When they saw themselves on the big screen, her jaw dropped, her hands flew to her face and she spun away from the camera. He ducked out of the frame, as did she.",
      "\u201cEither they\u2019re having an affair or they\u2019re just very shy,\u201d Martin joked.",
      "But it didn't end there. The video went viral, and the internet got to work.",

      "But internet sleuths allege he is the chief executive officer of a U.S.-based company, while she is the chief people officer \u2014 in other words, the head of human resources.",
      "A spokesman for the company did not respond when asked to confirm the identities of the people shown on camera. But he said in an email that a statement circulating online that was attributed to the chief executive was a \u201cfake from a clearly labeled parody account.\u201d The company later released a statement saying it had opened an investigation into the incident, but did not directly identify the employees.",
      "The woman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on LinkedIn. The man's LinkedIn page appeared to be deactivated, and no other way of contacting him could be immediately found. A phone call to a number listed in an online directory under his name went straight to voicemail. Attempts to reach him through other numbers associated with his name in the directory were not successful.",
      "A representative for Coldplay said the band had no comment.",
      "It\u2019s easy to miss, but most concert venues have signs informing the audience that they could be filmed during the event. Look for them on the walls when you arrive and around the bar areas or toilets. It\u2019s common practice especially when bands like to use performances for music videos or concert films.",

      "Hyuk, who lived in North Korea\u2019s North Hamgyong Province until age 12, defected to the South in 2013. His journey to K-pop stardom began while working in a factory in South Korea, where a chance encounter with the CEO of a music label eventually led to weekend rap lessons in Seoul.",

      "In Alaska, a public radio station general manager took a moment from a busy day warning her community about a possible tsunami for a special task \u2014 sending a text message to Sen. Lisa Murkowski urging her to vote against a measure to strip federal fund...",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Lauren Adams, general manager for KUCB public radio in Unalaska, Alaska, didn't have much time to reflect on Congress, 4,000 miles away, stripping federal funding for public media this week. She's been too busy working.",
      "Sirens blared in the Aleutian Islands community Wednesday warning of a potential tsunami, with a voice over public loudspeakers urging the community's 4,100 residents to seek higher ground immediately and tune into the radio \u2014 to Adams' station.",
      "At the same time in Washington, the Senate was voting on a measure that would eliminate nearly $1.1 billion that had already been appropriated for NPR and PBS \u2014 a process that didn't end until early Thursday morning. The House completed the process in time for President Donald Trump to sign it before a Friday deadline.",
      "Trump had called for the cuts, saying public media's news programming was biased against him and fellow Republicans, and threatened GOP members of Congress with primary challenges if they didn't fall in line.",
      "Adams, her news director, a reporter and an intern kept broadcasting and updating KUCB's social media feed until the danger passed. Then she made time for one more task \u2014 texting U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski and urging her to vote against the bill. Murkowski was one of two Republican senators, along with Susan Collins of Maine, to publicly dissent.",
      "\u201cI thought that it was such a telling story of why her constituents have a different relationship to public radio than maybe some other regions of the United States,\u201d Adams said.",
      "The federal money is appropriated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes it to NPR and PBS. Roughly 70% of the money goes directly to the 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations across the country, although that's only a shorthand way to describe its potential impact.",
      "The cuts are expected to weigh most heavily on smaller public media outlets away from big cities, and it's likely some won't survive. Katherine Maher, NPR's president and CEO, estimated as many as 80 NPR stations may face closure in the next year. Some stations are already fielding offers from commercial entities to buy their broadcast licenses, she said.",
      "\u201cMany of our stations which provide access to free unique local programming and emergency alerts will now be forced to make hard decisions in the weeks and months ahead,\u201d said Paula Kerger, PBS president and CEO. \u201cThere is nothing more American than PBS. Despite today's setback, we are determined to keep fighting to preserve the essential services we provide to the American public.\u201d",
      "The measure will cost PBS and NPR stations in Mississippi roughly $2 million, about 15% of the budget, said Royal Aills, executive director of Mississippi Public Broadcasting.",
      "Already, Mississippi Public Broadcasting has decided to eliminate a streaming channel that airs children's programming like \u201cCaillou\u201d and \u201cDaniel Tiger's Neighborhood\u201d to the state's youngsters 24 hours a day, said Taiwo Gaynor, the system's chief content officer.",
      "\u201cThis is important for families, to have access to content that they don't have to pay for,\u201d Gaynor said. \u201cThat is a sad thought, to think that we ... might not be able to provide that for a generation of children.\u201d",
      "Maine\u2019s public media system is looking at a hit of $2.5 million, or about 12% of its budget, for the next fiscal year, said Rick Schneider, president and chief executive officer of Maine Public. He said he\u2019s not ready to identify specific cuts, but the system is preparing to reinvent itself to make certain it continues serving the state\u2019s residents.",
      "Maine\u2019s rural residents rely heavily on public media for weather updates and disaster alerts, said Molly Curren Rowles, executive director of ACLU of Maine. Rowles said public media was a \u201clifeline\u201d to her growing up off the grid.",
      "NPR's Maher fears what the cuts might mean for the system's journalism, not just in rural areas where local news can be hard to come by, but in telling the rest of the country what is going on there. Less funding will also mean less support for popular television and radio programming, although it's too soon to tell which programs will be affected.",
      "NPR stations also use millions of dollars in federal money to pay music licensing fees. Now many will have to renegotiate these deals, which could mean less music, or a more limited variety of music, on outlets where music discovery is a big part of their identity. For example, Maher estimates that some 96% of all classical music broadcast in the United States is on NPR stations. \u201cThat is essentially taking an entire art form out of public access,\u201d she said.",

      "But donations aren't going to fill the hole left by the loss in federal funding, Maher said. The public media leaders have already turned to lobbying Congress to restore some of the funding through the appropriations process for next year's budget. They don't know how much time they have; Maher said it would be inordinately costly, and perhaps prohibitive, to reopen a radio station that is forced to close.",

      "The 1950s and \u201960s pop singer Connie Francis died Thursday at 87",
      "Connie Francis was a giant of 1950s and '60s sugary-sweet pop, notching more than a dozen hits. In the months leading up to her death, announced Thursday, she experienced one more in \u201cPretty Little Baby,\u201d which has become a viral hit on TikTok six decades after its release.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 22.5 million TikTok videos have been created using the sound, often partnering videos of baby animals, toddlers, makeup tutorials and retro fashions. According to TikTok, those videos have amassed more than 45.5 billion views, globally. Celebrities like Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian and North West have used it, too, with West lip-syncing along to the track.",
      "Hooky, feel-good pop songs tend to do well on TikTok, and 1962's \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d is an exemplar of that phenomenon. Users gravitated toward the song's wholesome simplicity, sweet vocals, delicate organ and upstroke riffs. \u201cYou can ask the flowers / I sit for hours / Telling all the bluebirds / The bill and coo birds / Pretty little baby, I\u2019m so in love with you,\u201d Francis swoons on the verse that has picked up steam on the platform.",
      "And all of this has transpired in mere months: According to Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d was earning just over 17,000 on-demand audio streams in the U.S. during the week ending April 10. A month later, that number had climbed to 2.4 million. That\u2019s a growth of over 7,000%. The song has earned over 29 million streams this year so far.",
      "In one popular video, which garnered over 56 million views, a user posted about baby teething hacks for first-time moms. Another user, Amari Goins, posted a video, with over 112 million views, of her 2-year-old daughter singing along to the lyrics, noting that her toddler picked up the song because of how often they heard it on TikTok.",
      "Most recently, TikTok users have begun posting covers of \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d as part of a singing challenge, where they exaggerate Francis' performance with their own stylized vocal runs. Francis, who died at 87, herself joined TikTok as a result of her song's popularity, and her first two videos \u2014 which earned 16.3 million and 31.2 million views, respectively \u2014 furthered engagement.

      "\u201cTo think that a song I recorded 63 years ago is captivating new generations of audiences is truly overwhelming for me,\u201d Francis said in that first post, which she followed with a clip of herself lip-syncing to the song.",
      "For decades, the song lived in relative obscurity \u2014 written by Don Stirling and Bill Nauman for Francis, it was never a single and was originally released in the U.K. as the B-side of her 1962 single \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be Warm This Winter.\u201d It appears on her album \u201cConnie Francis Sings \u2018Second Hand Love,\u2019\u201d released the same year. More than 60 years later, the song reached No. 20 on Billboard's Digital Song Sales chart in June 2025 and hit both the Hot 100\u2019s Bubbling Under chart and the Billboard Global 200.",
      "In Francis' last TikTok video, posted late last month, she thanked the \u201cmany wonderful artists\u201d who paid tribute to her, and all the users who sang along with her.",

      "The TikTok popularity of \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d prompted her label Republic/UMe Records to reissue versions Francis had sung in French, German, Italian, Spanish and Swedish in 1962.

      "In May, as the song took off, Francis thanked TikTok and its users for \u201cthe wonderful, and oh so unexpected, reception\u201d in a Facebook post.",

      "The Aug. 6 performance of \u201cHamilton\u201d at Broadway\u2019s Richard Rodgers Theatre is expected to raise about $3 million for the Immigrants: We Get the Job Done Coalition, 14 nonprofits ranging from the Hispanic Federation and National Immigration Law Center to the Haitian Bridge Alliance and the Tahirih Justice Center. The donation will come from Miranda, the Miranda Family and Miranda Family Fund, and the \u201cHamilton\u201d cast.",
      "It seemed like a fitting tribute to \u201cHamilton\u201d and its inspiration, Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, Miranda told The Associated Press, though he recognizes that Hamilton wouldn\u2019t have called himself an immigrant.",
      "\u201cHis narrative in our country kind of mirrors that of an immigrant story,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cHe did not grow up here. He didn\u2019t come from England. He came from the Caribbean, escaping harsh circumstances. And he really helped shape this country.\u201d",

Even the audience will be \u201cstacked,\u201d he said, since every actor who has ever performed during the show's Broadway run will be invited to be in the audience to watch the show\u2019s current Broadway cast that night. \u201cWe\u2019re working on something special for the curtain call and another nice special thing after that,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cThat\u2019s about all I can say.\u201d",
      "The bulk of the invites have gone to winners selected from a Prizeo sweepstakes, where entrants donated at least $10 to the Immigrants coalition. A few dozen VIP packages, ranging from $2,500 to $10,000, will be available Thursday through the Hispanic Federation, with proceeds also going to the coalition.",
      "\u201cOne of America\u2019s greatest exports -- at least for me growing up -- was the immigration narrative,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cSo many people I know\u2026 came to this country from somewhere else seeking a better life and then helped make this country better by being here. And I believe that\u2019s one of the greatest promises, one of greatest things about the American experiment, and I\u2019ll continue to fight for that and support organizations that are helping that cause.\u201d",
      "And the organizations that will benefit from the donations generated by the \u201cHamilton\u201d 10th anniversary, better known as #Hamilten, say the donations and encouragement are sorely needed now.",
      "Since the start of his second term, President Donald Trump swiftly moved to make good on \u201cMass Deportation Now!\u201d promises from his campaign.

      "Hispanic Federation President and CEO Frankie Miranda, no relation to Lin-Manuel Miranda, said he is heartened by the more than 125,000 people who have donated to the \u201cHamilton\u201d fundraiser. \u201cI think it is the beginning of what could be an incredible movement of philanthropy and individual donors basically saying, \u2018Enough is enough\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have seen it also in the different demonstrations of people around the country where they are expressing their concern and their frustration out in the streets.\u201d",
      "Hispanic Federation has already lost millions in federal funding, as the Trump administration cuts support for workplace development initiatives and environmental justice work, Frankie Miranda said. He has also seen some corporations withdraw their financial support because they fear reprisals from the Trump administration. \u201cWe need bold ideas like \u2018Hamilton\u2019 where everybody feels that they can stand behind it,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same reason why that No Kings protest vastly outnumbered the military parade happening on the same day,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are still a lot of people who believe in basic decency and treating people who come here -- often from really tough situations -- with humanity.\u201d",

      "Navarro, drummer Stephen Perkins and bassist Eric Avery sued Farrell in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking at least $10 million, alleging that Farrell's behavior on the tour had ranged from erratic to out-of-control, culminating in the assault, where Perry punched Navarro both on stage and backstage.",

      "\u201cNavarro, Avery and Perkins apparently decided,\u201d the lawsuit says, \u201cthat Jane\u2019s Addiction\u2019s decades of success should be jettisoned in pursuit of a yearslong bullying campaign against Farrell involving harassing him onstage during performances, including, among other tactics, trying to undermine him by playing their instruments at a high volume so that he could not hear himself sing.\u201d",
      "The Farrells said that Navarro and Avery actually assaulted them.",
      "Perry Farrell said he was \u201cblindsided\u201d when the other members canceled the remaining 15 shows of the tour and broke up the band without consulting him, costing all of them a great deal of money.",
      "And he said his bandmates defamed him by publicly saying after the fight that he had mental health problems.",

      "The U.S. is developing new safeguards for the organ transplant system after a government investigation found a Kentucky group continued preparations for donation by some patients who showed signs of life",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. is developing new safeguards for the organ transplant system after a government investigation found a Kentucky group continued preparations for organ donation by some patients who showed signs of life, officials told Congress Tuesday.",
      "While the organ removals were canceled, near misses that some lawmakers called horrifying should never happen. A House subcommittee asked how to repair trust in the transplant network for potential organ donors and families -- some of whom have opted out of donor registries after these cases were publicized.",
      "\u201cWe have to get this right,\u201d said Rep. Brett Guthrie, a Kentucky Republican who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee and whose mother died waiting for a liver transplant.",
      "\u201cHopefully people will walk away today knowing we need to address issues but still confident that they can give life,\u201d Guthrie said, adding that he will remain a registered organ donor.",
      "The hearing came after a federal investigation began last fall into allegations that a Kentucky donation group pressured a hospital in 2021 to proceed with plans to withdraw life support and retrieve organs from a man despite signs that he might be waking up from his drug overdose. That surgery never happened after a doctor noticed him moving and moaning while being transported to the operating room \u2014 and the man survived.",
      "Lawmakers stressed most organ donations proceed appropriately and save tens of thousands of lives a year. But the federal probe \u2013 concluded in March but only made public ahead of Tuesday\u2019s hearing -- cited a \u201cconcerning pattern of risk\u201d in dozens of other cases involving the Kentucky group's initial planning to recover someone's organs.",
      "The report said some should have been stopped or reassessed earlier, and mostly involved small or rural hospitals with less experience in caring for potential organ donors.",
      "The Kentucky organ procurement organization, or OPO, has made changes and the national transplant network is working on additional steps. But notably absent Tuesday was any testimony from hospitals \u2013 whose doctors must independently determine a patient is dead before donation groups are allowed to retrieve organs.",
      "Here's a look at how the nation's transplant system works.",
      "More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list and about 13 a day die waiting, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.",
      "Only about 1% of deaths occur in a way that allows someone to even be considered for organ donation. Most people declared dead in a hospital will quickly be transferred to a funeral home or morgue instead.",
      "Several groups are involved in every transplant: the hospital caring for someone dead or dying; the 55 OPOs that coordinate recovery of organs and help match them to patients on the waiting list; and transplant centers that decide if an organ is the right fit for their patients.",
      "Adding to the complexity, two government agencies \u2014 HRSA, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \u2014 share regulatory oversight of different parts of the donation and transplant process.",
      "Most organ donors are brain-dead \u2013 when testing determines someone has no brain function after a catastrophic injury. The body is left on a ventilator to support the organs until they can be retrieved.",

      "But increasingly organs are donated after circulatory death, called DCD \u2013 when people die because their heart stops. It usually happens when doctors determine someone has a nonsurvivable injury and the family withdraws life support.",
      "Hospitals are required to alert their area OPO to every potential donor who is declared brain-dead or once the decision to withdraw life support is made. The OPOs by law can't participate in that decision and \"we are not even in the room at that time,\u201d said Barry Massa of Kentucky's Network for Hope.",
      "During the following days of preparation, hospital employees continue caring for the patient \u2013 while the donation team talks with the family about the process, gathers hospital records showing the patient is eligible, requests tests of organ quality, and make arrangements with transplant centers to use them.",
      "Once the hospital withdraws life support and the heart stops beating there\u2019s a mandatory wait \u2013 five minutes \u2013 to be sure it won\u2019t restart. When the doctor declares death, the organ retrieval process can begin.",
      "Organs are only considered usable if death occurs relatively quickly, usually up to about two hours. Sometimes that takes much longer and thus the organs can\u2019t be used \u2013 and HRSA\u2019s Dr. Raymond Lynch told Congress that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything was done wrong. Still, he said HRSA is investigating reports of possible mistakes elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThis is a technically demanding form of care\u201d that requires \u201cgood collaboration between the OPO and the hospital,\u201d he said.",
      "At issue is how doctors are sure when it\u2019s time to withdraw life support from a dying patient \u2014 and the delicate balance of how OPOs interact with hospital staff in preparing for donation once death occurs.",
      "In May, HRSA quietly ordered the U.S. transplant network to oversee improvements at the Kentucky OPO and to develop new national policies making clear that anyone \u2013 family, hospital staff or organ donation staff \u2013 can call for a pause in donation preparations any time there are concerns about the patient\u2019s eligibility.",
      "Lynch said the government now wants more proactive collaboration from OPOs to give hospital staff \u201ca clear understanding\u201d of when to at least temporarily halt and reevaluate a potential donor if their health status changes.",
      "Kentucky's Massa said his group only received HRSA\u2019s reports this week \u2013 but that after learning about last fall\u2019s allegations, it made some changes. Massa said every hospital doctor and nurse now gets a checklist on caring for potential donors and how to pause when concerns are raised \u2014 and anyone can anonymously report complaints.",

      "The database lists just 65 resolutions so far this year, on pace to fall far below previous years\u2019 totals. Last year the office logged 380 resolutions in total, following 561 in 2023. During President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, the office averaged more than 800 resolutions a year, including 1,300 during his first year in office.",
      "Other internal data obtained by The Associated Press show a similar trend. Since Trump took office, the total number of resolved cases is down about 40% from the same time frame last year \u2014 including cases that were dismissed, mediated or reached a voluntary resolution. Compared with last year, there also has been a 70% decrease in the number of cases resolved through resolution agreements or action taken by a school to comply with federal law, the internal data shows.",
      "Meanwhile, new complaints have increased 9%. The total number of cases has now climbed beyond 25,000.",
      "An Education Department spokesperson said the Trump administration is fixing a broken system.",
      "\u201cWhen staff levels were at their peak, OCR\u2019s processes still proved to be ineffective, as evidenced by the chronic backlog of tens of thousands of cases that left students\u2019 discrimination claims languishing over many presidential administrations,\u201d spokesperson Julie Hartman said.",
      "Parents and advocates say they\u2019ve noticed a difference.",
      "Adrienne Hazel filed a complaint in April after her 20-year-old son Ricky, who has autism, was placed in a public school program without a certified teacher and was not given an individual learning plan. Hazel, of Southfield, Michigan, has not heard from the federal office after receiving an automatic reply when she filed the complaint.",
      "Things moved faster last year when Hazel filed a separate complaint for her son. The office notified Ricky\u2019s school, which Hazel says spurred the district to reach an agreement with her within about three months. This time, she said, it feels like she\u2019s on her own.",
      "\u201cThere has been zero response to this,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s basically going into a babysitting situation. He\u2019s not getting the things that he needs to grow into independence. And he\u2019ll just be aging without getting an education.\u201d",
      "Marcie Lipsitt, a special education advocate in Michigan who worked with Hazel, said such stories are common. She helps families file complaints but warns it could take at least a year before an investigation opens. Some schools have backtracked on previous agreements, she said, yet parents can\u2019t get a response from the federal office.",

      "The removal of 21 children from the custody of a Los Angeles-area couple has put a spotlight on the practice of using surrogates to build a family. Surrogacy has no federal regulation, leaving it up to states to set the rules if they choose to allow it.",
      "The kids \u2014 15 at the couple's mansion and six more living elsewhere \u2014 were taken by an LA County child welfare agency in May after the parents were accused of failing to intervene in the abuse of a baby by a nanny, police in Arcadia said.",
      "The children range in age from 2 months to 13 years, with most between 1 and 3, police said. The FBI won\u2019t comment but agents are investigating. Silvia Zhang, 38, and Guojun Xuan, 65, have not responded to emails seeking comment.",
      "Police believe Zhang gave birth to one or two of the children while the rest were born by surrogate. Some women who were paid surrogates for the couple now say they were unaware that the couple was accumulating a supersize family, raising questions about their intentions.",
      "\u201cWhat were they going to do with these children?\u201d said Deborah Wald, a lawyer in San Francisco whose expertise includes surrogacy law.",
      "Surrogacy is an agreement between parties to have a woman become pregnant, typically through an embryo transfer, and deliver a baby. The intended parent or parents might struggle with infertility. They also could be same-sex couples.",
      "There\u2019s no limit on how many children someone can have through surrogates or any other method, said Wald, who is not involved in the Arcadia case.",
      "She acknowledged that California is considered a \u201csurrogacy-friendly state\" because it has clear laws around the process.",
      "Both sides are required to have lawyers, and there must be a written, notarized contract before an embryo transfer, Wald said.",
      "\u201cThe legitimate surrogacy community in California is very distressed when things like this happen,\u201d Wald said of surrogates feeling deceived. \u201dWe\u2019ve worked very hard on legal and ethical standards. It hurts everyone when something like this happens.\u201d",
      "There are businesses that act as matchmakers, connecting surrogates to people who want to have children. State business records show a company called Mark Surrogacy Investment LLC had been registered at the Arcadia address of Zhang and Xuan.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if Zhang and Xuan set up the business solely to find surrogates for themselves. State records show the company terminated its business license in June.",
      "Wald said there are no special licensing requirements in California for businesses that match surrogates with intended parents.",
      "Wald said there should have been plenty of checks and balances in the process, noting the role of fertility clinics in handling embryos.",

      "The Children\u2019s Law Center has worked with some families with 10 to 12 children, Heimov said. A family with 20 children or more is \u201cunusual,\" she added.",

      "Swollen legs led to President Donald Trump being diagnosed with what\u2019s called chronic venous insufficiency",
      "Swollen legs led to President Donald Trump being diagnosed with what's called chronic venous insufficiency. It's a fairly common condition among older adults but requires a thorough checkup to rule out more serious causes of swelling in the legs. Here are some things to know.",
      "Chronic venous insufficiency, or CVI, happens when veins in the legs can't properly carry blood back to the heart. That can lead to blood pooling in the lower legs. In addition to swelling, usually around the feet and ankles, symptoms can include legs that are achy, heavy feeling or tingly, and varicose veins. Severe cases could trigger leg sores known as ulcers.",
      "Overcoming gravity to pump blood from the feet all the way up to the heart is a challenge, especially when someone is standing or sitting for long periods. So legs veins are lined with one-way valves that keep blood from sliding backward on that journey. Anything that damages those valves can lead to chronic venous insufficiency. Risk factors can include blood clots, vein inflammation known as phlebitis or being overweight.",
      "Doctors must rule out serious causes of leg swelling, such as heart problems, kidney disease or blood clots. Ultrasound exams of the leg veins can help confirm chronic venous insufficiency. According to the Cleveland Clinic, treatment can include wearing compression stockings, elevating the legs and achieving a healthy weight. Also exercise, especially walking, is recommended \u2014 because strong leg muscles can squeeze veins in a way that helps them pump blood. Medications and medical procedures are available for more advanced cases.",

      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- More than 1,400 people, most of them civilians, were killed in several days of sectarian violence on Syria \u2019s coast earlier this year, a government committee tasked with investigating it said Tuesday.",
      "The violence was the first major incident to emerge after the ouster of longtime President Bashar Assad in December. It said there was no evidence that Syria's new military leaders ordered attacks on the Alawite community there, to which Assad belonged.",
      "Nearly 300 people suspected of committing crimes including murder, robbery, torture and looting and burning of homes and businesses were identified during the four-month investigation and referred for prosecution, and 37 people have been arrested, officials told journalists. They didn't say how many suspects were members of security forces.",
      "The committee's report came as Syria reels from a new round of sectarian violence in the south, which again has threatened to upend the country\u2019s fragile recovery from nearly 14 years of civil war.",
      "The violence on the coast began on March 6 when armed groups loyal to Assad attacked security forces of the new government, killing 238 of them, the committee said. In response, security forces descended on the coast from other areas of the country, joined by thousands of armed civilians. In total, some 200,000 armed men mobilized, the committee said.",
      "As they entered neighborhoods and villages, some \u2014 including members of military factions \u2014 committed \u201cwidespread, serious violations against civilians,\u201d committee spokesperson Yasser al-Farhan said. In some cases, armed men asked civilians whether they belonged to the Alawite sect and \u201ccommitted violations based on this,\u201d he said.",
      "The committee, however, found that the \u201csectarian motives were mostly based on revenge, not ideology,\u201d he said.",
      "Judge Jumaa al-Anzi, the committee\u2019s chair, said that \u201cwe have no evidence that the (military) leaders gave orders to commit violations.\u201d",
      "He also said investigators had not received reports of girls or women being kidnapped. Some rights groups, including a United Nations commission, have documented cases of Alawite women being kidnapped in the months since the violence.",

      "Echoes of the coastal violence resonated in the new clashes in southern Sweida province over the past two weeks.",
      "Those clashes broke out between Sunni Muslim Bedouin clans and armed groups of the Druze religious minority, and government security forces who intervened to restore order ended up siding with the Bedouins. Members of the security forces allegedly killed Druze civilians and looted and burned homes. Druze armed groups launched revenge attacks on Bedouin communities.",
      "Hundreds have been killed, and the U.N. says more than 128,500 people have been displaced. The violence has largely stopped as a ceasefire takes told.",

The finding, which implied human errors, drew quick, vehement protests from bereaved families and fellow pilots who accuse authorities of trying to shift responsibility for the disaster to the dead pilots.",

But it was forced to cancel its press briefing in the face of strong protests by relatives of crash victims who were informed of the findings earlier in the day, according to government officials and bereaved families.",
      "\u201cIf they want to say their investigation was done in a reliable, independent manner, they should have come up with evidence that backs up their explanation,\u201d said Kim Yu-jin, head of an association of bereaved families. \u201cNone of us resent the pilots.\u201d",
      "The Boeing 737-800 operated by Jeju Air landed on its belly without its land gear deployed at South Korea\u2019s southern Muan International Airport on Dec. 29. It overshoot a runaway, slammed into a concrete structure and burst into flames. It was the deadliest disaster in South Korea\u2019s aviation history in decades, killing all but two of the 181 people on board.",
      "According to a copy of an unpublished briefing report obtained by The Associated Press, a South Korean-led multilateral investigation team said it found no defects in the plane\u2019s engines built by France\u2019s Safran and GE.",
      "The report said thorough examinations of the engines found the plane\u2019s right engine suffered more serious internal damage following bird strikes as it was engulfed with big fires and black smoke. But the pilots switched off the plane\u2019s left engine, the report said citing probes on the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder and the engines examinations.",

The person, who requested anonymity citing the sensitive nature of the investigation, said authorities earlier planned to publicize the results of probes after reviewing various issues, but changed the plan and tried to release the outcome of engine investigation at the request of bereaved families.

      "Russia initially launched its production of the Iranian drones at factory in Alabuga, located in Tatarstan. An Associated Press investigation found employees at the Alabuga plant included young African women who said they were duped into taking jobs there. Geran production later began at a plant in Udmurtia, west of the Ural Mountains. Ukraine has launched drone attacks on both factories but failed to derail production.",

      "The Pacific island nation of Vanuatu is living with the daily realities of climate change, as intensifying cyclones, rising seas and saltwater intrusion reshape its coasts and disrupt life",
      "PORT VILA, Vanuatu -- When John Warmington first began diving the reefs outside his home in Vanuatu\u2019s Havannah Harbor a decade ago, the coral rose like a sunken forest \u2014 tall stands of staghorns branched into yellow antlers, plate corals layered like canopies, and clouds of darting fish wove through the labyrinth.",
      "\u201cWe used to know every inch of that reef,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like a friend.\u201d",
      "Now, it\u2019s unrecognizable. After Cyclone Pam battered the reef in 2015, sediment from inland rivers smothered the coral beds. Crown-of-thorns starfish swept in and devoured the recovering polyps. Back-to-back cyclones in 2023 crushed what was left. Then, in December 2024, a 7.3 magnitude earthquake shook the seabed.",
      "What remains is a coral graveyard \u2014 bleached rubble scattered across the seafloor, habitats collapsed, life vanished. \u201cWe\u2019ve come out of the water in tears,\u201d said Warmington, who has logged thousands of dives on this single reef. \u201cWe just see heartbreak.\u201d",
      "That heartbreak is becoming more common across this Pacific island nation, where intensifying cyclones, rising seas and saltwater intrusion are reshaping coastlines and threatening daily life. Since 1993, sea levels around Vanuatu\u2019s shores have risen by about 6 millimeters (.24 inches) per year \u2014 significantly faster than the global average \u2014 and in some areas, tectonic activity has doubled that rate.",
      "On Wednesday, Vanuatu will get its day in the world\u2019s highest court. The International Court of Justice will issue an advisory opinion on what legal obligations nations have to address climate change and what consequences they may face if they don\u2019t. The case, led by Vanuatu and backed by more than 130 countries, is seen as a potential turning point in international climate law.",
      "\u201cSeeing large, polluting countries just continue business as usual and not take the climate crisis seriously can get really sad and disappointing,\u201d said 16-year-old climate activist Vepaiamele Trief. \u201cIf they rule in our favor, that could change everything.\u201d",
      "The opinion won't be legally binding, but could help shape future efforts to hold major emitters accountable and secure the funding and action small island nations need to adapt or survive.",
      "It comes after decades of frustration for Pacific nations who\u2019ve watched their homelands disappear. In Tuvalu, where the average elevation is just 2 meters (6.6 feet), more than a third of the population has applied for a climate migration visa to Australia. By 2100, much of the country is projected to be under water at high tide. In Nauru, the government has begun selling passports to wealthy foreigners \u2014 offering visa-free access to dozens of countries \u2014 in a bid to generate revenue for possible relocation efforts.",
      "\u201cThe agreements being made at an international level between states are not moving fast enough,\u201d said Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu\u2019s minister for climate change. \u201cThey're definitely not being met according to what the science tells us needs to happen.\u201d",
      "Vanuatu has already sought opinions from other international courts and is pushing for the recognition of ecocide \u2014 the destruction of the environment \u2014 as a crime under the International Criminal Court. \u201cWe have to keep fighting till the last bit,\u201d Regenvanu said.",
      "For children in Vanuatu, climate change isn\u2019t a theory \u2014 it\u2019s a classroom, or the lack of one.",
      "At Sainte Jeanne D\u2019Arc school on Efate Island, elementary school teacher Noellina Tavi has spent two of the last three years teaching her students in tents \u2014 first after the 2023 cyclones and again following the 2024 earthquake.",
      "With a shortage of emergency tents, her class was combined with another. Students fidget and lose focus. \u201cIt\u2019s too crowded,\u201d Tavi said. \u201cWe can\u2019t work peacefully.\u201d",
      "When it rains, the tents turn cold and muddy. Tavi often sends students home so they don\u2019t get sick. Anytime a storm approaches, the tents must be dismantled, the furniture carried to shelter and the children sent home. \u201cThat disrupts their education for a whole week,\u201d she said.",

      "The therapy was already under FDA scrutiny after two teenage boys died earlier this year from acute liver injury, a known side effect of the treatment. Then the company last week disclosed a third death with a different therapy: a 51-year-old patient who was enrolled in a company trial for another form of muscular dystrophy.",
      "FDA responded on Friday by asking the company to immediately halt all shipments of Elevidys. Company executives initially refused, noting that the latest death was not tied to Elevidys, its best-selling product.",

      "A fringe far-right populist party in Japan was one of the biggest winners in the weekend\u2019s upper house election",
      "TOKYO -- Japan's far-right populist Sanseito party was one of the biggest winners in the weekend's upper house election, attracting many voters with its \u201cJapanese First\" platform that included calling for tougher restrictions on foreigners and the curtailment of gender equality and diversity policies.",
      "Sanseito added 14 seats in Sunday\u2019s vote to the one seat already held by its leader in the 248-member upper house, the less powerful of Japan's two-chamber parliament.",
      "The surge in the party's popularity came amid the backdrop of a historic loss by the long-governing conservative coalition of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, with Sanseito attracting frustrated voters struggling with economic woes.",
      "Sanseito leader Sohei Kamiya said Tuesday that he has no interest in forming an alliance with conventional parties like Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP.",
      "Kamiya said he is open to cooperating with other emerging parties, but he's expected to wait in the hopes of gaining more seats in the more powerful lower house. His ambition is to have more influence to possibly form a multiparty coalition like those in Europe.",
      "Sanseito, which translates to \u201cParticipate in Politics,\u201d started in 2020 when Kamiya gathered people on YouTube and social media to create a political group to attract voters discontent with conventional parties.",
      "The group began to grow as its members started winning seats in local assemblies, stepping up its presence and grassroots support base.",
      "After the start of the coronavirus pandemic, his online approach quickly got traction, fueled partly by an anti-vaccine stance.",
      "Sanseito achieved a foothold in national politics in 2022 when Kamiya won a six-year term in the upper house. The party won three seats in the October election in the lower house.",
      "The party holds 15 seats in the upper house, compared with the 122 held by Ishiba's governing coalition, but Kamiya has been steadily reaching a much larger audience.",
      "Sanseito has gained more than 100,000 YouTube subscribers over the past few weeks to nearly 500,000, compared to the the LDP's 140,000.",
      "Sanseito party stood out from Japan's other parties, with a tough anti-foreigner stance as part of its \u201cJapanese First\u201d platform, apparently inspired by U.S. President Donald Trump's \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy.",
      "Under his slogan, Kamiya proposes a new agency to handle regulations on foreigners. During the election, the party campaigned for stricter screening for allowing Japanese citizenship and to exclude non-Japanese from welfare benefits.",

      "An electrical engineer in rural Vermont is reviving old pay phones to give people a free option for making calls in areas where cell service is unreliable or nonexistent",
      "TUNBRIDGE, Vt. -- An electrical engineer by trade, Patrick Schlott has spent countless hours tinkering with new and old technology. But it wasn\u2019t until he found himself living in rural Vermont that he realized his penchant for repairing old pay phones could provide a public service.",
      "\u201cI realized, wow, there\u2019s no cell service for 10 miles (16 kilometers) in either direction,\u201d he said. \u201cThe community could really benefit from something like this.\u201d",
      "Schlott, a full-time engineer at electric airplane manufacturing company BETA Technologies, decided to approach the owners of his local general store with the idea to install old pay phones around town and make them free for public use. After he explained that there would be no cost to the host, North Tunbridge General Store owners Mike and Lois Gross let Schlott install his first phone outside the store.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s pretty surprised, and they\u2019re like, \u2018Is that a real payphone? Does that really work?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, but it doesn\u2019t cost any money now,\u2019\" said store owner Mike Gross. \"We\u2019ve had people use it that broke down. It\u2019s a great thing because service is so spotty in Vermont.\u201d",
      "The first free public phone installation was Schlott\u2019s idea, but he says the two other locations, the Latham Library in Thetford and inside an informational booth in Randolph off Interstate 89, came from community members requesting the service.",
      "\u201cAll the other phones so far have been people reaching out, which is pretty cool,\u201d he said.",
      "Schlott buys the old pay phones, which can range in cost from $100-$500, at flea markets, from internet listings or at auction and fixes them up in his basement workshop. All that\u2019s needed to install one of his phones is an internet connection \u2014 no coins necessary.",
      "\u201cBasically, there\u2019s a small piece of equipment that converts an internet telephone line to an analog line that these phones can operate off of,\u201d he said.",

If a user dials zero, the phone will ring Schlott's personal cellphone, though he uses an app to keep his number private.",
      "So far, the phone at the Latham Library location has seen the most use. According to Schlott, 370 calls have been made since the phone was installed five months ago, filling a need for students without cellphones to call their parents for after-school pickups.",
      "Hannah McClain is a regular at the North Tunbridge General Store and says she finds comfort in knowing the phone is there whenever her 16-year-old daughters might need it.",
      "\u201cIt does make me feel safer if the kids are out and about, that if they had an emergency up this way that they could stop and use this. I think these are a great service,\u201d she said.",
      "Schlott is seeing increased interest in the service, with another free phone install in the works at the Brownell Library in Essex. For now, he plans to continue covering the costs associated with each phone, but noted that may change as the project scales.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s cool to see something retro that has that old-school appeal but also works. To actually hear it ring, to pick it up and have a dial tone, I think there\u2019s real power in that,\" he said. \"And I don\u2019t think they should end up in a landfill. They should be recycled and put to good use.\u201d",

      "Nonprofits in the Bronx are facing severe challenges as federal grant cuts disrupt essential services",
      "NEW YORK -- On a sweltering summer day, children leap between rocks along the Bronx River while cyclists pedal on newly paved paths. Kayaks rest on what was once an industrial dumping ground, now transformed into a bustling promenade along the city\u2019s only freshwater river.",
      "The Bronx River Greenway, a series of stitched-together waterfront parks built atop once largely abandoned and polluted wasteland, is a hard-fought victory for the country\u2019s poorest congressional district \u2014 one that locals call a \u201cbeacon of environmental justice\u201d built by federal dollars and water-pollution settlements from the borough\u2019s wealthier neighbors.",
      "Now, like thousands of nonprofits around the country, this organization\u2019s future is in jeopardy. The Trump administration\u2019s sweeping federal grant cuts have left nonprofits nationwide and the communities they serve in precarious straits. But few places face as stark a reckoning as the Bronx, where federal funding has proved indispensable for revitalizing green spaces, protecting survivors of domestic violence, and preventing youth violence.",
      "Over 84% of the 342 nonprofits based in the Bronx rely on federal grants now at risk, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute. It\u2019s a significant increase from the 70% of groups vulnerable to government defunding statewide.",
      "In all but two of the country\u2019s 437 congressional districts, the typical nonprofit could not cover its expenses without government grants. Nonprofits have increasingly served as contractors for government services \u2014 like operating homeless shelters \u2014 since the 1960s.",
      "In the Bronx, if such grants were to disappear entirely, the borough\u2019s nonprofits could face a collective deficit of nearly 30% \u2014 cuts that have begun to force layoffs and austerity on dozens of groups connecting Bronxites to low-cost health care, food assistance, and preschool slots.",
      "\u201cWhen America sneezes, the Bronx gets the flu,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres, the Democrat who represents the district. \u201cI think we in the Bronx feel we have been and will continue to be the hardest hit by the impact of a Trump presidency.\u201d",
      "Nestled in a corner of parkland atop the site of an abandoned amusement park, the headquarters of the Bronx River Alliance is among the borough\u2019s greenest buildings, boasting nature classrooms, samples of the river\u2019s flora and fauna, and a storage space teeming with kayaks and canoes.",
      "In March, the group received formal notice that it would lose $1.5 million in federal grants promised under the Inflation Reduction Act last year for improving water quality and climate-resilience projects. After years of rising momentum, cubicles now sit empty. Leaders held off on hiring in anticipation of cuts, and now they don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll be able to fill those roles.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve met some of the folks who were pulling cars out of the river in the \u201970s and \u201980s,\u201d said Daniel Ranells, the group\u2019s deputy director of programs. Back then, the area was a \u201cdumping ground\u201d so inundated with industrial waste, tires, abandoned cars, ovens, and microwaves that \u201cfolks didn\u2019t really understand there was a river there.\u201d",
      "That has shifted dramatically in recent years thanks in part to decades of federal investment. Just south of its headquarters, the organization restored salt marshes along the riverbanks of a shuttered concrete plant.",
      "In 2007, the first beaver appeared on the Bronx River in over 200 years \u2014 named \u201cJos\u00e9 the Beaver\u201d in honor of former Congressman Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano, who helped direct millions in federal funds to groups dedicated to the river\u2019s restoration.",
      "\u201cThe Bronx River is a shining light of environmental justice,\u201d Ranells said, and millions in federal funding over the years has helped \u201cmake it a destination\u201d after years of neglect.",
      "Now staffers at the Bronx River Alliance describe a sense of \u201cwhiplash\u201d in seeing hard-fought funds dry up and grant language scrubbed of any allusions to racial or environmental justice.",
      "The Bronx River Alliance has joined other nonprofits in suing the Trump administration to unfreeze funds, but the uncertainty has already disrupted years of planning, a reality that has rippled across the neighborhood, leaving few organizations untouched.",
      "Up the street from the Alliance, the office of the Osborne Association, a group that has worked to prevent youth violence for nearly a century, has grown quieter. In April, an email from the Bureau of Justice Assistance stated the remaining $666,000 of a $2 million grant \u201cno longer effectuates department priorities.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lifeline for young people, and it\u2019s no longer there for 25 more of them,\u201d Monsalve said. \u201cWithout another alternative, it\u2019s 25 young people that will see prison or jail time, and that\u2019s incredibly frustrating.\u201d",
      "The Department of Justice has canceled over $810 million in similar grants to nonprofits working in violence prevention. The Environmental Protection Agency attempted to cancel $2 billion in grants for environmental justice work.",
      "Nonprofit leaders say the cuts hit hardest in the places that can afford them the least. In the Bronx, almost 30 percent of residents live in poverty, the vast majority of whom are Black or Latino, and nearly one in six schoolchildren experience homelessness every year.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had decades of disinvestment in these communities, and we had been starting to see some meaningful investment and community-based solutions that were actually working,\u201d said Monsalve. \u201cAnd then all of a sudden that support just gets yanked away.\u201d",

      "For decades, a million-dollar federal grant allowed the victim-service organization Safe Horizon to operate a program that stationed domestic violence advocates in the borough\u2019s criminal court.",
      "When the grant came up for renewal this year, it came with new restrictions that CEO Liz Roberts described as \u201cso extreme, so broad, so radical\u201d that the organization chose to walk away rather than accept conditions which would have prohibited supporting transgender survivors or treating domestic violence as a systemic issue.",
      "It was an agonizing decision given the volume of domestic violence in the Bronx, Roberts said.",
      "It means that hundreds of survivors \u201cmay not have the opportunity to talk to an advocate about their options, about their rights, or about their safety,\u201d she said.",
      "Roberts said she\u2019s bracing for more cuts \u2014 federal funds make up about 24% of the group\u2019s budget \u2014 that could force the closure of shelters or reductions to a citywide hotline.",
      "As nonprofits nationwide grapple with similar losses, Roberts said private philanthropy and local governments will need to \u201cmake some smart and thoughtful and principled decisions about where they can help to fill those gaps.\u201d",
      "In places like the Bronx, finding alternative funding is especially challenging. \u201cThe not-for-profit sector is often fragile, and nowhere more so than the Bronx,\u201d Torres said of the district he represents, where organizations tend to be more dependent on government funding than wealthier enclaves.",
      "\u201cOrganizations spent hundreds of thousands of dollars simply to apply for a contract and hired staff and made all these plans only to see the written contract disappear,\u201d Torres said. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply destabilizing.\u201d",

      "Nonprofits in McDowell County, West Virginia, face severe challenges due to federal funding cuts",
      "For nonprofits in McDowell County, West Virginia, the federal cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act threaten a lifeline.",
      "Many of McDowell\u2019s 17,000 residents rely on federal programs and the nonprofits they fund to get by. The county\u2019s tax base and population have significantly declined since 1950, when McDowell was the top coal-producing county in the nation and had about 100,000 residents.",
      "Now, more than half the children in the county receive federal Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program benefits, and about one-third of seniors are on Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for the poor. Decades after the Kennedy administration made the county a first test of food stamps, nearly half the county\u2019s residents receive supplemental nutrition assistance, or SNAP, the Food Stamp Program\u2019s successor.",
      "The strains created by new eligibility restrictions on SNAP as a result of the passage of President Trump\u2019s domestic policy bill will be especially dire in places like McDowell County, where more than one-third of the population lives below the federal poverty line, said Rosemary Ketchum, executive director of the West Virginia Nonprofit Association.",
      "\u201cThese federal cuts are starving people,\u201d she said.",
      "Since the interruption in federal support tied to President Trump\u2019s January executive orders barring grants related to \u201cgender ideology\u201d; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and environmental justice, Ketchum said many of the 9,000 or so nonprofits in her state have laid off staff. Others, she said, are dipping into whatever reserves they have to pay their employees.",
      "Those reserves are slim, if they exist at all. Taken together, the seven nonprofits that receive federal grants in McDowell County run on a 3 percent operating margin, according to data tabulated by the Urban Institute\u2019s National Center for Charitable Statistics. If all federal support disappeared, the center found, all the county\u2019s nonprofits would be at risk of going under unless other funding was provided.",
      "In a poor state like West Virginia, which is already facing a budget deficit and lacks the legions of philanthropic donors who got rich on Wall Street or in Silicon Valley, nonprofits don\u2019t have a plan B, said Kathy Gentry, executive director of Safe Housing and Economic Development, or SHED, a McDowell nonprofit housing provider.",
      "The nonprofit\u2019s clients, many of whom are elderly or disabled, rely on U.S. Housing and Urban Development support to cover the rent at the 94 housing units SHED manages.",
      "Gentry\u2019s pay was temporarily cut for six weeks this spring because part of her salary comes from a HUD capacity-building grant that the administration deemed at cross-purposes with Trump\u2019s anti-DEI policy agenda. Her full paycheck resumed, but Gentry worries further cuts will force her to lay off staff.",
      "Already the nonprofit operates at a loss. In its 2023 tax filing, the most recent available, SHED\u2019s $663,000 in expenses outstripped its revenue by nearly $200,000.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a quandary here \u2014 all nonprofits are,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cAre we going to exist? Will we have to dissolve?\u201d",
      "Since 2015, Heidi Binko and her team at the Just Transition Fund have worked with economic development agencies and nonprofits in areas where the coal industry once flourished. That can mean helping a local organization identify or write a grant or provide a matching grant.",
      "The fund was created by the Rockefeller Family Foundation and Appalachian Funders Network to help coal towns capture some of the dollars provided in the 2015 Clean Power Plan, or POWER Act, passed during the Obama administration. Since then, the fund says it has helped coal communities in West Virginia and throughout the nation secure more than $2 billion in federal grants.",
      "Binko hopes the fund can continue to attract federal resources to towns with high poverty rates.",
      "\u201cThere are still federal dollars available,\u201d she said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t all been zeroed out.\u201d",

      "Two hallmarks of the Biden administration\u2019s infrastructure and stimulus acts \u2014 transitioning away from a carbon-based economy and providing federal resources among different populations equitably \u2014 are not a focus of the Trump plan. As a result, Binko fears recent progress will be dimmed.",
      "For instance, Generation West Virginia, a Just Transition Fund grantee worked with McDowell County to apply for funds from the Biden administration\u2019s Digital Equity Act to run an elementary and middle school digital literacy program. Programs under the act were terminated in May.",
      "The cancellation of the Digital Equity Act is a setback for McDowell, where 20 percent of households don\u2019t have a broadband internet connection, according to a Generation West Virginia report.",
      "Other, more basic infrastructure is lacking in the county. According to DigDeep, a nonprofit that assists with clean water access and wastewater systems and is primarily funded by private institutions, corporate partners and grassroots donations, there may be hundreds of people in the county without a dependable water supply. The exact number is unknown because information on whether existing water systems provide safe drinking water is not gathered by the U.S. Census.",
      "DigDeep works with the McDowell Public Service District utility provider to identify residents who need a water hookup and helps secure grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s rural development program to extend water trunk lines to hard-to-reach areas. In some cases, the nonprofit helps pay to connect the federally supported water lines directly to people\u2019s homes. It is also helping to install wastewater treatment facilities to more than 400 residents who either have inadequate systems or flush waste into nearby creeks.",
      "The water supply throughout the county is unreliable because of the area\u2019s close historical ties to the rise and fall of the coal economy, said George McGraw, DigDeep\u2019s chief executive.",
      "When coal operations came to McDowell, businesses operated in a \u201cclosed loop\u201d environment. Coal companies paid workers to build and work in the mines, they owned the houses where miners lived, and they built the water lines that served those houses, McGraw said.",
      "When the coal industry began to peter out, companies exited the county, leaving behind an aging system of pipes and drains.",
      "To secure water in the county today, hundreds of people fill plastic jugs from roadside springs or mine shafts, McGraw said. To get drinking water, they may use the bathroom in a store, a neighbor\u2019s house, or a school.",
      "DigDeep has several projects in the planning stages in McDowell. But the Trump USDA budget proposal would chop the rural water program by two-thirds, meaning some public works projects may never get completed. Someone else will have to foot the bill or the system will continue to crumble, leaving many people in McDowell County without a basic necessity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like the burden goes away,\u201d McGraw said. \u201cThe burden just shifts, and utilities are forced to raise rates on customers, many of whom are below the poverty line.\u201d",

      "Usually, she logs into an online portal to withdraw enough from an account funded by a grant from the federal housing agency. But in February, she couldn't. Access had been temporarily cut off for many housing organizations as part of the Trump administration\u2019s cuts and funding freezes.",
      "\u201cThat was just a sea change for us for those dollars to be so immediately at risk,\u201d said Price, the executive director of Friendship Shelter, which started in 1987 as a community organization. Access was eventually restored but the episode took a toll.",

      "In the early days of his second term, President Donald Trump froze, cut or threatened to cut a huge range of social services programs from public safety to early childhood education to food assistance and services for refugee resettlement. Staffing cuts to federal agencies have also contributed to delays and uncertainty around future grant funds. Altogether, his policies are poised to upend decades of partnerships the federal government has built with nonprofits to help people in their communities.",
      "This vast and interconnected set of programs funded by taxpayers has been significantly dismantled in just months, nonprofit leaders, researchers and funders say. And even deeper, permanent cuts are still possible. That uncertainty is also taking a toll on their staff and communities, the leaders said.",
      "In response to questions about the cuts to grant funding, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said, \u201cInstead of government largesse that\u2019s often riddled with corruption, waste, fraud, and abuse, the Trump administration is focused on unleashing America\u2019s economic resurgence to fuel Americans\u2019 individual generosity.\u201d",
      "He pointed to a new deduction for charitable giving included in the recently passed tax and spending law that he said encourages Americans\u2019 \u201cinnate altruism.\u201d",
      "But experts say private donations will not be enough to meet the needs.",
      "In 2021, $267 billion was granted to nonprofits from all levels of government, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute published in February. While the data includes tax-exempt organizations like local food pantries as well as universities and nonprofit hospitals, it underestimates the total funding that nonprofits receive from the government. It includes grants, but not contracts for services nor reimbursements from programs like Medicare. It also excludes the smallest nonprofits, which file a different, abbreviated tax form.",
      "However, the figure does give a sense of the scale of the historic \u2014 and, until now, solid \u2014 relationship between the public sector and nonprofits over the last 50 years. Now, this system is at risk and leaders like Price say the cost of undoing it will be \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d",
      "The Urban Institute\u2019s analysis shows more than half of nonprofits in every state received government grants in 2021.",
      "In the vast majority of the country, the typical nonprofit would run a deficit without government funding. Only in two Congressional districts \u2014 one including parts of Orange County, California, and another in the suburbs west of Atlanta \u2014 would a typical nonprofit not be in the red if they lost all of their public grant funding, the analysis found.",
      "But in Orange County, famous for its stunning beaches, mansions and extraordinary wealth, funders, nonprofits and researchers said that finding surprised them. In part, that's because of major economic inequalities in the county and its high cost of living.",
      "Taryn Palumbo, executive director of Orange County Grantmakers, said nonprofits are not as optimistic about their resiliency.",
      "\u201cThey are seeing their budgets getting slashed by 50% or 40%,\u201d she said. \u201cOr they\u2019re having to look to restructure programs that they are running or how they\u2019re serving or the number of people that they\u2019re serving.\u201d",
      "Last year, the local Samueli Foundation commissioned a study of nonprofit needs in part because they were significantly increasing their grantmaking from $18.8 million in 2022 to an estimated $125 million in 2025. They found local nonprofits reported problems maintaining staff, a deep lack of investment in their operations and a dearth of flexible reserve funds.",

      "The foundation responded by opening applications for both unrestricted grants and to support investments in buildings or land. Against this $10 million in potential awards, they received 1,242 applications for more than $250 million, said Lindsey Spindle, the foundation\u2019s president.",
      "\u201cIt tells a really stark picture of how unbelievably deep and broad the need is,\u201d Spindle said. \u201cThere is not a single part of the nonprofit sector that has not responded to these funds. Every topic you can think of: poverty, animal welfare, arts and culture, civil rights, domestic abuse... They\u2019re telling us loud and clear that they are struggling to stay alive.\u201d",
      "One of the founding stories of the United States is the importance of the voluntary sector, of neighbors helping neighbors and of individuals solving social problems. While other liberal democracies built strong welfare states, the U.S. has preferred to look to the charitable sector to provide a substantial part of social services.",
      "Since the 1960s, the federal government has largely funded those social services by giving money to nonprofits, universities, hospitals and companies. Several new policies converged at that time to create this system, including the expansion of the federal income tax during World War II and the codification of tax-exempt charitable organizations in 1954. Then, the Kennedy and Johnson administrations started to fund nonprofits directly with federal money as part of urban renewal and Great Society programs.",
      "\u201cIt was a key approach of midcentury liberalism of addressing issues of poverty, sort of making a reference to civil rights and racial inequality, but not growing the size of government,\u201d said Claire Dunning, an assistant professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, College Park. Conservatives also tended to support working through local, private, nonprofit organizations, though for different reasons than liberals, she said.",
      "With various expansions and cuts during different presidencies, the federal government has continued to fund nonprofits at significant levels, essentially hiding the government in plain sight, Dunning said. The size and importance of the nonprofit apparatus became suddenly visible in January when the Trump administration sought to freeze federal grants and loans.",
      "Dunning said the speed, hostility and scale of the proposed cuts broke with the long legacy of bipartisan support for nonprofits.",
      "\u201cPeople had no idea that the public health information or services they are receiving, their Meals on Wheels program, their afterschool tutoring program, the local park cleanup were actually enabled by public government dollars,\u201d she said.",
      "A coalition of nonprofits challenged the freeze in court in a case that is ongoing, but in the six months since, the administration has cut, paused or discontinued a vast array of programs and grants. The impacts of some of those policy changes have been felt immediately, but many will not hit the ground until current grant funding runs out, which could be in months or years depending on the programs.",
      "Friendship Shelter in Laguna Beach has an annual budget of about $15 million, $11.5 million of which comes from government sources. Price said the government funding is \u201cbraided\u201d in complex ways to house and support 330 people. They've already lost a rental reimbursement grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. But the Samueli Foundation stepped in to backfill those lost funds for three years.",
      "That kind of support is extremely unusual, she said.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know of any large-scale private philanthropy response to keeping people housed because it\u2019s a forever commitment,\u201d Price said. \u201cThat person is in housing and is going to need the subsidy for the rest of their lives. These are seriously disabled people with multiple issues that they\u2019re facing that they need help with.\u201d",
      "She also believes that even in a wealthy place like Orange County, private donors are not prepared to give five, six or eight times as much as they do currently. Donors already subsidize their government grants, which she said pay for 69% of the actual program costs.",
      "\u201cWe are providing this service to our government at a loss, at a business loss, and then making up that loss with these Medicaid dollars and also the private fundraising,\u201d she said.",
      "She said her organization has discussed having to put people out of housing back on to the streets if the government funding is cut further.",
      "\u201cThat would be, I think, a signal to me that something is deeply, deeply wrong with how we\u2019re looking at these issues,\u201d said Price, adding, \u201cIf I was placing a bet, I would bet that we have enough good still in government to prevent that.\u201d",

      "When the KissCam at a Coldplay concert last week landed on a couple who suspiciously escaped their embrace and tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work",
      "NEW YORK -- When the \u201cKissCam\u201d at a Coldplay concert landed on a couple who tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work.",
      "In hours, the clip was just about everywhere. Endless memes, parody videos and photos of the pair's shocked faces filled social media feeds. Online sleuths rushed to identify who was on camera. Artificial intelligence and software company Astronomer eventually confirmed that its CEO and chief people officer were in fact the couple in the video \u2014 and announced the CEO's resignation over the weekend.",
      "The incident's fallout has, of course, generated conversations about business ethics, corporate accountability and the repercussions that conflicts of interest among leadership can cause. But there are also broader implications at play in our increasingly online world \u2014 about the state of potentially being visible everywhere you go or tracked through \u201csocial media surveillance.\" Experts say it's more and more common for moments that may have been intended to be private, or at least reserved to a single physical venue, to make their way online and even go global today.",
      "So in the era of lightning-fast social sharing and when cameras are practically inescapable, does being in public hold any expectation of privacy anymore? Is every experience simply fodder for the world to see?",
      "It's no secret that cameras are filming much of our lives these days.",
      "From CCTV security systems to Ring doorbells, businesses, schools and neighborhoods use ample video surveillance around the clock. Sporting and concert venues have also filmed fans for years, often projecting playful bits of audience participation to the rest of the crowd. In short, the on-scene viewer becomes part of the product \u2014 and the center of attention.",
      "And of course, consumers can record just about anything if they have a smartphone in their pocket \u2014 and, if it's enticing to other social media users, that footage can quickly spread through cyberspace.",
      "Ellis Cashmore, author of the book \u201cCelebrity Culture,\u201d proposes that the rapid fame of last week\u2019s KissCam moment probably answers a question many have been asking for years: \u201cIs the private life still what it was? And the answer is, of course, there\u2019s no such thing as the private life anymore,\u201d he notes. \u201cCertainly not in the traditional sense of the term.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that we can assume privacy at a concert with hundreds of other people,\u201d adds Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s School of Journalism and Media. \u201cWe can\u2019t assume privacy on the street anymore.\u201d",
      "Some version of the KissCam has long been a staple at big events \u2014 from timeouts during sports games to romantic songs played by artists at their concerts. It\u2019s easy to miss, but most venues have signs to inform the audience that they could be filmed during the event. What\u2019s been different in more recent years, experts note, is how quickly those moments can travel beyond the physical space where they actually unfold.",
      "That isn\u2019t only limited to what shows up on a jumbotron. Sometimes it only takes one person in the crowd to capture any interaction on their phone and post the video online \u2014 where it can zip around the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just the camera,\" Bock says. \u201cIt\u2019s the distribution system that is wild and new.\u201d",

The LinkedIn pages belonging both to Astronomer\u2019s now-former CEO and chief people officer remained disabled on Monday, and The Associated Press could not reach either for comment.",
      "But it isn't limited to company executives. Beyond someone simply spotting a familiar face and spreading the word, technological advances \u2014 including AI \u2014 have made it easier and faster overall to find just about anyone in an online post. This can happen with videos and photos shared on social media each day, even if it doesn't go viral, experts warn.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us \u2014 and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,\" Bock says. \u201cWhen you think about it, we are being surveilled by our social media. They\u2019re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.\u201d",
      "And of course, such moments can also impact people who were not actually on camera. As easy as it can be to be identified online today, the internet is notorious for cutting a broad swath or not always getting it right. That sometimes produces harassment of individuals not actually involved.",
      "At last week's Coldplay concert, for example, many social media users speculated that a third person seen near the two caught on camera was another Astronomer employee \u2014 leading to swarms of posts targeting her. But the company later confirmed that she was not at the event and said no other employees were in the video circulating online.",

Still, it\u2019s a \u201cvery frightening thing to get a lot of abuse and harassment online,\u201d Taylor notes. \u201cThere are real human beings behind this.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to think that that these kind of viral moments will ever go away \u2014 and there are few legal restrictions to stop users from sharing clips of interactions recorded from anything from a concert to the street widely online. But on an individual level, Bock says it can be helpful to \u201cthink before you share\u201d and question whether something\u2019s really accurate.",

      "The U.S. Department of Labor is aiming to rewrite or repeal more than 60 \u201cobsolete\u201d workplace regulations adopted under previous presidential administrations",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. Department of Labor is aiming to rewrite or repeal more than 60 \u201cobsolete\u201d workplace regulations, ranging from minimum wage requirements for home health care workers and people with disabilities to standards governing exposure to harmful substances.",
      "If approved, the wide-ranging changes unveiled this month also would affect working conditions at constructions sites and in mines, and limit the government's ability to penalize employers if workers are injured or killed while engaging in inherently risky activities such as movie stunts or animal training.",
      "The Labor Department says the goal is to reduce costly, burdensome rules imposed under previous administrations, and to deliver on President Donald Trump's commitment to restore American prosperity through deregulation.",
      "\u201cThe Department of Labor is proud to lead the way by eliminating unnecessary regulations that stifle growth and limit opportunity,\u201d Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement, which boasted the \u201cmost ambitious proposal to slash red tape of any department across the federal government.\u201d",
      "Critics say the proposals would put workers at greater risk of harm, with women and members of minority groups bearing a disproportionate impact.",
      "\"People are at very great risk of dying on the job already,\u201d Rebecca Reindel, the AFL-CIO union's occupational safety and health director, said. \u201cThis is something that is only going to make the problem worse.\u201d",
      "The proposed changes have several stages to get through before they can take effect, including a public comment period for each one.",
      "Here's a look at some of the rollbacks under consideration:",
      "Home health care workers help elderly or medically fragile people by preparing meals, administering medications, assisting with toilet use, accompanying clients to doctor appointments and performing other tasks. Under one of the Labor Department's proposals, an estimated 3.7 million workers employed by home care agencies could be paid below the federal minimum wage \u2014 currently $7.25 per hour \u2014 and made ineligible for overtime pay if they aren't covered by corresponding state laws.",
      "The proposed rule would reverse changes made in 2013 under former President Barack Obama and revert to a regulatory framework from 1975. The Labor Department says that by lowering labor and compliance costs, its revisions might expand the home care market and help keep frail individuals in their homes for longer.",
      "Judy Conti, director of government affairs at the National Employment Law Project, said her organization plans to work hard to defeat the proposal. Home health workers are subject to injuries from lifting clients, and \"before those (2013) regulations, it was very common for home care workers to work 50, 60 and maybe even more hours a week, without getting any overtime pay,\u201d Conti said.",
      "Others endorse the proposal, including the Independent Women\u2019s Forum, a conservative nonprofit based in Virginia. Women often bear the brunt of family caregiving responsibilities, so making home care more affordable would help women balance work and personal responsibilities, the group's president, Carrie Lukas, said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re pleased to see the Trump administration moving forward on rolling back some of what we saw as counterproductive micromanaging of relationships that were making it hard for people to get the care they need,\u201d Lukas said.",
      "Samantha Sanders, director of government affairs and advocacy at the nonprofit Economic Policy Institute, said the repeal would not constitute a win for women.",
      "\u201cSaying we actually don\u2019t think they need those protections would be pretty devastating to a workforce that performs really essential work and is very heavily dominated by women, and women of color in particular,\u201d Sanders said.",
      "Last year, the Labor Department finalized rules that provided protections to migrant farmworkers who held H-2A visas. The current administration says most of those rules placed unnecessary and costly requirements on employers.",

      "Worker advocates think getting rid of a specific construction site requirement is a bad idea. \u201cThere have been many fatalities where workers fall through a hole in the floor, where there\u2019s not adequate lighting,\u201d Reindel said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very obvious thing that employers should address, but unfortunately it\u2019s one of those things where we need a standard, and it\u2019s violated all the time.\u201d",
      "Several proposals could impact safety procedures for mines. For example, employers have to submit plans for ventilation and preventing roof collapses in coal mines for review by the Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Administration. Currently, MSHA district managers can require mine operators to take additional steps to improve those plans.",
      "The Labor Department wants to end that authority, saying the current regulations give the district manager the ability to draft and create laws without soliciting comments or action by Congress.",
      "Similarly, the department is proposing to strip district managers of their ability to require changes to mine health and safety training programs.",
      "The general duty clause allows OSHA to punish employers for unsafe working conditions when there's no specific standard in place to cover a situation.",
      "An OSHA proposal would exclude the agency from applying the clause to prohibit, restrict or penalize employers for \u201cinherently risky professional activities that are intrinsic to professional, athletic, or entertainment occupations.\u201d",
      "A preliminary analysis identified athletes, actors, dancers, musicians, other entertainers and journalists as among the types of workers the limitation would apply to.",
      "\u201cIt is simply not plausible to assert that Congress, when passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act, silently intended to authorize the Department of Labor to eliminate familiar sports and entertainment practices, such as punt returns in the NFL, speeding in NASCAR, or the whale show at SeaWorld,\u201d the proposed rule reads.",
      "Debbie Berkowitz, who served as OSHA chief of staff during the Obama administration, said she thinks limiting the agency's enforcement authority would be a mistake.",
      "\u201cOnce you start taking that threat away, you could return to where they\u2019ll throw safety to the wind, because there are other production pressures they have,\" Berkowitz said.",

      "The parents of a man who died alone in a Colorado jail cell after an ulcer burned a hole in his digestive tract and left him in what they said was excruciating pain for about 15 hours have filed a federal lawsuit",
      "DENVER -- The parents of a man who died alone in a Colorado jail cell after an ulcer burned a hole in his digestive tract and left him in what they said was excruciating pain for about 15 hours filed a federal lawsuit Monday, accusing the jail's nurses and sheriff's deputes of ignoring his cries for help.",
      "The lawsuit blames them, local government officials and Southern Health Partners for failing to stop the death of Daniel Foard in 2023 by taking him to the hospital. Foard, 32, was a cook at a brewpub and user of fentanyl who was arrested for failing to appear in court. After being segregated and monitored for withdrawal from the synthetic opioid, he began vomiting and complained of stomach pain after being put in a regular jail cell, it said.",
      "The lawsuit alleges Southern Health Partners \u2014 the Tennessee-based company they contracted with to provide health care at the La Plata County jail \u2014 has tried to maximize its profits at the jail by only having one nurse on duty at a time, leaving it to medically untrained deputies to monitor sick inmates. The company holds hundred of contracts at jails around the country and the lawsuit alleges that is has been involved in lawsuits related to the deaths of at least five other jail inmates nationally.",
      "The company's lawyer, Shira Crittendon, said she had not seen the lawsuit and declined to comment on it.",
      "The sheriff's office referred questions about the the lawsuit to a county spokesperson. In a statement, the county said it had not analyzed the allegations in the lawsuit and does not comment publicly on active litigation.",
      "Foard was found dead in the jail on Aug. 17, 2023, six days after he was arrested.",
      "An autopsy found Foard died as a result of a hole created by an ulcer in his small intestine, which caused inflammation of the tissue lining his abdomen. Such ulcers can let food and digestive juices leak out of the body's digestive tract.",
      "Fentanyl was found in Foard's blood but the autopsy report did not name that as a cause of his death. Dr. Michael Arnall ruled Foard's death was due to natural causes.",
      "On Aug. 15, 2023, even though Foard had collapsed several times and had trouble standing, he was moved out of an area where he could be more easily observed for problems with his withdrawal and put into a regular jail cell, staggering as we went, the lawsuit said. The day nurse ignored a deputy's concern that he was very unstable, according to the lawsuit brought by lawyers Dan Weiss, Anna Holland Edwards, John Holland and Erica Grossman.",

      "After a deputy delivering breakfast on Aug. 16, 2023 saw that Foard repeatedly fell while trying to get his tray, the jail's day nurse came to check on him, it said. She recorded that Foard reported he had sharp, shooting pain that was a \u201c10\u201d on a scale of one to 10, but she did not call for a doctor or send him to the hospital, it said.",
      "The nurse moved Foard to an empty cell where he could be monitored but didn't tell deputies what he was being monitored for and didn't order any follow up care or check on him, it said. He vomited all day and was moved to another cell and then a third because they had all become so messy with vomit, it said. Surveillance video showed him crawling to the final cell, where it said he continuously called out for help and yelled that he needed to go to a hospital, saying he was vomiting blood. The lawsuit claims that no one responded to his pleas but one deputy could be heard on surveillance video telling him to \u201ctry to hit that drain\u201d with his vomit to keep the cell from becoming dirty.",
      "Another nurse, working the evening shift, only walked by his cell and glanced inside, but did not assess him or provide care as he was pleading for help, the lawsuit said. When she did enter his cell around 10 p.m., Foard was dead, it said. She told state investigators that vomiting was normal for people withdrawing from fentanyl.",
      "The day shift nurse later told a state investigator that it was not unusual that Foard would not have had his vital signs checked for 12 hours because of the number of inmates the jail's nurses need to provide care, according to a report from an investigation by the Colorado Bureau of Investigations. She also said she didn't think there was anything different she could have done based on Foard's symptoms.",
      "The bureau's findings were forwarded to the 6th District Attorney's Office, which would decide whether any criminal charges were warranted in connection with Foard's death. It's not known whether the office decided to pursue any charges. A telephone message and email sent to District Attorney Sean Murray were not immediately returned.",
      "In a statement, Jim Foard and Susan Gizinski said they want everyone to know about their son's ordeal both to hold those they say are responsible for his death accountable and to change how inmates are treated at the jail.",
      "\u201cJust basic training in having compassion for others would be a great start. But adding more staff is critical too,\u201d they said.",

      "It has been five years since a $60 million bribery scheme funded by FirstEnergy Corp. came to light in Ohio with the stunning arrests ofa powerful Republican state lawmaker and four associates in July 2020",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Five years after a $60 million bribery scheme funded by FirstEnergy Corp. came to light in Ohio, expert observers say the resulting prosecutions, lawsuits, penalties and legislation haven't led to enough change and accountability to prevent politicians and corporate executives from cutting similar deals in the future.",
      "The scheme \u2014 whose prospective $2 billion-plus pricetag to consumers makes it the largest infrastructure scandal in U.S. history \u2014 surfaced with the stunning arrests of a powerful Republican state lawmaker and four associates on July 21, 2020.",
      "That lawmaker, former House Speaker Larry Householder, is serving 20 years in federal prison for masterminding the racketeering operation at the center of the scandal.",
      "Jurors agreed with prosecutors that money that changed hands wasn\u2019t everyday political giving, but an elaborate secret scheme orchestrated by Householder to elect political allies, become the House speaker, pass a $1 billion nuclear bailout law in House Bill 6 and crush a repeal effort. One of the dark money groups Householder used also pleaded guilty to racketeering.",
      "Householder and a former lobbyist have unsuccessfully challenged their convictions. Two of the arrested associates pleaded guilty, and the other died by suicide.",
      "Any hope that the convictions would have clarified federal law around 501(c)4 nonprofit \u201cdark money\u201d groups or prompted new restrictions on those hasn\u2019t materialized, said former U.S. Attorney David DeVillers, who led the initial investigation.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s actually worse than it was before,\u201d he said. \u201cNationally, you have both Democrats and Republicans using these, so there\u2019s no political will to do anything about it.\u201d",
      "Indeed, a study released in May by the Brennan Center for Justice found that dark money unleashed by the 2010 Citizens United decision hit a record high of $1.9 billion in 2024 federal races, nearly double the $1 billion spent in 2020. The vast majority of money from undisclosed donors raised into dark money accounts now goes to super PACs, providing them a way to skirt a requirement that they make their donors public, the study found.",
      "DeVillers said one positive result of the scandal is that Ohio lawmakers appear genuinely concerned about avoiding quid pro quos, real or perceived, between them and their political contributors.",
      "Anti-corruption legislation perennially introduced by Ohio Democrats since the scandal broke has gone nowhere in the GOP-dominated Legislature. Republican legislative leaders have said it is outside their authority to amend federal campaign finance law.",
      "The U.S. Attorney\u2019s office declined to discuss the investigation because prosecutions remain ongoing. Two fired FirstEnergy executives have pleaded not guilty on related state and federal charges and await trial.",
      "Former Public Utilities Commission of Ohio Chairman Samuel Randazzo, to whom FirstEnergy admitted giving a $4.3 million bribe in exchange for regulatory favors, had faced both federal and state charges. He died by suicide after pleading not guilty.",

They\u2019re intended to determine whether FirstEnergy used money for bribes that was meant for grid modernization and whether it improperly comingled money from its different corporate entities.",
      "FirstEnergy spokeperson Jennifer Young said it invested $4 billion in grid upgrades in 2024 and plans to spend a total of $28 billion through 2029.",

      "\u201cFirstEnergy is a far different company today than it was five years ago,\u201d she said.",
      "The PUCO also made changes in response to the scandal. Chair Jenifer French told state lawmakers that ethics training has been enhanced, staff lawyers and the administrative law judges who hear cases now report to different directors to ensure legal independence, and she never takes a meeting alone.",
      "Ashley Brown, a retired executive director of the Harvard Electricity Policy Group who previously served as a PUCO commissioner, said the commission is the only state entity with the power to order FirstEnergy to return tainted cash \u2014 including the bribe money \u2014 to customers. That largely hasn\u2019t happened.",
      "He said the Ohio commission had vast power to hold FirstEnergy accountable for its misdeeds but hasn't conducted its own management audit of the energy giant, demanded an overhaul of FirstEnergy\u2019s corporate board or pressed for public release of FirstEnergy\u2019s own internal investigation of the scandal, whose findings remain a mystery. Shareholders won some accountability measures as part of a $180 million settlement in 2022, but they continue to fight in court for release of the investigation. Willis does, too.",

      "PUCO spokesperson Matt Schilling reiterated that the commission's probes are ongoing. He said the panel has vowed to take its proceedings \u201cwherever the facts lead.\u201d",
      "The portion of HB 6 that bailed out two FirstEnergy-affiliated nuclear plants was repealed in 2021, and $26 million was refunded to customers.",
      "The scandal investigation revealed that other power distribution companies got a lucrative payout of their own added to the bill in exchange for their buy-in: subsidies for two unprofitable Cold War-era coal plants. It wasn\u2019t until April that a law was passed repealing those subsidies.",
      "Until that takes effect Aug. 14, the charges cost Ohio ratepayers $445,679 a day \u2014 and it\u2019s unclear if or when they\u2019ll get that money back. A ticker on Willis\u2019 website puts the total they\u2019ve paid at more than $500 million and counting.",

Those deaths occurred between 2007 and 2022, involving children between the ages of 22 months and 3 years old. No additional fatalities have been reported in Canada.",
      "Consumers in possession of these pools are urged to immediately contact Bestway, Intex and/or Polygroup to receive a free repair kit \u2014 which will consist of a rope to replace the compression strap. Owners of these pools should otherwise ensure that small children cannot access the pool without supervision, regulators note \u2014 and could alternatively drain the pool until the repair is made.",

      "In addition to his new role at the Obama Foundation, Walker has already been named president of the National Gallery of Art. In September, \u201cThe Idea of America: Reflections on Inequality, Democracy, and the Values We Share,\u201d a collection of his essays, will be published. The Ford Foundation has selected Yale Law School Dean Heather Gerken, a leading expert on constitutional law and democracy, to succeed Darren Walker as its president.",

      "Everyone saw Woods coming when he was on \u201cThe Mike Douglas Show\u201d at age 2, when he won the Junior Worlds six times and both the U.S. Junior and the U.S. Amateur three straight times. He made a hole-in-one in his pro debut. He won his first PGA Tour event in his fifth start.",
      "Scheffler spent his first year as a pro on the Korn Ferry Tour.",
      "\u201cI played with him a lot in college, and he was not that good,\u201d Bryson DeChambeau said with a laugh. He now refers to Scheffler as being \u201cin a league of his own.\u201d",
      "Woods was all about power and putting. Scheffler is fairways and greens.",
      "Woods was overwhelming, winning the Masters by 12 shots, the U.S. Open by 15 and the British Open at St. Andrews by eight for the career Grand Slam at age 24.",
      "Scheffler is relentless. He can take the drama out of a major without notice. He's the first player to win each of his first four majors by at least three shots since J.H. Taylor more than a century ago, when the British Open was the only major and had fields smaller than a signature event.",
      "Nicklaus picked up on this at the Memorial without ever talking to Scheffler about it.",
      "Before the tournament, Nicklaus spoke about his approach to golf \u2014 more emphasis on the tee shot (left-to-right shape, like Scheffler) and the approach, less dependence on putting for a good score. And when he got the lead, Nicklaus did what was required.",
      "Scheffler won that week by four shots.",

      "Teenagers are turning to AI for advice, guidance and conversation",
      "As artificial intelligence technology becomes part of daily life, adolescents are turning to chatbots for advice, guidance and conversation. The appeal is clear: Chatbots are patient, never judgmental, supportive and always available.",
      "That worries experts who say the booming AI industry is largely unregulated and that many parents have no idea about how their kids are using AI tools or the extent of personal information they are sharing with chatbots.",
      "New research shows more than 70% of American teenagers have used AI companions and more than half converse with them regularly. The study by Common Sense Media focused on \u201cAI companions,\u201d like Character. AI, Nomi and Replika, which it defines as \u201cdigital friends or characters you can text or talk with whenever you want,\u201d versus AI assistants or tools like ChatGPT, though it notes they can be used the same way.",
      "It\u2019s important that parents understand the technology. Experts suggest some things parents can do to help protect their kids:",
      "\u2014 Start a conversation, without judgment, says Michael Robb, head researcher at Common Sense Media. Approach your teen with curiosity and basic questions: \u201cHave you heard of AI companions?\u201d \u201cDo you use apps that talk to you like a friend?\u201d Listen and understand what appeals to your teen before being dismissive or saying you\u2019re worried about it.",
      "\u2014 Help teens recognize that AI companions are programmed to be agreeable and validating. Explain that\u2019s not how real relationships work and that real friends with their own points of view can help navigate difficult situations in ways that AI companions cannot.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that's really concerning is not only what's happening on screen but how much time it\u2019s taking kids away from relationships in real life,\u201d says Mitch Prinstein, chief of psychology at the American Psychological Association. \u201cWe need to teach kids that this is a form of entertainment. It's not real, and it's really important they distinguish it from reality and should not have it replace relationships in your actual life.\u201d",
      "The APA recently put out a health advisory on AI and adolescent well-being, and tips for parents.",
      "\u2014 Parents should watch for signs of unhealthy attachments.",
      "\u201cIf your teen is preferring AI interactions over real relationships or spending hours talking to AI companions, or showing that they are becoming emotionally distressed when separated from them \u2014 those are patterns that suggest AI companions might be replacing rather than complementing human connection,\u201d Robb says.",
      "\u2014 Parents can set rules about AI use, just like they do for screen time and social media. Have discussions about when and how AI tools can and cannot be used. Many AI companions are designed for adult use and can mimic romantic, intimate and role-playing scenarios.",

But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship.",
      "\u201cEveryone uses AI for everything now. It\u2019s really taking over,\u201d said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. \u201cI think kids use AI to get out of thinking.\u201d",
      "For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving.",
      "More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, according to a new study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly.",
      "The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as \u201cdigital friends,\u201d like Character.AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say.",
      "As the technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers and experts worry about AI\u2019s potential to redefine human relationships and exacerbate crises of loneliness and youth mental health.",
      "\u201cAI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It\u2019s never judgmental,\u201d says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking to AI, you are always right. You\u2019re always interesting. You are always emotionally justified.\u201d",
      "All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an \u201cAI companion\u201d for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship.",
      "\u201cThat felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,\u201d said Nair. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people.\u201d",
      "In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were \u201cas satisfying or more satisfying\u201d than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people.",
      "Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study\u2019s lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s eye-opening,\u201d said Robb. \u201cWhen we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions.\u201d The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May.",
      "Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement \u2014 not replace \u2014 real-world interactions.",
      "\u201cIf teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else\u2019s perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,\u201d he said.",

In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults.",

      "Archaeologists have identified a 250-year-old shipwreck uncovered on a remote Scottish beach",
      "LONDON -- When a schoolboy going for a run found the ribs of a wooden ship poking through the dunes of a remote Scottish beach, it sparked a hunt by archaeologists, scientists and local historians to uncover its story.",
      "Through a mix of high-tech science and community research, they have an answer. Researchers announced Wednesday that the vessel is very likely the Earl of Chatham, an 18th-century warship that saw action in the American War of Independence before a second life hunting whales in the Arctic \u2014 and then a stormy demise.",
      "\u201cI would regard it as a lucky ship, which is a strange thing to say about a ship that\u2019s wrecked,\u201d said Ben Saunders, senior marine archaeologist at Wessex Archaeology, a charity that helped community researchers conduct the investigation.",
      "\u201cI think if it had been found in many other places, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily have had that community drive, that desire to recover and study that material, and also the community spirit to do it,\u201d Saunders said.",
      "The wreck was discovered in February 2024 after a storm swept away sand covering it on Sanday, one of the rugged Orkney Islands that lie off Scotland\u2019s northern tip.",
      "It excited interest on the island of 500 people, whose history is bound up with the sea and its dangers. Around 270 shipwrecks have been recorded around the 20-square-mile (50-square-kilometer) island since the 15th century.",
      "Local farmers used their tractors and trailers to haul the 12 tons of oak timbers off the beach, before local researchers set to work trying to identify it.",
      "\u201cThat was really good fun, and it was such a good feeling about the community \u2013 everybody pulling together to get it back,\u201d said Sylvia Thorne, one of the island\u2019s community researchers. \u201cQuite a few people are really getting interested in it and becoming experts.\u201d",
      "Dendrochronology \u2014 the science of dating wood from tree rings \u2014 showed the timber came from southern England in the middle of the 18th century. That was one bit of luck, Saunders said, because it coincides with \u201cthe point where British bureaucracy\u2019s really starting to kick off\u201d and detailed records were being kept.",
      "\u201cAnd so we can then start to look at the archive evidence that we have for the wrecks in Orkney,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cIt becomes a process of elimination.",
      "\u201cYou remove ones that are Northern European as opposed to British, you remove wrecks that are too small or operating out of the north of England and you really are down to two or three \u2026 and Earl of Chatham is the last one left.\u201d",

      "Further research found that before it was the Earl of Chatham, the ship was HMS Hind, a 24-gun Royal Navy frigate built in Chichester on England\u2019s south coast in 1749.",
      "Its military career saw it play a part in the expansion \u2014 and contraction \u2014 of the British Empire. It helped Britain wrest control of Canada from France during the sieges of Louisbourg and Quebec in the 1750s, and in the 1770s served as a convoy escort during Britain\u2019s failed effort to hold onto its American colonies.",
      "Sold off by the navy in 1784 and renamed, the vessel became a whaling ship, hunting the huge mammals in the Arctic waters off Greenland.",
      "Whale oil was an essential fuel of the Industrial Revolution, used to lubricate machinery, soften fabric and light city streets. Saunders said that in 1787 there were 120 London-based whaling ships in the Greenland Sea, the Earl of Chatham among them.",

      "The upgrades, which the team said had been in the works for a few years, came after a players poll released by the NFL Players Association in February gave the Jets a D-plus for their locker room, ranking 26th in the league. The team moved into its current facility in 2008. Woody Johnson received an F and was the lowest-ranked owner. The team received an overall ranking of 29th.",

      "The Jets, who have the NFL's longest active playoff drought at 14 seasons, have a new general manager in Darren Mougey and head coach in Aaron Glenn.

      "NEW YORK -- When the \u201cKissCam\u201d at a Coldplay concert landed on a couple who tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work.",
      "In hours, the clip was just about everywhere. Endless memes, parody videos and photos of the pair's shocked faces filled social media feeds. Online sleuths rushed to identify who was on camera. Artificial intelligence and software company Astronomer eventually confirmed that its CEO and chief people officer were in fact the couple in the video \u2014 and announced the CEO's resignation over the weekend.",
      "The incident's fallout has, of course, generated conversations about business ethics, corporate accountability and the repercussions that conflicts of interest among leadership can cause. But there are also broader implications at play in our increasingly online world \u2014 about the state of potentially being visible everywhere you go or tracked through \u201csocial media surveillance.\" Experts say it's more and more common for moments that may have been intended to be private, or at least reserved to a single physical venue, to make their way online and even go global today.",
      "So in the era of lightning-fast social sharing and when cameras are practically inescapable, does being in public hold any expectation of privacy anymore? Is every experience simply fodder for the world to see?",
      "It's no secret that cameras are filming much of our lives these days.",
      "From CCTV security systems to Ring doorbells, businesses, schools and neighborhoods use ample video surveillance around the clock. Sporting and concert venues have also filmed fans for years, often projecting playful bits of audience participation to the rest of the crowd. In short, the on-scene viewer becomes part of the product \u2014 and the center of attention.",
      "And of course, consumers can record just about anything if they have a smartphone in their pocket \u2014 and, if it's enticing to other social media users, that footage can quickly spread through cyberspace.",
      "Ellis Cashmore, author of the book \u201cCelebrity Culture,\u201d proposes that the rapid fame of last week\u2019s KissCam moment probably answers a question many have been asking for years: \u201cIs the private life still what it was? And the answer is, of course, there\u2019s no such thing as the private life anymore,\u201d he notes. \u201cCertainly not in the traditional sense of the term.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that we can assume privacy at a concert with hundreds of other people,\u201d adds Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s School of Journalism and Media. \u201cWe can\u2019t assume privacy on the street anymore.\u201d",
      "Some version of the KissCam has long been a staple at big events \u2014 from timeouts during sports games to romantic songs played by artists at their concerts. It\u2019s easy to miss, but most venues have signs to inform the audience that they could be filmed during the event. What\u2019s been different in more recent years, experts note, is how quickly those moments can travel beyond the physical space where they actually unfold.",
      "That isn\u2019t only limited to what shows up on a jumbotron. Sometimes it only takes one person in the crowd to capture any interaction on their phone and post the video online \u2014 where it can zip around the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just the camera,\" Bock says. \u201cIt\u2019s the distribution system that is wild and new.\u201d",

The LinkedIn pages belonging both to Astronomer\u2019s now-former CEO and chief people officer remained disabled on Monday, and The Associated Press could not reach either for comment.",
      "But it isn't limited to company executives. Beyond someone simply spotting a familiar face and spreading the word, technological advances \u2014 including AI \u2014 have made it easier and faster overall to find just about anyone in an online post. This can happen with videos and photos shared on social media each day, even if it doesn't go viral, experts warn.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us \u2014 and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,\" Bock says. \u201cWhen you think about it, we are being surveilled by our social media. They\u2019re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.\u201d",
      "And of course, such moments can also impact people who were not actually on camera. As easy as it can be to be identified online today, the internet is notorious for cutting a broad swath or not always getting it right. That sometimes produces harassment of individuals not actually involved.",
      "At last week's Coldplay concert, for example, many social media users speculated that a third person seen near the two caught on camera was another Astronomer employee \u2014 leading to swarms of posts targeting her. But the company later confirmed that she was not at the event and said no other employees were in the video circulating online.",
      "For the now-viral moment, \u201cwe can talk about what\u2019s right and wrong, and whether they deserved it,\u201d says Alison Taylor, a clinical associate professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. Still, it\u2019s a \u201cvery frightening thing to get a lot of abuse and harassment online,\u201d Taylor notes. \u201cThere are real human beings behind this.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to think that that these kind of viral moments will ever go away \u2014 and there are few legal restrictions to stop users from sharing clips of interactions recorded from anything from a concert to the street widely online. But on an individual level, Bock says it can be helpful to \u201cthink before you share\u201d and question whether something\u2019s really accurate.",
      "\u201cSocial media has changed so much,\u201d Bock says. \u201cBut we really have not, as a society, caught up with the technology in terms of our ethics and our etiquette.\u201d",

      "MIAMI -- Elon Musk fought court cases on opposite coasts Monday, raising a question about the billionaire that could either speed his plan to put self-driving Teslas on U.S. roads or throw up a major roadblock: Can this wildly successful man who tends to exaggerate really be trusted?",
      "In Miami, a Tesla driver who has admitted he was wrong to reach for a dropped cell phone moments before a deadly accident, spoke of the danger of putting too much faith in Musk's technology \u2014 in this case his Autopilot program.",
      "\u201cI trusted the technology too much,\u201d said George McGee, who ran off the road and killed a woman out stargazing with her boyfriend. \u201cI believed that if the car saw something in front of it, it would provide a warning and apply the brakes.\u201d",
      "In unusual coincidence, regulators arguing an Oakland, California, case tried to pin exaggerated talk about the same Tesla technology at the center of a request to suspend the carmaker from being able to sell vehicles in the state.",
      "Musk's tendency to talk big \u2014 whether it's his cars, his rockets or his government costing-cutting efforts \u2014 have landed him in trouble with investors, regulators and courts before, but rarely at such a delicate moment.",
      "After his social media spat with President Donald Trump, Musk can no longer count on a light regulatory touch from Washington. Meanwhile, sales of his electric cars have plunged and so a hit to his safety reputation could threaten his next big project: rolling out driverless robotaxis \u2014 hundreds of thousands of them \u2014 in several U.S. cities by the end of next year.",
      "The Miami case holds other dangers, too. Lawyers for the family of the dead woman, Naibel Benavides Leon, recently convinced the judge overseeing the jury trial to allow them to argue for punitive damages. A car crash lawyer not involved in the case, but closely following it, said that could cost Tesla tens of millions of dollars, or possibly more.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen punitive damages go to the hundreds of millions, so that is the floor,\u201d said Miguel Custodio of Los Angeles-based Custodio & Dubey. \u201cIt is also a signal to other plaintiffs that they can also ask for punitive damages, and then the payments could start compounding.\u201d",
      "That Tesla has allowed the Miami case to proceed to trial is surprising. It has settled at least four deadly accidents involving Autopilot, including payments just last week to a Florida family of a Tesla driver. That said, Tesla was victorious in two other jury cases, both in California, that also sought to lay blame on its technology for crashes.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the Miami case argue that Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance feature, called Autopilot, should have warned the driver and braked when his Model S sedan blew through flashing lights, a stop sign and a T-intersection at 62 miles-an-hour in an April 2019 crash. Tesla said that drivers are warned not to rely on Autopilot, or its more advanced Full Self-Driving system. It says the fault entirely lies with the \"distracted driver\" just like so many other \u201caccidents since cellphones were invented.\u201d",

      "As global temperatures rise under climate change, the bees responsible for pollinating many crops are under increasing stress and scientists are trying to understand how they are affected",
      "WILLIAMSPORT, Ohio -- Sweat covers Isaac Barnes\u2019s face under his beekeeper\u2019s veil as he hauls boxes of honeycomb from his hives to his truck. It's a workout in what feels like a sauna as the late-morning June temperatures rise.",
      "Though Barnes was hot, his bees were even hotter. Their body temperatures can be up to 27 degrees Fahrenheit (about 15 Celsius) higher than the air around them. As global temperatures rise under climate change, scientists are trying to better understand the effects on managed and wild bees as they pollinate crops, gather nectar, make honey and reproduce.",
      "They noticed flying bees gathering nectar avoided overheating on the hottest days by using fewer but harder wingbeats to keep their body temperature below dangerous levels, according to a study published last year. Scientists also say that bees \u2014 like people \u2014 may also cope by retreating to a cooler environment such as the shade or their nest.",
      "\u201cJust like we go into the shade, or we sweat or we might work less hard, bees actually do the exact same thing so they can avoid the heat,\u201d said Jon Harrison, an environmental physiologist at Arizona State University and one of the study\u2019s authors.",
      "But that means the bees aren't able to do what they normally do, said Kevin McCluney, a biology professor at Bowling Green State University.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not going out and getting more nectar. They\u2019re not mating. They\u2019re not doing the things that bees would otherwise do,\u201d McCluney said.",
      "Generally, most bees are heat-tolerant, but as the climate warms, some experts think their ability to fend off disease and gather food might become harder. And habitat loss, increased use of pesticides, diseases and lack of forage for both managed and wild bees are all listed as potential contributors to the global decline of bees and other pollinators.",
      "\u201cIf you're not well-fed, and your body is intoxicated with pesticides and you have lots of diseases in your body, you're going to be less heat-tolerant than if you were healthy,\u201d said Margarita L\u00f3pez-Uribe, a pollinator health expert at Pennsylvania State University.",
      "Earlier this year, preliminary results from the annual U.S. Beekeeping Survey found that beekeepers lost almost 56% of their managed colonies, the highest loss since the survey started in 2010.",
      "Almost all of the managed honeybee colonies in the U.S. are used to pollinate agricultural crops such as almonds, apples, cherries and blueberries. Fewer pollinators can lead to less pollination and potentially lower yields.",
      "\u201cIt's a very fragile system if you think about it,\u201d L\u00f3pez-Uribe said. \u201cBecause if something goes wrong, you have these super high-value crops that won\u2019t get enough bees for pollination.\u201d",
      "Back at Barnes' hives in Ohio, thousands of honeybees fly around as he gathers boxes to take back to his farm for honey production. Nearby, a couple of his bees land on milkweed flowers, a rare bit of plant diversity in an area dominated by corn and soybean fields.",
      "For Barnes, who operates Honeyrun Farm with his wife, Jayne, one of the challenges heat can pose to his 500 honeybee hives is fending off parasitic mites that threaten the bees. If temperatures get too hot, he can\u2019t apply formic acid, an organic chemical that kills the mites. If it\u2019s applied when it\u2019s too hot, the bees could die.",
      "Last year they lost almost a third of the 400 hives they sent to California to help pollinate commercial almond groves. Barnes thinks those hives may have been in poor health ahead of pollination because they were unable to ward off mites when it was hot months earlier.",

      "Sometimes the heat helps. Here in Ohio, Barnes' hives last summer produced a bumper crop of honey as they feasted on nearby soybean nectar as the plants bloomed in the heat. Still, the lack of diverse plants for bees to forage in an area dominated by corn and soybean fields isn't ideal.",
      "And even the native blooms are appearing erratically, Barnes said. In autumn, his bees search for food on goldenrod, but those blooms are appearing later. And even then, he has supplemented his hive with additional food to keep them healthy into the winter.",
      "\u201cEvery single plant that blooms is something that the bee can use,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cAnd every single plant is affected by climate change.\u201d",
      "It's only in the last decade that people have become aware of the magnitude of the pollinator decline globally, said Harrison, of Arizona State University. Data is limited on how much climate change and heat stress is contributing to pollinator decline.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a relatively new focus for biology,\" he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s super important, but it\u2019s not being studied a ton.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration's proposed budget would eliminate the research program that funds the USGS Bee Lab, which supports the inventory, monitoring and natural history of the nation\u2019s wild bees. Other grants for bee research are also in jeopardy.",
      "U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon said America\u2019s pollinators are in \u201cgrave danger,\u201d and he'll fight for the federal funding. Pollinators contribute to the health of the planet, the crops we grow and the food we eat, he said.",
      "\u201cRather than taking bold action to protect them, the Trump administration has proposed a reckless budget that would zero out funding for critical research aimed at saving important pollinators,\u201d he said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "Harrison said his research on this topic would come to a halt if cuts are made to his federal funding, and it would be more difficult in general for scientists to study the disappearance of bees and other pollinators and improve how they prevent these losses. Not being able to manage these pollinator deaths could cause the price of fruits, vegetables, nuts, coffee and chocolate to jump or become scarce.",
      "\u201cHopefully, even if such research is defunded in the U.S., such research will continue in Europe and China, preventing these extreme scenarios,\u201d said Harrison.",

      "OpenAI should continue to be controlled by a nonprofit because the artificial intelligence technology it is developing is \u201ctoo consequential\u201d to be governed by a corporation alone.",
      "That is the message from an advisory board convened by OpenAI to give it recommendations about its nonprofit structure \u2014 delivered in a report released Thursday, along with a sweeping vision for democratizing AI and reforming philanthropy.",
      "\u201cWe think it\u2019s too important to entrust to any one sector, the private sector or even the government sector,\u201d said Daniel Zingale, the convener of OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit commission and a former adviser to three California governors. \u201cThe nonprofit model allows for what we call a common sector,\u201d that facilitates democratic participation.",
      "The recommendations are not binding on OpenAI, but the advisory commission, which includes the labor organizer Dolores Huerta, offers a framework that may be used to judge OpenAI in the future, whether or not they adopt it.",
      "In the commission's view, communities that are already feeling the impacts of AI technologies should have input on how they are developed, including how data about them is used. But there are currently few avenues for people to influence tech companies who control much of the development of AI.",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, started in 2015 as a nonprofit research laboratory and has since incorporated a for-profit company with a valuation that has grown to $300 billion. The company has tried to change its structure since the nonprofit board ousted its CEO Sam Altman in Nov. 2023. He was reinstated days later and continues to lead OpenAI.",
      "It has run into hurdles escaping its nonprofit roots, including scrutiny from the attorney generals in California and Delaware, who have oversight of nonprofits, and a lawsuit by Elon Musk, an early donor to and founder of OpenAI.",
      "Most recently, OpenAI has said it will turn its for-profit company into a public benefit corporation, which must balance the interests of shareholders and its mission. Its nonprofit will hold shares in that new corporation, but OpenAI has not said how much.",
      "Zingale said Huerta told the commission their challenge was to help make sure AI is a blessing and not a curse. To grapple with those stakes, they envision a nonprofit with an expansive mandate to help everyone participate in the development and trajectory of AI.",
      "\u201cThe measure of this nonprofit will be in what it builds, who it includes, and how faithfully it endures to mission and impact,\" they wrote.",
      "The commission toured California communities and solicited feedback online. They heard that many were inspired by OpenAI\u2019s mission to create artificial intelligence to benefit humanity and ensure those benefits are felt widely and evenly.",

      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- Wednesday\u2019s magnitude 7.3 earthquake off Alaska's Aleutian Islands chain struck in a region that has experienced a handful of powerful quakes within the last five years \u2014 including one that shook communities almost exactly two years earlier.",
      "Officials said Thursday they had received no reports of injuries or major damage from the latest event, which triggered a tsunami warning that lasted about an hour before being downgraded and prompted communities along a 700-mile (1,127-km) stretch of Alaska\u2019s southern coast to urge people to move to higher ground. The official maximum wave height at Sand Point, a community 55 miles (88 kilometers) north of the epicenter, was about 3.9 inches (10 centimeters), said Kara Sterling, a lead duty scientist at the National Tsunami Warning Center. It occurred at low tide.",
      "The earthquake struck at 12:37 p.m. local time, prompting the center's tsunami warning.",
      "There are a number of ways people in warning areas can receive notifications, including the sounding of sirens in communities that have them, listening to weather radio or public radio broadcasts, following official accounts on social media, or via push alerts on cellphones. In some places, local officials have relayed warnings door to door, said Jeremy Zidek, a spokesperson with the state's emergency management division.",
      "Public safety departments in King Cove and Unalaska sent alerts urging those in coastal areas or those that could see inundation to seek higher ground.",
      "The warning issued by the center was downgraded to an advisory before being canceled around 2:45 p.m.",
      "Alaska is the most earthquake-prone state in the U.S. and one of the most seismically active regions in the world, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The state experiences a magnitude 7 earthquake almost annually, and the second-largest earthquake ever recorded was centered about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Anchorage, the agency said. That 1964 magnitude 9.2 earthquake \u2014 and the tsunami it triggered \u2014 killed about 130 people.",
      "The Aleutian arc is no stranger to earthquakes, but the activity in the region where Wednesday's earthquake struck has gotten scientists' attention. The area, within a few hundred miles of the earthquake, has \u201clit up\u201d since 2020, with Wednesday's earthquake marking the fifth exceeding magnitude 7.0 since 2020, said state seismologist Michael West.",
      "\u201cI would not call this an isolated earthquake. It appears to be part of a larger sequence spanning the last several years,\" he said. But West added: \u201cThere's no reason to be alarmist about this.\u201d",

      "Zidek and West said people should continue to heed warnings. West said he worries about a \u201cburnout effect\u201d among residents in the region, some of whom have evacuated numerous times since 2018 in response to larger earthquakes that have not caused significant damage.",

      "San Jose\u2019s mayor is using AI tools like ChatGPT to streamline city operations and improve services for its 1 million residents",
      "Before the mayor of San Jose, California, arrives at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new business, his aides ask ChatGPT to help draft some talking points.",
      "\u201cElected officials do a tremendous amount of public speaking,\u201d said Mayor Matt Mahan, whose recent itinerary has taken him from new restaurant and semiconductor startup openings to a festival of lowriding car culture.",
      "Other politicians might be skittish admitting a chatbot co-wrote their speech or that it helped draft a $5.6 billion budget for the new fiscal year, but Mahan is trying to lead by example, pushing a growing number of the nearly 7,000 government workers running Silicon Valley's biggest city to embrace artificial intelligence technology.",
      "Mahan said adopting AI tools will eliminate drudge work and help the city better serve its roughly 1 million residents.",
      "He\u2019s hardly the only public or private sector executive directing an AI-or-bust strategy, though in some cases, workers have found that the costly technology can add hassles or mistakes.",
      "\u201cThe idea is to try things, be really transparent, look for problems, flag them, share them across different government agencies, and then work with vendors and internal teams to problem solve,\u201d Mahan said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s always bumpy with new technologies.\u201d",
      "By next year, the city intends to have 1,000, or about 15%, of its workers trained to use AI tools for a variety of tasks, including pothole complaint response, bus routing and using vehicle-tracking surveillance cameras to solve crimes.",
      "One of San Jose's early adopters was Andrea Arjona Amador, who leads electric mobility programs at the city\u2019s transportation department. She has already used ChatGPT to secure a $12 million grant for electric vehicle chargers.",
      "Arjona Amador set up a customized \u201cAI agent\u201d to review the correspondence she was receiving about various grant proposals and asked it to help organize the incoming information, including due dates. Then, she had it help draft the 20-page document.",
      "So far, San Jose has spent more than $35,000 to purchase 89 ChatGPT licenses -- at $400 per account -- for city workers to use.",
      "\u201cThe way it used to work, before I started using this, we spent a lot of evenings and weekends trying to get grants to the finish line,\u201d she said. The Trump administration later rescinded the funding, so she pitched a similar proposal to a regional funder not tied to the federal government.",
      "Arjona Amador, who learned Spanish and French before she learned English, also created another customized chatbot to edit the tone and language of her professional writings.",
      "With close relationships to some of the tech industry's biggest players, including San Francisco-based OpenAI and Mountain View-based Google, the mayors of the Bay Area's biggest cities are helping to promote the type of AI adoption that the tech industry is striving for, while also promising guidelines and standards to avoid the technology's harms.",
      "San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie announced a plan Monday to give nearly 30,000 city workers, including nurses and social workers, access to Microsoft\u2019s Copilot chatbot, which is based on the same technology that powers ChatGPT. San Francisco's plan says it comes with \u201crobust privacy and bias safeguards, and clear guidelines to ensure technology enhances \u2014 not replaces \u2014 human judgment.\u201d",
      "San Jose has similar guidelines and hasn't yet reported any major mishaps with its pilot projects. Such problems have attracted attention elsewhere because of the technology's propensity to spew false information, known as hallucinations.",

      "Earlier this year, when OpenAI introduced a new pilot product called Operator, it promised a new kind of tool that went beyond a chatbot's capabilities. Instead of just analyzing documents and producing passages of text, it could also access a computer system and schedule calendars or perform tasks on a person's behalf.

      "For 37 years in a searing California desert, runners from across the globe have embarked on a 135-mile race through one of the hottest places on Earth",
      "DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK, Calif. -- When the running gets hard in this desert dubbed \u201chell on Earth,\u201d Danny Westergaard tells himself: \u201cSlow and steady\u201d or \u201csmooth as butter.\u201d",
      "For 18 years, Westergaard, 66, has braved the scorching summer heat of California\u2019s Death Valley in an ultramarathon billed as the world\u2019s toughest. Last week, 99 runners from across the globe embarked on a grueling 135 mile (217.26 kilometer) competition from the lowest point below sea level of North America to the trailhead of the highest peak in the contiguous U.S. They had 48 hours to do it. Few have completed the competition as many times as Westergaard, though finishing is not a given.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just become like a summer ritual and a family reunion,\" he said. \u201cI feel at home when I\u2019m here. It\u2019s my tribe.\u201d",
      "For the 37th year, the Badwater 135 Ultramarathon challenged athletes to withstand stretches of this dry, searing desert. The race takes place in July, when temperatures have soared into the 130s F (54.44s C). Even as a place of extremes, Death Valley is not immune to global warming. Seven of its hottest summers have occurred in the past 10 years, according to the National Park Service. And if planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current pace, more places could experience its broiling temperatures.",
      "Over two days, Westergaard would trek up and down mountain ranges, past sand dunes and salt flats, through quaint towns and vast desertscapes amid temperatures as high as 117 F (47.22 C). He tried to smile throughout, even when he felt miserable.",
      "\u201cIt just lifts you up,\u201d he said of smiling so others smile back.",
      "At 8 p.m., the first wave of runners take off. Westergaard jogs up a ramp into the pale light of dusk. It\u2019s 113 F (45 C), and it feels like a blow dryer to the face.",
      "Leap frogging in a van behind him is his cheer squad and support crew \u2013 Jennifer Drain, his smiley cousin back for the 17th year, and daughters Meagan, who has attended before, and Madison, a first timer. The crew, who playfully call Westergaard \"wiener dog,\u201d are hauling everything he needs: food, ice, water, electrolytes.",
      "This heat can kill. Soaring body temperatures can lead to organ failure and strain the heart, especially for people with heart disease, and cause heat stroke. To prevent that they keep him cool. They spray mist on him and pour ice into his hat and a bandana wrapped around his neck. His drinking water is ice cold.",
      "A few hours in, Meagan asks her dad if he\u2019s peed. \u201cLong stream,\" he responded of his amount of urine. Staying hydrated is critical. As he sweats, he\u2019s losing liquids that can critically stress kidneys if not replenished. Dehydration can cause organs to fail from lack of blood, oxygen and nutrients, leading to seizures and death.",
      "No runners have died doing the competition, but heat-related issues are common, said Megan Dell, the race's medical director. Stomach issues can lead to vomiting and dehydration. Hyponatremia \u2014 which happens when your blood's sodium is too low \u2014 has sent runners to the hospital.",
      "Westergaard has learned to embrace the rollercoaster. One moment he feels like Superman \u2014 the next he could be throwing up on the side of the road, questioning if he\u2019ll make it. \u201cYou just suck it up, just like in life, and get through the lows, and it always gets better.\u201d",
      "The runners dash toward mile 50.8 (81.75 kilometers), the critical cut off point they must get to by 10 a.m. or be eliminated. The sun is peaking over the mountains, casting a warm glow over dune fields. It\u2019s 85 F (29.44 C).",
      "\u201cLiving the dream, ey?\u201d Westergaard said with a smile, his perky strut now a droopy shuffle.",
      "He pours water on his face and arms and munches some watermelon. Madison paces behind him as they crack jokes. \u201cGet er done! Junior wiener in training!\u201d Meagan yelled.",
      "Westergaard makes it to the cut off point before 9 a.m. It\u2019s 90 F (32.2 C).",
      "Mile 56 (90.12 kilometers): After moving for 14 hours straight, Westergaard rests and eats some avocado toast. \u201cGreat! Let\u2019s motor!\u201d he said after 10 minutes sitting on a chair.",
      "Miles later, he begins his descent into \u201cthe oven\u201d that is Panamint Valley, usually the hottest part of the race during the hottest part of the day. It\u2019s 96 F (35.56 C) and the heat sizzles from above and below. Westergaard runs on the white line on the road because it\u2019s cooler. In hotter years, the asphalt got so hot the bottoms of his shoes felt sticky on the ground.",
      "Westergaard trains year round to acclimate to the heat. As he gets older, he doesn't tolerate heat as well and has slowed down. His two-hour sauna sessions are now one, and he runs a few times a week instead of daily.",

      "A coalition of philanthropic funders will spend $1 billion over 15 years to help develop artificial intelligence tools to help spur economic mobility",
      "A coalition of funders, including the Gates Foundation and Ballmer Group, will spend $1 billion over 15 years to help develop artificial intelligence tools for public defenders, parole officers, social workers and others who help Americans in precarious situations.",
      "The funders announced Thursday that they will create a new entity, NextLadder Ventures, to offer grants and investments to nonprofits and for-profits to develop tools for those who often manage huge caseloads with few resources.",
      "\u201cThe solutions that we\u2019re investing in, the hundreds of entrepreneurs that are going to bring forward solutions that incorporate leading edge technologies, are going to do it by coming alongside people who are living through some of the struggles in the economy,\u201d said Brian Hooks, CEO of Stand Together, a nonprofit started by Kansas-based billionaire Charles Koch.",
      "The other funders include hedge fund founder John Overdeck and Valhalla Foundation, which was started by Inuit cofounder Steve Cook and his wife Signe Ostby. Ballmer Group is the philanthropy of former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and his wife Connie. The funders declined to reveal the exact financial commitments made by each of the contributors.",
      "The point of investing in these AI tools is to spur economic mobility, a focus all the funders share, they said. The funders believe there are many ideas for how AI technologies could help match people with resources after a disaster or an eviction, for example, or help a parole officer close out more cases for people who have met all of the criteria but are waiting for the paperwork to be processed.",
      "\u201cAs we traded notes on where we were making investments and where we saw broader gaps in the sector, it was readily apparent that there was a real opportunity to come together as a group of cofunders and cofounders to establish a new kind of investment organization,\u201d said Kevin Bromer, who leads the technology and data strategy at Ballmer Group. He will also serve as a member on NextLadder's board, which will include three independent board members and representatives from the other funders.",
      "NextLadder will be led by Ryan Rippel, who previously directed the Gates Foundation's economic mobility portfolio. The funder group has not yet determined if NextLadder will incorporate as a nonprofit or a for profit organization but said any returns they make from investments will go back into funding new initiatives.",
      "NextLadder will partner with AI company Anthropic, which will offer technical expertise and access to its technologies to the nonprofits and companies it invests in. Anthropic has committed around $1.5 million annually to the partnership, said Elizabeth Kelly, its head of beneficial deployments, which is a team that focuses on giving back to society.",
      "\u201cWe want to hand-hold grantees through their use of Claude with the same care and commitment we provide to our largest enterprise customers,\u201d Kelly said, referencing Anthropic's large language model.",
      "Hooks, of Stand Together, said philanthropy can reduce the riskiness of these types of investments and offer organizations more time to prove out their ideas.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re successful, this will be the first capital to demonstrate what\u2019s possible,\u201d Hooks said.",

      "Cleaning your electronic devices is essential for hygiene and performance",
      "LONDON -- Smartphones, laptops, headphones and other electronic devices are essential for work and play in our daily lives. But all that time spent typing, scrolling or listening also means our devices gradually accumulate grime that needs to be cleaned off.",
      "You might not give much thought to cleaning your devices but there are reasons you should, says Logitech, which makes keyboards, webcams and other computer peripherals.",
      "\u201cRegular cleaning and proper maintenance not only keeps your gadgets looking pristine, and wins you hygiene points, it also helps them perform better and last longer,\u201d the company says. \u201cIn the case of devices like earbuds, the accumulated bacteria and debris may even cause health issues or discomfort.\u201d",
      "Here are some pointers on cleaning your tech:",
      "Always check if the manufacturer has any specific guidelines for cleaning.",
      "Assemble some basic equipment and material for cleaning, which should include a soft and lint-free cleaning cloth, like a microfiber cloth; cotton swabs; a soft-bristled brush like a toothbrush, paintbrush or makeup brush; compressed air and isopropyl alcohol.",
      "Isopropyl, or rubbing alcohol, is a non-toxic cleaning solvent that\u2019s antiseptic and antibacterial. It's popular for cleaning electronics because it doesn\u2019t leave any residue and dries quickly. But you might want to wear gloves to avoid skin irritation. Drip some of it on a cloth instead of pouring it directly onto your device. Also heed some of the more specific warnings below.",
      "Water and mild soap can be useful for cleaning dirty surfaces, but isopropyl alcohol is recommended for cleaning the internals of a device, said Alex Diaz-Kokaisl, senior technical writer at electronics repair company iFixit.",
      "\u201cWhile there isn\u2019t a hard-and-fast rule for cleaning electronics, we generally use high-concentration isopropyl alcohol (more than 90%) because it evaporates quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe faster a liquid evaporates, the less likely it is to affect any components that conduct electricity.\u201d",
      "For whatever device you're cleaning, disconnect or power it off first. Remove any cases, plugs, covers and accessories.",
      "When using a computer, the keyboard and mouse are the parts that are touched most often and therefore need the most frequent cleaning. And all those crevices between a keyboard's keys are sure to catch crumbs.",
      "To remove any loose debris, iFixit's official in-house cleaning guide recommends using a can of compressed air. Run the spray back and forth across the keys to blow out any bits. If possible, hold the keyboard upside down so the debris falls out.",
      "If you don\u2019t have compressed air, Logitech suggests using a hair dryer on the cold air setting. Some social media users also recommend a handheld balloon pump.",
      "Next, dampen a cleaning cloth with water and gently wipe down the keyboard and mouse.",
      "Logitech says you can also use rubbing alcohol but recommends you test it first on an inconspicuous spot to make sure it doesn't cause discoloration or scrub the lettering off the keys.",
      "Anti-bacterial baby wipes can also work on devices like a mouse, Diaz-Kokaisl said.",

      "Use a cotton swab to wipe the earbud nozzles clean.",

The Army leases a key part of Pohakuloa Training Area on the Big Island from the state and its contract to do so expires in 2029. It wants to be able to continue using the land so it can quickly send troops from Hawaii to Asia and the Pacific, something that is growing in importance as China becomes more assertive particularly regarding Taiwan.",

      "Teenagers are turning to AI for advice, guidance and conversation",
      "As artificial intelligence technology becomes part of daily life, adolescents are turning to chatbots for advice, guidance and conversation. The appeal is clear: Chatbots are patient, never judgmental, supportive and always available.",
      "That worries experts who say the booming AI industry is largely unregulated and that many parents have no idea about how their kids are using AI tools or the extent of personal information they are sharing with chatbots.",
      "New research shows more than 70% of American teenagers have used AI companions and more than half converse with them regularly. The study by Common Sense Media focused on \u201cAI companions,\u201d like Character. AI, Nomi and Replika, which it defines as \u201cdigital friends or characters you can text or talk with whenever you want,\u201d versus AI assistants or tools like ChatGPT, though it notes they can be used the same way.",
      "It\u2019s important that parents understand the technology. Experts suggest some things parents can do to help protect their kids:",
      "\u2014 Start a conversation, without judgment, says Michael Robb, head researcher at Common Sense Media. Approach your teen with curiosity and basic questions: \u201cHave you heard of AI companions?\u201d \u201cDo you use apps that talk to you like a friend?\u201d Listen and understand what appeals to your teen before being dismissive or saying you\u2019re worried about it.",
      "\u2014 Help teens recognize that AI companions are programmed to be agreeable and validating. Explain that\u2019s not how real relationships work and that real friends with their own points of view can help navigate difficult situations in ways that AI companions cannot.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that's really concerning is not only what's happening on screen but how much time it\u2019s taking kids away from relationships in real life,\u201d says Mitch Prinstein, chief of psychology at the American Psychological Association. \u201cWe need to teach kids that this is a form of entertainment. It's not real, and it's really important they distinguish it from reality and should not have it replace relationships in your actual life.\u201d",
      "The APA recently put out a health advisory on AI and adolescent well-being, and tips for parents.",
      "\u2014 Parents should watch for signs of unhealthy attachments.",
      "\u201cIf your teen is preferring AI interactions over real relationships or spending hours talking to AI companions, or showing that they are becoming emotionally distressed when separated from them \u2014 those are patterns that suggest AI companions might be replacing rather than complementing human connection,\u201d Robb says.",
      "\u2014 Parents can set rules about AI use, just like they do for screen time and social media. Have discussions about when and how AI tools can and cannot be used. Many AI companions are designed for adult use and can mimic romantic, intimate and role-playing scenarios.",

If you fall for the idea that easier is better, then you are the most vulnerable to being absorbed into this newly artificial world.\u201d",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Two men accused of homicide and facing a potential death sentence if convicted asked Pennsylvania's highest court Tuesday to restrict a county prosecutor's pursuit of the death penalty, accusing him of misusing it to pressure defendants into guilty pleas or get them to turn state's evidence.",
      "The two defendants filed a petition before the state Supreme Court that suggests a range of actions to limit Washington County District Attorney Jason Walsh's discretion in asking for capital punishment.",
      "\u201cThe arbitrary seeking of the death penalty has become a crisis in Washington County, where a wildly disproportionate number\" of the state's prosecutorial death penalty notices of aggravating factors are filed, wrote lawyers for Jordan Clarke and Joshua George. They say Walsh, a Republican appointed in 2021 and elected to keep the job nearly two years ago, has sought the death penalty in 11 of the county's 18 homicide cases during his term in office.",
      "Walsh on Tuesday disputed the numbers, saying the county has had more than 18 homicide cases over that period. He said several of the cases during his tenure have involved the deaths of children, where one of the aggravating factors required for the death penalty, the young age of the victim, is simple to demonstrate in court.",
      "\u201cIf it fits under the law, prosecutors can seek the death penalty,\u201d Walsh said in a phone interview. \u201cThat's just the law.\u201d",
      "The petition asks the justices to adopt \u201csome or all\u201d of the changes they want. They are asking for Walsh to be required to have an out-of-county judge, the attorney general\u2019s office or a court-appointed special master review decisions to seek the death penalty; to stop the death penalty from being pursued in the cases of the two petitioners; and to get an outside judge to review all death penalty cases filed since the year Walsh took office.",

      "As an example, the filing describes how the prosecutor's office upgraded a woman's charge of conspiracy to commit homicide to add criminal homicide after being told by defense lawyers that conspiracy was not sufficient to face a death penalty.

      "In Clarke\u2019s case, involving a 2-month-old boy\u2019s death, the petition alleges Walsh \u201cintervened to improperly influence the manner of death determination, filed homicide charges and a notice of aggravators before the manner of death was determined, and is pursuing a death sentence based on facially inappropriate aggravating circumstances.\u201d",
      "Walsh said state and federal courts have long upheld the legality of the death penalty. In Pennsylvania, only three people have been executed since the 1970s, and all had given up on their appeals. Appeals and natural deaths have shrunk Pennsylvania's death row from well over 200 two decades ago to 94 inmates currently.",
      "\u201cThis is nothing but a liberal Hail Mary from a liberal think tank,\u201d Walsh said of the newly filed court petition. \u201cThose allegations are nonsensical and without merit.\u201d",

      "The United Nations reports a global shift toward renewable energy, calling it a \"positive tipping point.\"",
      "NEW YORK -- The global switch to renewable energy has passed a \u201cpositive tipping point\u201d where solar and wind power will become even cheaper and more widespread, according to two United Nations reports released Tuesday, describing a bright spot amid otherwise gloomy progress to curb climate change.",
      "Last year, 74% of the growth in electricity generated worldwide was from wind, solar and other green sources, according to the U.N.\u2019s multiagency report, called Seizing the Moment of Opportunity. It found that 92.5% of all new electricity capacity added to the grid worldwide in that time period came from renewables. Meanwhile, sales of electric vehicles are up from 500,000 in 2015 to more than 17 million in 2024.",
      "The three cheapest electricity sources globally last year were onshore wind, solar panels and new hydropower, according to an energy cost report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Solar power now is 41% cheaper and wind power is 53% cheaper globally than the lowest-cost fossil fuel, the reports said. Fossil fuels, which are the chief cause of climate change, include coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "\u201cThe fossil fuel age is flailing and failing,\u201d United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in Tuesday morning speech unveiling the reports. \u201cWe are in the dawn of a new energy era. An era where cheap, clean, abundant energy powers a world rich in economic opportunity.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust follow the money,\u201d Guterres said, quoting the reports that showed last year there was $2 trillion in investment in green energy, which is about $800 billion more than in fossil fuels.",
      "Still, United Nations officials said the switch to renewable energy, while remarkable compared to 10 years ago, is not happening fast enough.",
      "The global renewables growth has been mostly in developed countries such as China \u2014 where one-tenth of the economy is tied up in green energy \u2014 as well as countries such as India and Brazil.",
      "Yet Africa represented less than 2% of the new green energy capacity installed last year despite having great electrification needs, the reports said. United Nations officials blamed the high cost of capital for the Global South.",
      "\u201cThe Global South must be empowered to generate its own electricity without adding to already unsustainable level of debts,\u201d said Bahamian climate scientist Adelle Thomas of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Thomas, who did not work on the reports, added that they debunk the myth that clean energy cannot compete with fossil fuels, instead showing a clean energy future is not just possible but likely inevitable.",
      "The U.N. reports are \u201cright on the money,\" said University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck, who also wasn't part of the studies. He said the economic tipping point leads to a cycle that keeps driving renewable costs down and makes fossil fuel power less and less desirable.",
      "And renewables are booming despite fossil fuels getting nearly nine times the government consumption subsidies as they do, Guterres and the reports said. In 2023, global fossil fuel subsidies amounted to $620 billion, compared to $70 billion for renewables, the U.N. report said.",

      "\u201cA typical AI data center eats up as much electricity as 100,000 homes,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cBy 2030 data centers could consume as much electricity as all of Japan does today.\u201d",

But since President Donald Trump took office earlier this year, his administration has withdrawn the nation from the landmark Paris climate accord and cut many federal renewable energy programs, with a renewed emphasis on fossil fuels.",

      "In January, President Donald Trump ordered the release of thousands of classified governmental documents about Kennedy's assassination, while also moving to declassify federal records related to the deaths of New York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and King more than five decades ago.",
      "Trump ordered Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Attorney General Pam Bondi to coordinate with other government officials to review records related to the assassinations of RFK and King, and present a plan to the president for their \u201ccomplete release.\u201d Some 10,000 pages of records about the RFK assassination were released April 18.",

King\u2019s family, including his two living children, Martin III and Bernice, was given advance notice of the release and had their own teams reviewing the records ahead of the public disclosure.",
      "In a statement released Monday, King's children called their father\u2019s case a \u201ccaptivating public curiosity for decades.\u201d But they also emphasized the personal nature of the matter and urged that \u201cthese files must be viewed within their full historical context.\u201d",

      "San Francisco is set to ban homeless people from living in RVs with a new citywide parking limit of two hours on large vehicles",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- San Francisco is set to ban homeless people from living in RVs by adopting strict new parking limits the mayor says are necessary to keep sidewalks clear and prevent trash build-up.",
      "The policy, up for final approval by San Francisco supervisors Tuesday, targets at least 400 recreational vehicles in the city of 800,000 people. The RVs serve as shelter for people who can't afford housing, including immigrant families with kids.",
      "Those who live in them say they're a necessary option in an expensive city where affordable apartments are impossible to find. But Mayor Daniel Lurie and other supporters of the policy say motor homes are not suitable for long-term living and the city has a duty to both provide shelter to those in need and clean up the streets.",
      "\u201cWe absolutely want to serve those families, those who are in crisis across San Francisco,\u201d said Kunal Modi, who advises the mayor on health, homelessness and family services. \u201cWe feel the responsibility to help them get to a stable solution. And at the same time, we want to make sure that that stability is somewhere indoors and not exposed in the public roadway.\u201d",
      "Critics of the plan, however, say that it's cruel to force people to give up their only home in exchange for a shot at traditional housing when there is not nearly enough units for all the people who need help; the mayor is only offering additional money to help 65 households.",
      "Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness, says city officials are woefully behind on establishing details of an accompanying permit program, which will exempt RV residents from parking limits so long as they are working with homeless outreach staff to find housing.",
      "\u201cI think that there\u2019s going to be people who lose their RVs. I think there\u2019s going to be people who are able to get into shelter, but at the expense\" of people with higher needs, like those sleeping on a sidewalk, she said.",
      "San Francisco, like other U.S. cities, has seen an explosion in recent years of people living out of vehicles and RVs as the cost of living has risen. Banning oversized vehicles is part of Lurie's pledge to clean up San Francisco streets, and part of a growing trend to require homeless people to accept offers of shelter or risk arrest or tows.",
      "The proposal sets a two-hour parking limit citywide for all RVs and oversized vehicles longer than 22 feet (7 meters) or higher than 7 feet (2 meters), regardless of whether they are being used as housing.",
      "Under the accompanying permit program, RV residents registered with the city as of May are exempt from the parking limits. In exchange, they must accept the city's offer of temporary or longer-term housing, and get rid of their RV when it's time to move. The city has budgeted more than half a million dollars to buy RVs from residents at $175 per foot.",
      "The permits will last for six months. People in RVs who arrive after May will not be eligible for the permit program and must abide by the two-hour rule, which makes it impossible for a family in an RV to live within city limits.",
      "It first cleared the Board of Supervisors last week with two of 11 supervisors voting \u201cno.\u201d",
      "Carlos Perez, 55, was among RV residents who told supervisors at a hearing this month that they could not afford the city's high rents. Perez works full-time as a produce deliveryman and supports his brother, who lives with him and is unable to work due to a disability.",

For Zach, who is able-bodied, maintains a clean space and has no dependents, moving to a shelter would be a step down, he says. Still, he expects to receive a permit.",

      "Two weeks after deadly floods swept through Texas, officials dropped the number of still-missing people in the hardest-hit area to three \u2014 down from nearly 160 in the days following the July Fourth weekend floods",
      "DALLAS -- Texas officials labored to account for more than 160 people originally reported missing along the Guadalupe River after the deadly July Fourth floods before ultimately concluding that most were safe and only three individuals still haven't been found, the top executive in the hardest-hit county said Monday.",
      "\u201cMost of them were tourists that came into town and left and went back home and didn\u2019t report that they were there,\u201d Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly said at a special meeting of the county commissioner court. He called the process a \u201cHerculean effort.\"",
      "The flash floods killed at least 135 people in Texas, and most of the deaths were in Kerr County, where destructive, fast-moving water rose 26 feet (8 meters) on the Guadalupe River, washing away buildings and vehicles in the area about 60 miles (100 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio.",
      "The sharp revision in the number of missing by Kerr County officials on Saturday followed a familiar pattern in the often chaotic aftermath of large-scale disasters. Hundreds of people were reported missing in the initial days after the floods through a phone hotline and email address, which launched investigators on an \u201cexhaustive effort\u201d to verify the status of each of those individuals, Kerrville police spokesperson Jonathan Lamb said.",
      "\u201cWe understand how critical it is to report this information accurately \u2014 not only for the families affected but for the integrity of our emergency response as a whole,\u201d Lamb said.",
      "Drastic changes in the missing count after a disaster aren\u2019t unusual.",
      "For instance, the death count from the 2023 Maui fire was eventually found to be just over 100 \u2014 far below the 1,100 initially feared missing.",
      "In 2017, a wildfire in Northern California\u2019s wine country killed more than 20 people, but most of the 100 people initially reported missing were located safe.",
      "The 2018 wildfire that largely destroyed the California town of Paradise ended up killing nearly 100 people, though Butte County investigators at one point had the names of more than 3,000 people who were not accounted for in the early days of the disaster. The names were whittled down when the list was published in the local paper, and many people realized for the first time that officials were looking for them.",
      "Texas\u2019 Hill Country is a popular tourist destination, where campers seek out spots along the Guadalupe River amid the rolling landscapes.",
      "Vacation cabins, RV parks and youth campgrounds fill the riverbanks and hills of Kerr County, including Camp Mystic, a century-old Christian summer camp for girls where at least 27 campers and counselors died in the floods.",

      "The flooding was far more severe than the 100-year event envisioned by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, experts said, and it moved so quickly in the middle of the night that it caught many off guard in Kerr County, which lacked a warning system.",
      "At a July 14 news conference, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott had lowered the number of still-missing in the state to about 100 and suggested that pinning down that number was difficult. In the days after the floods, officials had put the number of missing at about 170 statewide with all but about 10 coming from Kerr County alone.",
      "Campers, residents or people who registered at RV parks or hotels are easier to account for, Abbott said. Others may have been reported missing by a friend, family member or coworker.",
      "In Travis County, which includes Austin, the floods killed at least 10 people. The sheriff\u2019s office has said one person remains on their missing list but may be removed if they can verify sightings of the person.",
      "Kristen Dark, a spokesperson for the sheriff\u2019s office, said investigators work the missing person and decedent list \u201cjust like we would work any other cases.\u201d For instance, if someone reports that they haven\u2019t seen their neighbor, deputies might begin by reaching out to the neighbor\u2019s employer and family.",
      "\u201cThey use all kinds of different avenues to see if they can find out either that the person hasn\u2019t been seen or that the person is alive and here\u2019s where they are,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Ozzy Osbourne, the heavy metal legend who rose to fame in the pioneering group Black Sabbath, has died, his family said in a statement to CBS News. He was 76.",
      "\"It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning,\" the family said in the statement. \"He was with his family and surrounded by love. We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.\"",
      "The family's statement didn't provide additional details about the circumstances surrounding Osbourne's death.",
      "Osbourne revealed in 2020 that he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, the movement disorder affecting the nervous system that gets worse over time. A year earlier, the rock star postponed all of his 2019 performances after falling at his home in Los Angeles, which aggravated injuries from a 2003 all-terrain vehicle accident. He announced in 2023 that he would retire from touring.",
      "\"Ozzy was someone who lived hard, rocked hard and retired over and over again, starting, I think, first in the '90s,\" Joe Levy, a contributor for Rolling Stone magazine, told CBS News on Tuesday following news of Osbourne's death. \"He retired at least two times, kept coming back, and the fact that his Parkinson's diagnosis kept him from performing made it all the more amazing that just two weeks ago, he took the stage for what absolutely would be the final time.\"",
      "Either clad in black or bare-chested, the singer was often the target of parents' groups for his imagery and once caused an uproar for biting the head off a bat. Later, he would reveal himself to be a doddering and sweet father on the reality TV show \"The Osbournes.\"",
      "The Big Bang of heavy metal",
      "Black Sabbath's 1969 self-titled debut LP has been likened to the Big Bang of heavy metal. It came during the height of the Vietnam War and crashed the hippie party, dripping menace and foreboding. The cover of the record was of a spooky figure against a stark landscape. The music was loud, dense and angry, and marked a shift in rock 'n' roll.",
      "The band's second album, \"Paranoid,\" included such classic metal tunes as \"War Pigs,\" \"Iron Man\" and \"Fairies Wear Boots.\" The song \"Paranoid\" only reached No. 61 on the Billboard Hot 100 but became in many ways the band's signature song. Both albums were voted among the top 10 greatest heavy metal albums of all time by readers of Rolling Stone magazine.",
      "\"Black Sabbath are the Beatles of heavy metal. Anybody who's serious about metal will tell you it all comes down to Sabbath,\" Dave Navarro of the band Jane's Addiction wrote in a 2010 tribute in Rolling Stone. \"There's a direct line you can draw back from today's metal, through Eighties bands like Iron Maiden, back to Sabbath.\"",
      "Sabbath fired Osbourne in 1979 for his legendary excesses, like showing up late for rehearsals and missing gigs. \"We knew we didn't really have a choice but to sack him because he was just so out of control. But we were all very down about the situation,\" wrote bassist Terry \"Geezer\" Butler in his memoir, \"Into the Void.\"",
      "Osbourne reemerged the next year as a solo artist with \"Blizzard of Ozz\" and the following year's \"Diary of a Madman,\" both hard rock classics that went multi-platinum and spawned enduring favorites such as \"Crazy Train,\" \"Goodbye to Romance,\" \"Flying High Again\" and \"You Can't Kill Rock and Roll.\" Osbourne was twice inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame \u2014 once with Sabbath in 2006 and again in 2024 as a solo artist.",
      "The original Sabbath lineup reunited for the first time in 20 years in July 2025 in the U.K. for what Osborne said would be his final concert. \"Let the madness begin!\" he told 42,000 fans.",
      "Metallica, Guns N Roses, Slayer, Tool, Pantera, Gojira, Alice in Chains, Lamb of God, Halestorm, Anthrax, Rival Sons and Mastodon did sets. Tom Morello, Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, Billy Corgan, Ronnie Wood, Travis Barker, Sammy Hagar, Andrew Watt, Yungblud, Korn's Jonathan Davis, Nuno Bettencourt, Chad Smith and Vernon Reid made appearances. Actor Jason Momoa was the host for the festivities.",
      "\"Black Sabbath: we'd all be different people without them, that's the truth,\" said Pantera singer Phil Anselmo. \"I know I wouldn't be up here with a microphone in my hand without Black Sabbath.\"",
      "Outlandish exploits and a classic look",
      "Osbourne embodied the excesses of metal. His outlandish exploits included relieving himself on the Alamo, snorting a line of ants off a sidewalk and, most memorably, biting the head off a live bat that a fan threw onstage during a 1981 concert. (He said he thought it was rubber.)",
      "In a statement posted to its Facebook page Tuesday, the Alamo said it was \"saddened to hear\" of Osbourne's death.",
      "\"His relationship with the Alamo was marked initially by a deeply disrespectful incident in 1982,\" the statement reads. \"This act profoundly and rightfully upset many who hold this site sacred. However, redemption and reconciliation eventually became part of his history as well. In 1992, Ozzy personally apologized to then-Mayor Nelson Wolff and expressed genuine remorse for his actions. Decades later, in 2015, he revisited the Alamo grounds to learn and appreciate the site's profound history, openly demonstrating humility and understanding.\"",
      "Osbourne was sued in 1987 by parents of a 19-year-old teen who died by suicide while listening to his song \"Suicide Solution.\" The lawsuit was dismissed. Osbourne said the song was really about the dangers of alcohol, which caused the death of his friend Bon Scott, lead singer of AC/DC.",
      "Then-Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York claimed in 1990 that Osbourne's songs led to demonic possession and even suicide. \"You are ignorant about the true meaning of my songs,\" the singer wrote back. \"You have also insulted the intelligence of rock fans all over the world.\"",
      "Audiences at Osbourne shows could be mooned or spit on by the singer. They would often be hectored to scream along with the song, but the Satan-invoking Osbourne would usually send the crowds home with their ears ringing and a hearty \"God bless!\"",
      "He started an annual tour \u2014 Ozzfest \u2014   in 1996 after he was rejected from the lineup of what was then the top touring music festival, Lollapalooza. Ozzfest has gone on to host such bands as Slipknot, Tool, Megadeth, Rob Zombie, System of a Down, Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park.",
      "Osbourne's look changed little over his life. He wore his long hair flat, heavy black eye makeup and round glasses, often wearing a cross around his neck. In 2013, he reunited with Black Sabbath for the dour, raw \"13,\" which reached No. 1 on the U.K. Albums Chart and peaked at No. 86 on the U.S. Billboard 200. In 2019, he had a Top 10 hit when featured on Post Malone's \"Take What You Want,\" Osbourne's first song in the Top 10 since 1989.",
      "In 2020, he released the album \"Ordinary Man,\" which had as its title song a duet with Elton John. \"I've been a bad guy, been higher than the blue sky/And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man,\" he sang. In 2022, he landed his first career back-to-back No. 1 rock radio singles from his album \"Patient Number 9,\" which featured collaborations with Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Mike McCready, Chad Smith, Robert Trujillo and Duff McKagan. It earned four Grammy nominations.",
      "At the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2024, Jack Black called him \"greatest frontman in the history of rock and roll\" and \"the Jack Nicholson of rock.\" Osbourne thanked his fans, his guitarist Randy Rhoads and his longtime wife, Sharon.",
      "The beginnings of Black Sabbath",
      "John Michael Osbourne was raised in the gritty city of Birmingham, England. Kids in school nicknamed him Ozzy, short for his surname. As a boy, he loved the Four Seasons, Chuck Berry and Little Richard. The Beatles made a huge impression.",
      "\"They came from Liverpool, which was approximately 60 miles north of where I come from,\" he told Billboard. \"So all of a sudden it was in my grasp, but I never thought it would be as successful as it became.\"",
      "In the late 1960s, Osbourne had teamed up with Butler, guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward as the Polka Tulk Blues Band. They decided to rename the band Earth, but found to their dismay there was another band with that name. So they changed the name to the American title of the classic Italian horror movie \"I Tre Volti Della Paura,\" starring Boris Karloff: Black Sabbath.",
      "Once they found their sludgy, ominous groove, the band was productive, putting out their self-titled debut and \"Paranoid\" in 1970, \"Master of Reality\" in 1971, \"Vol. 4\" in 1972 and \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" in 1973.",
      "The music was all about industrial guitar riffs and disorienting changes in time signatures, along with lyrics that spoke of alienation and doom. \"People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time,\" Osbourne sang in one song. \"All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy/Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify.\"",
      "The Guardian newspaper in 2009 said the band \"introduced working-class anger, stoner sludge grooves and witchy horror-rock to flower power. Black Sabbath confronted the empty platitudes of the 1960s and, along with Altamont and Charles Manson, almost certainly helped kill off the hippy counterculture.\"",
      "After Sabbath, Osbourne had an uncanny knack for calling some of the most creative young guitarists to his side. When he went solo, he hired the brilliant innovator Rhoads, who played on two of Osbourne's finest solo albums, \"Blizzard of Ozz\" and \"Diary of a Madman.\" Rhoads was killed in a freak plane accident in 1982; Osbourne released the live album \"Tribute\" in 1987 in his memory.",
      "Osbourne then signed Jake E. Lee, who lent his talents to the platinum albums \"Bark at the Moon\" and \"The Ultimate Sin.\" Hotshot Zakk Wylde joined Osbourne's band for \"No Rest for the Wicked\" and the multiplatinum \"No More Tears.\"",
      "\"They come along, they sprout wings, they blossom, and they fly off,\" Osbourne said of his players in 1995 to The Associated Press. \"But I have to move on. To get a new player now and again boosts me on.\"",
      "Music world reacts to Osbourne's death",
      "Several musicians and celebrities, including Osbourne's Black Sabbath bandmates, took to social media to respond Tuesday to the news of his death.",
      "\"I just can't believe it! My dear dear friend Ozzy has passed away only weeks after our show at Villa Park,\" Black Sabbath guitarist and band co-founder Tony Iommi\u00a0wrote on X, referring to the farewell show earlier this month. \"It's just such heartbreaking news that I can't really find the words, there won't ever be another like him. Geezer, Bill and myself have lost our brother. My thoughts go out to Sharon and all the Osbourne family. Rest in peace Oz.\"",
      "Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler wrote on X: \"Goodbye dear friend - thanks for all those years - we had some great fun. 4 kids from Aston- who'd have thought, eh? So glad we got to do it one last time, back in Aston. Love you.\"",
      "On Instagram, Elton John described Osbourne as a \"dear friend and a huge trailblazer who secured his place in the pantheon of rock gods \u2014 a true legend. He was also one of the funniest people I've ever met. I will miss him dearly. To Sharon and the family, I send my condolences and love.\"",
      "Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, who took part in Osbourne's farewell concert, wrote on X that he was \"so very sad to hear of the death of Ozzy Osbourne. What a lovely goodbye concert he had at Back To The Beginning in Birmingham.\"",
      "Kiss co-founder Gene Simmons called Osbourne a \"giant\" who was \"Admired and loved by millions of fans worldwide. Prayers and condolences go out to the Osborne family.\"",
      "Actor Jason Momoa, who hosted the farewell show, wrote on Instagram, \"Love you @ozzyosbourne All my aloha @sharonosbourne and ohana. So grateful. RIP.\"",
      "Mike McCready, lead guitarist and founding member of Pearl Jam, wrote on X that he discovered Black Sabbath's music in high school.",
      "\"'War Pigs' was terrifying and mesmerizing at the same time,\" McCready wrote. \"It was Ozzy's voice that took me away to a dark universe. A great escape. Then when The 'Blizzard of Ozz' record came out I was instantly a fan. Randy Rhoads was an influence on me to play lead guitar. Luckily I got to play on the song 'Immortal' on the last record. Thanks for the music, Ozzy it makes our journey in life better.\"",
      "Courting controversy \u2014 and wholesomeness",
      "Whomever he was playing with, Osbourne wasn't likely to back down from controversy. He had the last laugh when the TV evangelist the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart in 1986 lambasted various rock groups and rock magazines as \"the new pornography,\" prompting some retailers to pull Osbourne's album.",
      "When Swaggart later was caught with a sex worker in 1988, Osbourne put out the song \"Miracle Man\" about his foe: \"Miracle man got busted/miracle man got busted,\" he sang. \"Today I saw a Miracle Man, on TV cryin'/Such a hypocritical man, born again, dying.\"",
      "Much later, a whole new Osbourne would be revealed when \"The Osbournes,\" which ran on MTV from 2002-2005, showed this one-time self-proclaimed madman drinking Diet Cokes as he struggled to find the History Channel on his new satellite television or warning his kids not to smoke or drink before they embarked on a night on the town.",
      "Later, he and his son Jack toured America on the travel show \"Ozzy & Jack's World Detour,\" where the pair visited such places as Mount Rushmore and the Space Center Houston. Osbourne was honored in 2014 with the naming of a bat frog found in the Amazon that makes high-pitched, batlike calls. It was dubbed Dendropsophus ozzyi.",
      "He also met Queen Elizabeth II during her Golden Jubilee weekend. He was standing next to singer-actor Cliff Richard. \"She took one look at the two of us, said 'Oh, so this is what they call variety, is it?' then cracked up laughing. I honestly thought that Sharon had slipped some acid into my cornflakes that morning,\" he wrote in \"I Am Ozzy.\"",
      "Thelma Riley and Osbourne married in 1971; Osbourne adopted her son Elliot Kingsley, and they had two more children, Jessica and Louis. Osbourne later met Sharon, who became her own celebrity persona, when she was running her father's Los Angeles office. Her father was Don Arden, a top concert promoter and artist manager. She went to Osbourne's hotel in Los Angeles to collect money, which Osbourne had spent on drugs.",
      "\"She says she'll come back in three days and I'd better have it. I'd always fancied her and I thought, 'Ah, she's coming back! Maybe I have a chance.' I had pizza hanging from my hair, cigarette ashes on my shirt,\" he told the Los Angeles Times in 2000. They married in 1982, had three children \u2014 Kelly, Aimee and Jack \u2014 and endured periodic separations and reconciliations.",
      "He is survived by Sharon, and his children.",

      "Warner was assisted by people who were at the beach, but he was declared dead by the staff of the Costa Rican Red Cross, the department said. An autopsy determined his cause of death to be asphyxiation by submersion.",
      "In a statement Monday, the Costa Rican Red Cross said it was alerted to a water accident on Sunday at 2:10 p.m. local time, and it dispatched three ambulances.",
      "The Red Cross said two adult men were treated on-site and one was transferred to a local clinic in critical condition. They tried to resuscitate Warner, but he didn't show vital signs and was declared dead. Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Department said the other person involved in the incident had \"entered the sea to try to help Mr. Warner.\"",
      "Warner starred as Theo Huxtable on \"The Cosby Show\" from 1984 to 1992. His performance earned him an Emmy nomination for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series in 1986.",
      "In 2023, Warner told CBS Pittsburgh that being part of \"The Cosby Show\" was an \"awesome\" experience.",
      "\"That show had such an impact on the culture here in America but also a global impact on how Black people saw ourselves globally and how the rest of the world saw us,\" he said. \"So I'm proud to have been part of that legacy and it's been a great ride ever since.\"",
      "Warner said in a 2015 interview with The Associated Press that he was saddened that the show's legacy was \"tarnished\" by \"Cosby Show\" patriarch Bill Cosby, who was\u00a0accused of sexual assault by multiple women. Cosby's\u00a0conviction in a Pennsylvania case\u00a0was later overturned.",
      "Warner went on to star in other TV shows, including \"Malcolm & Eddie\" (1996-2000), \"Reed Between the Lines\" (2011-2015) and \"The Resident\" (2018-2023). He also voiced The Producer on \"The Magic School Bus\" (1994-1997). He made his feature film debut in \"Drop Zone\" in 1994.",
      "Warner also directed episodes of several TV shows, including \"The Cosby Show,\" \"All That,\" \"Keenan & Kel\" and \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" according to his biography on his website.",
      "Most recently, he appeared in a few episodes of \"Alert: Missing Persons Unit\" and was hosting the podcast \"Not All Hood,\" looking at the different experiences of Black Americans.",
      "Warner was also a poet and a musician. He won a Grammy for best traditional R&B performance in 2015 for his part in a cover of Stevie Wonder's \"Jesus Children of America,\" and was nominated for another Grammy for best spoken word poetry.",
      "Fellow poet and author Kevin Powell, who was a friend of Warner's, described him as a devoted husband and father who was humble, kind and supportive of other people.",
      "\"You would have never known he was a major child star,\" Powell said in an interview Monday with CBS News. \"He was never someone who was into the celebrity of it. He knew what he was. He knew, you know, that he was America's son. He literally was America's son as the only male child on that historic show, 'The Cosby Show.'\"",
      "Powell said he was struck by the emotional reactions from fans on social media. \"It's someone you came of age with,\" he said of Warner.",
      "Powell recalled publishing a poem Warner wrote in a special issue of the magazine \"African Voices\" for the 50th anniversary of hip-hop in 2023.",
      "Warner was a lifelong hip-hop fan, Powell said, but he also was \"concerned about a lot of the images that were being put out there.\"",
      "\"So that became kind of his thing in the last few years, like how are we representing ourselves as a community, as a people, with the art that we're creating?\" he said. \"That sticks with me because he was someone who understood he had a huge platform. He had a famous name and people would pay attention if he said certain things. ... That's who Malcolm-Jamal was.\"",
      "The news of Warner's death was \"devastating,\" a spokesperson for Bill Cosby said. The spokesperson, Andrew Wyatt, said Cosby compared it to learning of the death of his son Ennis, who was shot and killed in a robbery in 1997. \"It felt the same way,\" Wyatt said.",

    "summary": "He opened such popular NYC institutions as The Odeon, Balthazar and Pastis. But a 2016 stroke, which caused immobility and affected his speech, led to a suicide attempt two years later. He has now penned an irreverent memoir, \"I Regret Almost Everything.\"",
    "story": [
      "Restaurateur Keith McNally hates New Year's Eve \u2013 he doesn't like being told to have a good time. \"I don't like to be forced to enjoy myself,\" he said.",
      "The \"least hospitable man in hospitality,\" as he calls himself, is not a big smiler, either. \"Inside,\" he explained.",
      "It doesn't seem to have hurt. Over 40 years, he's opened some of New York City's most popular restaurants, among them The Odeon, Balthazar, and Pastis \u2013 institutions almost as well-known as some of the bold-face names that frequent them. But McNally himself has never been much of a publicity hound, even less so after suffering a stroke in 2016. \"Naturally I'm a bit embarrassed to be on TV talking like this\u2014who wouldn't be?\" he said. \"But it's good for me to do it, because it gets me free of my embarrassment. Actually, I'm embarrassed talking about embarrassment!\"",
      "But the British-born McNally has largely overcome his embarrassment in a new memoir, \"I Regret Almost Everything.\" \u00a0\"The drawback for me with most memoirs [is], if you're not embarrassed by what you write, you've probably not spoken the truth,\" he said. \"If you don't cringe over every word, it's not the truth.\"",
      "The hardest part to write, he said, was about his suicide attempt, \"because my kids. I didn't want to leave them at all.\"",
      "That suicide attempt was two years after his stroke. He was found by his younger son, George. \"He was supposed to not find me,\" McNally said. \"Like most teenagers he would sleep until noon. But that day he woke up early, at 8:00 o'clock.\"",
      "\"You expected him to be sleeping later, he woke up early, he saw you?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, the bastard just woke up early and saved my life!\" he laughed.",
      "McNally might joke about it now, but the father of five was suffering with an immobile right arm (he was right-handed), back pain, and aphasia (which causes his slurred speech), and his second marriage was falling apart. But as he writes, some sobering words from a doctor made him reflect: \"He said that children who lose a parent to suicide were far more likely to kill themselves than the children of parents who don't. That stopped me in my tracks.\"",
      "Because he had such trouble communicating verbally after his stroke, McNally began using social media. \"I was so embarrassed by my speech and the way I looked, I didn't go to my restaurants for one year,\" he said. \"I was ashamed. But eventually I realized, nothing to be ashamed about. So, not only did I admit it wasn't a bad thing, but I went in on Instagram.\"",
      "McNally went viral in 2022 with a post criticizing former late-night host James Corden for allegedly being rude to the waitstaff at Balthazar. But now, McNally confesses in his book he isn't so sure calling out Corden was fair. He wrote: \"For someone who's hyperconscious of humiliation since suffering a stroke, it now seems monstrous that I didn't consider the humiliation I was subjecting Corden to. I felt like I'd hit the jackpot of a slot machine and thousands of gold coins were spilling out in front of me. That night I ended up with over 90,000 followers. I was intoxicated with self-righteousness.\"",
      "\"Uh-huh, it's true,\" McNally said. \"But afterwards, I felt really bad.\"",
      "Corden later apologized. But the 73-year-old McNally has continued creating a stir online. Take this recent post he wrote about his friend, ABC News' Diane Sawyer, describing a weeklong affair the two had in the 1970s. The story made news \u2026 except that it was completely made up.",
      "I said, \"Some people say, 'Listen, Keith, you know, it's really not cool for you to be sharing this.' And so, did you enjoy that back-and-forth with them?\"",
      "\"Yes. Yeah, I'm afraid, I did, yeah,\" he laughed.",
      "\"And I wonder, do you think that the stroke \u2013 I don't know, is that, does that \u2026\"",
      "\"Say what you think,\" said McNally.",
      "\"Well, is it that you feel a little trapped inside of yourself?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"I've always been a little like this inside. But since my stroke, and now on the outside.\"",
      "McNally grew up in the East End of London, one of four children born to Jack, a dockworker, and Joyce, a house and office cleaner. The family had little money. \"I got angry inside at my parents,\" he said, \"because we had no books in the house, no pictures on the walls. But they couldn't help it. They were working class who grew up with nothing.\"",
      "McNally says he didn't eat in a restaurant until he was 17. \"Most of the time, when we were on a holiday, we would go to the restaurant, they would look the prices outside, and then she'd go, 'Not for us.'\"",
      "And yet, when McNally moved to New York City in 1975 as an aspiring filmmaker, he made ends meet by working in restaurants. \"I didn't eat asparagus until I came here,\" he said. \"And the next day, I went to the doctor because the smell of my \u2026\"",
      "\"That was so pungent from eating the asparagus?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, I thought I was sick! So, I went to the doctor. He said, 'What'd you eat last night?'\" McNally laughed.",
      "\"You know what? You gotta put that in the paperback,\" I said.",
      "In 1980, McNally opened his own restaurant, The Odeon, in the neighborhood of Tribeca, in what had been a no-man's land. An immediate sensation, it established certain McNally \"musts,\" such as the importance of having a hamburger on the menu. \"I don't like hamburgers much myself,\" he said. \"But it's a sign of snobbery not to have a hamburgers.\"",
      "McNally prides himself on putting his staff above even his diners. Some of his employees have been with him for over 30 years. And ever since returning to work post-stroke, McNally has come to appreciate how they feel about him. \"I had to talk to my staff and was really nervous,\" he said. \"They were really kind. In the end, kindness is really essential.\"",
      "I asked, \"The stroke lifted the veil on what they thought of you?\"",
      "\"Yeah, yeah,\" McNally laughed. \"They made me feel good.\"",

    "summary": "Connie Francis was a wholesome pop star of the 1950s and '60s whose personal life was filled with heartbreak and tragedy.",
    "story": [
      "Connie Francis, the wholesome pop star of the 1950s and '60s whose hits include \"Pretty Little Baby\" and whose personal life was filled with heartbreak and tragedy, has died, her friend and publicist, Ron Roberts, announced Thursday. She was 87.",
      "\"It is with a heavy heart and extreme sadness that i inform you of the passing of my dear friend Connie Francis last night,\" Roberts said in a statement posted to Facebook at 1:46 a.m. EDT. \"I know that Connie would approve that her fans are among the first to learn of this sad news.\"",
      "In another post Thursday afternoon, Roberts said Francis died Wednesday in a hospital in Pompano Beach, Florida. She had been hospitalized since late June after experiencing hip pain that led to her using a wheelchair and was later determined to be a pelvic fracture. While Francis was being treated in an intensive care unit, it was confirmed on Tuesday that she had pneumonia, Roberts said.",
      "Francis was a top performer of the pre-Beatles era, rarely off the charts from 1957-64. Able to appeal to both young people and adults, she had more than a dozen top 20 hits, starting with \"Who's Sorry Now?\" and including the No. 1 songs \"Don't Break the Heart That Loves You\" and \"The Heart Has a Mind of Its Own.\" Like other teen favorites of her time, she also starred in several films, including \"Where the Boys Are\" and \"Follow the Boys.\"",
      "The dark-haired singer was just 17 when she signed a contract with MGM Records following appearances on several TV variety shows. Her earliest recordings attracted little attention, but then she released her version of \"Who's Sorry Now?\" an old ballad by Ted Snyder, Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby.",
      "It, too, had little success initially until Dick Clark played it on his \"American Bandstand\" show in 1958. Francis followed with such teen hits as \"Stupid Cupid,\" \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool,\" and \"Lipstick on Your Collar.\" Her records became hits worldwide as she re-recorded versions of her original songs in Italian and Spanish among other languages. Her concerts around the country quickly sold out.",
      "Decades after recording \"Pretty Little Baby\" in the 1960s, the song gained popularity on social media in 2025, being featured in videos on TikTok and Instagram. Francis told the New York Times the song went unnoticed when it was originally released.",
      "\"It's a cute song,\" Francis said. \"I couldn't imagine that it has the effect that it has worldwide on people \u2014 it's hard to believe. I wanted something for the B-side of a single and I chose something that wouldn't give my A-side any competition. I don't even know the name of the record that I put it on. But I think it has a ring of innocence in this chaotic time and it connects with people.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a romance bloomed with fellow teen idol Bobby Darin, who had volunteered to write songs for her. But when her father heard rumors that the pair were planning a wedding he stormed into a rehearsal and pulled a gun on Darin, ending their relationship and seeming to set on Francis on a pained and traumatic path.",
      "She chronicled some of it in her autobiography, \"Who's Sorry Now?\"",
      "\"My personal life is a regret from A to Z,\" she told The Associated Press in 1984, the year the book came out. \"I realized I had allowed my father to exert too much influence over me.\"",
      "Her father, George Franconero, was a roofing contractor from New Jersey who played the accordion, and he had his daughter learn the instrument as soon as she began to show an aptitude for music. When she was 4, he began booking singing dates for her, going on to become her manager.",
      "Although her acting career had faded by the mid-1960s, Francis was still popular on the concert circuit when she appeared at the Westbury Music Center in Westbury, New York, in 1974. She had returned to her hotel room and was asleep when a man broke in and raped her at knifepoint. He was never captured.",
      "Francis sued the hotel, alleging its security was faulty, and a jury awarded her $2.5 million in 1976. The two sides then settled out of court for $1,475,000 as an appeal was pending. She said the attack destroyed her marriage and put her through years of emotional turmoil.",
      "She suffered tragedy in 1981 when her brother George was shot to death as he was leaving his New Jersey home. Later in the decade, her father had her committed to a psychiatric hospital, where she was diagnosed as manic-depressive. At one point she attempted suicide by swallowing dozens of sleeping tablets. After three days in a coma, she recovered.",
      "She was married four times and would say that only her third husband, Joseph Garzilli, was worth the trouble. The other marriages each lasted less than a year.",
      "Concetta Rosemarie Franconero was born on Dec. 12, 1937, in Newark, New Jersey. She was just 3 when her father presented her with a child-size accordion. The next year she began singing and playing the instrument at various public events.",
      "At age 9 she began appearing on television programs, including \"Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts\" and \"The Perry Como Show.\" It was Godfrey who suggested she shorten her last name.",
      "Clark featured her repeatedly on \"American Bandstand,\" and she said in later years that without his support she would have abandoned her music career.",

      "PepsiCo is introducing a new prebiotic soda this fall geared toward health-conscious customers.",
      "The food and beverage company said Monday that the new product is designed to meet changing consumer needs and offer \"more functional ingredients.\" The new drink, which will come in cola and cherry vanilla flavors, will contain five grams of cane sugar, three grams of prebiotic fiber and no artificial sweeteners, while a single serving will have 30 calories, according to Pepsi.",
      "\"Pepsi Prebiotic Cola represents the next leap forward in giving consumers choice, optionality and functional ingredients in their cola experience, without sacrificing the iconic Pepsi taste we're known for delivering,\" Ram Krishnan, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages U.S., said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "The new cola will be available for purchase online this fall and in stores next year, Pepsi said.",
      "The product announcement comes only months after Pepsi\u00a0acquired Poppi, which is marketed as a healthier alternative for soda lovers, for nearly $2 billion. The low-calorie soda contains a mix of prebiotics, fruit juice and apple cider.",
      "The prebiotic and probiotic food and drink sector has grown quickly in recent years as consumers increasingly seek out gut-healthy alternatives to soda that contain less sugar.\u00a0According\u00a0to consulting firm Future Market Insights, the prebiotic soda market was valued at $262 million in 2024. Global sales are expected to grow 7.6% over the next 10 years.",
      "\"Consumer demand is certainly moving healthier,\" said Christopher Palmedo, an associate professor at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health & Health Policy. \"Decades ago, gargantuan Big Gulps were the rage. Now it's probiotic Pepsi.\"",
      "\"From a public health perspective, that's a good trend,\" Palmedo said, while noting that most beverages in the market, including probiotic drinks like Pepsi's are \"ultra-processed\" making their health claims questionable.",
      "While consumer preferences have shifted away from soda and toward healthier options, demand for carbonated drinks overall remains high. Nearly 80% U.S. consumers drink carbonated drinks at least once a week, according to Innova Market Insights.",
      "Pepsi is moving to introduce healthier offerings to boost lagging soda sales. On an earnings call last week, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company will introduce protein-enhanced versions of its snacks and new protein beverages this year. He also said Pepsi will relaunch Lay's potato chips and Tostitos tortilla chips without artificial colors or ingredients.",
      "\"I think protein is clearly a subsegment in our food and beverages categories that is growing fast,\" Laguarta said in the July 17 call. \"Consumers are adopting protein solutions in the diet at a pace that was not the case in a few months back, a few years back.\"",

      "At the time, Emerson said he had been grieving the death of his best friend and first turned to alcohol before experimenting with the psychedelic drug. Two days after trying so-called 'magic mushrooms' for the first time, he boarded Alaska Air Flight 2059 as a passenger from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco. It was a full flight, with 83 other passengers and crew on board, so he was given the cockpit jump seat behind the pilot and first officer.",
      "\"Most consequential three seconds of my life\"",
      "Suddenly, he said he felt a sense of \"all-out panic and fear\" on the plane as the drugs altered his perception of reality.",
      "\"You're not going home. You need to wake up. That's when I acted. I pulled the handles that were in front of my face,\" Emerson recalled thinking as he pulled the handles that cut off fuel to the engines in the event of a fire.",

      "The flight was diverted and landed safely in Portland, Oregon, where Emerson was arrested. He's set to be arraigned next month on a federal charge of interfering with a flight crew, and faces a host of state charges including 83 misdemeanor counts of recklessly endangering another person and one felony count of first-degree endangering aircraft.",
      "The case reignited the conversation about barriers facing pilots when it comes to their mental health.",
      "Pilots' mental health",
      "Disclosing mental health issues can lead to a pilot being grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration, putting their ability to work at risk for an extended period of time, possibly lasting years. A 2022 study published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine estimated 56% of pilots avoid seeking medical care due to fear of losing their certification to fly.",
      "\"I came to an understanding, or a misunderstanding, that I needed to be perfect on paper. I needed to show up and appear perfect, no matter what else was going on for me,\" Emerson said.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board has since held a first of its kind pilot mental health forum to review existing pilot mental health rules. The FAA also launched a review of policies \u2013 both calling for changes to address barriers to care.",
      "\"We need to have a system that allows people to be more forthcoming and to have treatment for issues that shouldn't keep you out of the cockpit,\" then-FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker said months after the incident, in December 2023.",
      "The FAA review committee made 24 recommendations.",
      "Illinois Rep. Sean Casten and Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber are leading an effort in Congress to enact reforms within two years, introducing the bipartisan\u00a0Mental Health in Aviation Act\u00a0to help pilots and air traffic controllers get access to mental health care and hire additional medical examiners.",
      "\"The goal really simply is to make our skies safer and make our pilots safer. That's it,\" Casten told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "The bill would also require the FAA to annually review and update the process related to mental health-related special issuance of medical certificates to pilots and air traffic controllers, set aside 13.74 million dollars a year for the next three years to hire additional certified Aviation Medical Examiners, and authorize a three year $4.5 million dollar public information campaign aimed at destigmatizing mental health care among pilots and air traffic controllers.",
      "\"Our pilots and air traffic controllers are not going to lose their job when they ask for help. We in this country must recognize that that's strength. And they're not to be punished. We're going to help them, process them, and get them back into cockpits,\" Stauber added.",

      "The 15% tariff rate announced by Mr. Trump is lower than the 25% he proposed earlier this month and the 24% duties that were proposed on \"Liberation Day\" in early April.",
      "\"This is a very exciting time for the United States of America, and especially for the fact that we will continue to always have a great relationship with the Country of Japan,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "\"They had their top people here, and we worked on it long and hard, and it's a great deal for everybody,\" the president said of the negotiations with Japan, addressing GOP lawmakers Tuesday night during a White House reception.",
      "Japan is the United States' fifth-largest trading partner, according to federal statistics. Japan bought $79.7 billion worth of American goods last year, and the U.S. imported $148.2 billion worth of Japanese goods.",

      "Duties of 25% percent on vehicles from Japan were in place under\u00a0the tariffs on foreign-made cars and parts\u00a0Mr. Trump announced earlier this year, as were 50 percent levies on steel and aluminum.",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Wednesday the autos tariff will be lowered to 15%, which sent shares of Japanese automakers soaring.",
      "\"We are the first (country) in the world to reduce tariffs on automobiles and auto parts, with no limits on volume,\" he told reporters.",
      "\"By protecting what needs to be protected, we continued the negotiations with an aim to reach an agreement that meets the national interest of both Japan and the United States,\" Ishiba added. \"In this agreement with President Trump, I think we were able to realize such an agreement.\"",

      "Akazawa also said increased defense spending by Japan -- something Mr. Trump has pressed for -- was not part of the deal.",
      "Mr. Trump also said Tuesday evening that his administration is working on a separate deal with Alaska involving liquified natural gas in the state.",

The threats came near the end of a 90-day pause on most of the sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs Mr. Trump unveiled against dozens of countries on \"Liberation Day\" in April.",
      "The Trump administration has hoped the letters will lead to a blitz of trade deals in the coming weeks, before the higher tariff rates kick in at the start of August. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick predicted Sunday\u00a0that the next two weeks will be \"for the record books.\"",
      "The letters have \"gotten these countries to the table, and they are going to open their markets or they're going to pay the tariff,\" Lutnick said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",

      "\"This change is not related to tariffs or trade policies,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. \"It reflects the reality of rising ingredient costs including the unprecedented cost of cocoa.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump said he's \"thinking about\" eliminating capital gains tax on home sales. Here's what that would mean for the housing market.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday floated the possibility of eliminating the federal capital gains tax on home sales, in a move that would change the way real estate profits are taxed for the first time in 30 years.",
      "Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Mr. Trump suggested he is weighing supporting\u00a0legislation\u00a0introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia that would nix the existing capital gains tax on home sales. Greene called the tax \"an outdated, unfair burden\u2014especially in today's housing market, where values have skyrocketed.\"",
      "\"We're thinking about that,\" Mr. Trump responded to a reporter, when asked how important it is that the capital gains tax be eliminated in order to \"unleash\" the housing market. \"It would also unleash it just by lowering the interest rates,\" the president said, adding, \"If the fed would lower the rates we wouldn't even have to do that. But we are thinking about no tax on capital gains on houses.\"",
      "Currently, single-tax filers can exclude up to $250,000 in capital gains from sales of their primary homes from their taxable incomes under what's called the Section 121\u00a0exclusion. That amount rises to $500,000 for joint filers. Both amounts have remained fixed since 1997.",
      "Reached for comment by CBS MoneyWatch, the White House said it had nothing additional to add to Mr. Trump's comments.",
      "\"Homeowners who have lived in their homes for decades, especially seniors in places where values have surged, shouldn't be forced to stay put because of an IRS penalty,\" Greene said in a statement announcing the proposed No Tax on Home Sales Act. \"My bill unlocks that equity, helps fix the housing shortage, and supports long-term financial security for American families.\"",
      "According to Research from the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the current federal policy on the capital gains tax on home sales is \"quietly distorting the housing market\" by \"locking in older homeowners, and strangling inventory just when America needs it most.\"",
      "\"Stay-put penalty\"",
      "A NAR study found that 34% of homeowners, or 29 million Americans, would exceed the $250,000 threshold were they to sell their homes, while 10%, or eight million Americans, would surpass the $500,000 threshold for joint filers.",
      "As a result, older homeowners are disincentivized to sell their homes, in what NAR researchers refer to as a \"stay-put penalty.\" For example, seniors who might otherwise consider moving closer to family, or downsizing, are staying in place \u2014 and keeping housing inventory tied up.",
      "\"This stagnation in housing turnover is rippling through the entire market, driving up costs and limiting opportunity \u2014 exactly the opposite of what public policy should be encouraging,\" Shannon McGahn, NAR executive vice president and chief advocacy officer,\u00a0 said in a statement. \"And it grows worse each month.\"",
      "Critics say eliminating the tax would only benefit wealthy Americans who can afford to pay tax on gains from home sales that exceed the limit.",
      "Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, told CBS MoneyWatch that a lot of home sellers already benefit from the $250,000 exclusion limit, and that eliminating the capital gains tax altogether would primarily benefit wealthier Americans who own residences that have appreciated by more than $250,000, or $500,000 in the case of joint filers.",
      "\"It wouldn't really move the needle for a regular family, unless you have a home that's appreciated a lot,\" Berner told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If your home has appreciated by more than $1 million, there would be a benefit to removing the capital gains tax.\"",
      "Inventory release",
      "He also suspects abolishing the capital gains tax on home sales would release inventory onto the housing market.",
      "\"It could be a good thing for the market. In particular where inventory is constrained, it could benefit regular folks,\" Berner said.",
      "By contrast, eliminating the federal tax would also erase revenue paid to the government, and could spark increased interest from investors and speculators, which could also drive up home values. That would contribute to the nation's housing affordability problem, according to Berner.",
      "Nearly 27% of all homes sold in the first three months of the year were bought by investors \u2014 the highest share in at least five years, according to a report by real estate data provider BatchData.",

    "summary": "More than three-quarters of Americans fear Social Security won't provide enough to live on when they retire, AARP study finds.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security is facing a growing number of challenges that threaten to undermine the retirement program's stability even as more retirees today say they urgently need the monthly payments compared with 20 years ago, according to a new AARP survey.",
      "About two-thirds of retirees said they substantially rely on Social Security for retirement income, or plan to do so, according to the survey, which polled more than 1,200 retirees as well as more than 2,000 younger Americans. When the advocacy group for older Americans asked the same question in 2005, about half of retirees indicated a heavy reliance on their monthly checks.",
      "The surge in retirees who largely rely on Social Security income to make ends meet comes as the program faces key challenges, from recent staffing cuts to a long-term financial crunch that could cause payments to be slashed starting in 2034.",
      "The AARP survey, conducted to mark the 90th anniversary of President Franklin D. Roosevelt signing the Social Security Act on August 14, 1935, underscores both the ever-growing importance of the program as well as its vulnerabilities.",
      "\"More than three-quarters of people in the U.S. \u2014 78% \u2014 are worried that Social Security won't provide enough to live on during retirement,\" AARP CEO Myechia Minter-Jordan said in a conference call to discuss the group's findings. \"That's an increase from five years ago, when 74%\" expressed concern.\"",
      "Confidence in the future of Social Security is also declining, with only 36% of Americans today saying they believe it will continue to pay out reliably and at the same level, a dip of seven percentage points from 2020, the study found. At the same time, 96% of Americans said they believed Social Security is important, with little difference between age groups or political party affiliations, AARP said.",
      "\"We're concerned that faith in the system ... is waning,\" Minter-Jordan added. \"We're concerned about their confidence that they will be able to receive benefits that they have paid into over time.\"",
      "Americans in their 30s are the most pessimistic about the future of Social Security, although confidence in the program's outlook tends to rise as people approach retirement age and get closer to claiming their benefits, the study found.",
      "\"Younger people have always underestimated how important Social Security will be to them in the future,\" Bill Sweeney, senior vice president of government affairs at AARP, said on the call.",
      "He added, \"Receiving Social Security changes how people view the program. They realize how important that inflation-adjusted treatment income is.\"",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the survey's findings.",
      "Social Security filings at a record",
      "Meanwhile, Social Security Administration data shows that Americans are filing for benefits at a record rate in 2025. This comes as experts are pointing to rising concerns about the program's reliability and future solvency, given job cuts at the agency and other changes.",
      "Wealth inequality is also a growing issue among retirees, with some white-collar workers heading into their golden years with hefty retirement savings thanks to corporate 401(k) programs with company matches. But about half of all private-sector workers lack access to corporate retirement accounts, creating hurdles for saving for retirement, a recent Pew Charitable Trusts study found.",
      "Last year, a record 68 million retirees, disabled people and survivors of deceased workers relied on Social Security, a 42% jump from two decades ago,\u00a0data shows. The number of Social Security beneficiaries is forecast to swell to 82 million by 2035, AARP said.",
      "Despite the retirement program's importance, many Americans lack a grasp of the basics of Social Security, the new AARP study also found. For instance, only 24% of those surveyed correctly identified 70 years old as the age at which individuals can maximize their Social Security benefits.",
      "And about one-third of respondents said the potential insolvency of the Social Security trust funds would lead to a complete cessation of benefits, which is false. If the trust funds aren't shored up and they run out of money, which is currently forecast to occur in 2034, monthly benefits would be reduced by about 20%.",

      "The\u00a0policy\u00a0enabled a price match if shoppers could provide proof of the lower price within 14 days of their purchase. The product had to be identical in brand name, size, weight, color and model number, and had to be sold and fulfilled by Amazon or Walmart, according to the Target policy.",
      "After July 28, customers will only be able to request a price match for products sold at either Target or Target.com, not competitors Amazon and Walmart, according to a Target spokesperson. The company said that it's ending price matching for products sold by the two rival retailers because \"guests overwhelmingly price match Target and not other retailers.\"",
      "Target introduced its competitor price match policy in 2013. At the time, former Target CEO and president Gregg Steinhafel said the policy provided \"unbeatable value.\"",
      "Other retailers that have price matching policies include Best Buy and\u00a0Home Depot. Walmart also has a price matching policy, although it's for Walmart.com, not competitors.",
      "Target's decision to end its price matching policy comes as the retailer is struggling to boost sales and store traffic. In its most recent earnings report released in May, the company reported a nearly 3% decline in sales during the first quarter compared to the same time last year.",

      "A U.S. Department of Commerce employee has been restricted from leaving China by authorities in Beijing, a State Department spokesperson told CBS News on Monday. The unidentified government employee's restricted travel was confirmed as Beijing revealed new information about a U.S.-based Wells Fargo banker who has also been subjected to an exit ban.",
      "\"We can confirm that a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office employee, while traveling to China in a personal capacity, was made subject to an exit ban in China,\" the State Department spokesperson said Monday. \"We are tracking this case very closely and are engaged with Chinese officials to resolve the situation as quickly as possible.\"",
      "The New York Times reported Monday that the employee in question is a U.S. citizen who has been prevented from leaving China since mid-April. The newspaper cited a State Department document it has obtained, adding that it shows Beijing officials seized the man's passport, credit card, cellphone and iPad while he was in the city of Chengdu on April 14.",
      "The Times said, citing the document, that the man's documents were returned on April 22, but that he was told he could not leave the country.",
      "At a news conference on Monday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson declined to comment on the case of the Department of Commerce employee beyond saying that Beijing \"upholds the rule of law and handles entry and exit affairs in accordance with the law.\"",
      "But Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiaku did confirm that Wells Fargo banker Mao Chenyue has been restricted from leaving China and is facing criminal charges.",
      "\"Ms. Mao Chenyue is involved in a criminal case currently being handled by Chinese law-enforcement authorities and is subjected to exit restrictions in accordance with the law. Pursuant to Chinese laws, with the case still under investigation, Ms. Mao cannot leave the country for the time being and has an obligation to cooperate with the investigation,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiaku said Monday.",
      "Chenyue is a Managing Director at Wells Fargo and is based in Atlanta, according to her Linkedin profile, which says she is bilingual in English and Chinese. A source close to Chenyue confirmed to CBS News that she is a U.S. citizen. She leads Wells Fargo's international factoring business and was born in Shanghai, according to a June press release on the website of the non profit FCI, a global network of companies that provides factoring services.",
      "A Wells Fargo representative told CBS News in a statement on Monday that the company was \"closely tracking this situation and working through the appropriate channels so our employee can return to the United States as soon as possible.\"",
      "A U.S. State Department spokesperson declined to comment Monday on Chenyue's status, \"due to privacy and other considerations,\" but said the State Department \"has no higher priority than the safety and security of American citizens.\"",
      "On its website, the State Department urges Americans travelling in China to \"exercise increased caution,\" warning that China \"arbitrarily enforces local laws, including exit bans on U.S. citizens and citizens of other countries, without fair and transparent process under the law.\"",
      "U.S. citizens may only realize they have been subjected to an exit ban when they attempt to leave China, and there may be no available legal recourse to appeal such a ban via a Chinese court, according to the State Department's travel advisory.",
      "The Chinese government also does not recognize dual nationality, meaning \"U.S. citizens of Chinese descent may be subject to additional scrutiny and harassment,\" the guidance on the State Department's website says.",
      "The latest incidents come at a sensitive time in relations between Beijing and Washington. In late June, the White House and officials in Beijing said the two sides had\u00a0agreed on the framework of a new deal\u00a0to end a trade war between the world's two largest economies.",
      "As it stands, China faces an August 12 deadline \u2014 imposed by President Trump \u2014 to strike a new trade deal with the U.S. to end an escalating tit-for-tat trade tariff war that the countries have engaged in since Mr. Trump returned to the White House in January.",
      "Mr. Trump imposed tariffs of up to 145% on imports from China, and Beijing responded with its own steep import duties, but the two sides agreed to a truce to allow for negotiations. In the meantime, the Trump administration has imposed 30% tariffs on imports from China, pending the August 12 deadline, when much higher rates will be imposed by both Washington and Beijing if no agreement is reached.",
      "The standoff has increased the risks for American companies doing business in China that had already been mounting for several years.",
      "In June 2023, after Chinese authorities\u00a0raided the offices\u00a0of several U.S.-based firms, Beijing-based business lawyer James Zimmerman\u00a0told CBS News\u00a0it seemed everything was being taken by the Communist Party as a potential threat.",
      "\"Unfortunately, in that kind of environment it's very difficult to operate \u2014 when everything is viewed as a national security matter and\u2026 it looks as if\u2026. anything you do could be considered to be spying,\" he said.",

      "Southwest, which announced last year that it was abandoning open seating, said customers can start booking flights with assigned seats starting on July 29.",
      "\"Assigned seating unlocks new opportunities for our Customers \u2014 including the ability to select Extra Legroom seats \u2014 and removes the uncertainty of not knowing where they will sit in the cabin,\" Tony Roach, executive vice president of customer & brand at Southwest Airlines, said in a statement.",

      "The U.S. Department of Labor is aiming to rewrite or repeal more than 60 \"obsolete\" workplace regulations, ranging from minimum wage requirements for home health care workers and people with disabilities to standards governing exposure to harmful substances.",
      "If approved, the wide-ranging changes unveiled this month also would affect working conditions at constructions sites and in mines, and limit the government's ability to penalize employers if workers are injured or killed while engaging in inherently risky activities such as movie stunts or animal training.",
      "The Labor Department says the goal is to reduce costly, burdensome rules imposed under previous administrations, and to deliver on President Trump's commitment to restore American prosperity through deregulation.",
      "\"The Department of Labor is proud to lead the way by eliminating unnecessary regulations that stifle growth and limit opportunity,\" Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement, which boasted the \"most ambitious proposal to slash red tape of any department across the federal government.\"",
      "Critics say the proposals would put workers at greater risk of harm, with women and members of minority groups bearing a disproportionate impact.",
      "\"People are at very great risk of dying on the job already,\" Rebecca Reindel, the AFL-CIO union's occupational safety and health director, said. \"This is something that is only going to make the problem worse.\"",
      "The proposed changes have several stages to get through before they can take effect, including a public comment period for each one.",
      "Some rollbacks under consideration",
      "Home health care workers help elderly or medically fragile people by preparing meals, administering medications, assisting with toilet use, accompanying clients to doctor appointments and performing other tasks. Under one of the Labor Department's proposals, an estimated 3.7 million workers employed by home care agencies could be paid below the federal minimum wage - currently $7.25 per hour - and made ineligible for overtime pay if they aren't covered by corresponding state laws.",
      "The proposed rule would reverse changes made in 2013 under former President Barack Obama and revert to a regulatory framework from 1975. The Labor Department says that by lowering labor and compliance costs, its revisions might expand the home care market and help keep frail individuals in their homes longer.",
      "Judy Conti, director of government affairs at the National Employment Law Project, said her organization plans to work hard to defeat the proposal. Home health workers are subject to injuries from lifting clients, and \"before those (2013) regulations, it was very common for home care workers to work 50, 60 and maybe even more hours a week without getting any overtime pay,\" Conti said.",
      "Others endorse the proposal, including the Independent Women's Forum, a conservative nonprofit based in Virginia. Women often bear the brunt of family caregiving responsibilities, so making home care more affordable would help women balance work and personal responsibilities, the group's president, Carrie Lukas, said.",
      "\"We're pleased to see the Trump administration moving forward on rolling back some of what we saw as counterproductive micromanaging of relationships that were making it hard for people to get the care they need,\" Lukas said.",
      "Samantha Sanders, director of government affairs and advocacy at the nonprofit Economic Policy Institute, said the repeal wouldn't constitute a win for women.",
      "\"Saying we actually don't think they need those protections would be pretty devastating to a workforce that performs really essential work and is very heavily dominated by women, and women of color in particular,\" Sanders said.",
      "Migrant farmworkers",
      "Last year, the Labor Department finalized rules that provided protections to migrant farmworkers who held H-2A visas. The current administration says most of those rules placed unnecessary and costly requirements on employers.",
      "Under the new proposal, the Labor Department would rescind a requirement for most employer-provided transportation to have seat belts for those agriculture workers.",
      "The department is also proposing to reverse a 2024 rule that protected migrant farmworkers from retaliation for activities such as filing a complaint and testifying or participating in an investigation, hearing or proceeding.",
      "\"There's a long history of retaliation against workers who speak up against abuses in farm work. And with H-2A it's even worse because the employer can just not renew your visa,\" said Lori Johnson, senior attorney at Farmworker Justice.",
      "Michael Marsh, president and CEO of the National Council of Agricultural Employers, applauded the deregulation efforts, saying farmers have been hit with thousands of pages of regulations pertaining to migrant farmworkers in recent years.",
      "\"Can you imagine a farmer and his or her spouse trying to navigate 3,000 new pages of regulation in 18 months and then be liable for every one of them?\" he asked.",
      "Construction workers",
      "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, part of the Labor Department, wants to rescind a requirement for employers to provide adequate lighting at construction sites, saying the regulation doesn't substantially reduce a significant risk.",
      "OSHA said if employers fail to correct lighting deficiencies at construction worksites, the agency can issue citations under its \"general duty clause.\" The clause requires employers to provide a place of employment free from recognized hazards that are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.",
      "Worker advocates think getting rid of a specific construction site requirement is a bad idea. \"There have been many fatalities where workers fall through a hole in the floor, where there's not adequate lighting,\" Reindel said. \"It's a very obvious thing that employers should address, but unfortunately it's one of those things where we need a standard, and it's violated all the time.\"",
      "Miners and more",
      "Several proposals could impact safety procedures for mines. For example, employers have to submit plans for ventilation and preventing roof collapses in coal mines for review by the Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Administration. Currently, MSHA district managers can require mine operators to take additional steps to improve those plans.",
      "The Labor Department wants to end that authority, saying current regulations give the district manager the ability to draft and create laws without soliciting comments or action by Congress.",
      "Similarly, the department is proposing to strip district managers of their ability to require changes to mine health and safety training programs.",
      "The general duty clause allows OSHA to punish employers for unsafe working conditions when there's no specific standard in place to cover a situation.",
      "An OSHA proposal would exclude the agency from applying the clause to prohibit, restrict or penalize employers for \"inherently risky professional activities that are intrinsic to professional, athletic, or entertainment occupations.\"",
      "A preliminary analysis identified athletes, actors, dancers, musicians, other entertainers and journalists as among the types of workers the limitation would apply to.",
      "\"It is simply not plausible to assert that Congress, when passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act, silently intended to authorize the Department of Labor to eliminate familiar sports and entertainment practices, such as punt returns in the NFL, speeding in NASCAR, or the whale show at SeaWorld,\" the proposed rule reads.",
      "Debbie Berkowitz, who served as OSHA chief of staff during the Obama administration, said she thinks limiting the agency's enforcement authority would be a mistake.",

    "story": [
      "Trump Media and Technology Group, the social media company owned by President Trump, said it has bought about $2 billion in bitcoin and related securities as it remodels itself as an investment firm.",
      "Trump Media, which owns the Truth Social app, announced in May that it planned to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, with the goal of creating a reserve of the cryptocurrency. The $2 billion bitcoin purchase is part of the company's \"bitcoin treasury plan,\" Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a news release on Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump, the largest investor in Trump Media, has increasingly focused on cryptocurrencies both through his private businesses and his administration. The company's $2 billion bitcoin purchase comes as Trump Media looks to roll out a range of investment products, including a plan to sell exchange-traded funds, or ETFs.",
      "The bitcoin purchase will \"help ensure our Company's financial freedom, help protect us against discrimination by financial institutions and will create synergies with the utility token we're planning to introduce across the Truth Social ecosphere,\" Nunes said in a statement.",
      "The company also said it has set aside $300 million for an \"options acquisition strategy for bitcoin-related securities.\" Trump Media said it plans to continue acquiring bitcoin.",
      "Shares of Trump Media rose $1.04, or 5.6%, to $19.71 in Monday morning trading. The stock has declined 42% this year.",
      "For the first quarter, Trump Media reported revenue of roughly $821,000, up from $770,000 in the year-ago period, a regulatory filing shows. The company reported an operating loss for the quarter of $39.5 million, down from $98.3 million a year ago.",
      "What is a crypto treasury strategy?",
      "A crypto treasury strategy involves buying and holding cryptocurrencies, similar to how companies may invest in more traditional assets like bonds to provide them with financial flexibility.",
      "The best-known advocate of this approach is billionaire Michael Saylor, who runs a software company called Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy). It owns 607,000 bitcoins \u2014 worth more than $72 billion at today's bitcoin price \u2014 making it the largest public bitcoin treasury company,\u00a0according\u00a0to Bitcointreasuries.net.",
      "Saylor's company uses a variety of strategies, such as selling shares or issuing debt, to keep expanding its bitcoin holdings. As the digital currency's price has soared to more than $118,000, shooting up 74% over the last year alone, Strategy's stock price has followed, surging more than 3,500% since 2020.",
      "That success has also spawned many imitators, while the White House invited him to its Digital Assets Summit earlier this year.",
      "The Trump administration is planning a new U.S. \"strategic reserve\" of crypto assets. Last week, Mr. Trump signed the\u00a0GENIUS Act, the first major law governing digital currency.",
      "\"For the past five years, the only thing better than Bitcoin is More Bitcoin,\" Saylor wrote in a July 17 social media post.",

    "story": [
      "A former chief executive of two clothing technology companies was released on $1 million bail Friday after pleading not guilty to charges alleging she cheated investors out of over $300 million over the past six years.",
      "Christine Hunsicker, 48, of Lafayette, New Jersey, was charged with six counts, including fraud, aggravated identity theft and false statement charges in the indictment in Manhattan federal court.",
      "U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said in a release that Hunsicker forged documents, fabricated audits and made material misrepresentations about her company's financial condition to defraud investors in CaaStle Inc. and P180.",
      "\"As alleged, Christine Hunsicker defrauded investors of hundreds of millions of dollars through document forgery, fabricated audits, and material misrepresentations about her company's financial condition,\" Clayton said in a statement on Friday. \"The promise of pre-IPO technology companies can be fertile ground for fraudsters who play on investor euphoria.\"",
      "The indictment\u00a0said Hunsicker, once portrayed as an on-the-rise fashion entrepreneur, portrayed CaaStle as a high-growth, private company with substantial cash on hand when she knew it faced significant financial distress.",
      "In a statement, defense lawyers Michael Levy and Anna Skotko said prosecutors \"have chosen to present to the public an incomplete and very distorted picture in today's indictment,\" despite Hunsicker's efforts to be \"fully cooperative and transparent\" with prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "\"There is much more to this story, and we look forward to telling it,\" they said.",
      "Hunsicker did not comment as she left the courthouse with Skotko after entering the not-guilty plea and agreeing to the rules of her $1 million bail, which included not having any contact with former or current investors or employees.",
      "According to the indictment, Hunsicker continued her fraudulent scheme even after the CaaStle board of directors removed her and prohibited her from soliciting investments or taking other actions on the company's behalf.",
      "She \"persisted in her scheme\" even after law enforcement agents confronted her over the fraud, the indictment said.",
      "Before the fraud allegations emerged, Hunsicker seemed to be a rising star in the fashion world after she was named to Crain's New York Business \"40 under 40\" lists, was selected as one of Inc.'s \"Most Impressive Women Entrepreneurs\" and was recognized by the National Retail Federation as someone shaping the future of retail, the indictment noted.",
      "At a time when the business was in financial distress with limited cash available and significant expenses, CaaStle was valued by Hunsicker at $1.4 billion, the indictment said.",
      "Hunsicker was lying to investors in February 2019 and continued to do so through this March, prosecutors alleged.",
      "They said she fed investors falsely inflated income statements, fake audited financial statements, fictitious bank account records and sham corporate records.",
      "She allegedly told one investor in August 2023 that CaaStle reported an operating profit of nearly $24 million in the second quarter of 2023 when its operating profit that quarter was actually less than $30,000.",
      "The indictment alleged that she carried out the majority of the fraud by bilking CaaStle investors of $275 million before forming P180 last year to infuse CaaStle with cash before its investors could discover her fraud.",
      "Through misrepresentations and omissions, she cheated P180 investors out of about $30 million, the indictment said.",
      "It said CaaStle filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy last month, leaving hundreds of investors holding now-worthless CaaStle shares. Hunsicker was forced to resign from CaaStle's board in December and formally resigned as chief executive in March.",
      "In a related civil filing, the SEC said Hunsicker's \"fake financials\" supported her narrative that CaaStle was nearing an initial public offering or sale in late 2022 as it enjoyed rapid and steady revenue growth after launching a new monetization model called \"Clothing-as-a-Service.\"",
      "\"In reality, CaaStle's revenues were shrinking, its losses were increasing, and the company was never profitable,\" the lawsuit said. \"Not a single existing or prospective CaaStle investor received accurate monthly, quarterly, or annual CaaStle financial statements from Hunsicker.\"",
      "Before CaaStle, Hunsicker launched Gwynnie Bee, a subscription service renting everyday clothes to women sizes 10 to 32.",
      "\"We want it to be a place where managing a rotating wardrobe is actually the way the majority of people interact with clothing,\" Hunsicker told CBS News in 2016 when discussing the company.",
      "Previously, Hunsicker was also the COO and president of Right Media, an online advertising startup that sold to Yahoo! for $850 million, and then became the COO of Drop.io, an online file sharing service that was purchased by Facebook.",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were easily found with a simple search on TikTok and available to a user under the age of 18, in violation of the platform's own policies, CBS News has found.",
      "CBS News created a TikTok account for a hypothetical 15-year-old female user in the United States and found that, at the very least, hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were searchable and watchable on the platform using the account.",
      "Once the CBS News account interacted with a handful of these videos, similar content was then recommended to the account on TikTok's \"For You\" feed.",
      "Searchable videos ranged from content with captions such as, \"nothing feels better than an empty stomach,\" to \"what I eat in a day\" videos promoting restrictive, 500-calorie-per-day diets. Guidelines published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggest that girls between the ages of 14 and 18 ingest between 1,800 and 2,400 calories per day.",
      "Many of the videos promoted thin body types as aspirational targets and included the hashtag \"harsh motivation\" to push extreme weight loss advice.",
      "Some of those videos included messages or slogans such as \"skinny is a status symbol\" and \"every time you say no to food, you say yes to skinny.\"",
      "TikTok's community guidelines say the platform only allows users over the age of 18 to see content promoting restrictive, low-calorie diets, including videos promoting medications for weight loss or idealizing certain body types. The Chinese-owned platform also says it bans users under the age of 18 from viewing videos that promote cosmetic surgery without warning of the risks, such as before-and-after images, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery.",
      "But CBS News found a range of videos by entering basic search terms on the platform, such as \"skinny,\" \"thin,\" and \"low cal,\" that promoted thin bodies as ideal, while also pushing harmful weight management behaviors. One such video showed an image of a scale with a weight of 39.9 kg (88 pounds) alongside a caption saying \"weight loss\" and the hashtag \"ed,\" which is a common abbreviation for \"eating disorder.\"",
      "Another graphic video with the caption \"ana gives you wings\" showed a series of models with protruding collar bones and spines. The term \"ana\" is an abbreviation for the eating disorder anorexia.",
      "Responding to CBS News' research, a TikTok spokesperson said Thursday that it was \"based on a very limited sample size and does not reflect the experience of the vast majority of our community.\"",
      "\"TikTok does not allow content that promotes disordered eating or extreme weight loss behaviours, and we work with health experts to provide in-app support resources where needed,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson pointed to a study published in May by the University of Southern California, which found that a majority of the eating disorder content on TikTok is discussion among users about recovery from such conditions.",
      "The same study noted, however, the platform's \"dual role in both challenging harmful cultural norms and potentially perpetuating them,\" regarding body image perceptions and eating disorders.",
      "\"We know that this isn't a one-off error on TikTok's part and that children are coming across this content on a scale,\" said Gareth Hill, a spokesperson for the Molly Russell foundation, a charity in the United Kingdom that works to prevent young people from committing self-harm.",
      "\"The question for TikTok is, if this is not representative, then why has this account [created by CBS News], which is a child's account, been shown this content in the first place, and then why is it continuing to get recommended to it?\"",
      "CBS News also found a wide variety of videos available to the under-18 user promoting the weight loss drug Ozempic and various forms of cosmetic surgery. That included videos that showed up on the recommended \"For You\" feed, which promotes cosmetic surgeries such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and liposuction.",
      "In one case, a user talking about their waist reduction surgery included a voiceover saying: \"I would rather die hot than live ugly.\"",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment specifically on CBS News' findings regarding cosmetic surgeries being promoted to underage users.",
      "TikTok says it has taken a range of measures over the past several months to address criticism regarding the availability of extreme weight loss content on the platform. In early June, the platform suspended search results for the viral hashtag #SkinnyTok, after drawing criticism from health experts and European regulators. The hashtag had been associated primarily with videos promoting extreme weight loss, calorie restriction and negative body talk, often presented as wellness advice.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson also told CBS News on Thursday that searches for words or phrases such as #Anorexia would lead users to relevant assistance, including localized eating disorder helplines, where they can access further information and support.",
      "\"I think we're understanding more and more about how this content shows up and so even when you ban a particular hashtag, for example, it's not long until something similar jumps up in its place,\" Doreen Marshall, who leads the American nonprofit National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA], told CBS News.",
      "\"This is going to be an evolving landscape both for creating content guidelines, but also for the platforms themselves and, you know, while some progress has been made, there's clearly more that can be done,\" Marshall said.",
      "TikTok is not the only social media platform that has faced criticism for the accessibility of extreme weight loss content.",
      "In 2022, 60 Minutes reported on a leaked internal document from Meta that showed the company was aware, through its own research, of content on its Instagram platform promoting extreme weight loss and fueling eating disorders in young people.",
      "At the time, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined 60 Minutes' request for an interview but its global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said, \"We want teens to be safe online\" and that Instagram doesn't \"allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders.\"",
      "Last year, 60 Minutes reported that the Google-owned YouTube video platform, which is hugely popular among teenagers, was also serving up extreme weight loss and eating disorder content to children.",

      "The president wrote on his\u00a0Truth Social\u00a0platform Tuesday that, as part of the agreement, Japan will invest $550 billion in the U.S. \"which will receive 90% of the Profits.\" He also said Japan will \"open their Country to Trade including Cars and Trucks, Rice and certain other Agricultural Products.\"",
      "The 15% tariff rate announced by Mr. Trump is lower than the 25% he proposed earlier this month and the 24% duties that were proposed on \"Liberation Day\" in early April.",
      "\"This is a very exciting time for the United States of America, and especially for the fact that we will continue to always have a great relationship with the Country of Japan,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "\"They had their top people here, and we worked on it long and hard, and it's a great deal for everybody,\" the president said of the negotiations with Japan, addressing GOP lawmakers Tuesday night during a White House reception.",
      "Japan is the United States' fifth-largest trading partner, according to federal statistics. Japan bought $79.7 billion worth of American goods last year, and the U.S. imported $148.2 billion worth of Japanese goods.",
      "More than one-third of U.S. imports from Japan last year \u2014 or $52.3 billion \u2014 were cars and car parts, powered by Japan's massive auto industry, according to federal data.",
      "Duties of 25% percent on vehicles from Japan were in place under\u00a0the tariffs on foreign-made cars and parts\u00a0Mr. Trump announced earlier this year, as were 50 percent levies on steel and aluminum.",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Wednesday the autos tariff will be lowered to 15%, which sent shares of Japanese automakers soaring.",
      "\"We are the first (country) in the world to reduce tariffs on automobiles and auto parts, with no limits on volume,\" he told reporters.",
      "\"By protecting what needs to be protected, we continued the negotiations with an aim to reach an agreement that meets the national interest of both Japan and the United States,\" Ishiba added. \"In this agreement with President Trump, I think we were able to realize such an agreement.\"",
      "But Japan trade envoy Ryosei Akazawa said the 50 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum would stay in place.",
      "Akazawa also said increased defense spending by Japan -- something Mr. Trump has pressed for -- was not part of the deal.",
      "Mr. Trump also said Tuesday evening that his administration is working on a separate deal with Alaska involving liquified natural gas in the state.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, Mr. Trump announced trade deals with Indonesia and the Philippines calling for 19% tariffs on those countries' exports to the United States. The administration is still in talks with several other crucial trading partners, including Mexico, Canada and the European Union.",
      "Trump pushing for last-minute trade deal blitz",
      "Mr. Trump sent letters this month to about two dozen countries \u2014 including Japan \u2014 telling them to expect higher tariffs starting Aug. 1 unless they strike deals before then to resolve what the president views as unfair trade practices. The threats came near the end of a 90-day pause on most of the sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs Mr. Trump unveiled against dozens of countries on \"Liberation Day\" in April.",
      "The Trump administration has hoped the letters will lead to a blitz of trade deals in the coming weeks, before the higher tariff rates kick in at the start of August. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick predicted Sunday\u00a0that the next two weeks will be \"for the record books.\"",
      "The letters have \"gotten these countries to the table, and they are going to open their markets or they're going to pay the tariff,\" Lutnick said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "When the dust settles, Lutnick said, smaller countries can expect to face a roughly 10% tariff \u2014 which is the baseline rate imposed by Mr. Trump in April \u2014 while larger countries will likely face higher tariffs.",
      "By comparison, the average tariff rate on U.S. imports in 2023 was around 2.5%, according to figures from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "Mr. Trump argues his tariff strategy is necessary to revive U.S. manufacturing, correct unfair trade practices and bring in additional government revenue. But many economists warn that tariffs can lead to higher inflation and lower economic growth.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said earlier this month\u00a0that the central bank has left interest rates relatively high so far this year because it is concerned Mr. Trump's tariffs could push up consumer prices.",
      "Lutnick responded to inflation worries Sunday by saying, \"I think you're going to see inflation stay right where it is,\" and argued that tariffs will help American manufacturers.",
      "\"The idea that these importers are more important than the people who employ Americans, I think it's just [the] wrong way of thinking about it,\" Lutnick SAID.",

    "story": [
      "Federal judges in New Jersey invoked a rarely used judiciary power to sideline interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, installing her top assistant as the state's top federal prosecutor \u2014 but hours later, the Trump administration responded by ousting\u00a0Habba's deputy.",
      "President Trump installed Habba, who had served as his personal attorney, on March 24 in an interim capacity. An appointee can lead a U.S. attorney's office for up to 120 days pending Senate confirmation. Habba was not formally nominated for the role until July 1 and has not been confirmed.",
      "The state's district judges voted to replace her. Chief Judge Ren\u00e9e Bumb wrote in an order Tuesday that they appointed Habba's first assistant, longtime prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace, to the role.",
      "Hours later, Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Justice Department had \"removed\" Grace, accusing \"rogue judges\" of \"threatening\" the president's constitutional powers.",
      "A Justice Department official told CBS News that Grace is no longer with the department.",
      "New Jersey Sens. Cory Booker and Andy Kim, both Democrats, condemned Grace's removal.",
      "\"The firing of a career public servant, lawfully appointed by the court, is another blatant attempt to intimidate anyone that doesn't agree with them and undermine judicial independence,\" the two senators wrote in a joint statement.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Grace for comment.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who in social media posts on Sunday and Monday urged the judges to keep Habba in the role, blasted their decision Tuesday.",
      "Blanche accused the judges of \"trying to force out\" Habba, and serving \"a left-wing agenda, not the rule of law.\"",
      "\"When judges act like activists, they undermine confidence in our justice system. Alina is President Trump's choice to lead\u2014and no partisan bench can override that,\" Blanche wrote.",
      "Habba did not immediately reply to a request for comment by CBS News.",
      "Habba faced an uphill battle to secure Senate confirmation, which was opposed by the state's two Democratic senators.",
      "Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey praised the judges' decision in a social media post Tuesday, noting that Grace has been a federal prosecutor in the state since 2016.",
      "\"The people of New Jersey deserve a United States Attorney who will enforce the law without fear or favor, always in pursuit of the public interest and guided by the principles of impartiality and fairness,\" Booker wrote.",

      "The charges against Baraka were dropped, and McIver entered a not guilty plea.",
      "Habba was previously counselor to the president early in his second term. For several years prior, she was a lead attorney on many of his most high-profile civil cases, including a New York state fraud case and a defamation case involving the writer E. Jean Carroll. A judge and a jury in those cases found Mr. Trump liable for about half a billion dollars in damages and disgorgement.",

    "summary": "The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee has effectively barred transgender women from competing in women's sports, telling sports governing bodies it has an \"obligation to comply\" with federal policy.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee has effectively barred transgender women from competing in women's sports, telling the federations overseeing swimming, athletics and other sports it has an \"obligation to comply\" with an\u00a0executive order\u00a0issued by President Trump.",
      "The new policy, announced Monday with\u00a0a quiet change on the USOPC's website\u00a0and confirmed in a letter sent to national sport governing bodies, follows a similar step taken by the NCAA earlier this year.",
      "The USOPC change is noted obliquely as a detail under \"USOPC Athlete Safety Policy\" and references Mr. Trump's executive order, \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports,\" signed in February. That order, among other things, threatens to \"rescind all funds\" from organizations that allow transgender athlete participation in women's sports.",
      "U.S. Olympic officials told the national governing bodies they will need to follow suit, adding that \"the USOPC has engaged in a series of respectful and constructive conversations with federal officials\" since Mr. Trump signed the order.",
      "\"As a federally chartered organization, we have an obligation to comply with federal expectations,\" USOPC CEO Sarah Hirshland and President Gene Sykes wrote in a letter. \"Our revised policy emphasizes the importance of ensuring fair and safe competition environments for women. All National Governing Bodies are required to update their applicable policies in alignment.\"",
      "At the 2024 Olympics in Paris, just one openly transgender U.S. athlete competed. Nikki Hiltz, a middle-distance runner from California who uses they/them pronouns, was assigned female at birth. It's unclear how the change announced by USOPC would impact Hiltz.",
      "At a\u00a0USOPC meeting in April, Hirshland said that the committee had no plans to define eligibility criteria ahead of the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.",
      "\"So typically speaking at an international level, the international federations will define eligibility criteria for the events in which they own jurisdiction, world Cups, world Championships, et cetera, and the national governing bodies domestically would define eligibility criteria for their events,\" Hirshland said at the time. \"In some cases those may be elite level events, national championships and things. In other cases those may be lower level grassroots youth sport competitions and things of that nature. So we do not have, nor will we have an eligibility policy, it wouldn't be appropriate, it's not our role to take on that position.\"",
      "The National Women's Law Center put out a statement condemning the move.",
      "\"By giving into the political demands, the USOPC is sacrificing the needs and safety of its own athletes,\" said that organization's president and CEO, Fatima Goss Graves.",
      "The USOPC oversees around 50 national governing bodies, most of which play a role in everything from the grassroots to elite levels of their sports. That raises the possibility that rules might need to be changed at local sports clubs to retain their memberships in the NGBs.",
      "Some of those organizations \u2014 for instance, USA Track and Field \u2014 have long followed guidelines set by their own world federation. World Athletics is considering changes to its policies that would mostly fall in line with Mr. Trump's order.",
      "A USA Swimming spokesman said the federation had been made aware of the USOPC's change and was consulting with the committee to figure out what changes it needs to make. USA Fencing changed its policy effective Aug. 1 to allow only \"athletes who are of the female sex\" in women's competition and opening men's events to \"all athletes not eligible for the women's category, including transgender women, transgender men, non-binary and intersex athletes and cisgender male athletes.\"",
      "The nationwide battle over transgender athletes on girls' and women's sports teams has played out at both the state and federal levels as Republicans portray the issue as a fight for athletic fairness. More than two dozen states have enacted laws barring transgender women and girls from participating in certain sports competitions. Some policies have been blocked in court by those who say the policies are discriminatory, cruel and unnecessarily target a tiny niche of athletes.",
      "The Supreme Court earlier this month agreed to hear a case over whether states can prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
      "Also earlier this month, the Justice Department\u00a0filed a civil lawsuit against California's Department of Education and a nongovernmental sports organization alleging that they violated federal civil rights laws, including Title IX, by implementing policies that \"force girls to compete against boys\" in state athletic events.",
      "The NCAA changed its participation policy for transgender athletes to limit competition in women's sports to athletes assigned female at birth. That change came a day after Mr. Trump signed the executive order intended to ban transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports.",
      "Earlier this month, the University of Pennsylvania said it would ban transgender women from participating in its women's sports teams as part of an agreement to resolve Title IX violations. The Trump administration had opened an investigation into the school for allowing\u00a0Lia Thomas, a transgender swimmer, to compete for\u00a0its women's swimming team in 2021 and 2022.",
      "Female eligibility is a key issue for the International Olympic Committee\u00a0under its new president, Kirsty Coventry, who has signaled an effort to \"protect the female category.\" The IOC has allowed individual sports federations to set their own rules at the Olympics \u2014 and some have already taken steps on the topic.",
      "Stricter rules on transgender athletes \u2014 barring from women's events anyone who went through male puberty \u2014 have been passed by swimming, cycling and track and field. Soccer is reviewing its eligibility rules for women and could set limits on testosterone.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he wants the IOC to change everything \"having to do with this absolutely ridiculous subject.\"",
      "As he took office earlier this year, the president signed an executive order declaring that it is the policy of the federal government to only recognize \"two sexes, male and female.\" Mr. Trump campaigned on the issue and spent tens of millions of dollars on political ads that focused on transgender rights.",

We extend our warmest regards to the wonderful people of The Philippines!\"",
      "The 19% tariff rate is just shy of the 20% tariff rate the Trump administration was set to impose on the Philippines. And it's also higher than the so-called reciprocal tariff of 17% on Philippine imports the administration announced in April.",

      "The proposed renaming was folded into an amendment to a bill that would set fiscal year 2026 funding levels for the Interior Department and several other federal agencies, including the Kennedy Center. The amendment \u2014 and the bill itself \u2014 were advanced by the House Appropriations Committee in a hearing Tuesday.",
      "The renaming was authored by Republican Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho, who pointed to the first lady's role as honorary chair of the Kennedy Center board.",
      "The renaming was not requested by the Trump administration, Simpson's communications director Lexi Hamel told CBS News in an email.",
      "\"Naming a theater after her is an excellent way to recognize her appreciation for the arts,\" Simpson, who chairs the Appropriations Committee's Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Subcommittee, wrote in a statement.",

      "The nameplate over the opera house \u2014 which seats nearly 2,400 people and is one of several spaces in the Kennedy Center \u2014 is unlikely to change any time soon. Spending bills like the one advanced Tuesday generally need 60 votes to pass the Senate, meaning even if it makes it through the full House intact, several Senate Democrats will need to vote for it.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Todd Blanche, the second-highest ranking official at the Justice Department, said Tuesday that he plans to meet with Ghislaine Maxwell \"in the coming days\" about the case involving convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"Justice demands courage. For the first time, the Department of Justice is reaching out to Ghislaine Maxwell to ask: what do you know?\" Blanche wrote on social media. He added that he contacted Maxwell's lawyers at the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi. \"I intend to meet with her soon. No one is above the law \u2014 and no lead is off-limits,\" Blanche wrote.",
      "On Capitol Hill, a subcommittee of the House Oversight and Reform Committee approved a motion from GOP Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee that directs the committee's chairman to subpoena Maxwell to appear for a deposition, a signal of lawmakers' interest in speaking to Epstein's former partner.",
      "Blanche, who was President Trump's private defense attorney before joining the Justice Department, said that the department and the FBI continue to stand by a memo released earlier this month that concluded Epstein did not have a \"client list\" and confirmed that he died by suicide. The memo, which detailed the findings of a review of Epstein's case, also said there was no \"credible evidence\" that the disgraced financier blackmailed prominent people.",
      "The Justice Department and FBI also said they would not release any additional information about Epstein's case, and noted that the review did not uncover evidence that would prompt an investigation into uncharged third parties.",
      "\"President Trump has told us to release all credible evidence,\" Blanche said in a second statement shared by Bondi. \"If Ghislane Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say.\"",
      "The deputy attorney general said the Justice Department in prior administrations had not asked about her willingness to meet with the government, and he anticipates \"meeting with Ms. Maxwell in the coming days.\"",
      "David Oscar Markus, Maxwell's lawyer, said in a statement, \"I can confirm that we are in discussions with the government and that Ghislaine will always testify truthfully. We are grateful to President Trump for his commitment to uncovering the truth in this case.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that he did not know about Blanche's bid to speak with Maxwell but said it \"sounds appropriate to do.\"",
      "\"It's sort of a witch hunt,\" he said in the Oval Office. \"Just a continuation of the witch hunt.\"",
      "Maxwell was an associate of Epstein's and convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence. Her lawyers have asked the Supreme Court to take up an appeal of her conviction.",
      "Blanche's outreach to Maxwell's lawyers comes after the Justice Department asked a federal court in New York on Friday to unseal transcripts from grand jury proceedings involving Epstein. He was indicted in 2019 on one count of sex trafficking of minors and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors.",
      "Federal prosecutors alleged that Epstein sexually exploited and abused dozens of underage girls from 2002 through 2005, and worked with others who set up sexual encounters with victims at Epstein's residences in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "He died by suicide while in federal custody before his trial. Epstein had been arrested in Florida in 2006 and pleaded guilty to two state prostitution charges in 2008.",
      "In addition to asking the court to release the grand jury transcripts related to Epstein's indictment, the Justice Department also asked it to make public grand jury transcripts associated with Maxwell's case. U.S. District Judges Paul Engelmayer and Richard Berman, who are handling Maxwell and Epstein's cases, respectively, each\u00a0ordered the Justice Department to submit additional filings to the court about its request to unseal the grand jury records. The judges gave the defendants \u2014 in Epstein's case, his representative \u2014 and victims until Aug. 5 to lay out their positions on the proposed disclosure.",
      "Whether the transcripts become public will be up to the judges overseeing the cases, though the records will likely be heavily redacted to shield information related to victims. If the Justice Department's requests are granted by the court, the material is unlikely to be available immediately, and it could be weeks or months before it is unsealed.",
      "Federal rules typically require matters before a grand jury to be kept secret.",
      "The president and his administration have been dealing with backlash from Mr. Trump's allies that arose after the Justice Department released the memo about Epstein.",
      "Some top administration officials, such as Vice President JD Vance and FBI Director Kash Patel, suggested before Mr. Trump's reelection that Democrats were deliberately concealing information about Epstein and his purported list of clients.

      "Mr. Trump has tried to downplay the focus on Epstein and lashed out at some of his supporters, calling them \"weaklings\" who have been fooled by Democrats. He referred to claims about Epstein as the \"Jeffrey Epstein Hoax.\"",
      "Epstein and Mr. Trump moved in the same social circles in New York and Florida from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. They were friends for years, until they had a falling out around 2004. Mr. Trump has previously acknowledged he crossed paths with Epstein in Palm Beach, but said in 2019 following Epstein's arrest that they haven't spoken in 15 years.",
      "Last week, the president lashed out at a story in the Wall Street Journal that chronicled the pair's relationship, which the president has said ended before Epstein's first arrest in 2006.

    "story": [
      "Special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff is scheduled to travel to Europe this week for meetings on a wide range of issues, including the Israel-Hamas conflict, and will continue pushing for a ceasefire and peace deal, according to a U.S. official.",
      "In a briefing with reporters Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce suggested Witkoff could soon go to the Middle East, but declined to provide details about his itinerary.",
      "\"When it comes to the specific location of the envoy, I do not have that,\" Bruce said.",
      "Indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas are ongoing, according to an Israeli official, and the Israeli government expects to soon receive Hamas' response to an offer made last week.",
      "So far, there have been no breakthroughs as they attempt to broker a 60-day ceasefire, initially proposed by the U.S., in the 21-month war. Doha, Qatar, hosted indirect talks between the two parties earlier this month.",
      "Witkoff, according to two diplomatic sources, was expected to travel to the Middle East if negotiations progressed and a deal could potentially be closed. He met last week with Qatari officials at the White House just before President Trump hosted the Qatari prime minister for a dinner that stretched late into the night. It took place as diplomatic efforts were reaching a critical moment in the pursuit of a deal to release the 20 living Israeli hostages, free some Palestinian detainees, allow the entry of much needed food and aid to civilians in Gaza, and bring about a cessation of violence and repositioning of Israeli Defense Forces.",
      "A U.S. official and a regional source familiar with the diplomacy told CBS News that Israel last week proposed a new map with new locations where the IDF would potentially withdraw within Gaza. The demarcation of these proposed withdrawal zones has been a sticking point in the ongoing diplomatic efforts to broker a deal acceptable to both Hamas and the Netanyahu government. The international mediators \u2014 Qatar, Egypt and the U.S. \u2014 planned to transit the Israeli proposal to Hamas for consideration.",
      "The two sources indicated that the Trump administration is cautiously optimistic about the possibility of an impending break in the Gaza negotiations that could lead to a 60-day ceasefire and hostage release.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Washington in early July to discuss the deal with the Trump administration but a sticking point emerged over the deployment of Israeli troops during the truce. Israel wants to keep forces in what it says is an important land corridor in southern Gaza, but Hamas views the presence of Israeli troops on that strip of land as an indication that Israel intends to continue the war once a temporary ceasefire expires.",
      "The Knesset goes into a three-month summer recess next week, on July 27, which would give Netanyahu more political flexibility in ceasefire negotiations.",
      "In the meantime, Israel has continued to carry out military operations in Gaza, and on Sunday, it issued new evacuation orders to include an area that has been somewhat less hard hit than others, indicating a new battleground may be opening up and squeezing Palestinians further south.",
      "In a social media post published Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces warned Palestinians that it was operating \"with great force to destroy the enemy's capabilities and terrorist infrastructure\" in the central city of Deir al-Balah, \"as it expands its activities in this region to operate in an area it has not operated in before.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Jul 2025 16:12:09 -0400",
    "summary": "Tulsi Gabbard released a memorandum and files regarding the intelligence community's assessment of Russia's actions during the 2016 election.",
    "story": [
      "The release of more than 100 pages of declassified files and a memorandum by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has reignited political battles over Russia's actions during the 2016 presidential election, a topic that has long incensed President Trump and put the actions of the U.S. intelligence community in partisan crosshairs.",
      "Gabbard's office on Friday alleged in the memorandum, which accompanied the files, that they contained what she called evidence of \"suppression\" and manipulation of the intelligence underlying a 2017 community-wide assessment of Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. The files include email exchanges, excerpts from a President's Daily Brief and a readout from a principals committee meeting, chiefly from a period during the Obama administration.",
      "In a statement and social media posts, Gabbard claimed the materials, which were marked declassified on July 17, 2025, were evidence of a \"treasonous conspiracy\" and \"years-long coup\" plotted by Obama administration officials against Mr. Trump, and said she would forward them to the Department of Justice as part of a criminal referral. She also said in subsequent media appearances that more declassifications about the matter would be made.",
      "Democrats fiercely disputed her claims, pointing to the findings of a bipartisan Senate investigation that concluded Russia had attempted to influence the 2016 election. They accused Gabbard herself of misrepresenting intelligence findings and processes.",
      "\"What you saw from the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was not just a lie, but a very dangerous lie, because when you start throwing around language like sedition and treason, somebody is going to get hurt,\" said Congressman Jim Himes, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday.",
      "\"[T]he intelligence community is full of very good people who do their jobs every single day, and now they're watching their leader do something that each and every one of them knows is dishonest,\" Himes said.",
      "\"This is just another example of the DNI trying to cook the books, rewrite history, and erode trust in the intelligence agencies she's supposed to be leading,\" Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner of Virginia said in a statement.",
      "The memorandum released by Gabbard appears to conflate different kinds of Russian operations during the 2016 election cycle while alleging Obama administration officials fabricated a narrative designed to undermine Mr. Trump. It points several times to select phrases in the documents that say Russia lacked the intent or the capability to use cyber operations to target U.S. election infrastructure, change vote tallies, and overturn the election \u2014 which previous investigations agreed did not happen.",
      "But while no evidence emerged to indicate Russia engaged in a vote-switching cyberattack, there was evidence that showed a multi-pronged Kremlin influence campaign that attempted to sway American voters. That influence campaign included hack-and-leak operations and social media posts designed to undermine the candidacy of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and bolster then-candidate Trump's, according to the intelligence community's assessment.",
      "In the years after the 2016 presidential election, multiple reviews of the intelligence community's findings \u2014 including the Senate report and an investigation led by special counsel John Durham, who was appointed by Mr. Trump \u2014 reinforced its conclusions.",
      "A CIA review of the tradecraft involved in the agency's assessment released earlier this month found some of its judgments may have been rushed and the confidence levels attached to one of them may have been too high, but it did not change the conclusion that Russia's efforts were designed to benefit Mr. Trump's candidacy.",
      "Obama's spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush said in a statement Tuesday: \"These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction.\"",
      "\"Nothing in the document issued last week undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election but did not successfully manipulate any votes,\" Rodenbush wrote.",
      "Gabbard's statements on Friday were praised and recirculated multiple times by the president, senior White House officials and Republican lawmakers. Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Tom Cotton wrote in a social media post, \"It will take decades for the Intelligence Community to recover from the damage done during the Obama and Biden presidencies.\"",
      "Senior White House official Stephen Miller wrote that Gabbard had \"exposed the startling depths of a seditious coup against the Republic.\"",
      "The memorandum also criticizes leaks from what it terms \"IC officials\" or \"Deep State officials in the IC\" \u2014 with \"IC\" referring to the intelligence community \u2014 to media outlets at the time the assessments were being drafted that said Russia had intervened in the election in an effort to help President Trump. The memo does not, however, identify these individuals or provide other evidence about the origin of those disclosures.",
      "It also highlights instances in which certain agencies disputed or pushed to change language included in evolving intelligence assessments of Russia's cyber activity. For instance, it cites an FBI official who suggested in an exchange in September of 2016 that language about Russia's intent to use cyber attacks to disrupt the 2016 election be \"softened.\"",
      "\"[W]e would prefer for the first sentence regarding Russia's intent to be softened,\" the official wrote. \"The way it currently reads, it would indicate that we have definitive information that Russia does intend to disrupt our elections and we are uncomfortable making that assessment at this point.\"",
      "Dissents from different agencies are common and conclusions can change as more intelligence is collected or analysis is done, according to current and former officials familiar with the drafting process for intelligence assessments. It is not clear from the redacted selection of emails released by Gabbard how the language flagged by the FBI was finalized.",
      "Warner has expressed concerns about the effect of Gabbard's recent actions on intelligence sharing by partners of the United States, noting that representatives of the intelligence-sharing alliance known as the Five Eyes \u2014 which includes the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Canada \u2014 had approached him for answers.",
      "\"I have had Five Eye partners say, 'Warner, what the hell is going on?'\" Warner said during a panel discussion at last week's Aspen Security forum, hours before the 2016 files were released. \"I do believe our Five Eyes partners and others are not sharing as much information as they would.\"",

    "story": [
      "The federal government on Monday released thousands of records on the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. \u2014 a move that was ordered by President Trump earlier this year.",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the documents, which number over 230,000 pages, \"had never been digitized and sat collecting dust in facilities across the federal government for decades, until today.\"",
      "The records include the FBI's \"discussion of potential leads, internal FBI memos detailing the progress of the case, and documents related to James Earl Ray's former cellmate, who stated he discussed with Ray an alleged assassination plot,\" according to ODNI. The agency says the release also includes CIA records on the search for Ray, who fled the U.S. before he was eventually captured and pleaded guilty to assassinating King.",
      "\"The American people have waited nearly sixty years to see the full scope of the federal government's investigation into Dr. King's assassination,\" Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said in a statement.",
      "What's in the MLK files?",
      "A CBS News review found many of the documents released Monday focus on the FBI's role prior to MLK's assassination and its investigation of his death. Much of what is in the documents confirms long-established facts. Also included in the disclosure are newspaper clippings and records from other arms of government.",
      "ODNI called Monday's release \"the first time these records are published online in one collection with minimal redactions,\" though it said some records had been made public previously through Freedom of Information Act requests.",
      "It is not clear that the latest document release adds significantly to what was already known about King's assassination and the events that precipitated and followed it.",
      "The FBI surveilled and pursued King for years leading up to his death, suspicious of some members of the civil rights movement's ties to communism. A 1977\u00a0Justice Department report\u00a0concluded the surveillance of King was \"very probably\" illegal, noting the FBI had \"no evidence whatsoever that Dr. King was ever a communist\" and that one adviser of his in the early 1960s had \"disassociated himself\" from the Communist Party.",
      "One\u00a0page\u00a0in the files released Monday references an FBI technical surveillance operation of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 1965 that allegedly found \"communist influence\" on the SCLC through King. It alleges contacts between King and individuals \"with communist backgrounds.\"",
      "A 1963\u00a0memo\u00a0from assistant FBI director W.C. Sullivan says King \"stands head and shoulders over all other Negro leaders put together when it comes to influencing great masses of Negroes. We must mark him now, if we have not done so before, as the most dangerous Negro of the future in this Nation from the standpoint of communism, the Negro and national security.\"",
      "There is also one audio recording: an interview with Jerry Ray, the brother of James Earl Ray. Jerry Ray said his brother never mentioned King or his feelings about \"negroes\" to him, and did not believe his brother assassinated King.",
      "What has MLK's family said about the files?",
      "ODNI said King's relatives were \"provided an opportunity to review the files\" two weeks ago.",
      "Prior to the release, some relatives of King pushed back on the plan, saying: \"For us, the assassination of our father is a deeply personal family loss that we have endured over the last 56 years. We hope to be provided the opportunity to review the files as a family prior to its public release.\"",
      "King's two living children, Bernice King and Martin Luther King III, said in a statement Monday they understood the records have \"long been a subject of interest,\" but urged people to engage with the files \"with empathy, restraint, and respect for our family's continued grief.\"",
      "The statement \u2014 released by the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change \u2014 pointed to the FBI's yearslong surveillance of King in the 1960s.",
      "\"While we support transparency and historical accountability, we object to any attacks on our father's legacy or attempts to weaponize it to spread falsehoods,\" the family members said. \"Those who promote the fruit of the FBI's surveillance will unknowingly align themselves with an ongoing campaign to degrade our father and the Civil Rights Movement.\"",
      "Bernice King addressed the release of the files in a \"Vanity Fair\" article Monday, writing, \"I wonder why I have to be confronted once again with something that was very confusing and distressing for me as a five-year-old. I am, honestly, not prepared to revisit the gruesome details of this painful history. For me, there is no real value in it; there is only reliving the trauma.\"",
      "King's niece, Alveda King, said in ODNI's statement that she supported the release, calling it \"a historic step towards the truth that the American people deserve.\"",
      "Why are the MLK files being released?",
      "Shortly after returning to office, Mr. Trump ordered the government to declassify and release federal records on President John F. Kennedy's 1963 assassination, along with the 1968 killings of King and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. Records on JFK were released in March, and the government released several tranches of documents on RFK starting in April.",
      "All three assassinations have drawn decades of public curiosity, including theories about whether the people accused and convicted of assassinating the three men acted alone or were even responsible for the killings.",
      "Ray pleaded guilty to murdering King in Memphis one year after the assassination, and was sentenced to 99 years in prison, but he later recanted his guilty plea and spent years unsuccessfully seeking a new trial. He died in 1998.",
      "Members of King's family have contended that Ray was not the shooter. Their statement Monday pointed to a 1999 wrongful death suit in Tennessee civil court in which a jury concluded a man named Loyd Jowers and other co-conspirators, \"including government agencies,\" were linked to King's assassination.",
      "Other official findings have varied. The Justice Department conducted reviews of the assassination in 1977 and 2000, which asserted that Ray was the assassin and that he didn't act as part of a conspiracy. In the 1970s, the House Select Committee on Assassinations found that King was likely assassinated as part of a conspiracy involving Ray, but that the government wasn't involved.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has faced pressure from across the political spectrum \u2014 including from his supporters \u2014 to release government records on the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, after some members of his administration promised to disclose more information on the late financier. Last week, the Justice Department asked a court to unseal grand jury testimony from Epstein's 2019 child sex trafficking case.",
      "Late Monday, after records on her father were released, Bernice King\u00a0wrote on X: \"Now, do the Epstein files.\"",

      "An appellate court has allowed the Trump administration to end a program that grants temporary deportation protections and work permits to more than 10,000 people from Afghanistan and Cameroon.",
      "In a brief order Monday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit wrote that the plaintiff \u2014 an immigration advocacy group called CASA \u2014 has a plausible case against the administration for choosing to end temporary protected status, or TPS, for Afghans and Cameroonians. But the court said \"there is insufficient evidence to warrant the extraordinary remedy\" of blocking the government from phasing out TPS while the lawsuit works its way through the courts.",
      "One week ago, the appeals court temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending TPS for Afghanistan for one week, while it considered the merits of CASA's case.",
      "The administration had planned to end the program for Afghans last week. The program is set to end for Cameroonians in two weeks, on Aug. 4.",
      "The appellate court on Monday directed a lower court to \"move expeditiously\" to hear the case.",
      "Around\u00a011,700 Afghans\u00a0and\u00a05,200 Cameroonians\u00a0are enrolled in TPS, the government estimates. But roughly 3,600 of the Afghans and 200 of the Cameroonians have green cards, so they will not be affected. Those who lose their TPS protections can apply for asylum or some other form of legal status, but otherwise, they will be at risk of deportation.",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin called the ruling \"another win for the American people and the safety of our communities.\"",
      "\"TPS was never intended to be a de facto asylum program, yet it has been abused as one for decades. DHS records indicate that there are Afghan nationals who are TPS recipients who have been the subject of administrative investigations for fraud, public safety, and national security,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson called TPS a \"temporary benefit committed to the discretion of the President and the Secretary of Homeland Security,\" and said the administration was \"vindicated on appeal because the appeals court properly interpreted the law as written.\"",
      "AfghanEvac, a group that has helped relocate Afghans, said in a statement it is \"deeply alarmed\" by Monday's ruling.",
      "\"Lives will be upended. Families will be separated. Allies will be detained, deported, or forced into hiding\u2014while their legal rights remain unsettled,\" AfghanEvac President Shawn VanDiver said in a statement Monday night.",
      "CBS News has reached out to CASA for comment.",
      "The Trump administration has sought for months to roll back TPS, a program that allows the government to grant relief from deportation and work permits for people whose home countries are deemed unsafe due to natural disasters or war.",
      "The government argues that the TPS program is intended to be temporary, and Cameroon and Afghanistan are now safe enough for TPS recipients to return.",
      "Earlier this year, the Trump administration said Afghanistan's security situation and economy have improved despite the Taliban's 2021 takeover of the country following the U.S. military's withdrawal. And the government said a pair of armed conflicts in Cameroon \u2014 including a separatist conflict and an insurgency by the extremist group Boko Haram, which the U.S. designated a foreign terrorist organization in 2013 \u2014 are \"contained in limited regions\" and don't imperil people's personal safety in most of the country.",
      "\"This administration is returning TPS to its original temporary intent,\" Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said in a May statement announcing the Afghanistan decision.",
      "The State Department has placed a \"Do Not Travel\" advisory on Afghanistan, warning of the risk of \"civil unrest, crime, terrorism, risk of wrongful detention, kidnapping, and limited health facilities.\"  The department advises travelers to Cameroon to exercise caution, and not to travel to certain parts of the country due to armed violence, crime and terrorism.",
      "CASA has argued in court papers that both countries are unsafe, and TPS recipients could be endangered if they're forced to return to their home countries. The group says the conflict in Cameroon \u2014 which involves English-speaking separatists in a mostly French-speaking country \u2014 has created a humanitarian crisis and wrecked the African country's economy. And people from Afghanistan, the group notes, were made eligible for TPS because of repression by the Taliban and conflict between the group and ISIS-K insurgents.",
      "CASA also argues the administration hasn't followed the correct legal processes to end TPS, and contends the decision was \"preordained\" and based partly on \"racial animus.\"",
      "\"That animus is evidenced by the Trump Administration's efforts to eliminate lawful immigration status for noncitizens from countries the Administration believes are predominantly non-white, while simultaneously removing immigration barriers to noncitizens from countries the Administration believes are predominately white,\" the group said.",

Johnson also said the monitoring and maintenance allotment for the remainder of the fiscal year will be increased to $5,000 to be put toward personal security.",
      "Johnson said that at the end of September, he would evaluate \"all the data points, see how effective it was, how it was utilized, and then make decisions going forward.\"",
      "\"We live in an enhanced threat environment,\" Johnson told CBS News. \"We mourn the death of this intern that Ron Estes had, that you know, has been in the news the last couple of days, just an unspeakable tragedy.\"",

    "summary": "House lawmakers will head home until September after GOP leaders refuse to hold a vote on the release of Jeffrey Epstein-related files.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House will leave town early for its monthlong summer break as members clash over the release of files related to child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The lower chamber was originally scheduled to be in session through Thursday, but votes were scrapped as Democrats and some Republicans push for a floor vote to force the release of the Epstein files. Lawmakers will now head home until Sept. 2, after votes on Wednesday afternoon.",
      "On Monday night, the Epstein controversy disrupted another House Rules Committee meeting \u2014 the last hurdle for most legislation before it gets a floor vote \u2014 when Democrats threatened to make Republicans take more uncomfortable votes on Epstein-related amendments.",
      "The committee instead recessed for the remainder of the week, blocking the House from passing legislation with a simple majority. The House can still bypass the committee and approve noncontroversial legislation with a two-thirds majority.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson accused Democrats of playing \"political games.\"",
      "\"We all understand that the America first agenda and the American people are best served by putting an end to the Democrat side shows, and that's what we're doing by not allowing the Rules Committee to continue with that nonsense this week,\" the Louisiana Republican said.",
      "\"We are not going to let them use this as a political battering ram. The Rules Committee became the ground for them to do that,\" he said.",
      "House Republicans last week\u00a0offered a resolution\u00a0that carries no legal weight to make the Epstein files public as they faced increasing pressure on an issue that has split President Trump's base. But Johnson said Monday there would not be a vote on the issue before Congress' August recess.",
      "\"There's no purpose for Congress to push an administration to do something that they're already doing,\" Johnson reiterated Tuesday.",
      "Last week, the Justice Department formally asked a federal judge\u00a0to unseal transcripts from grand jury proceedings at the direction of Mr. Trump.",
      "Numerous lawmakers have said that their offices are fielding calls from constituents wanting more information released.",
      "\"I don't think this issue is going away over August,\" Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky said.",
      "Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California introduced a measure that would force the Justice Department to release Epstein-related files within 30 days. Massie plans to force a floor vote on the legislation once lawmakers return in September.",
      "\"I'm not quite certain what his strategy is,\" Johnson said. \"I don't understand Thomas Massie's motivation. I really don't. I don't know how his mind works. I don't know what he's thinking. Thomas Massie could have brought his discharge petition anytime over the last four and a half years.\"",
      "\"When the speaker stands in the way of justice and transparency, this is how we get justice,\" Massie said Monday. Grand jury testimony is \"like one of 12 things that we need,\" he said, adding, \"I do believe that there are some things that need to be brought to the American public's knowledge that have happened that will be embarrassing.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Jul 2025 07:06:58 -0400",
    "summary": "The Labor Department is seeking to pull back on the regulation of workplaces by rewriting or repealing more than 60 \"obsolete\" regulations.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Labor is aiming to rewrite or repeal more than 60 \"obsolete\" workplace regulations, ranging from minimum wage requirements for home health care workers and people with disabilities to standards governing exposure to harmful substances.",
      "If approved, the wide-ranging changes unveiled this month also would affect working conditions at constructions sites and in mines, and limit the government's ability to penalize employers if workers are injured or killed while engaging in inherently risky activities such as movie stunts or animal training.",
      "The Labor Department says the goal is to reduce costly, burdensome rules imposed under previous administrations, and to deliver on President Trump's commitment to restore American prosperity through deregulation.",
      "\"The Department of Labor is proud to lead the way by eliminating unnecessary regulations that stifle growth and limit opportunity,\" Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement, which boasted the \"most ambitious proposal to slash red tape of any department across the federal government.\"",
      "Critics say the proposals would put workers at greater risk of harm, with women and members of minority groups bearing a disproportionate impact.",
      "\"People are at very great risk of dying on the job already,\" Rebecca Reindel, the AFL-CIO union's occupational safety and health director, said. \"This is something that is only going to make the problem worse.\"",
      "The proposed changes have several stages to get through before they can take effect, including a public comment period for each one.",
      "Some rollbacks under consideration",
      "Home health care workers help elderly or medically fragile people by preparing meals, administering medications, assisting with toilet use, accompanying clients to doctor appointments and performing other tasks. Under one of the Labor Department's proposals, an estimated 3.7 million workers employed by home care agencies could be paid below the federal minimum wage - currently $7.25 per hour - and made ineligible for overtime pay if they aren't covered by corresponding state laws.",
      "The proposed rule would reverse changes made in 2013 under former President Barack Obama and revert to a regulatory framework from 1975. The Labor Department says that by lowering labor and compliance costs, its revisions might expand the home care market and help keep frail individuals in their homes longer.",
      "Judy Conti, director of government affairs at the National Employment Law Project, said her organization plans to work hard to defeat the proposal. Home health workers are subject to injuries from lifting clients, and \"before those (2013) regulations, it was very common for home care workers to work 50, 60 and maybe even more hours a week without getting any overtime pay,\" Conti said.",
      "Others endorse the proposal, including the Independent Women's Forum, a conservative nonprofit based in Virginia. Women often bear the brunt of family caregiving responsibilities, so making home care more affordable would help women balance work and personal responsibilities, the group's president, Carrie Lukas, said.",
      "\"We're pleased to see the Trump administration moving forward on rolling back some of what we saw as counterproductive micromanaging of relationships that were making it hard for people to get the care they need,\" Lukas said.",
      "Samantha Sanders, director of government affairs and advocacy at the nonprofit Economic Policy Institute, said the repeal wouldn't constitute a win for women.",
      "\"Saying we actually don't think they need those protections would be pretty devastating to a workforce that performs really essential work and is very heavily dominated by women, and women of color in particular,\" Sanders said.",
      "Migrant farmworkers",
      "Last year, the Labor Department finalized rules that provided protections to migrant farmworkers who held H-2A visas. The current administration says most of those rules placed unnecessary and costly requirements on employers.",
      "Under the new proposal, the Labor Department would rescind a requirement for most employer-provided transportation to have seat belts for those agriculture workers.",
      "The department is also proposing to reverse a 2024 rule that protected migrant farmworkers from retaliation for activities such as filing a complaint and testifying or participating in an investigation, hearing or proceeding.",
      "\"There's a long history of retaliation against workers who speak up against abuses in farm work. And with H-2A it's even worse because the employer can just not renew your visa,\" said Lori Johnson, senior attorney at Farmworker Justice.",
      "Michael Marsh, president and CEO of the National Council of Agricultural Employers, applauded the deregulation efforts, saying farmers have been hit with thousands of pages of regulations pertaining to migrant farmworkers in recent years.",
      "\"Can you imagine a farmer and his or her spouse trying to navigate 3,000 new pages of regulation in 18 months and then be liable for every one of them?\" he asked.",
      "Construction workers",
      "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, part of the Labor Department, wants to rescind a requirement for employers to provide adequate lighting at construction sites, saying the regulation doesn't substantially reduce a significant risk.",
      "OSHA said if employers fail to correct lighting deficiencies at construction worksites, the agency can issue citations under its \"general duty clause.\" The clause requires employers to provide a place of employment free from recognized hazards that are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.",
      "Worker advocates think getting rid of a specific construction site requirement is a bad idea. \"There have been many fatalities where workers fall through a hole in the floor, where there's not adequate lighting,\" Reindel said. \"It's a very obvious thing that employers should address, but unfortunately it's one of those things where we need a standard, and it's violated all the time.\"",
      "Miners and more",
      "Several proposals could impact safety procedures for mines. For example, employers have to submit plans for ventilation and preventing roof collapses in coal mines for review by the Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Administration. Currently, MSHA district managers can require mine operators to take additional steps to improve those plans.",
      "The Labor Department wants to end that authority, saying current regulations give the district manager the ability to draft and create laws without soliciting comments or action by Congress.",
      "Similarly, the department is proposing to strip district managers of their ability to require changes to mine health and safety training programs.",
      "The general duty clause allows OSHA to punish employers for unsafe working conditions when there's no specific standard in place to cover a situation.",
      "An OSHA proposal would exclude the agency from applying the clause to prohibit, restrict or penalize employers for \"inherently risky professional activities that are intrinsic to professional, athletic, or entertainment occupations.\"",
      "A preliminary analysis identified athletes, actors, dancers, musicians, other entertainers and journalists as among the types of workers the limitation would apply to.",
      "\"It is simply not plausible to assert that Congress, when passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act, silently intended to authorize the Department of Labor to eliminate familiar sports and entertainment practices, such as punt returns in the NFL, speeding in NASCAR, or the whale show at SeaWorld,\" the proposed rule reads.",
      "Debbie Berkowitz, who served as OSHA chief of staff during the Obama administration, said she thinks limiting the agency's enforcement authority would be a mistake.",
      "\"Once you start taking that threat away, you could return to where they'll throw safety to the wind, because there are other production pressures they have,\" Berkowitz said.",

      "Washington \u2014 Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia asked a federal judge overseeing his criminal case to put off his release from custody for 30 days if the judge rejects a Justice Department bid to keep him in confinement while awaiting a trial.",
      "Abrego Garcica's lawyers said in a filing that the 30-day pause in issuing a release order would give him time to evaluate his legal options in response to likely efforts by the Department of Homeland Security to deport him.",
      "\"We have been advised by the government that if the court denies the government's motion for revocation, the defendant would be transferred to the custody of the Department of Homeland Security ('DHS'), and DHS would begin removal proceedings,\" they wrote.",
      "The Justice Department does not object to the request, and Abrego Garcia's legal team said that the delay would not affect their ability to come up with a proposed schedule leading up to his criminal trial.",
      "A federal grand jury in Tennessee indicted Abrego Garcia\u00a0in late May on two counts of human smuggling. He has pleaded not guilty to both counts. A trial in his case is set to begin in January.",
      "Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign, but his removal gained headlines after a federal immigration official acknowledged it was an administrative error. An immigration judge had granted Abrego Garcia a withholding of removal in 2019, which prevented DHS from deporting him to his home country of El Salvador because he was likely to face persecution by local gangs.",
      "Abrego Garcia, who has lived in Maryland after coming to the U.S. illegally in 2011, and his wife filed a civil lawsuit against the Trump administration in March challenging his removal, and a federal judge in Maryland ordered the government to facilitate his return to the U.S.",
      "After weeks of back-and-forth \u2014 and his case reaching the Supreme Court \u2014 Attorney General Pam Bondi announced in early June that Abrego Garcia had been released from Salvadoran custody and brought back to the U.S. to face criminal charges stemming from his alleged participation in a scheme to smuggle undocumented migrants into the country.",
      "A federal magistrate judge last month ordered Abrego Garcia's release from federal law enforcement custody while he awaits a trial, but that raised concerns that he would be swiftly detained by immigration agents and possibly deported. The Justice Department appealed that decision and asked a U.S. district judge to revoke the release order.",
      "The judge overseeing the criminal case, Waverly Crenshaw, held a hearing last week on the government's motion but has not yet ruled on whether to grant it. If Crenshaw denies the bid, it would give the green-light for Abrego Garcia to be released from criminal custody.",
      "But the prospect that Abrego Garcia would then swiftly be detained by the Department of Homeland Security for removal proceedings has created a new tangle for the courts to unravel. He has remained in the custody of U.S. Marshals as the legal proceedings have continued.",
      "In the ongoing civil case in Maryland, the federal judge is considering a separate request from Abrego Garcia's lawyers to return him to Maryland immediately after he is released from confinement in the criminal proceedings that are ongoing in Tennessee. They also asked the judge to bar the Trump administration from removing Abrego Garcia from the U.S.",

      "\"My belief is we need the administration to have the space to do what it is doing, and if further congressional action is necessary or appropriate, then we'll look at that,\" the Louisiana Republican told reporters Monday. \"But I don't think we're at that point right now because we agree with the president.\"",

      "In an effort to alleviate the pressure from some of Mr. Trump's most fervent supporters, which Democrats have sought to capitalize on, House Republicans last week offered a resolution that carries no legal weight to make the Epstein files public.",

      "The Republican National Committee ended the first half of 2025 with a $65.56 million cash on hand advantage over the Democratic Party, as the left works to rebound from 2024 election losses and the right continues to deeply intertwine its future with President Trump.",
      "New campaign finance filings show the RNC had more than $80.7 million at the end of June, while the Democratic National Committee finished with around $15.2 million in cash on hand as both parties prepare for next year's midterm elections.",

      "The gap between the two is far wider than this same time period before the 2018 midterms, when the RNC's cash on hand advantage over the DNC was $37.2 million at the end of June 2017. The political dynamics at that point were similar to now, with President Trump months removed from winning the White House and Republicans controlling the House and Senate. In the 2018 midterms, Democrats won back the House and started to build momentum that carried over into Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election.",
      "While the midterms are still more than a year away, it already appears likely the House will be Democrats' easiest route to winning back power in Washington. Republicans are also contending with the potential challenge that often befalls the party of the president, where the midterms become a referendum on the commander in chief.",
      "Democrats are facing continued questions about their approach moving forward after last fall's election setbacks, where Mr. Trump won a second term as president and the party lost the Senate and failed to retake the House. Earlier this year, party leaders chose Ken Martin, then the head of Minnesota's Democratic Party, to take over the DNC in an attempt to gain stronger footing with next year's midterms and the 2028 presidential election in mind.",

      "Can you teach an old dog new tricks? Atlantic staff writer Olga Khazan set out to change aspects of her personality she didn't like by forcing herself outside of her comfort zone, and documented the progress she made in her new book, \"Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change\" (Simon & Schuster/Simon Element).",
      "Among the challenges that Khazan, a lifelong introvert, set for herself: Tackling her social anxiety by enrolling in an improv class. Yes, and \u2026 how did that go?",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Susan Spencer's interview with Olga Khazan on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" July 20!",
      "\"Me, But Better\" by Olga Khazan",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "My journey into extroversion began solitarily, with me watching the improv show Middleditch & Schwartz on Netflix one night. The episode opened with two well-known actors, Thomas Middleditch and Ben Schwartz, spending an uncomfortably long time pulling a premise for their sketch out of a random audience member\u2014a photography intern. Then, on a bare stage, Middleditch pretended to interview Schwartz for a photography job, making up absurd questions like \"embody a gazelle.\"",
      "The audience laughed along gamely, but mostly, the scene reminded me that I needed to file my expense report. I felt uneasy for the actors, like at any moment the crowd could turn on them, leaving them groping for laughs in ghostly silence. I wondered why they couldn't have just written out better scenes ahead of time. And even worse, I knew that soon, I would be in their exact same position, except without the advantage of being a famous comedian.",
      "For my personality-change project, I had decided to focus on each of the five traits intensively for a few months at a time, and I tackled extroversion first. In recent years my life had descended into a rut that I didn't particularly like, and extroversion seemed like the way out. Most days, I worked, made dinner, watched TV, and worked some more. Rich and I were planning to relocate, and it occurred to me that I would have both moved into and out of my house without having met any of my neighbors. A test in a self-help book reminded me that I have \"high loneliness.\"",
      "My \"very low\" extroversion score was probably not surprising to people who know me: My friend Anastasia once sentenced me to attending a party on pain of ending our friendship. But my hard-core introversion could turn pernicious, shading at times into loneliness and isolation. I have a career in which work can expand to fill every crevice of the day, and sometimes I thought that was a good thing, because I didn't have many hobbies or friends to otherwise occupy my time. (And say what you will about extroverts, but they have plenty of hobbies and friends.) I had always told myself I could focus on socializing after my life had stabilized, but the absence of social interaction was, itself, destabilizing.",
      "Of all five traits, extroversion offers the simplest path to personality change: You just have to go out and talk to people. You don't even have to be particularly good at it, or to proclaim yourself an \"extrovert\" while you do it. You just go, and extroversion will find you, like the entire wedding follows the first intrepid dancer.",
      "Coincidentally, this is also the ethos behind improv comedy: You just have to say something. Anything! For the uninitiated, \"improv\" is short for \"improvisational theater.\" The idea is that two or more actors get up on stage without knowing what they'll say or do. They get to the \"scene\" by accepting and building on a partner's improvisations\u2014a concept known as \"yes, and.\" When this is done well, improvisers say there is virtually no difference between improv and scripted theater\u2014a claim about which opinions surely differ.",
      "I knew I needed a commitment device for extroversion\u2014something to force me out of my house and into gregariousness. I decided to try improv, which seemed like the full-immersion extrovert experience.",
      "It also felt like full-immersion insanity. Rich saw me entering my credit-card information into the website of Dojo Comedy, a cozy-looking D.C. improv theater whose logo incorporates a pair of mustachioed Groucho Marx comedy glasses. \"You doing improv is like Larry David doing ice hockey,\" he said.",
      "It's true. My general vibe is less \"yes, and\" and more \"well, actually.\" I've never really liked improv as an art form. I don't find it particularly funny\u2014it's more like an extended inside joke you're never going to get. I thought Middleditch would warm me to improv, but it only turned me off more.",
      "Before the first class a few weeks later, I donned a Groundlings-ready black T-shirt and jeans, hoping to draw as little attention to myself as possible. I tried to shake memories of being so timid in middle-school drama class that I only qualified to be the understudy for the smallest role\u2014Bob Cratchit's daughter. When I typed the address of the improv studio into my phone, I was relieved when the red snake of \"heavier than usual traffic\" indicated that I would have at least an hour to mentally prepare.",
      "The improv class met in an old townhouse, in a room that was, for no discernible reason, filled with dozens of sculptures of elephants. Six of us novices sat in a circle on chairs that looked like they'd been salvaged from Victorian funerals.",
      "The instructor, a short brunette with a brisk, friendly manner, opened by asking us about our past improv experience\u2014none, in my case. One of the other women rattled off a long list of improv classes she had taken. What kind of crazy person does improv multiple times? I wondered. (Me, as it would turn out.)",
      "Right after the instructor said, \"Let's get started,\" I prayed for someone to grab an elephant and knock me unconscious. That didn't happen, so instead I stood up to play warm-up games with a software engineer, two lawyers, and a guy who worked on the Hill. The games were meant to loosen us up for what was to come, which was \"scene work,\" or acting out unscripted mini plays with one another.",
      "First, we learned the improv standard Zip Zap Zop, which involves whooshing beams of energy at one another and taking turns saying \"Zip,\" \"Zap,\" and\u2014you guessed it\u2014 \"Zop.\" The point of the game is to stay unflustered enough to keep up the Zip-Zap-Zop sequence while still whooshing on to someone else in the circle.",
      "I struggled for several reasons: Because of the pandemic, I hadn't been in a room with other people for more than a year. On top of that, I have poor reflexes, and, because we wore masks, you had to determine whether someone was about to Zop you solely by the angle of their eyes.",
      "If someone messed up the sequence\u2014said \"Zip\" to another's \"Zip,\" for instance\u2014we would all stop, clap, and say, \"yay!,\" reinforcing the idea that it's okay to screw up in improv. The spirit of all this was so different from my job, where you can get fired for screwing up, that it felt like some sort of rehab for perfectionists.",
      "Then we moved on to juggling various invisible items between one another, including an invisible ball, which, humiliatingly, we had to refer to as \"invisible ball!\" I sensed that the others were as nervous as I was, but this being D.C., an air of try-hard overachievement subsumed everyone's true emotions. People, myself included, will behave ridiculously if they feel they have no alternative. I imagined all my fellow ball-jugglers back at work the next day, writing emails in which they promised to circle back and touch base. I wondered whether they would think back to this moment of whimsy at their brown-bag lunches, as they gravely discussed the situation in Burkina Faso. Maybe it would make the situation in Burkina Faso seem less chaotic by comparison.",
      "Soon it was time to call an invisible hawk to my arm. I noted with gratitude that at least the blinds were closed, so no one could see us from the street.",

    "summary": "Writer Olga Khazan, a lifelong introvert obsessed with work, was unhappy with who she was, and so vowed to redesign her personality by living outside her comfort zone \u2013 a journey she documented in her new book, \"Me, But Better.\"",
    "story": [
      "For years, Olga Khazan, a Virginia-based staff writer at The Atlantic, knew she had a big problem: she hated much of her own personality. \"I was constantly worried about everything,\" she said. \"Just never living in the moment. And I didn't really like doing anything fun with other people. Just wasn't my thing.\"",
      "How might she function at a party? \"I would kind of stand off to myself, and honestly, sometimes just, like, read articles on my phone or just basically not engage,\" she laughed.",
      "Not surprisingly, a lot of folks didn't want to engage with Khazan, either. \"One person called me a pressure addict, that I was sort of obsessed with working, and just doing as much work as possible, and never taking a minute to appreciate life,\" she said. \"One person told me that she was kind of afraid of me when we worked together.\"",
      "Predictably, when she took a personality test four years ago, she was off the charts \u2013 way off \u2013 in neuroticism, or negative emotions \u2026 not that she hadn't tried to find help: \"This whole time I'd been in therapy,\" Khazan said. \"I had taken different medications. I did yoga. And I did all the self-care things. Nothing was truly working.\"",
      "Frustrated, Khazan set out to do something much more radical: She vowed to redesign her whole personality. \"I decided to spend a year trying to change my personality traits,\" she laughed.",
      "Professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala described one's personality as \"your characteristic way of thinking, feeling, and behaving. It's how you think about your behavior and how you act.\"",
      "I asked, \"I always assumed that once you had reached a certain age, your personality was your personality?\"",
      "\"That really is, I think, the prevailing way to think about personality, but it doesn't line up with our science,\" Sauer-Zavala replied.",
      "Personality science is her specialty, and her research at the University of Kentucky could be a game-changer for how we approach mental health issues. She says data tells us it is possible to scientifically change your personality, and that, with the right intervention, introverts can become extroverts \u2026 sloppy people can get neater \u2026 slackers can gain ambition \u2026 and anxious people can learn to be calm. \"In my almost 20 years of treating people with anxiety disorders, I've seen dramatic changes in 12, 16, 20 weeks,\" Sauer-Zavala said.",
      "Step one is a baseline personality test, which asks questions such as: \"I sometimes manipulate people into doing what I want.\"",
      "The next step is forcing yourself to act the opposite of how you normally would. If you're shy, make conversations. If you're messy, make the bed.",
      "Sauer-Zavala said, \"When we make intentional changes to our thinking, our feeling, and our behaviors, and we maintain those changes over time, then we're essentially shifting our personality. We're changing the way we're gonna fill out those bubbles on the personality questionnaire.\"",
      "\"So, you consciously adopt the behavior of the personality that you think you want?\" I asked. \"You make it sound easy.\"",
      "\"It's not easy,\" Sauer-Zavala replied. \"The principles are simple, but the execution is difficult.\"",
      "It wasn't easy for Olga Khazan, the lifelong introvert. Among other strategies to tackle her social anxiety, she enrolled in an improv class with total strangers \u2026 something completely outside her comfort zone. \"I was very, very scared,\" she said. \"Probably for the first three or four months that I did it, my heart was really beating in my chest, and I was deeply uncomfortable.\"",
      "What about it scared her? \"I didn't like looking silly!\" she laughed.",
      "Murphy McHugh, who was Khazan's improv teacher, said, \"For me, doing improv was a life-changing thing. I opened up socially. I became a better listener, a better collaborator.\"",
      "He said as Khazan continued coming to class, he noticed changes in her: \"Relaxing, a little bit less of the cross-armed body language. You see someone relaxed, you see their shoulders drop. You see them laughing, and coming into scenes with an idea.\"",
      "Along with improv, Khazan meditated, went sailing, took conversation classes, and kept a journal, as she describes in a new book, \"Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change.\"",
      "\"Journaling kind of helps you focus on some of the more positive elements of your life that, if you're very neurotic, you tend to kind of gloss over or forget,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Is this a case of fake it 'til you make it?\"",
      "\"Yeah, it is fake it 'til you make it,\" Khazan said. \"Because if you think about it, anything is gonna feel fake if it feels new, right? Anything that you're not accustomed to doing is gonna feel really unnatural. But the only way to make it natural is to do it over and over and over again\"",
      "\"And just incorporate it in who you are?\"",
      "\"Exactly.\"",
      "Today, Khazan is happily married, with a 14-month-old baby. As for that personality she once so disliked, she said, \"I feel like I am a different person today than I was three years ago. I think I genuinely have a different way of living my life, and approaching problems, than I did before.\"",
      "So, what advice does Shannon Sauer-Zavala have for everyone watching with completely unsatisfactory personalities? \"Not to get stuck in a personality-type box,\" she said. \"Think about the life that you want to have, and then know that you can intentionally develop the traits that will facilitate that journey for you.\"",

    "summary": "A groundbreaking IVF trial has raised hope that women with genetic mutations in their own DNA could one day have children without passing on deadly diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Eight healthy babies have been born in the U.K. using a new IVF technique that successfully reduced their risk of inheriting genetic diseases from their mothers, the people behind a world-first trial said Wednesday.",
      "The findings were hailed as a breakthrough, which raises hopes that women with mutations in their mitochondrial DNA could one day have children without passing debilitating or deadly diseases on to the children. One out of every 5,000 births is affected by mitochondrial diseases, which cannot be treated, and include symptoms such as impaired vision, diabetes and muscle wasting.",
      "In 2015, Britain became the first country to approve an in-vitro fertilization technique that uses a small amount of healthy mitochondrial DNA from the egg of a donor \u2014 along with the mother's egg and father's sperm.",
      "Some have called the result of this process \"three-parent babies,\" though researchers have pushed back at this term because only roughly 0.1% of the newborn's DNA comes from the donor.",
      "The results of the much-awaited U.K. trial were published in several papers in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "8 children with DNA from 3 people currently healthy",
      "Out of 22 women to undergo the treatment at the Newcastle Fertility Centre in northeast England, eight babies were born. The four boys and four girls now range from under 6 months to over 2 years old.",
      "The amount of mutated mitochondrial DNA \u2014 which causes disease \u2014   was reduced by 95-100% in six of the babies, according to the research. For the other two newborns, the amount fell by 77-88%, which is still below the range that causes disease.",
      "This indicates the technique was \"effective in reducing transmission\" of diseases between mother and child, one of the studies said.",
      "The eight children are currently healthy, though one had a disturbance of their heart's rhythm which was successfully treated, the researchers said.",
      "Their health will be followed up over the coming years to see if problems arise.",
      "Oxford University reproductive genetics expert Dagan Wells noted that among the eight children, three have shown some signs of what is known as \"reversal,\" which is still little understood.",
      "It is \"a phenomenon where the therapy initially succeeds in producing an embryo with very few defective mitochondria, but by the time the child is born the proportion of abnormal mitochondria in its cells has significantly increased,\" he explained.",
      "Nevertheless, Nils-Goran Larsson, a Swedish reproductive expert not involved in the research, hailed it as a \"breakthrough.\"",
      "The new technique offers a \"very important reproductive option\" for families affected by \"devastating\" mitochondrial diseases, he added.",
      "While the U.K. trial is the first to involve multiple mothers, the eight babies born to them are not the first to be born with DNA from three people. That first came in 2016, after a woman was treated by U.S. fertility specialists in Mexico, where there were no laws regulating the practice. A similar IVF method was used in that groundbreaking case.",
      "Ethical concerns over embryos and \"designer babies\"",
      "Mitochondrial donation remains controversial and has not been approved in many countries, including the United States and France.",
      "Religious leaders have opposed the procedure because it involves the destruction of human embryos. Other opponents have expressed fears it could pave the way for genetically engineered \"designer babies.\"",
      "An ethical review carried out by the U.K.'s independent Nuffield Council on Bioethics was \"instrumental\" in conducting the new research, the council's director Danielle Hamm said Wednesday.",
      "Peter Thompson, head of the U.K.'s Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which approved the procedure, said only people with a \"very high risk\" of passing on a mitochondrial disease would be eligible for the treatment.",
      "Ethical concerns have also been raised over the use of mitochondrial donation for infertility in Greece and Ukraine.",
      "French mitochondrial disease specialist Julie Steffann told AFP that \"it is a question of the risk-benefit ratio: for a mitochondrial disease, the benefit is obvious.\"",
      "\"In the context of infertility, it has not been proven,\" she added.",

Tim Scott, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement Thursday following the bill's passage by Congress.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backed the passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What will the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) established guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the Genius Act passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaited approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks were already considering how they could integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "Outside of the banking world, companies like Walmart and Amazon are also exploring the idea of issuing their own stablecoins, Sam Mcingvale, head of product at blockchain technology company Optimism, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"If new stablecoin legislation is passed, we expect it to open the floodgates even further,\" he said.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Congress' approval of the Genius Act aligns with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "The president on Tuesdy\u00a0posted\u00a0his support for the Genius Act on Truth Social.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "The price of bitcoin was up 1.40% on Thursday, rising to $120,584.80; etherium's price rose 3.41% to $3,486.86.",
      "Shares of Coinbase, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, rose 3.2% on Thursday, to close at $410.75.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 15:30:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Content promoting extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery is available to young TikTok users, breaching the social media platform's policies.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were easily found with a simple search on TikTok and available to a user under the age of 18, in violation of the platform's own policies, CBS News has found.",
      "CBS News created a TikTok account for a hypothetical 15-year-old female user in the United States and found that, at the very least, hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were searchable and watchable on the platform using the account.",
      "Once the CBS News account interacted with a handful of these videos, similar content was then recommended to the account on TikTok's \"For You\" feed.",
      "Searchable videos ranged from content with captions such as, \"nothing feels better than an empty stomach,\" to \"what I eat in a day\" videos promoting restrictive, 500-calorie-per-day diets. Guidelines published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggest that girls between the ages of 14 and 18 ingest between 1,800 and 2,400 calories per day.",
      "Many of the videos promoted thin body types as aspirational targets and included the hashtag \"harsh motivation\" to push extreme weight loss advice.",
      "Some of those videos included messages or slogans such as \"skinny is a status symbol\" and \"every time you say no to food, you say yes to skinny.\"",
      "TikTok's community guidelines say the platform only allows users over the age of 18 to see content promoting restrictive, low-calorie diets, including videos promoting medications for weight loss or idealizing certain body types. The Chinese-owned platform also says it bans users under the age of 18 from viewing videos that promote cosmetic surgery without warning of the risks, such as before-and-after images, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery.",
      "But CBS News found a range of videos by entering basic search terms on the platform, such as \"skinny,\" \"thin,\" and \"low cal,\" that promoted thin bodies as ideal, while also pushing harmful weight management behaviors. One such video showed an image of a scale with a weight of 39.9 kg (88 pounds) alongside a caption saying \"weight loss\" and the hashtag \"ed,\" which is a common abbreviation for \"eating disorder.\"",
      "Another graphic video with the caption \"ana gives you wings\" showed a series of models with protruding collar bones and spines. The term \"ana\" is an abbreviation for the eating disorder anorexia.",
      "Responding to CBS News' research, a TikTok spokesperson said Thursday that it was \"based on a very limited sample size and does not reflect the experience of the vast majority of our community.\"",
      "\"TikTok does not allow content that promotes disordered eating or extreme weight loss behaviours, and we work with health experts to provide in-app support resources where needed,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson pointed to a study published in May by the University of Southern California, which found that a majority of the eating disorder content on TikTok is discussion among users about recovery from such conditions.",
      "The same study noted, however, the platform's \"dual role in both challenging harmful cultural norms and potentially perpetuating them,\" regarding body image perceptions and eating disorders.",
      "\"We know that this isn't a one-off error on TikTok's part and that children are coming across this content on a scale,\" said Gareth Hill, a spokesperson for the Molly Russell foundation, a charity in the United Kingdom that works to prevent young people from committing self-harm.",
      "\"The question for TikTok is, if this is not representative, then why has this account [created by CBS News], which is a child's account, been shown this content in the first place, and then why is it continuing to get recommended to it?\"",
      "CBS News also found a wide variety of videos available to the under-18 user promoting the weight loss drug Ozempic and various forms of cosmetic surgery. That included videos that showed up on the recommended \"For You\" feed, which promotes cosmetic surgeries such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and liposuction.",
      "In one case, a user talking about their waist reduction surgery included a voiceover saying: \"I would rather die hot than live ugly.\"",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment specifically on CBS News' findings regarding cosmetic surgeries being promoted to underage users.",
      "TikTok says it has taken a range of measures over the past several months to address criticism regarding the availability of extreme weight loss content on the platform. In early June, the platform suspended search results for the viral hashtag #SkinnyTok, after drawing criticism from health experts and European regulators. The hashtag had been associated primarily with videos promoting extreme weight loss, calorie restriction and negative body talk, often presented as wellness advice.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson also told CBS News on Thursday that searches for words or phrases such as #Anorexia would lead users to relevant assistance, including localized eating disorder helplines, where they can access further information and support.",
      "\"I think we're understanding more and more about how this content shows up and so even when you ban a particular hashtag, for example, it's not long until something similar jumps up in its place,\" Doreen Marshall, who leads the American nonprofit National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA], told CBS News.",
      "\"This is going to be an evolving landscape both for creating content guidelines, but also for the platforms themselves and, you know, while some progress has been made, there's clearly more that can be done,\" Marshall said.",
      "TikTok is not the only social media platform that has faced criticism for the accessibility of extreme weight loss content.",
      "In 2022, 60 Minutes reported on a leaked internal document from Meta that showed the company was aware, through its own research, of content on its Instagram platform promoting extreme weight loss and fueling eating disorders in young people.",
      "At the time, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined 60 Minutes' request for an interview but its global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said, \"We want teens to be safe online\" and that Instagram doesn't \"allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders.\"",
      "Last year, 60 Minutes reported that the Google-owned YouTube video platform, which is hugely popular among teenagers, was also serving up extreme weight loss and eating disorder content to children.",
      "Responding to that report, a YouTube representative said the platform \"continually works with mental health experts to refine [its] approach to content recommendations for teens.\"",

      "President Trump installed Habba, who had served as his personal attorney, on March 24 in an interim capacity.

    "story": [
      "Venus Williams became the second-oldest woman to win a tour-level singles match in professional tennis, delivering some of her familiar big serves and groundstrokes at age 45 while beating Peyton Stearns \u2014 22 years her junior \u2014 by a 6-3, 6-4 score at the DC Open on Tuesday night.",
      "This was the first singles victory for Williams in nearly two years. The only older woman to win a match was Martina Navratilova at 47 in 2004.",
      "The former No. 1-ranked Williams had not played singles in an official match since March 2024 in Miami, missing time while having surgery to remove uterine fibroids. She hadn't won in singles since August 2023 in Cincinnati. Until this week, she was listed by the WTA Tour as \"inactive.\"",
      "\"It is not easy,\" Williams said, \"to (come back) after all that time and play the perfect match.\"",
      "But backed by a crowd that clearly was there to see, and support, her at the hard-court tournament in the nation's capital, Williams showed glimpses of the talent she possesses and the skills she displayed while earning all of her Grand Slam titles: seven in singles, 14 in women's doubles \u2014 all alongside younger sister Serena \u2014 and two in mixed doubles.",
      "\"I wanted to play a good match,\" she told the fans, then added a phrase that drew appreciative roars: \"and win the match.\"",
      "In Tuesday's second game, for example, Williams smacked a return winner to get things started, then delivered a couple of other big responses to break Stearns, a 23-year-old who won singles and team NCAA titles at the University of Texas and is currently ranked 35th.",
      "In the next game, Williams sprinted forward to reach a drop shot and replied with a winner. Soon, she led 4-2, then closed that set.",
      "She was accompanied by choruses of cheers. The first arrived when Williams walked out into the main stadium at the DC Open, a 7,000-seat arena that's more than twice as large as where she was for her doubles victory a day earlier. Another came when she strode from the sideline to the center of the court for the formality of the coin toss. The noise really reached a crescendo when Williams began hitting aces \u2014 at 110 mph and faster \u2014 the way she used to.",
      "There also were moments where Williams \u2014 who said her fianc\u00e9 was in the stands \u2014 looked as if it had been just as long as it actually has since she competed, including in the opening game, when she got broken at love this way: forehand wide, forehand into the net, forehand long, backhand long.",
      "At the end, it took Williams a bit of extra effort to close things out. She kept holding match points and kept failing to convert them. But eventually, she powered in a 112 mph serve that Stearns returned into the net. That was it: Williams smiled wide as can be and jogged to the net to shake hands, then performed her customary post-win pirouette-and-wave.",
      "She advanced to a second-round matchup against No. 5 seed Magdalena Frech, a 27-year-old from Poland.",
      "In other action Tuesday, Emma Raducanu handed No. 7 seed Marta Kostyuk a sixth consecutive loss by eliminating her 7-6 (4), 6-4. That set up a matchup between Raducanu and four-time major champion Naomi Osaka, who was a 6-2, 7-5 winner against Yulia Putintseva.",
      "Two top men's seeds exited: Cam Norrie beat No. 2 Lorenzo Musetti 3-6, 6-2, 6-3, and No. 3 Holger Rune withdrew from the tournament because of a back injury. No. 4 seed Ben Shelton defeated Mackie McDonald 6-3, 6-4.",

    "summary": "The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee has effectively barred transgender women from competing in women's sports, telling sports governing bodies it has an \"obligation to comply\" with federal policy.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee has effectively barred transgender women from competing in women's sports, telling the federations overseeing swimming, athletics and other sports it has an \"obligation to comply\" with an\u00a0executive order\u00a0issued by President Trump.",
      "The new policy, announced Monday with\u00a0a quiet change on the USOPC's website\u00a0and confirmed in a letter sent to national sport governing bodies, follows a similar step taken by the NCAA earlier this year.",
      "The USOPC change is noted obliquely as a detail under \"USOPC Athlete Safety Policy\" and references Mr. Trump's executive order, \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports,\" signed in February. That order, among other things, threatens to \"rescind all funds\" from organizations that allow transgender athlete participation in women's sports.",
      "U.S. Olympic officials told the national governing bodies they will need to follow suit, adding that \"the USOPC has engaged in a series of respectful and constructive conversations with federal officials\" since Mr. Trump signed the order.",
      "\"As a federally chartered organization, we have an obligation to comply with federal expectations,\" USOPC CEO Sarah Hirshland and President Gene Sykes wrote in a letter. \"Our revised policy emphasizes the importance of ensuring fair and safe competition environments for women. All National Governing Bodies are required to update their applicable policies in alignment.\"",
      "At the 2024 Olympics in Paris, just one openly transgender U.S. athlete competed. Nikki Hiltz, a middle-distance runner from California who uses they/them pronouns, was assigned female at birth. It's unclear how the change announced by USOPC would impact Hiltz.",
      "At a\u00a0USOPC meeting in April, Hirshland said that the committee had no plans to define eligibility criteria ahead of the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.",
      "\"So typically speaking at an international level, the international federations will define eligibility criteria for the events in which they own jurisdiction, world Cups, world Championships, et cetera, and the national governing bodies domestically would define eligibility criteria for their events,\" Hirshland said at the time. \"In some cases those may be elite level events, national championships and things. In other cases those may be lower level grassroots youth sport competitions and things of that nature. So we do not have, nor will we have an eligibility policy, it wouldn't be appropriate, it's not our role to take on that position.\"",
      "The National Women's Law Center put out a statement condemning the move.",
      "\"By giving into the political demands, the USOPC is sacrificing the needs and safety of its own athletes,\" said that organization's president and CEO, Fatima Goss Graves.",
      "The USOPC oversees around 50 national governing bodies, most of which play a role in everything from the grassroots to elite levels of their sports. That raises the possibility that rules might need to be changed at local sports clubs to retain their memberships in the NGBs.",
      "Some of those organizations \u2014 for instance, USA Track and Field \u2014 have long followed guidelines set by their own world federation. World Athletics is considering changes to its policies that would mostly fall in line with Mr. Trump's order.",
      "A USA Swimming spokesman said the federation had been made aware of the USOPC's change and was consulting with the committee to figure out what changes it needs to make. USA Fencing changed its policy effective Aug. 1 to allow only \"athletes who are of the female sex\" in women's competition and opening men's events to \"all athletes not eligible for the women's category, including transgender women, transgender men, non-binary and intersex athletes and cisgender male athletes.\"",
      "The nationwide battle over transgender athletes on girls' and women's sports teams has played out at both the state and federal levels as Republicans portray the issue as a fight for athletic fairness. More than two dozen states have enacted laws barring transgender women and girls from participating in certain sports competitions. Some policies have been blocked in court by those who say the policies are discriminatory, cruel and unnecessarily target a tiny niche of athletes.",
      "The Supreme Court earlier this month agreed to hear a case over whether states can prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
      "Also earlier this month, the Justice Department\u00a0filed a civil lawsuit against California's Department of Education and a nongovernmental sports organization alleging that they violated federal civil rights laws, including Title IX, by implementing policies that \"force girls to compete against boys\" in state athletic events.",
      "The NCAA changed its participation policy for transgender athletes to limit competition in women's sports to athletes assigned female at birth. That change came a day after Mr. Trump signed the executive order intended to ban transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports.",
      "Earlier this month, the University of Pennsylvania said it would ban transgender women from participating in its women's sports teams as part of an agreement to resolve Title IX violations.

      "\"And then it went. Just collapsed. For whatever reason, it collapsed. The fire escape collapsed,\" Forman told CBS News. \"They're falling. There's no doubt they're falling, and the fire escape coming down behind them. I realized two people had fallen to the ground.\"",

The amendment \u2014 and the bill itself \u2014 were advanced by the House Appropriations Committee in a hearing Tuesday.",
      "The renaming was authored by Republican Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho, who pointed to the first lady's role as honorary chair of the Kennedy Center board.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Todd Blanche, the second-highest ranking official at the Justice Department, said Tuesday that he plans to meet with Ghislaine Maxwell \"in the coming days\" about the case involving convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"Justice demands courage. For the first time, the Department of Justice is reaching out to Ghislaine Maxwell to ask: what do you know?\" Blanche wrote on social media. He added that he contacted Maxwell's lawyers at the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi. \"I intend to meet with her soon. No one is above the law \u2014 and no lead is off-limits,\" Blanche wrote.",
      "On Capitol Hill, a subcommittee of the House Oversight and Reform Committee approved a motion from GOP Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee that directs the committee's chairman to subpoena Maxwell to appear for a deposition, a signal of lawmakers' interest in speaking to Epstein's former partner.",
      "Blanche, who was President Trump's private defense attorney before joining the Justice Department, said that the department and the FBI continue to stand by a memo released earlier this month that concluded Epstein did not have a \"client list\" and confirmed that he died by suicide. The memo, which detailed the findings of a review of Epstein's case, also said there was no \"credible evidence\" that the disgraced financier blackmailed prominent people.",
      "The Justice Department and FBI also said they would not release any additional information about Epstein's case, and noted that the review did not uncover evidence that would prompt an investigation into uncharged third parties.",
      "\"President Trump has told us to release all credible evidence,\" Blanche said in a second statement shared by Bondi. \"If Ghislane Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say.\"",
      "The deputy attorney general said the Justice Department in prior administrations had not asked about her willingness to meet with the government, and he anticipates \"meeting with Ms. Maxwell in the coming days.\"",
      "David Oscar Markus, Maxwell's lawyer, said in a statement, \"I can confirm that we are in discussions with the government and that Ghislaine will always testify truthfully. We are grateful to President Trump for his commitment to uncovering the truth in this case.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that he did not know about Blanche's bid to speak with Maxwell but said it \"sounds appropriate to do.\"",
      "\"It's sort of a witch hunt,\" he said in the Oval Office. \"Just a continuation of the witch hunt.\"",
      "Maxwell was an associate of Epstein's and convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence. Her lawyers have asked the Supreme Court to take up an appeal of her conviction.",
      "Blanche's outreach to Maxwell's lawyers comes after the Justice Department asked a federal court in New York on Friday to unseal transcripts from grand jury proceedings involving Epstein. He was indicted in 2019 on one count of sex trafficking of minors and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors.",
      "Federal prosecutors alleged that Epstein sexually exploited and abused dozens of underage girls from 2002 through 2005, and worked with others who set up sexual encounters with victims at Epstein's residences in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "He died by suicide while in federal custody before his trial. Epstein had been arrested in Florida in 2006 and pleaded guilty to two state prostitution charges in 2008.",
      "In addition to asking the court to release the grand jury transcripts related to Epstein's indictment, the Justice Department also asked it to make public grand jury transcripts associated with Maxwell's case. U.S. District Judges Paul Engelmayer and Richard Berman, who are handling Maxwell and Epstein's cases, respectively, each\u00a0ordered the Justice Department to submit additional filings to the court about its request to unseal the grand jury records. The judges gave the defendants \u2014 in Epstein's case, his representative \u2014 and victims until Aug. 5 to lay out their positions on the proposed disclosure.",
      "Whether the transcripts become public will be up to the judges overseeing the cases, though the records will likely be heavily redacted to shield information related to victims. If the Justice Department's requests are granted by the court, the material is unlikely to be available immediately, and it could be weeks or months before it is unsealed.",
      "Federal rules typically require matters before a grand jury to be kept secret.",
      "The president and his administration have been dealing with backlash from Mr. Trump's allies that arose after the Justice Department released the memo about Epstein.",
      "Some top administration officials, such as Vice President JD Vance and FBI Director Kash Patel, suggested before Mr. Trump's reelection that Democrats were deliberately concealing information about Epstein and his purported list of clients. But now, with the Justice Department under Mr. Trump's control, some of his allies are skeptical of its claim that there is nothing left to disclose.",
      "Mr. Trump has tried to downplay the focus on Epstein and lashed out at some of his supporters, calling them \"weaklings\" who have been fooled by Democrats. He referred to claims about Epstein as the \"Jeffrey Epstein Hoax.\"",
      "Epstein and Mr. Trump moved in the same social circles in New York and Florida from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. They were friends for years, until they had a falling out around 2004. Mr. Trump has previously acknowledged he crossed paths with Epstein in Palm Beach, but said in 2019 following Epstein's arrest that they haven't spoken in 15 years.",
      "Last week, the president lashed out at a story in the Wall Street Journal that chronicled the pair's relationship, which the president has said ended before Epstein's first arrest in 2006. The Journal reported that Mr. Trump had signed a \"bawdy\" letter to Epstein in the early 2000s to mark his 50th birthday that said, in part, \"may every day be another wonderful secret.\" CBS News has not independently seen or verified the letter.",

      "The majority of the world's cocoa supply comes from Ghana and the Ivory Coast, which have faced heatwaves and heavy rain linked to climate change. These unfavorable weather conditions have led to diseases like Black pod rot, which kills cocoa crops. Chronic underinvestment in cocoa farms is another reason behind the spike in cocoa prices,\u00a0according to an article from J.P. Morgan Global Research.",
      "\"Cocoa is a market where the grower produces a very high-value good but receives a very low share of the actual value chain.

    "summary": "President Trump said he's \"thinking about\" eliminating capital gains tax on home sales. Here's what that would mean for the housing market.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday floated the possibility of eliminating the federal capital gains tax on home sales, in a move that would change the way real estate profits are taxed for the first time in 30 years.",
      "Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Mr. Trump suggested he is weighing supporting\u00a0legislation\u00a0introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia that would nix the existing capital gains tax on home sales. Greene called the tax \"an outdated, unfair burden\u2014especially in today's housing market, where values have skyrocketed.\"",
      "\"We're thinking about that,\" Mr. Trump responded to a reporter, when asked how important it is that the capital gains tax be eliminated in order to \"unleash\" the housing market. \"It would also unleash it just by lowering the interest rates,\" the president said, adding, \"If the fed would lower the rates we wouldn't even have to do that. But we are thinking about no tax on capital gains on houses.\"",
      "Currently, single-tax filers can exclude up to $250,000 in capital gains from sales of their primary homes from their taxable incomes under what's called the Section 121\u00a0exclusion. That amount rises to $500,000 for joint filers. Both amounts have remained fixed since 1997.",
      "Reached for comment by CBS MoneyWatch, the White House said it had nothing additional to add to Mr. Trump's comments.",
      "\"Homeowners who have lived in their homes for decades, especially seniors in places where values have surged, shouldn't be forced to stay put because of an IRS penalty,\" Greene said in a statement announcing the proposed No Tax on Home Sales Act. \"My bill unlocks that equity, helps fix the housing shortage, and supports long-term financial security for American families.\"",
      "According to Research from the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the current federal policy on the capital gains tax on home sales is \"quietly distorting the housing market\" by \"locking in older homeowners, and strangling inventory just when America needs it most.\"",
      "\"Stay-put penalty\"",
      "A NAR study found that 34% of homeowners, or 29 million Americans, would exceed the $250,000 threshold were they to sell their homes, while 10%, or eight million Americans, would surpass the $500,000 threshold for joint filers.",
      "As a result, older homeowners are disincentivized to sell their homes, in what NAR researchers refer to as a \"stay-put penalty.\" For example, seniors who might otherwise consider moving closer to family, or downsizing, are staying in place \u2014 and keeping housing inventory tied up.",
      "\"This stagnation in housing turnover is rippling through the entire market, driving up costs and limiting opportunity \u2014 exactly the opposite of what public policy should be encouraging,\" Shannon McGahn, NAR executive vice president and chief advocacy officer,\u00a0 said in a statement. \"And it grows worse each month.\"",
      "Critics say eliminating the tax would only benefit wealthy Americans who can afford to pay tax on gains from home sales that exceed the limit.",
      "Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, told CBS MoneyWatch that a lot of home sellers already benefit from the $250,000 exclusion limit, and that eliminating the capital gains tax altogether would primarily benefit wealthier Americans who own residences that have appreciated by more than $250,000, or $500,000 in the case of joint filers.",
      "\"It wouldn't really move the needle for a regular family, unless you have a home that's appreciated a lot,\" Berner told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If your home has appreciated by more than $1 million, there would be a benefit to removing the capital gains tax.\"",
      "Inventory release",
      "He also suspects abolishing the capital gains tax on home sales would release inventory onto the housing market.",
      "\"It could be a good thing for the market. In particular where inventory is constrained, it could benefit regular folks,\" Berner said.",
      "By contrast, eliminating the federal tax would also erase revenue paid to the government, and could spark increased interest from investors and speculators, which could also drive up home values. That would contribute to the nation's housing affordability problem, according to Berner.",
      "Nearly 27% of all homes sold in the first three months of the year were bought by investors \u2014 the highest share in at least five years, according to a report by real estate data provider BatchData.",

    "summary": "Investors are championing Kohl's, GoPro and other struggling companies as the \"meme stock\" frenzy returns.",
    "story": [
      "Kohl's shares soared Tuesday as investors piled in amid renewed exuberance for so-called meme stocks.",
      "The struggling department store's stock price jumped nearly 38%, or $3,92, to close at $14.34 a share. Like other beaten down stocks suddenly embraced by retail investors, Kohl's has benefited this month from buzz in online investor communities like WallStreetBets, the Reddit forum that in 2021 helped power the starting market gains\u00a0of companies like GameStop, BlackBerry and AMC Entertainment.",
      "Kohl's has faced tepid sales growth as it struggles to attract budget-conscious shoppers still hurting from elevated inflation. In May the retail chain, which has roughly 1,100 stores around the U.S.,\u00a0reported a fiscal first-quarter loss of $15 million and that net sales fell more than 4% from the year-ago period.",
      "Also that month, Kohl's\u00a0fired then-CEO Ashley Buchanan\u00a0after the company found that he had violated its conflict-of-interest policies by hiring a vendor with whom he had a personal relationship and failing to disclose it.",
      "Hockey-stick increases in a company's shares even as it loses money is typical of meme stocks, which can surge as retail investors in pursuit of a quick killing crowd into the stock \u2014 often at the expense of other investors who have shorted, or bet against, the company.",
      "Other companies that have rallied of late, largely driven by good vibes, include online real estate company Opendoor Technologies and mobile camera maker GoPro.",
      "Noted hedge fund manager Eric Jackson ignited the frenzy in Opendoor shares with a July 14\u00a0post on social media that touted what he described as the company's long-term upside for investors.",
      "\"If $OPEN goes to $12B in revenue in a few years (already the Bloomberg consensus estimate)\u2026 And if the market gives them a 5x EV/revenue multiple again (as it did at the 2021 peak)\u2026 That's a stock price of $82. 100x from here,\" he wrote.",
      "\"Giant red flags\"",
      "Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at market reserch firm S3 Partners, referred to companies like Kohl's as \"Battleground Stocks\" in which individual investors clash with short sellers betting against the companies.",
      "\"In this charged atmosphere, even a single dollar of uncommitted capital \u2014 dry powder waiting in the wings \u2014 can unleash a stampede, tipping the balance in a heartbeat and generating jaw-dropping price swings within a single session,\" he said in a research note. \"It's not just investing \u2014 it's a tactical war zone where sentiment and strategy collide.\"",
      "Some Wall Street analysts also think the latest surge in meme stocks could signal that equities, which have hit new highs in recent weeks, could be cresting.",
      "Adam Crisafulli, head of investment advisory firm Vital Knowledge, said in a report Tuesday that the spikes in stocks like Kohl's and Opendoor \"act like giant red flags\" for the market and that \"froth this extreme is never a good sign,\" while noting that corporate profits overall remain solid.",

      "A\u00a0heat dome is trapping over 90 million Americans in extreme temperatures this week with the\u00a0National Weather Service issuing heat alerts from Nebraska to Florida.",
      "Dangerous heat threatens to bake much of the Mississippi Valley and parts of the Southeast from Tuesday through at least Thursday, with temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit expected in some areas. Some places could see heat index values, or feels-like temperatures, of 110 to 115 degrees.",
      "While not expected to reach record highs, temperatures are still forecast to be about 10 to 15 degrees above average compared to what they typically are this time of year.",
      "Maps show July heat alerts and forecasts",
      "As the extreme heat hits parts of the Corn Belt, a region over part of the Plains and Central Mississippi Valley where heat index values could reach between 105 and 110 degrees, high humidity is also expected. The common phenomenon is known as corn sweat, which occurs when extreme heat beats down on corn crops and causes it to perspire and increase the humidity in the air.",
      "Although record highs aren't forecasted this week, overnight lows in the mid 70s to low 80s could possibly break record high minimums in states like Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, South Carolina and Tennessee, according to\u00a0Climate Central, a nonprofit that analyzes climate change data.",
      "High humidity coupled with extreme temperatures is dangerous because the combination significantly increases the likelihood of heat-related illnesses. Little to no overnight relief also poses a greater threat to health, NWS Prediction Center says.",
      "Heat waves increasingly intensified by climate change",
      "Climate change has made excessive heat in July at least three times more likely for nearly 160 million people in the U.S., nearly half the population, a Climate Central analysis found.",
      "Using its calculation of data and what is called a Climate Shift Index (CSI), the nonprofit said Monday that human-caused climate change made this extreme heat at least five times more likely for certain areas, from Salt Lake City and Santa Fe, New Mexico, to Tallahassee, Florida, and Montgomery, Alabama.",
      "The CSI uses real-time data to estimate how climate change has increased the likelihood of a particular daily temperature, according to Climate Central.",
      "Last month, another heat dome exposed nearly half of the country to dangerously high temperatures. On June 24, seven states tied or broke monthly high temperature records, many exceeding triple digits. One of those states, Maryland, reported that 472 people needed medical assistance for heat-related illnesses during that time when the heat index topped 110 degrees in some places.",
      "With such events becoming more common, Democratic lawmakers last week proposed legislation to classify extreme heat as a disaster, which would allow federal funding to flow into areas where hotter temperatures cause significant physical and economic distress.",

      "The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is recalling roughly 5 million above-ground pools linked to the deaths of nine children over the last two decades.",
      "The federal agency said in a recall\u00a0notice\u00a0that the pools, which were manufactured in China and sold by multiple U.S. vendors, have a compression strap along the outside that can allow children to gain access and drown. Children are able to enter the pool even when the ladder is removed, the CPSC said.",
      "The children who drowned were between 22 months and 3 years old, according to the agency. The deaths took place between 2007 and 2002 in California, Texas, Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin and Missouri. The CPSC said it's also aware of three separate instances when children gained access to the recalled pools using the compression strap.",
      "The pools, which are 48 inches high and taller, have been sold by outdoor recreation companies Bestway, Intex and Polygroup since 2002 at retail stores across the U.S., including Amazon.com, Lowe's, Target and Walmart, among others. Over 250,000 were also sold in Canada. They range in price from $400 to over $1,000, according to the CPSC.",
      "In a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, a spokesperson for Bestway, Intex and Polygroup said the three companies started working with the CPSC in 2023 to update the safety standard for above-ground pools. The updated standard, finalized in May 2025, \"aims to prevent unsupervised children from gaining a foothold on the products from compression straps that surround the outside of the pool legs,\" the companies' statement said.",
      "The recall, issued jointly by the CPSC and Bestway, Intex and Polygroup, was made to ensure that the new changes be applied to \"all above-ground pools sold since 2002 that are 48 inches or taller in height,\" according to the statement.",

The $2 billion bitcoin purchase is part of the company's \"bitcoin treasury plan,\" Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a news release on Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump, the largest investor in Trump Media, has increasingly focused on cryptocurrencies both through his private businesses and his administration. The company's $2 billion bitcoin purchase comes as Trump Media looks to roll out a range of investment products, including a plan to sell exchange-traded funds, or ETFs.",

      "What is a crypto treasury strategy?",
      "A crypto treasury strategy involves buying and holding cryptocurrencies, similar to how companies may invest in more traditional assets like bonds to provide them with financial flexibility.",

      "Gaza City\u00a0\u2014 The head of Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City said on Tuesday that 21 children had died across the Palestinian territory in the past three days \"due to malnutrition and starvation.\"",
      "\"These deaths were recorded at hospitals in Gaza, including Al-Shifa in Gaza City, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir el-Balah and Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis ... over the past 72 hours,\" Mohammed Abu Salmiya told reporters.",
      "United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned Monday evening that \"the last lifelines keeping people alive are collapsing\" in Gaza, and that there were growing reports of children and adults exhibiting symptoms of malnutrition.",
      "Abu Salmiya told reporters that new cases of malnutrition and starvation were arriving at Gaza's remaining functioning hospitals \"every moment,\" adding: \"We are heading towards alarming numbers of deaths due to the starvation inflicted on the people of Gaza.\"",
      "In a statement issued Tuesday, the U.N. human rights office said many people were arriving at Gaza's hospitals \"in a state of severe exhaustion caused by a lack of food. Others are collapsing in the streets. Many more may be dying unreported ... These deaths and the horrendous physical and psychological suffering caused by hunger are the result of Israel's interference with and militarization of humanitarian assistance.\"",
      "Photos emerging from Gaza in recent days have shown children and infants with severe malnutrition, including some said by hospital workers to have died of the condition. According to the National Institutes of Health, severe malnutrition typically causes symptoms including dramatic wasting, or fat and muscle loss, poor circulation and extreme fatigue.",
      "\"Hospitals are already overwhelmed by the number of casualties from gunfire. They can't provide much more help for hunger-related symptoms because of food and medicine shortages,\" Khalil al-Deqran, a spokesperson for the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, told the Reuters news agency. Deqran said there were 600,000 people suffering from malnutrition symptoms such as dehydration and anemia, including 60,000 pregnant women.",
      "After talks to extend a six-week ceasefire broke down, Israel imposed a full blockade on Gaza on March 2 this year, allowing no aid in until trucks were again permitted to cross the border in late May. The U.N. and aid organizations say the quantity of food and other emergency supplies being allowed into Gaza since then has been vastly insufficient, however.",
      "Food stocks accumulated inside the Palestinian territory during the ceasefire have depleted, leaving the territory's more than two million inhabitants experiencing the worst shortages since the start of the war sparked by the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Some 1,200 Israelis were killed and 251 others taken hostage during that siege more than 650 days ago, and 20 of the captives are still thought to be alive in Gaza.",
      "World Food Program director Carl Skau, who visited Gaza City in early July, called the situation \"the worst\" he had ever seen.",
      "Last Sunday, the civil defense agency in Hamas-run Gaza reported that at least three infants had died from \"severe hunger and malnutrition\" over the previous week.",
      "On Monday, the governments of 25 countries, including Israeli and U.S. allies Britain, France, Australia and Canada, urged an immediate end to the war, the unconditional release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, and the free flow of aid.",
      "In their joint statement, they accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's U.S.-backed government of the \"drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children\" in Gaza.",
      "The nations also condemned a new system for aid distribution backed by Israel's military that was launched in late May with the support of the Trump administration, but no support from other nations or humanitarian organizations.",
      "The U.N.'s human rights office said Tuesday that Israeli forces have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians trying to get food aid in Gaza since the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation started operations on May 26.",
      "Officially a private effort, the GHF began working in Gaza \u2014 with virtually no information provided about its funding or management \u2014 after Israel imposed the more than two-month blockade on all supplies entering Gaza.",
      "The group's operations, focused around four \"humanitarian hubs\" for food distribution, have been marred by chaotic scenes and near-daily reports of Israeli forces firing on people waiting to collect rations in the Palestinian territory, where the Israeli military is seeking to destroy Hamas.",
      "\"As of July 21, we have recorded 1,054 people killed in Gaza while trying to get food; 766 of them were killed in the vicinity of GHF sites and 288 near U.N. and other humanitarian organizations' aid convoys,\" U.N. human rights office spokesman Thameen Al-Kheetan told the AFP news agency. He said the agency's data was \"based on information from multiple reliable sources on the ground, including medical teams, humanitarian and human rights organizations.\"",
      "GHF says it has distributed more than 1.4 million boxes of foodstuffs to date and that it adjusts its \"operations in real time to keep people safe and informed, and we stand ready to partner with other organizations to scale up and deliver more meals to the people of Gaza.\"",
      "The U.N. and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the GHF over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives and violates basic humanitarian principles. The group has never commented, despite numerous questions from CBS News, on any links it has with the U.S. or Israeli governments.",
      "The Trump administration announced its first public support for the GHF \u2014 $30 million in funding \u2014 earlier this month, and called on other organizations and countries to cooperate with the group, saying that, in its view, it provides the only  means of delivering aid in Gaza without the risk of Hamas stealing it.",

    "story": [
      "Ozzy Osbourne, the heavy metal legend who rose to fame in the pioneering group Black Sabbath, has died, his family said in a statement to CBS News. He was 76.",
      "\"It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning,\" the family said in the statement. \"He was with his family and surrounded by love. We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.\"",
      "The family's statement didn't provide additional details about the circumstances surrounding Osbourne's death.",
      "Osbourne revealed in 2020 that he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, the movement disorder affecting the nervous system that gets worse over time. A year earlier, the rock star postponed all of his 2019 performances after falling at his home in Los Angeles, which aggravated injuries from a 2003 all-terrain vehicle accident. He announced in 2023 that he would retire from touring.",
      "\"Ozzy was someone who lived hard, rocked hard and retired over and over again, starting, I think, first in the '90s,\" Joe Levy, a contributor for Rolling Stone magazine, told CBS News on Tuesday following news of Osbourne's death. \"He retired at least two times, kept coming back, and the fact that his Parkinson's diagnosis kept him from performing made it all the more amazing that just two weeks ago, he took the stage for what absolutely would be the final time.\"",
      "Either clad in black or bare-chested, the singer was often the target of parents' groups for his imagery and once caused an uproar for biting the head off a bat. Later, he would reveal himself to be a doddering and sweet father on the reality TV show \"The Osbournes.\"",
      "The Big Bang of heavy metal",
      "Black Sabbath's 1969 self-titled debut LP has been likened to the Big Bang of heavy metal. It came during the height of the Vietnam War and crashed the hippie party, dripping menace and foreboding. The cover of the record was of a spooky figure against a stark landscape. The music was loud, dense and angry, and marked a shift in rock 'n' roll.",
      "The band's second album, \"Paranoid,\" included such classic metal tunes as \"War Pigs,\" \"Iron Man\" and \"Fairies Wear Boots.\" The song \"Paranoid\" only reached No. 61 on the Billboard Hot 100 but became in many ways the band's signature song. Both albums were voted among the top 10 greatest heavy metal albums of all time by readers of Rolling Stone magazine.",
      "\"Black Sabbath are the Beatles of heavy metal. Anybody who's serious about metal will tell you it all comes down to Sabbath,\" Dave Navarro of the band Jane's Addiction wrote in a 2010 tribute in Rolling Stone. \"There's a direct line you can draw back from today's metal, through Eighties bands like Iron Maiden, back to Sabbath.\"",
      "Sabbath fired Osbourne in 1979 for his legendary excesses, like showing up late for rehearsals and missing gigs. \"We knew we didn't really have a choice but to sack him because he was just so out of control. But we were all very down about the situation,\" wrote bassist Terry \"Geezer\" Butler in his memoir, \"Into the Void.\"",
      "Osbourne reemerged the next year as a solo artist with \"Blizzard of Ozz\" and the following year's \"Diary of a Madman,\" both hard rock classics that went multi-platinum and spawned enduring favorites such as \"Crazy Train,\" \"Goodbye to Romance,\" \"Flying High Again\" and \"You Can't Kill Rock and Roll.\" Osbourne was twice inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame \u2014 once with Sabbath in 2006 and again in 2024 as a solo artist.",
      "The original Sabbath lineup reunited for the first time in 20 years in July 2025 in the U.K. for what Osborne said would be his final concert. \"Let the madness begin!\" he told 42,000 fans.",
      "Metallica, Guns N Roses, Slayer, Tool, Pantera, Gojira, Alice in Chains, Lamb of God, Halestorm, Anthrax, Rival Sons and Mastodon did sets. Tom Morello, Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, Billy Corgan, Ronnie Wood, Travis Barker, Sammy Hagar, Andrew Watt, Yungblud, Korn's Jonathan Davis, Nuno Bettencourt, Chad Smith and Vernon Reid made appearances. Actor Jason Momoa was the host for the festivities.",
      "\"Black Sabbath: we'd all be different people without them, that's the truth,\" said Pantera singer Phil Anselmo. \"I know I wouldn't be up here with a microphone in my hand without Black Sabbath.\"",
      "Outlandish exploits and a classic look",
      "Osbourne embodied the excesses of metal. His outlandish exploits included relieving himself on the Alamo, snorting a line of ants off a sidewalk and, most memorably, biting the head off a live bat that a fan threw onstage during a 1981 concert. (He said he thought it was rubber.)",
      "In a statement posted to its Facebook page Tuesday, the Alamo said it was \"saddened to hear\" of Osbourne's death.",
      "\"His relationship with the Alamo was marked initially by a deeply disrespectful incident in 1982,\" the statement reads. \"This act profoundly and rightfully upset many who hold this site sacred. However, redemption and reconciliation eventually became part of his history as well. In 1992, Ozzy personally apologized to then-Mayor Nelson Wolff and expressed genuine remorse for his actions. Decades later, in 2015, he revisited the Alamo grounds to learn and appreciate the site's profound history, openly demonstrating humility and understanding.\"",
      "Osbourne was sued in 1987 by parents of a 19-year-old teen who died by suicide while listening to his song \"Suicide Solution.\" The lawsuit was dismissed. Osbourne said the song was really about the dangers of alcohol, which caused the death of his friend Bon Scott, lead singer of AC/DC.",
      "Then-Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York claimed in 1990 that Osbourne's songs led to demonic possession and even suicide. \"You are ignorant about the true meaning of my songs,\" the singer wrote back. \"You have also insulted the intelligence of rock fans all over the world.\"",
      "Audiences at Osbourne shows could be mooned or spit on by the singer. They would often be hectored to scream along with the song, but the Satan-invoking Osbourne would usually send the crowds home with their ears ringing and a hearty \"God bless!\"",
      "He started an annual tour \u2014 Ozzfest \u2014   in 1996 after he was rejected from the lineup of what was then the top touring music festival, Lollapalooza. Ozzfest has gone on to host such bands as Slipknot, Tool, Megadeth, Rob Zombie, System of a Down, Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park.",
      "Osbourne's look changed little over his life. He wore his long hair flat, heavy black eye makeup and round glasses, often wearing a cross around his neck. In 2013, he reunited with Black Sabbath for the dour, raw \"13,\" which reached No. 1 on the U.K. Albums Chart and peaked at No. 86 on the U.S. Billboard 200. In 2019, he had a Top 10 hit when featured on Post Malone's \"Take What You Want,\" Osbourne's first song in the Top 10 since 1989.",
      "In 2020, he released the album \"Ordinary Man,\" which had as its title song a duet with Elton John. \"I've been a bad guy, been higher than the blue sky/And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man,\" he sang. In 2022, he landed his first career back-to-back No. 1 rock radio singles from his album \"Patient Number 9,\" which featured collaborations with Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Mike McCready, Chad Smith, Robert Trujillo and Duff McKagan. It earned four Grammy nominations.",
      "At the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2024, Jack Black called him \"greatest frontman in the history of rock and roll\" and \"the Jack Nicholson of rock.\" Osbourne thanked his fans, his guitarist Randy Rhoads and his longtime wife, Sharon.",
      "The beginnings of Black Sabbath",
      "John Michael Osbourne was raised in the gritty city of Birmingham, England. Kids in school nicknamed him Ozzy, short for his surname. As a boy, he loved the Four Seasons, Chuck Berry and Little Richard. The Beatles made a huge impression.",
      "\"They came from Liverpool, which was approximately 60 miles north of where I come from,\" he told Billboard. \"So all of a sudden it was in my grasp, but I never thought it would be as successful as it became.\"",
      "In the late 1960s, Osbourne had teamed up with Butler, guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward as the Polka Tulk Blues Band. They decided to rename the band Earth, but found to their dismay there was another band with that name. So they changed the name to the American title of the classic Italian horror movie \"I Tre Volti Della Paura,\" starring Boris Karloff: Black Sabbath.",
      "Once they found their sludgy, ominous groove, the band was productive, putting out their self-titled debut and \"Paranoid\" in 1970, \"Master of Reality\" in 1971, \"Vol. 4\" in 1972 and \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" in 1973.",
      "The music was all about industrial guitar riffs and disorienting changes in time signatures, along with lyrics that spoke of alienation and doom. \"People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time,\" Osbourne sang in one song. \"All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy/Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify.\"",
      "The Guardian newspaper in 2009 said the band \"introduced working-class anger, stoner sludge grooves and witchy horror-rock to flower power. Black Sabbath confronted the empty platitudes of the 1960s and, along with Altamont and Charles Manson, almost certainly helped kill off the hippy counterculture.\"",
      "After Sabbath, Osbourne had an uncanny knack for calling some of the most creative young guitarists to his side. When he went solo, he hired the brilliant innovator Rhoads, who played on two of Osbourne's finest solo albums, \"Blizzard of Ozz\" and \"Diary of a Madman.\" Rhoads was killed in a freak plane accident in 1982; Osbourne released the live album \"Tribute\" in 1987 in his memory.",
      "Osbourne then signed Jake E. Lee, who lent his talents to the platinum albums \"Bark at the Moon\" and \"The Ultimate Sin.\" Hotshot Zakk Wylde joined Osbourne's band for \"No Rest for the Wicked\" and the multiplatinum \"No More Tears.\"",
      "\"They come along, they sprout wings, they blossom, and they fly off,\" Osbourne said of his players in 1995 to The Associated Press. \"But I have to move on. To get a new player now and again boosts me on.\"",
      "Music world reacts to Osbourne's death",
      "Several musicians and celebrities, including Osbourne's Black Sabbath bandmates, took to social media to respond Tuesday to the news of his death.",
      "\"I just can't believe it! My dear dear friend Ozzy has passed away only weeks after our show at Villa Park,\" Black Sabbath guitarist and band co-founder Tony Iommi\u00a0wrote on X, referring to the farewell show earlier this month. \"It's just such heartbreaking news that I can't really find the words, there won't ever be another like him. Geezer, Bill and myself have lost our brother. My thoughts go out to Sharon and all the Osbourne family. Rest in peace Oz.\"",
      "Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler wrote on X: \"Goodbye dear friend - thanks for all those years - we had some great fun. 4 kids from Aston- who'd have thought, eh? So glad we got to do it one last time, back in Aston. Love you.\"",
      "On Instagram, Elton John described Osbourne as a \"dear friend and a huge trailblazer who secured his place in the pantheon of rock gods \u2014 a true legend. He was also one of the funniest people I've ever met. I will miss him dearly. To Sharon and the family, I send my condolences and love.\"",
      "Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, who took part in Osbourne's farewell concert, wrote on X that he was \"so very sad to hear of the death of Ozzy Osbourne. What a lovely goodbye concert he had at Back To The Beginning in Birmingham.\"",
      "Kiss co-founder Gene Simmons called Osbourne a \"giant\" who was \"Admired and loved by millions of fans worldwide. Prayers and condolences go out to the Osborne family.\"",
      "Actor Jason Momoa, who hosted the farewell show, wrote on Instagram, \"Love you @ozzyosbourne All my aloha @sharonosbourne and ohana. So grateful. RIP.\"",
      "Mike McCready, lead guitarist and founding member of Pearl Jam, wrote on X that he discovered Black Sabbath's music in high school.",
      "\"'War Pigs' was terrifying and mesmerizing at the same time,\" McCready wrote. \"It was Ozzy's voice that took me away to a dark universe. A great escape. Then when The 'Blizzard of Ozz' record came out I was instantly a fan. Randy Rhoads was an influence on me to play lead guitar. Luckily I got to play on the song 'Immortal' on the last record. Thanks for the music, Ozzy it makes our journey in life better.\"",
      "Courting controversy \u2014 and wholesomeness",
      "Whomever he was playing with, Osbourne wasn't likely to back down from controversy. He had the last laugh when the TV evangelist the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart in 1986 lambasted various rock groups and rock magazines as \"the new pornography,\" prompting some retailers to pull Osbourne's album.",
      "When Swaggart later was caught with a sex worker in 1988, Osbourne put out the song \"Miracle Man\" about his foe: \"Miracle man got busted/miracle man got busted,\" he sang. \"Today I saw a Miracle Man, on TV cryin'/Such a hypocritical man, born again, dying.\"",
      "Much later, a whole new Osbourne would be revealed when \"The Osbournes,\" which ran on MTV from 2002-2005, showed this one-time self-proclaimed madman drinking Diet Cokes as he struggled to find the History Channel on his new satellite television or warning his kids not to smoke or drink before they embarked on a night on the town.",
      "Later, he and his son Jack toured America on the travel show \"Ozzy & Jack's World Detour,\" where the pair visited such places as Mount Rushmore and the Space Center Houston. Osbourne was honored in 2014 with the naming of a bat frog found in the Amazon that makes high-pitched, batlike calls. It was dubbed Dendropsophus ozzyi.",
      "He also met Queen Elizabeth II during her Golden Jubilee weekend. He was standing next to singer-actor Cliff Richard. \"She took one look at the two of us, said 'Oh, so this is what they call variety, is it?' then cracked up laughing. I honestly thought that Sharon had slipped some acid into my cornflakes that morning,\" he wrote in \"I Am Ozzy.\"",
      "Thelma Riley and Osbourne married in 1971; Osbourne adopted her son Elliot Kingsley, and they had two more children, Jessica and Louis. Osbourne later met Sharon, who became her own celebrity persona, when she was running her father's Los Angeles office. Her father was Don Arden, a top concert promoter and artist manager. She went to Osbourne's hotel in Los Angeles to collect money, which Osbourne had spent on drugs.",
      "\"She says she'll come back in three days and I'd better have it. I'd always fancied her and I thought, 'Ah, she's coming back! Maybe I have a chance.' I had pizza hanging from my hair, cigarette ashes on my shirt,\" he told the Los Angeles Times in 2000. They married in 1982, had three children \u2014 Kelly, Aimee and Jack \u2014 and endured periodic separations and reconciliations.",
      "He is survived by Sharon, and his children.",

    "story": [
      "Special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff is scheduled to travel to Europe this week for meetings on a wide range of issues, including the Israel-Hamas conflict, and will continue pushing for a ceasefire and peace deal, according to a U.S. official.",
      "In a briefing with reporters Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce suggested Witkoff could soon go to the Middle East, but declined to provide details about his itinerary.",
      "\"When it comes to the specific location of the envoy, I do not have that,\" Bruce said.",
      "Indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas are ongoing, according to an Israeli official, and the Israeli government expects to soon receive Hamas' response to an offer made last week.",
      "So far, there have been no breakthroughs as they attempt to broker a 60-day ceasefire, initially proposed by the U.S., in the 21-month war. Doha, Qatar, hosted indirect talks between the two parties earlier this month.",
      "Witkoff, according to two diplomatic sources, was expected to travel to the Middle East if negotiations progressed and a deal could potentially be closed. He met last week with Qatari officials at the White House just before President Trump hosted the Qatari prime minister for a dinner that stretched late into the night. It took place as diplomatic efforts were reaching a critical moment in the pursuit of a deal to release the 20 living Israeli hostages, free some Palestinian detainees, allow the entry of much needed food and aid to civilians in Gaza, and bring about a cessation of violence and repositioning of Israeli Defense Forces.",
      "A U.S. official and a regional source familiar with the diplomacy told CBS News that Israel last week proposed a new map with new locations where the IDF would potentially withdraw within Gaza. The demarcation of these proposed withdrawal zones has been a sticking point in the ongoing diplomatic efforts to broker a deal acceptable to both Hamas and the Netanyahu government. The international mediators \u2014 Qatar, Egypt and the U.S. \u2014 planned to transit the Israeli proposal to Hamas for consideration.",
      "The two sources indicated that the Trump administration is cautiously optimistic about the possibility of an impending break in the Gaza negotiations that could lead to a 60-day ceasefire and hostage release.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Washington in early July to discuss the deal with the Trump administration but a sticking point emerged over the deployment of Israeli troops during the truce. Israel wants to keep forces in what it says is an important land corridor in southern Gaza, but Hamas views the presence of Israeli troops on that strip of land as an indication that Israel intends to continue the war once a temporary ceasefire expires.",
      "The Knesset goes into a three-month summer recess next week, on July 27, which would give Netanyahu more political flexibility in ceasefire negotiations.",
      "In the meantime, Israel has continued to carry out military operations in Gaza, and on Sunday, it issued new evacuation orders to include an area that has been somewhat less hard hit than others, indicating a new battleground may be opening up and squeezing Palestinians further south.",
      "In a social media post published Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces warned Palestinians that it was operating \"with great force to destroy the enemy's capabilities and terrorist infrastructure\" in the central city of Deir al-Balah, \"as it expands its activities in this region to operate in an area it has not operated in before.\"",

      "U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Willis R. Hall was assigned to Lima Site 85, a tactical air navigation radio site on a remote mountain peak in Laos, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in a news release. There were 18 other men assigned to the site. On March 11, 1968, the location was attacked by Vietnamese commandos, marking the start of a major offensive by communist Vietnamese forces in Laos, which was a neutral country at that time, according to newspaper clippings shared by the DPAA.",
      "The unit had to evacuate to a narrow ledge of the 5,600-foot mountain. A few hours later, an A-1 Skyraider aircraft was able to provide cover for a rescue operation. U.S. helicopters managed to rescue eight of the men and travel to a base in Thailand. One of the rescued men died while en route to the base, according to a newspaper clipping.",
      "Hall and 10 other American soldiers were killed, and their bodies were unable to be recovered, officials said. Hall, a native of Broward County, Florida,   was 40 years old at the time of his death and was survived by his wife Mary, according to newspaper clippings.

A 2005 newspaper clipping said that to find the remains, U.S. investigators spoke to Vietnamese commandos who had been involved in the attack. The commandos showed the investigators where they had thrown the bodies of the dead servicemembers off the mountain. Investigators threw dummies from those sites, and used a video camera mounted on a helicopter to see where they landed.",
      "In 2023, DPAA personnel and partner organization members discovered unexploded ordnance, incident-related materials and possible material evidence and bones near another site on the mountain. Those remains were found to be those of a second technician who died during the attack.",

    "story": [
      "The initial results of an investigation into December's devastating Jeju Air crash in South Korea showed that, while the plane's both engines sustained bird strikes, its pilots turned off the less-damaged one just before its crash-landing. The finding, which implied human errors, drew quick, vehement protests from bereaved families and fellow pilots who accuse authorities of trying to shift responsibility for the disaster to the dead pilots.",
      "South Korea's Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board initially planned to publicize the results of an investigation of the plane's engines on Saturday. But it was forced to cancel its press briefing in the face of strong protests by relatives of crash victims who were informed of the findings earlier in the day, according to government officials and bereaved families.",
      "\"If they want to say their investigation was done in a reliable, independent manner, they should have come up with evidence that backs up their explanation,\" said Kim Yu-jin, head of an association of bereaved families. \"None of us resent the pilots.\"",
      "The Boeing 737-800 operated by Jeju Air landed on its belly without its land gear deployed at South Korea's southern Muan International Airport on Dec. 29. It overshoot a runaway, slammed into a concrete structure and burst into flames. It was the deadliest disaster in South Korea's aviation history in decades, killing all but two of the 181 people on board.",
      "According to a copy of an unpublished briefing report obtained by The Associated Press, a South Korean-led multilateral investigation team said it found no defects in the plane's engines built by France's Safran and GE.",
      "The report said thorough examinations of the engines found the plane's right engine suffered more serious internal damage following bird strikes as it was engulfed with big fires and black smoke. But the pilots switched off the plane's left engine, the report said citing probes on the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder and the engines examinations.",
      "Officials earlier said the black boxes of the Boeing jetliner stopped recording about four minutes before the accident, complicating investigations into the cause of the disaster. The cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder cited in the briefing report refers to data stored before the recording stopped.",

      "Bereaved families and pilots at Jeju Air and other airlines lambasted the investigation findings, saying authorities must disclose the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder.",
      "\"We, the 6,500 pilots at civilian airlines, can't contain our seething anger against the preposterous argument by the Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board that lost neutrality,\" the Korean Pilot Unions Alliance said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Unionized pilots at Jeju Air also issued a statement urging authorities to present scientific evidence to show the plane should have landed normally if it flew with the less-damaged engine.",
      "The latest report focused only on engine issues and didn't mention other factors that could also be blamed for the crash. Among them is the concrete structure the plane crashed into. It housed a set of antennas called localizers designed to guide aircraft safely during landings, and many analysts say it should have been made with more easily breakable materials. Some pilots say they suspect the government wouldn't want to mainly and prominently blame the localizers or bird strikes for mass deaths as the Muan airport is under direct management of the Transport Ministry.",
      "The Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board and the Transport Ministry have offered no public response to the criticism. They said they also won't publicly discuss the engine investigations to respect demands by bereaved families.",
      "A person familiar with the investigation told the AP that authorities are looking at the localizers and other issues like whether air traffic controllers relayed the danger of bird strikes to the pilots swiftly enough and what emergency training Jeju Air offered to pilots. The person, who requested anonymity citing the sensitive nature of the investigation, said authorities earlier planned to publicize the results of probes after reviewing various issues, but changed the plan and tried to release the outcome of engine investigations at the request of bereaved families. He said authorities don't intend to lay the responsibility for the disaster to the pilots.",
      "Authorities aim to publish the investigation's final results by next June, the person said.",
      "But Kwon Bo Hun, dean of Aeronautics College at the Far East University in South Korea, called the government's planned announcement \"clumsy\" because it didn't disclose evidence that supported its finding on the pilots. He said it only irritated \"emotional parts of us that the investigation puts the whole blame on dead people.\"",
      "A former Transport Ministry-turned-university professor reached by the AP said the engine investigation report must be \"reliable\" as it's based on an analysis of cockpit voice and flight data recorders that \"don't lie.\" He spoke on condition of anonymity citing the delicate nature of the issue.",

The newspaper cited a State Department document it has obtained, adding that it shows Beijing officials seized the man's passport, credit card, cellphone and iPad while he was in the city of Chengdu on April 14.",
      "The Times said, citing the document, that the man's documents were returned on April 22, but that he was told he could not leave the country.",
      "At a news conference on Monday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson declined to comment on the case of the Department of Commerce employee beyond saying that Beijing \"upholds the rule of law and handles entry and exit affairs in accordance with the law.\"",
      "But Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiaku did confirm that Wells Fargo banker Mao Chenyue has been restricted from leaving China and is facing criminal charges.",
      "\"Ms. Mao Chenyue is involved in a criminal case currently being handled by Chinese law-enforcement authorities and is subjected to exit restrictions in accordance with the law. Pursuant to Chinese laws, with the case still under investigation, Ms. Mao cannot leave the country for the time being and has an obligation to cooperate with the investigation,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiaku said Monday.",
      "Chenyue is a Managing Director at Wells Fargo and is based in Atlanta, according to her Linkedin profile, which says she is bilingual in English and Chinese. A source close to Chenyue confirmed to CBS News that she is a U.S. citizen. She leads Wells Fargo's international factoring business and was born in Shanghai, according to a June press release on the website of the non profit FCI, a global network of companies that provides factoring services.",
      "A Wells Fargo representative told CBS News in a statement on Monday that the company was \"closely tracking this situation and working through the appropriate channels so our employee can return to the United States as soon as possible.\"",
      "A U.S. State Department spokesperson declined to comment Monday on Chenyue's status, \"due to privacy and other considerations,\" but said the State Department \"has no higher priority than the safety and security of American citizens.\"",
      "On its website, the State Department urges Americans travelling in China to \"exercise increased caution,\" warning that China \"arbitrarily enforces local laws, including exit bans on U.S. citizens and citizens of other countries, without fair and transparent process under the law.\"",
      "U.S. citizens may only realize they have been subjected to an exit ban when they attempt to leave China, and there may be no available legal recourse to appeal such a ban via a Chinese court, according to the State Department's travel advisory.",
      "The Chinese government also does not recognize dual nationality, meaning \"U.S. citizens of Chinese descent may be subject to additional scrutiny and harassment,\" the guidance on the State Department's website says.",
      "The latest incidents come at a sensitive time in relations between Beijing and Washington. In late June, the White House and officials in Beijing said the two sides had\u00a0agreed on the framework of a new deal\u00a0to end a trade war between the world's two largest economies.",
      "As it stands, China faces an August 12 deadline \u2014 imposed by President Trump \u2014 to strike a new trade deal with the U.S. to end an escalating tit-for-tat trade tariff war that the countries have engaged in since Mr. Trump returned to the White House in January.",
      "Mr. Trump imposed tariffs of up to 145% on imports from China, and Beijing responded with its own steep import duties, but the two sides agreed to a truce to allow for negotiations. In the meantime, the Trump administration has imposed 30% tariffs on imports from China, pending the August 12 deadline, when much higher rates will be imposed by both Washington and Beijing if no agreement is reached.",
      "The standoff has increased the risks for American companies doing business in China that had already been mounting for several years.",
      "In June 2023, after Chinese authorities\u00a0raided the offices\u00a0of several U.S.-based firms, Beijing-based business lawyer James Zimmerman\u00a0told CBS News\u00a0it seemed everything was being taken by the Communist Party as a potential threat.",

    "story": [
      "Explorers on a quest to study a famed wartime shipwreck site have discovered new artifacts from one lost American destroyer. The USS DeHaven, which was sunk during an attack off the Solomon Islands in World War II, still has torpedoes and a bell that are largely intact, according to the Ocean Exploration Trust, a nonprofit that recently surveyed and filmed the wreckage with remotely operated vehicles.",
      "The DeHaven went down in February 1943, after operating out of Guadalcanal throughout the U.S. military campaign there, according to the Destroyer History Foundation. The ship was bombed multiple times and eventually sank, with 167 crew members on board, near Iron Bottom Sound, a section of the ocean near the Solomon Islands known for its WWII-era shipwrecks.",
      "The Ocean Exploration Trust set out to learn more about the maritime history of Guadalcanal and Iron Bottom Sound \u2014 the site of\u00a0five pivotal naval battles\u00a0between August and December 1942. The team used a sonar device to locate wreckage from the surface of the sea before dispatching a pair of remotely operated vehicles down to the seabed.",
      "Those ROVs were able to capture high-resolution footage of what remains of the DeHaven, more than 80 years after it plunged to the ocean floor. Video of the expedition has now been published online.",
      "During their mission, explorers identified a number of relics among the wreckage of the DeHaven, including propellers, artillery and torpedo mounts, and multiple torpedo warheads, the organization said. They also spotted the ship's bell with help from viewers watching a livestream of the deep-sea initiative, which the organization called \"a very unique sighting.\"",
      "Team leaders said the data gathered from the project can provide important frameworks for historians, as well as resource managers of heritage areas \"to understand this site's history and future.\" The Ocean Exploration Trust partnered with NOAA Ocean Exploration, the U.S. Naval History and Heritage Command, the Solomon Islands Government and a number of archaeological centers at universities around the world to help carry out the expedition.",
      "The Ocean Exploration Trust has explored the wreckage of World War II warships in the Solomon Islands before. Its teams recently discovered a famed Japanese destroyer sunk by U.S. torpedoes as well as the severed bow\u00a0of another well-known American warship called the USS New Orleans, which also sank in the Iron Bottom Sound.",

    "story": [
      "Twenty-five nations, including Britain, Canada and Japan, issued a joint statement on Monday with \"a simple, urgent message: the war in Gaza must end now.\"",
      "The statement by the U.S. allies and partners across the globe and published online by the U.K. government condemns Israel's tightly-controlled aid distribution method, accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's U.S.-backed government of the \"drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children.\"",
      "\"It is horrifying that over 800 Palestinians have been killed while seeking aid,\" said the statement, which was published after one of the deadliest days for aid seekers during the 21-month war in Gaza. Health officials in the Hamas-run enclave said more than 80 people were killed trying to access emergency food supplies on Sunday alone.",
      "In addition to the U.K., the nations that signed the joint statement were Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.",
      "\"The suffering of civilians in Gaza has reached new depths. The Israeli government's aid delivery model is dangerous, fuels instability and deprives Gazans of human dignity,\" the statement says. \"The Israeli Government's denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable. Israel must comply with its obligations under international humanitarian law.\"",
      "The war in Gaza was sparked by the Hamas-orchestrated terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, during which some 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken as hostages. Most of those captives have since been released, but Netanyahu said earlier this month that 50 remain in Gaza, including 20 he said were still alive.",
      "\"The hostages cruelly held captive by Hamas since 7 October 2023 continue to suffer terribly,\" the 25 nations said in the statement. \"We condemn their continued detention and call for their immediate and unconditional release. A negotiated ceasefire offers the best hope of bringing them home and ending the agony of their families.\"",
      "Israel does not allow foreign journalists into Gaza to report on the war, making it impossible to independently verify figures provided by the Palestinian enclave's Hamas-run health ministry and other agencies. The Israeli government rejects these numbers as falsely inflated, but the United Nations says the ministry's figure of more than 59,000 people being killed in total since the war started is the most credible information available.",
      "In a statement shared on social media, Foreign Ministry spokesman Oren Marmorstein said Israel rejected the joint international statement, \"as is disconnected from reality and sends the wrong message to Hamas.\"",
      "CBS News' own team inside Gaza has spoken with medical workers and family members of aid seekers who say Israeli forces have routinely opened fire on people near food distribution sites since at least the end of May, when a new, controversial, U.S.- and Israeli-backed organization started operating a handful of \"humanitarian hubs\" in the enclave.",
      "The deaths reported on Sunday, near a convoy of aid trucks operated by the U.N.'s World Food Program, were not linked to the U.S.-based Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which is run by an evangelical preacher who worked previously as an adviser to President Trump. But Palestinian authorities say most of the aid seekers killed by Israeli forces over the last month and a half were trying to access GHF hubs.",
      "GHF director Rev. Johnnie Moore told CBS News earlier this month that while he didn't \"want to diminish these reports\" about killings near GHF hubs, \"we can't control what happens outside our distribution sites.\"",
      "He repeated his previous calls \u2014 which have been echoed by the White House \u2014 for the United Nations and its humanitarian agencies to join the GHF's efforts to feed people in Gaza.",
      "None of the established humanitarian agencies that have worked for decades in Gaza have agreed to work with the GHF, saying it forces already-displaced Palestinians to trek for miles to reach its hubs and that it violates basic humanitarian principles.",
      "The Trump administration announced its first public support for the GHF in early July: $30 million in funding.",
      "In a statement on Monday, COGAT, the Israeli military agency in charge of affairs in the Palestinian territories, said: \"Israel acts in accordance with international law and is leading efforts to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza in coordination with the international organizations.\"",
      "Israel has blamed Hamas for all deaths in Gaza since the war began, accusing it of using civilians as human shields and of seizing aid materials for its own use, both of which the group \u2014 long designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., Israel and the European Union \u2014 denies doing.",
      "Pope Leo XIV also renewed his call over the weekend for \"an immediate end to the barbarity of this war and for a peaceful resolution to the conflict\" in Gaza.",
      "Netanyahu has said repeatedly that the war will continue until Hamas is rendered impotent militarily and politically, and all the hostages are returned.",
      "The international outcry and mounting demands for an immediate ceasefire come at a time when there's little to suggest any imminent breakthrough in ongoing negotiations for a truce. They come instead as Israel says it is again expanding its ground war in Gaza, forcing thousands of Palestinians to once again flee for safety.",
      "Israel warns of new ground operation in central Gaza",
      "On Sunday, Israel widened its evacuation orders for Gaza to include an area that has been somewhat less hard-hit than others, indicating a new battleground may be opening up and squeezing Palestinians into ever tinier areas.",
      "In an Arabic language social media post published Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces warned that it was operating \"with great force to destroy the enemy's capabilities and terrorist infrastructure\" in the central city of Deir al-Balah, \"as it expands its activities in this region to operate in an area it has not operated in before.\"",
      "\"For your safety, evacuate the area immediately and move south,\" the IDF said.",
      "The U.N.'s humanitarian agency OCHA estimated that between 50,000 and 80,000 people were in the area under the new evacuation order, and families were seen carrying what few items they could on donkey carts, bicycles and even dragging sleds behind them as they headed south.",
      "Deir el-Balah resident Abdullah Abu Saleem, 48, told the French news agency AFP that \"during the night, we heard huge and powerful explosions shaking the area as if it were an earthquake,\" which he attributed to \"artillery shelling in the south-central part of Deir el-Balah and the southeastern area.\"",
      "\"We are extremely worried and fearful that the army is planning a ground operation in Deir el-Balah, and the central camps where hundreds of thousands of displaced people are sheltering,\" he told AFP.",
      "The Israeli military did not provide immediate comment on the operations, but the GLZ Radio network, which is funded by the Israeli government and affiliated directly with the IDF, reported Monday that soldiers had, \"for the first time since the start of the war,\" entered Deir al-Balah on the ground.",
      "GLZ said a single combat brigade, \"including engineering and armor forces, have recently entered a maneuver in the southern Deir al-Balah area in the central camps in the Gaza Strip. The attacks were preceded by air and artillery strikes during the night and morning, and in the afternoon the forces went into action.\"",
      "The announced expansion of ground operations drew a quick statement of concern from the group that represents the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza \u2013 the precise whereabouts of whom remain unknown.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director Todd Lyons that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 20, 2025.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 Director Lyons, thank you so much for your time.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT TODD LYONS: Oh, appreciate it. Appreciate it. Thanks for coming.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: You are leading the agency that is at the center of President Trump's top domestic policy agenda, immigration enforcement and cracking down on illegal immigration. How do you see ICE's role in this administration?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 Well, I think, definitely, I see it as a law enforcement tool, right? So ICE is really focused on its public safety mission. I think under all administrations, that what ICE truly is, it's a law enforcement entity. And I really think right now, our main focus is public safety, and that's- that's my focus. The main focus is to keep American people safe and to enact our law enforcement mission.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 The administration has set a goal of carrying out about a million deportations per year annually. Congress just gave your agency $45 billion just to fund its detention network, and also another $30 billion to boost deportation efforts. What exactly will that money fund, and what do we expect that to look on the ground?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 On the ground, what we're really focused on is definitely hiring more in our ranks. In order to achieve the President's mission, and under Secretary Noem's vision, we definitely need more officers and agents.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Do you know how many?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 We're looking to hire about 10,000 and- but that's we've been depleted over the past four years. Our ranks have really shrunk, and we really don't have enough to do law enforcement mission. One of the big hampers for us is with the increase in sanctuary cities and sanctuary policies, we have to send more officers and agents out into the community, out on the street. Where we'd only take us two agents, say, going into a secure facility or a police station, county jail to arrest a public safety threat, well, we have to send out four to five agents, and with the increase of assaults on officers, we sometimes have to send out eight to ten just to provide security for those officers that are making the arrest. So that's one of the big things that we're looking forward to with this increased funding is increasing our manpower. Not only just officers, but our attorneys as well, to ensure that we have enough of legal support to go ahead and deal with the Department of Justice, immigration court appeals, things like that.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Detention facilities too.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 Detention facility as well, yeah.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Is the goal of 1 million deportations per year now possible because of this money?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 I definitely think it's possible. One thing though, that ICE is historically known for in our mission is we detain to remove, we don't detain punitively. So people do hear that increase in the bed space, but it's not for long-term. We, you know, it's- we detain people to remove them. So what we want to do, too, is focus on the removal efforts as well, because one thing we want to do is remove people in a safe, humane manner, but also efficiently as well, quickly. There's no reason for someone to linger in a detention facility after they've been lawfully ordered by immigration judge. We want to ensure that they can get back to their home country safely and quickly.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 More than a dozen individuals are facing charges for that violent attack against an ICE facility in Texas. The Department of Homeland Security, as you know, has also reported a sharp increase in attacks against your agents. What do you think is behind that?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 You know, I honestly have to say, I think it's just the increased rhetoric that we hear against ICE officers and the ICE mission. If we think back to when you and I did a ride along last year, in October. You know, you and I spent a good amount of time together observing teams in the field, and you didn't see the officers and agents that day masked up, right? You didn't see any kind of violence towards us, any protests. Even going back to January 20, beginning of this administration, up until the middle of February, you really didn't see that kind of rhetoric or violence coming against ICE officers and agents like you do now. I think the sharp increase in the rhetoric, especially from a lot of elected officials that are shaming, if you will, or speaking out against the ICE law enforcement mission, is what's really increasing these attacks on officers. And that, unfortunately, the Alvarado incident down in Prairieland, that is one that's really taken it to the next level. We've seen protests. We've seen rocks. Rocks, in itself, could be a deadly weapon, but now we have individuals laying in ambush with firearms to attack an ICE facility. Just the increase is amazing. The fact that, like you said, 830% increase from last year assaults on officers. That's what really keeps me up at night, is because we have to focus on the men and women of ICE, keeping them safe, making sure they go home to their families, our other partners, as well as the people in the community we interact with. You know, someone might interject themselves into this arrest of someone that's wanted for, say, a murder in their home country, a violent felon who has nothing to lose. And one of these people, agitators or protesters, might get involved in an ICE law enforcement arrest, and they could get injured as well. So there's a lot of factors that really come with this rhetoric against ICE officers and agents.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 Do you think the increase in attacks against ICE officers is connected to the broader increase in ICE arrests across the country? Because you're seeing more arrests, you're seeing more attacks, too.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 I think we're seeing both. I think because we are more visible in the community. You know, there was- recently, people had talked about the amount of support that ICE had under President Obama. Well, during those times, we did make more custodial arrests, those arrests like you would--",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: In jails--",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: --in the jails, right? We weren't really out there. We just don't see that now with a lot of the sanctuary policies and just a lot of- lot of lack of cooperation. So you are seeing us out more, and I think there is more of a tension, kind of like you said, the immigration mission is one of the forefront of this administration, so it is a lot of scrutiny and publicity to it. So I think that's also leading to a lot of the, you know, the rhetoric, the criticism, and just a lot more of the increased violence on officers.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 And you have cited those concerns about officer safety when defending your agents wearing masks during operations. That has become a polarizing debate. What do you say, director, to the criticism that law enforcement officials, including ICE officers, should be identifying themselves, and that the use of masks could be potentially dangerous, including because it could lead to imposters posing as ICE agents.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yeah, and that's one of our biggest concerns, and I've said it publicly before, I'm not a proponent of the masks. However, if that's a tool that the men and women of ICE to keep themselves and their family safe, then I will allow it. I do kind of push back on the criticism that they don't identify themselves. If you see a lot of the photos, like we were out that day, like I would go back to our ride along. Men and women of ICE and our DOJ partners in local law enforcement do help us. They are identified on their vest. You can see the HSI, ERO, federal police officer, FBI on the back of the vest. So I would push back on the notion that we aren't identifying themselves. Now, what I would advocate for, and I've said this many times, is I know a lot of elected officials have put forward legislation or proposed legislation about banning of the masks, things like that. I would also want, you know, elected officials to help us hold those people accountable that do doxx or threaten an ICE officer or agent or their family. I think that's key. If we- if we had that kind of support and had those laws or regulations in place, that we can hold those folks accountable to give ICE agents and officers and other law enforcement officers the peace of mind that someone that does threaten their life or their families or doxxes them will be held accountable. I think that'd go a long way.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 So you will continue to allow ICE officers to wear masks during operations.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I will.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Okay, what is the policy regarding that? It's not mandatory.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: It's not mandatory. As you see- I don't know, I wasn't with your ride-along yesterday, but if you see some of the media coverage, there are officers and agents that don't. Recently, there's been some officers that have been interviewed by other networks who- who've talked about the fears and some of the issues with the job. So there are some that don't, but there are some that have been severely doxxed. You know, speaking from experience, last administration I had multiple protesters from antifa show up at my residence. My address has been put out there. My family's information has been put out there. So I know firsthand what these men and women go through, and it's a scary experience for someone's family, because as a law enforcement officer, you don't sign up for that. You don't bring- you don't bring the work home to your job. But when you have folks, or even elected officials saying that there's going to be no rest for an ICE officer, an agent, that we're going to expose them, you know, no rest for their family. That really concerns me.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Let's get into who ICE is arresting.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Sure.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Do you know how many of the individuals arrested by ICE are people here illegally, but who also have serious criminal records?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yeah, we- we- like I said from the get go, and even, again, going back to when we were together in October, ICE is always focused on the worst of the worst. One difference you'll see now is under this administration, we have opened up the whole aperture of the immigration portfolio, meaning that if you're here illegally and ICE goes out and arrests someone that is released from a sanctuary jurisdiction or wanted in their home country, and an ICE officer finds other individuals with them who are in the country illegally, we're going to take them as well. We are still focused on the worst of the worst. More than half the individuals we have in custody right now have either a conviction or pending criminal charges, since they're released from a sanctuary jurisdiction. One thing, though, that I'd like to highlight is the fact that foreign criminal records aren't in U.S. data systems. So when we do go out and say, arrest someone that has an Interpol Red Notice because they're wanted in their home country, they're still a criminal, but under the American judicial state, they don't have an American criminal history, but that doesn't mean they don't have a criminal history in their home country. I think that's one of the statistic that kind of gets lost in someone and they say, well, this person is non criminal- he doesn't have a criminal history in the United States. Well, that individual can have a criminal history, say, in Brazil, Uruguay, Ukraine, Russia. So there's a lot too that goes into that, what ICE offices and agents do arrest people for.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: And you're saying that now, if your agents encounter anyone who is here illegally, irrespective of whether or not they have a criminal record, that person will be taken into custody?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: If they're here in the United States illegally, yes, they will.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: They're so-called collateral arrests.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Correct.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Okay. We just, as you mentioned, rode along with Border- not Border Patrol, but ICE agents in Maryland, and we saw the agents arresting sex offenders, suspected gang members, the individuals that the president has promised to deport from the country. He often talks about getting rid of the worst of the worst who are in the country illegally. But we have also seen ICE arrest day laborers outside of Home Depots, in some cases, farm workers, people attending their court hearings in immigration court. Is the policy still to prioritize the arrests and deportation of people who are here illegally, but also are violent offenders?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yes, that's one thing, and that's one thing I'm extremely focused on since I became the acting director, is the fact that the president and Secretary Noem have made a promise to the American public that ICE is going to focus on the worst of the worst, and that's what we do need to focus our limited resources on. That's one thing I've always said from the start. What's, again, frustrating for me is the fact that we would love to focus on these criminal aliens that are inside a jail facility, right? A local law enforcement agency, state agency already deemed that person a public safety threat and arrested them and they're in detention. I'd much rather focus all of our limited resources on that to take them into custody, but we do have to go out into the community and make those arrests, and that's where you are seeing those increase of if we encounter someone say, that- that is here in the country illegally, we will take them into custody. In regards to the work site, like you mentioned, one thing that I'd really like to highlight, especially what kicked off June 6 in LA, is the fact that when you see ICE doing these work raids, like the marijuana grow farm, you- we are going there with criminal search warrants or criminal arrest warrants. Not only are we focused on those individuals that are, you know, working here illegally, we're focused on these American companies that are actually exploiting these laborers, these people that came here for a better life. You know, either, you know, forced labor, child trafficking, you know, a lot of these work site cases just isn't a victimless crime of someone here working illegally and that's why we're going there with these criminal warrants to focus on these American businesses that are trying to make an extra dollar on the backs of these people that came here for a better life.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: So you are planning on holding accountable the employers, the companies that are hiring people who are here illegally, not just the workers.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: 100%.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Because that has been a concern.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: It is- it is. I can definitely see that concern, but what I would say is that we have to hold these American businesses accountable, especially when it comes to human trafficking, or child trafficking, forced labor, because those are victims, right? That, you know, that's where illegal employment isn't just a victimless crime, it's a victim at the end of that being exploited. And these American companies do exploit individuals who come here illegally just to make an extra dollar, and that's just not right. We have to hold those county- companies accountable.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Should anyone here illegally now be scared of ICE agents potentially arresting them? Should that be something that they should be worried about?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: No- I- what I can- I can speak for with ICE is, we've always done targeted enforcement. That's one thing I- I always stress. You saw it when you- when you and I rode together in Baltimore last year. ICE knows who they're going after that day. There are other DHS entities, Border Patrol has a different mission, CBP has a different mission than us. I can't speak to them, but I will speak to ICE, and the fact that, when ICE does go out, the person we're looking for, it- has a criminal record, has been released from a jail, that's considered a public safety threat, or has been ordered lawfully removed from the United States by an immigration judge. That's another one of our big things as well. But again, to go back to my point earlier, if we do go out--",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Who may not be criminals, but have been ordered deported.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yeah. Ordered deported. There are millions of people that are here in the United States that have had their due process, went through the entire immigration process, and have been lawfully ordered deported by a Department of Justice immigration judge, and have just not left the country. We are focused on them as well. But again, to go back to what I said earlier, if we go ahead and go out into the community, and we do effectuate an arrest of one of those individuals, but there might be two or three other individuals with that person that's here illegally, we're just not going to walk away like we did in the past. We are going to, you know, conduct our law enforcement mission and arrest those individuals.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: I want to read you, Director, a letter that Congressman Tony Gonzales and other Republicans wrote to you, actually. They said, \"every minute that we spend pursuing an individual with a clean record is a minute less that we dedicate on apprehending terrorists or cartel operatives.\" Isn't that just objectively true from an operational standpoint, because you don't have the agents and facilities, perhaps, to detain everyone who is here illegally?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I would say that. Operationally, I've always said we do have limited resources. Now we are going to get that funding with the president's Big Beautiful Bill. To the congressman, I would say that ICE is still focused on going after terrorists. We've- we've- you know, arrested over 3,000 TDA gang members, which is now a foreign terrorist organization. But much- what I would say is, much like any local law enforcement agency, if you pull somebody over in a vehicle, and that person has a misdemeanor warrant, say, or a civil warrant, that local law enforcement agency isn't going to walk away from that individual. They're going to arrest that individual. And it's the same with ICE. So while we still are going out after the rapists, murderers, terrorists, we are going to encounter individuals that are here illegally. But what I can promise is, our main focus is those public safety threats, are those national security concerns, because that's what ICE's mission is. Now we are going to encounter those other people which are listed as collaterals, but we just can't walk away from them. We need to do our law enforcement mission as well.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: You're not ignoring those cases anymore.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: No.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: On worksite enforcement, there have been some mixed messages, if you will, from the administration. Initially, there was an effective pause on arrests at hotels, restaurants, and farms. That was quickly reversed. The president has talked about, Director, giving a pass to farmers who are in the country with workers who are here illegally. What is the policy now, when it comes to immigration worksite enforcement?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Which is- kind of what I said earlier in the interview, is the fact that work- when we do a worksite enforcement, it's based on a criminal case. So ICE is still going to focus on a criminal case, whether that be, like you saw on the marijuana grow farm in California, whether it be suspected human trafficking or child forced labor, issues like that. So our policy is still, if we're going to worksite enforcement, we are focused on that criminal aspect of the investigation. So that's what ICE's policy is. I can't speak to the administration. I don't want to get ahead of the president or secretary when it comes to any type of long term immigration plan they do have for the workers, but I will say for ICE, our policy is, we're still going to build solid criminal cases on those worksites to include the businesses, and that's what we're focused on.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Including farms, hotels and restaurants?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Well, we have seen, in many instances, where certain organizations do exploit labor like that, whether it be child labor, human trafficking, things like that. We can't walk away from a criminal case when it comes to real victims there, we'll still focus on those. Now administratively, I- we're gonna focus more heavily on the criminal side of that.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: But there's no ban on enforcement operations at certain work sites?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: No. And I think, like I said, you'll see, when we show up at a work site, it's because a signed federal judge warrant has brought us there for a criminal reason.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Like in the case of the cannabis farms in California?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Correct.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: White House Deputy Chief of Staff, Stephen Miller, who plays a major role on immigration policy in this administration, has talked about ICE carrying out at least 3,000 daily arrests. Right now, you are not hitting that number. Is that target realistic? And can you get to it just by apprehending criminals?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I- if you look at the amount of criminals that we've already arrested, I think you see we can. I think when you look at those larger numbers, when people talk about those certain goals, you have to also look at those individuals that do have those final orders of removals. Those are what we're really focused on as well. There was many people that were let in the last administration that have gone through their immigration process, who have not shown up for immigration court and have been ordered deported. We still have to focus on those. So I would still say that you're going to see what ICE resources going out daily will be still those criminal cases and those final orders.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Can you get to that 3,000 number per day?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I think operationally, we can get to any number we set our- set our mind on. I think we just need to be limited in our scope, and use our limited resources to focus on the worst of the worst. I- you know, operationally, when we're trying to protect the American public, I can't be focused on a number. We have to be focused on, number one, getting those public safety threats and those national security threats out of the country, like we did just recently, when we arrested some of those Iranians. There were potential, known, suspected terrorists that came in on the last administration. And we also had to worry about the safety of the men and women of ICE as well. Those are the two main focus that I need to focus on, on our daily operations.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Do you know what the current daily arrest average is right now?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I wouldn't say this daily arrest average. It just really depends on size and scope of what we're doing nationwide. It can go anywhere from 2,500 to 1,700 a day.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Got it, okay. Our colleague Margaret Brennan recently obtained ICE data showing that only a small percentage of the convicted criminals that ICE has deported over the past six months had convictions for violence offenses. For example, fewer than 1% had homicide convictions. What do you make of that data?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: What I make of that is the fact that we can't look at it just based on the violence or the propensity of violence in that crime. What I looked at is, someone has committed a crime in the United States. Now, if you look at someone that has just been arrested, say, for DUI. Well, some people might say that's only a misdemeanor. We may have prevented vehicular homicide down the road for someone that's a habitual traffic offender. I can't look at the larger scale of what specific crimes are. You know, whether it's a rape, a homicide, of course, you want to get those worst of the worst. But if someone's committed a crime here in the United States and been let back into the community, into here illegally, we need to focus on that. So what I focus on is ensuring that those individuals that have committed a crime are the first ones we're focused on, and that's who we are going to remove.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: As you know, Director, the Supreme Court recently allowed third-country deportations to continue. Should we expect those deportations to increase in the near future? And are other countries, additional nations, now stepping up and saying, I will take back people who are not my citizens?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yeah, I would say you'd see that. But what I'd go back to is the fact that safe third-country removals has been a part of the Immigration Nationality Act for decades. This isn't something that's new, ICE has always done this, so obviously it's come to the forefront now, because, as we talked about earlier, immigration enforcement is at the forefront of the President's administration. But this has been part of the Immigration Nationality Act, which has been enacted by Congress for decades. So we've been doing this for years. That's been part of one of ICE's tools to remove individuals from these recalcitrant countries that just won't take anyone back. Prime example, if we had a country that won't take a homicide suspect back, and under the Supreme Court ruling of Zadvydas, we don't hold punitively, so we can only hold someone for six months to effectuate their removal. If their country won't take them back, we have to release this rapist and murderer back into the community. What Congress did under the Immigration Nationality Act, when enacting the Safe Third Country Agreement, gives us an option to remove these offenders back to a country that will take them.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: So you will continue those deportations.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: We will continue those deportations.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: To countries like South Sudan, for example.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yes.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Does it make sense to send people to countries where they have no ties, though? Even if they are convicted criminals.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Well, I would say, is I- my main focus, like I said, is the safety and security in the United States. Why would we let child rapists with a propensity of violence back into the community, because their home nation won't take them, when they're not here lawfully, or they have no right to stay here. That's our focus. Is to make sure that we are removing these individuals from the country in the most effective and meaningful way that we can. And if their home country won't take them back, then we need to seek other options, other than letting them just roam in the United States.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: The Associated Press, director, just reported that ICE now has access to the personal information of millions of people enrolled in Medicaid, including names and addresses. Can you confirm that that is true? And if so, what does ICE plan to do with that information?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: You know, one thing that we have seen is the fact that under the last administration, we have so many known got-aways, or individuals that came into the United States and just totally disappeared off the grid. What ICE is doing is working with all of our other federal partners to try to gain intelligence, to locate these individuals that have been ordered deported by a judge or have been released from a sanctuary jurisdiction like we talked about. That is what ICE is using that data for, whether it be data from the Department of Labor, data from health and service- Health and Human Services, Medicaid, we are using that data to try to locate, again, the worst of the worst, those people that have been lawfully deported. So I think that's what you're going to see that data used for.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 To identify and arrest people who are here illegally.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yes.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Let's talk about Alligator Alcatraz. Florida just opened a facility, as you know, in the Everglades, that is holding people awaiting deportation because they're here illegally. Some of them have committed crimes. How much of that facility is designed to help you operationally versus to send the message? That message being, if you're here illegally, you could potentially be sent to this scary-sounding place like Alligator Alcatraz.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: It's more of an operational. State of Florida had partnered with us for that. We had limited, we had limited space in Florida, obviously. What I would say is that we don't have the detention space capacity to remove people. Partnering with states like this definitely does help us. It is an operational need for us, is to have those partnerships with states, especially a state like Florida that does have the 287(g) agreement, where their local, State and County deputies are deputized to be ICE officers who are encountering these individuals. That definitely helps us in the- in the mission of removing individuals from the United States.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: As you underscore, there have been some growing tensions in some communities because of ICE enforcement actions. Do you think there's any way, Director, to de-escalate the situation, and can you carry out the mass deportation operation that the President has promised without losing the trust of many in the public?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I think one of the main things for us is that open line of communication, interviews like this, actually people looking at what ICE is doing, us highlighting these criminal offenders that we are arresting. I think a key thing too, is working with elected officials to come to common ground, to really focus on the safety of neighborhoods and communities, and really focus on what ICE does in their law enforcement mission, and totally take out the rhetoric of what's being said right now, and just really focus on that ICE is a viable law enforcement partner that does a significant public safety mission for the United States. I think that's very key in keeping these open line of communications, and working with local and state government- governments and elected officials to ensure that we are removing these public safety threats from their communities.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Director, is there something I didn't ask you that you wanted to underscore?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: No, I just really liked- appreciate you taking the time to come here, and let me highlight exactly what the ICE mission is. And I just appreciate the opportunity to have that conversation.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: All right. Thank you, Director.",

      "In mid-July, a load of 200,000 oyster larvae attached to biodegradable materials was deposited about 100 feet under the sea in the ship's hull.",
      "The environmental project, named Belreefs, aims to turn the wreckage into a biodiversity sanctuary.",
      "Flat oysters form reefs that purify water and that other sea animals, from fish to algae, use as breeding and feeding grounds, explained Stratigaki.",
      "\"There is a lot of predation in the sea, it's a wild environment,\" she said, with about 30,000 of the oyster larvae expected to survive their first year at sea. \"Then they will start reproducing, extending the reef and also supporting the biodiversity of the reef.\"",
      "The laying of the oyster stash is the culmination of two years' work for the Belgian government project, which is supported by European Union funding.",
      "\"Until around the 1850s, the North Sea and the European waters were full of these oyster reefs,\" Stratigaki explained.",
      "Then overfishing, the spreading of an imported parasite called Bonamia and \"climatic adverse effects\" caused them to disappear, she said.",

      "They analyzed each person\u2019s total energy expenditure (TEE), which is the number of calories burned daily, along with body fat percentage and BMI (body mass index).",
      "One dietitian says a mix of poor diet, high stress levels, lack of muscle and lack of frequent movement are behind rising obesity numbers. (iStock)",
      "When adjusted for body size, people across all lifestyles and income levels burned similar amounts of energy, even if their daily routines were drastically different.",
      "\"The differences in body fat that we see across populations likely aren't due to major differences in activity level or total daily energy burned,\" study authors Amanda McGrosky (from Elon University in North Carolina) and Amy Luke (Loyola University in Illinois) told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Rather, excess body fat is\u00a0likely\u00a0primarily the product of too many 'calories in,' or eating more calories than are burned.\"",
      "SCIENTISTS MAY HAVE DISCOVERED WHY THE POUNDS COME BACK AFTER LOSING WEIGHT",
      "People in more economically developed areas burned more calories, the researchers noted \u2014 but that\u2019s primarily because they tend to weigh more, and heavier bodies naturally burn more energy.",
      "Published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the study concluded that how much people eat plays a far greater role than the amount of exercise when it comes to putting on weight.",
      "The findings suggest that overeating is roughly 10 times more important than a lack of exercise in skyrocketing obesity rates. (iStock)",
      "\"Our analyses suggest that increased energy intake has been roughly 10 times more important than declining activity rates in driving the modern obesity crisis,\" the authors stated.",
      "Dr. Brett Osborn, a Florida neurosurgeon and longevity expert, agrees with the adage that \"you can\u2019t out-train a bad diet.\"",
      "\"Exercise burns far fewer calories than people want to believe,\" Osborn, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"We\u2019re not gaining weight because we stopped moving. We\u2019re gaining because we\u2019re overfed.\"",
      "\"This latest data only confirms what I\u2019ve seen in my clinic: We\u2019re not gaining weight because we stopped moving. We\u2019re gaining because we\u2019re overfed.\"",
      "Allen pointed out that muscle mass should also be considered.",
      "\"Having sufficient muscle is what drastically improves metabolism and fat-burning capabilities,\" she told Fox News Digital, also emphasizing the importance of stress levels. \"People\u00a0who live in high-stress societies tend to be fatter because stress hormones change our metabolism and shift us into 'survival mode.'\"",
      "SCIENTISTS CAN DETECT JUNK FOOD CONSUMPTION IN BLOOD AND URINE TESTS",
      "Another finding involves ultraprocessed foods (UPFs), which have long ingredient lists that are often calorie-dense, shelf-stable and \"highly palatable.\"",
      "\"As more populations are exposed to increasing amounts of highly processed, highly palatable foods, we will likely see increases in obesity in regions with relatively low rates currently,\" the study authors predicted.",
      "Ultraprocessed foods are less likely to help people feel full, causing them to overeat, experts say. (iStock)",
      "Ultraprocessed foods tend to be easier to overeat due to their flavor and texture, and they also don't keep people feeling full, the study found.",
      "They are also more calorie-dense, meaning they pack more energy into smaller volumes, and are more easily absorbed, making it harder for the body to eliminate excess energy.",
      "\"Ultraprocessed foods are engineered to override our biology, namely our satiety signaling in the brain,\" Osborn told Fox News Digital. \"They also promote inflammation and shift our physiology to a state that favors fat accumulation over fat burning.\"",

      "The researchers pointed out that physical activity is still important, particularly for cardiovascular health, mental well-being and longevity.",
      "Allen noted that people \"need to consider all the other benefits of exercise and shift the mindset away from how many calories they are burning (which actually doesn't work very well for weight loss) toward building as much strength and muscle as they can.\"",
      "People should consider the benefits of exercise beyond just weight loss, a researcher advised. (iStock)",
      "Osborn agreed, recommending \"progressively intense and challenging workouts\" \u2014 strength training in particular \u2014 to help boost the metabolic rate and facilitate fat-burning.",

      "The update from U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher capped an extraordinary court hearing centered on the status and location of \"Cristian,\" a 20-year-old Venezuelan migrant who was deported to El Salvador's CECOT maximum-security prison in March, as part of the Trump administration's early wave of Alien Enemies Act deportation flights.",

      "Gallagher, a Trump appointee, had ruled in April that Cristian's deportation violated a settlement agreement that the Department of Homeland Security struck last year with a group of young asylum seekers. Under the 2024 deal, DHS agreed not to deport members of that class until their asylum claims could be fully adjudicated by a U.S. court.",
      "The hearing sharply underscored the fast-changing fact pattern underpinning Cristian's custodial status. Days earlier, Cristian was deported from CECOT, in El Salvador, to his home country of Venezuela.",
      "Gallagher said Tuesday that the new situation has put the court \"in a different posture\" compared to its position just one week ago.",
      "Lawyers for Cristian argued on Tuesday that his removal to Venezuela, which they had no prior notice of, should be grounds to move on holding the Trump administration in criminal contempt. Gallagher did not rule it out.",
      "In Gallagher's ruling four months ago, she determined that Cristian's removal was a \"breach of contract\" due to the settlement terms of the 2024 DHS deal. She then ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the U.S.",
      "But as Tuesday's hearing made clear, Daniel Lozano-Camargo, the migrant referred to in court documents as \"Cristian,\" is not on his way to the U.S. from CECOT.",
      "In fact, Justice Department lawyers confirmed Tuesday that he was deported from CECOT back to his home country of Venezuela on Friday along with 251 other Venezuelan migrants, whom the Trump administration deported from the U.S. to El Salvador in March under the auspices of a wartime immigration law used just three times previously in U.S. history.",
      "Their return to Venezuela was part of a prisoner swap made on Friday in order to secure the release of 10 Americans detained in that country. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed the swap in a social media post later that evening.",

It is unclear if \u2013 or how many \u2013 migrants removed to the CECOT prison might have been under \"withholding of removal\" orders from a federal judge, which would block the U.S. from deporting them back to Venezuela.",

      "\"I do not say this lightly, and it's a weighty issue to consider, but given the history of violations here, criminal contempt should be on the table,\" DeJong said.",
      "Gallagher did not immediately discount that option, though she noted it would only come after a separate discovery process into the government's behavior.",
      "\"We're in a different position now,\" Gallagher said, nodding to what she described as the court's \"unusual\" procedural situation.",
      "She also stressed that the court still does not have an answer on whether the Trump administration attempted to comply with the court\u2019s order to facilitate Cristian\u2019s return to the U.S., or whether it even made such a request to the government of El Salvador.",
      "\"We do not know if that happened or not,\" Gallagher told Justice Department attorney Ruth Ann Mueller.",

      "Like Abrego Garcia, Cristian remained in El Salvador for months, despite a court order demanding his return and requiring the administration to file regular updates to his status in order to determine compliance with the order.",
      "But Tuesday's motions hearing \u2013 and the blitz of court filings submitted to Gallagher in recent days \u2013 underscored the very different situation that has played out instead.",
      "\"Cristian was a pawn in this plan,\" DeJong said on Tuesday, noting that the government took \"active purposeful steps to deport him\" despite the court order, and with apparent prior knowledge.",
      "\"They could have included him\" on the flight back to the U.S. with Abrego Garcia, he argued.",
      "Instead, DeJong said, the \"only reasonable inference we see is that the government attorneys willfully disregarded\" the court.",
      "Gallagher in May declined to grant the Trump administration's request for her to lift her order requiring them to return Cristian. She stressed that her order has nothing to do with the strength of his asylum request, in a nod to two apparent low-level drug offenses and a conviction as recently as January.",

      "\"The fundamental problem with New York City's housing market is that there is not enough supply to meet the demand,\" John Ketcham,\u00a0a\u00a0legal policy fellow and director of cities at the Manhattan Institute, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The city government has prevented the private sector from building enough housing through zoning, through other forms of regulation, through affordability requirements and so forth, and so we've had more jobs created in New York City than housing units to support the population of newcomers and so that has simply increased prices. Prices are an effect of the supply-demand dynamic. They're not a cause, they're an effect.\"",

      "Fox News Digital spoke to Manhattan Institute scholar John Ketcham about Zohran Mamdani's housing policies (Getty/Fox News Digital)",
      "\"Assembly member Mamdani's proposal to freeze the rent would only apply to the 1 million units of rent-stabilized apartments,\" Ketcham said. \"Now, these are units that can only increase in rents by an amount that the rent guidelines board determines and those members of the rent guidelines board are appointed by the mayor. So he would essentially appoint these members and direct them to keep rents stable.\"",
      "Ketcham continued, \"Now, rents are already not covering increased operational costs for the owners of these rent-stabilized buildings and so the quality of the rent-stabilized housing stock is deteriorating rapidly and will continue to do so if the capital is not there to cover maintenance and operational costs. Roofs leak and boilers break. These things have to be fixed and there has to be enough in the rent increases to allow for these increased costs. If there isn't, then we're going to see a situation where tenants are living in worse and worse conditions each year.\"",
      "Ketcham told Fox News Digital that the situation raises the question, \"Is that the type of city that we want to create?\"",
      "\"Or do we want a city where we have an abundance of new housing, where young people can feel like they have an option from among many different buildings and neighborhoods, where they can find the place that best suits their preferences and needs?\" Ketcham said.",

      "Ketcham also said a key issue in the New York City housing market is that the city already has the largest public housing authority in the country, totaling 177,000 units. According to Ketcham, those residents are already \"truly suffering from gross mismanagement.\"",
      "\"It takes our public housing Authority, NYSHA, 413 days to complete a repair on average,\" Ketcham said. \"It's so bad that our far-left public advocate, Jumaane Williams, has repeatedly called NYSHA the worst landlord in the city. So these are issues where we're looking at what kind of city is New York going to be? Is it going to a place that rewards aspiration and that tries to attract newcomers who want to live in conditions that are getting better every year? Or is it going to stay stagnant and simply appeal to those who seek security above all else?\"",

      "\"That's just the basic economics of it,\" Ketcham said. \"It's been tried in other cities like in Chicago and in St. Louis with Cabrini-Green and Pruitt-Igoe, which were historic failures in public housing.\"",
      "\"The residents of these places have to contend with mold, rats and other vermin; they have all sorts of crime issues as well, so those experiments simply did not work. What does work is allowing the private sector to build a lot of new housing, including market-rate housing across the city and Mr. Mamdani's proposals are not necessarily amenable to that kind of private investment. In fact, he'd like to substitute in large part that private investment with public investment, public building projects.\"",

He proposed eliminating fares to ride New York City's vast bus system, making CUNY (City University of New York) \"tuition-free,\" freezing rents on municipal housing, offering \"free childcare\" for children up to age 5 and setting up government-run grocery stores.",
      "And Mamdani, thanks in part to the efforts of a massive grassroots army of volunteers, rode a wave of support from younger and progressive voters to catapult himself into first place.",
      "Cuomo now says he's committed to making New York a city with \"lower rent, safer streets, where buying your first home is once again possible, where child care won\u2019t bankrupt you.\"",
      "And he's taken aim at Mamdani for putting out \"slick slogans, but no real solutions.\"",
      "POTUS THE PUNDIT: TRUMP SAYS CUOMO'S GOT A 'GOOD SHOT' OF BEATING MAMDANI",
      "Cuomo is one of four candidates in the general election who are taking on Mamdani, who, as the Democratic Party nominee, is the front-runner in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a roughly six-to-one margin.",
      "Also in the race are Mayor Eric Adams, the embattled incumbent who announced earlier this year that he would seek re-election as an independent candidate, and Guardian Angels co-founder Curtis Sliwa, who for a second straight election is the Republican mayoral nominee.",

      "\"Only 13% of New Yorkers voted in the June primary,\" Cuomo said in his general election launch video.",
      "And as he now faces a broader and more moderate electorate than that in the Democratic Party primary, Cuomo's apparent pivot away from Trump and towards issues of affordability appears strategic.",

      "A man kicking a ball while wearing the e-OPRA bionic knee prosthesis. (MIT)",
      "How the e-OPRA bionic knee for amputees works",
      "The tech is called e-OPRA (Enhanced Osseointegrated Prostheses for the Rehabilitation of Amputees). It involves surgically implanting a titanium rod into the femur, which connects directly to a robotic prosthetic limb. This rod becomes the foundation of a new kind of interface between the body and machine. But it doesn't stop there.",
      "Using a specialized surgical technique known as Agonist-Antagonist Myoneural Interface (AMI), muscles are reconnected in functional pairs. These muscles \"talk\" to each other, sending signals to the robotic controller, which calculates exactly how the knee should move, mirroring how a real leg works.",
      "Natural movement restored with the bionic knee for amputees",
      "In trials, two patients with this integrated system not only performed better, but they also felt better. They moved faster, climbed stairs with more ease, and avoided obstacles with greater confidence. Most importantly, they felt like the prosthetic was part of their body.",
      "One participant with only a few inches of thigh remaining could walk, pivot, and even kick a ball smoothly. This kind of intuitive, natural movement is a game-changer for above-the-knee amputees.",
      "Illustration of a new e-OPRA bionic knee that can help people with above-the-knee amputations. (MIT)",
      "Why the bionic knee for amputees is a major breakthrough",
      "Traditional socket-based prosthetics can be uncomfortable, unstable, and prone to infections. They often feel foreign, like a tool strapped to the body rather than a part of it. The bionic knee bypasses the socket altogether. By connecting directly to bone and muscle, it improves load-bearing, reduces skin problems, and most importantly, restores a sense of control. And control isn't just physical, it's emotional and psychological. Patients using the e-OPRA system reported a greater sense of agency and body ownership than those with traditional or partially-integrated prosthetics.",
      "MIT's bionic knee for amputees driven by lived experience",
      "Professor Hugh Herr isn't just leading the research; he's living it. After losing both legs below the knee to frostbite in his teens, he returned to mountain climbing and dedicated his career to advancing prosthetic technology. His personal journey powers a lab at MIT that continues to push the boundaries of biomechatronics. And now, that journey may change the lives of above-the-knee amputees worldwide.",
      "A man kicking balls while wearing the e-OPRA bionic knee prosthesis. (MIT)",
      "When the bionic knee for amputees will be available",

      "Photo showing fentanyl pills seized at the U.S. border. (Elizabeth Denis/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "How VaporID detects drugs faster than swab tests",
      "This portable air scanner, created at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), is being brought to market by California-based instrument maker BaySpec. The device works by pulling in air and identifying molecules in real time using a miniature mass spectrometer.",
      "Unlike traditional swab tests that take five to thirty minutes, VaporID detects fentanyl in seconds, even at levels as low as six parts per trillion. That's like spotting a single pine needle in an entire forest.",
      "Why drug dogs may soon be outmatched by VaporID",
      "For decades, trained canines have been the gold standard at ports of entry. But dogs have limits; they tire, need handlers, and can't be reprogrammed with software updates. VaporID, on the other hand, never needs a nap. It can detect not only known drugs but also fentanyl analogs, lab-made variants designed to skirt detection.",
      "The system's cutting-edge design includes an atmospheric flow tube that allows tiny drug molecules more time to interact with charged ions. That chemical dance dramatically boosts sensitivity, making it possible to detect even the most elusive threats.",
      "During a real-world field trial at the Nogales, Arizona border crossing, the device detected trace amounts of several drugs, including fentanyl and cocaine, within seconds inside a Customs and Border Protection lab.",
      "Illustration of the action within the atmospheric flow tube that is a key to the detection of trace levels of fentanyl. (Sara Levine/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "How VaporID works: Air, ions, and instant answers",
      "VaporID weighs about 40 pounds and draws in ambient air like a miniature vacuum. Suspicious molecules are filtered, tagged with electrically charged ions, and passed into a tiny mass spectrometer. Only the relevant particles make it through. This process filters out background interfering vapors from things like perfumes or cleaning agents, giving border agents a clear, accurate, and immediate read on potentially dangerous substances.",
      "What VaporID means for border security",
      "If deployed widely, VaporID could revolutionize how U.S. Customs and Border Protection detects narcotics and explosives. Its fast, hands-free scanning would help agents screen vehicles, cargo, luggage, and even people, without relying solely on canine units or invasive sampling.",
      "The device's sensitivity also opens doors for use beyond borders. The Department of Homeland Security is already working with PNNL and BaySpec to adapt the technology for mail screening, airport baggage checks, and large-scale cargo inspections.",
      "For materials like TNT (trinitrotoluene) and PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate), both powerful explosives that release very few molecules into the air, VaporID's ultra-sensitive detection provides a level of protection that's long been out of reach with current methods.",
      "Chemist Elizabeth Denis uses the PNNL system to check a substance in the laboratory. (Andrea Starr/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "VaporID\u2019s role in combating drug and explosive smuggling",
      "The U.S. is facing a deadly influx of synthetic opioids. According to the CDC, over 80,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2024, including approximately 48,400 deaths linked to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. Fast, contactless detection at ports of entry could help choke off the supply chain before these deadly substances ever hit the streets. And in an era of rising geopolitical tensions, having a portable scanner that can also detect explosives could be a critical layer in national defense.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Technology doesn\u2019t just assist border agents anymore; it\u2019s starting to outperform their most trusted tools. VaporID brings speed, precision, and reliability to a job where seconds count. While drug-sniffing dogs have served well, this portable air scanner may soon lead the front line in detecting threats. As agencies prepare to roll out the system, one thing is clear. The future of border security doesn\u2019t bark. It beeps.",

      "A Meta logo on a smartphone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why is Meta building AI superclusters?",
      "The answer is simple: compute power is now the most valuable resource in AI development. As generative AI, robotics and large language models become more sophisticated, they demand exponentially more data and processing capacity.",
      "Meta's planned superclusters, beginning with Prometheus, will be capable of training ultra-large AI models faster and more efficiently than ever before. According to industry publication SemiAnalysis, Meta could become the first AI company to launch a supercluster exceeding one gigawatt of compute power. That's a serious leap and a direct shot at competitors like OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Anthropic.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "What are Meta Superintelligence Labs?",
      "To supercharge this effort, Meta recently launched Meta Superintelligence Labs, a new elite division focused entirely on next-gen AI development. The lab is being led by Alexandr Wang, former CEO of Scale AI, and Nat Friedman, ex-GitHub chief. In a major signal of intent, Meta invested $14.3 billion in Scale AI and has reportedly poached top talent from Apple, OpenAI and Anthropic to join the effort.",
      "\"I'm focused on building the most elite and talent-dense team in the industry,\" Zuckerberg said.",

      "The bigger picture: Meta's AI arms race",
      "It's no secret that Meta has struggled to keep pace with the AI breakthroughs happening at rival labs. The company's Llama 4 large language models received a lukewarm reception earlier this year. Now, Meta is retooling. The investment in infrastructure, talent, and research is Zuckerberg's way of leveling the playing field-and possibly pulling ahead. In April, Meta increased its 2025 capital expenditures to $64-72 billion, a massive chunk of which will go toward AI development. These numbers aren't just headline-grabbing, they're a clear signal that Meta is done playing catch-up.",

Its newest innovation, the Kinisi 01, also known as KR1, is a powerful autonomous humanoid robot for warehouses. Unlike other robots that perform limited functions, KR1 can move, lift and think like a human, only faster and more reliably. The robot can handle complex pick-and-place tasks with ease. It moves across warehouse floors, approaches shelves and selects items with steady precision. Whether it's lifting heavy boxes or handling fragile goods, KR1 combines physical strength with delicate motor skills. Kinisi designed it to bring human-like flexibility to work environments where consistency and speed matter most.",

      "The Kinisi 01, also known as KR1, is a powerful autonomous humanoid robot.\u00a0(Kinisi Robotics)",
      "How this warehouse robot combines strength and precision",
      "Kinisi built KR1 to thrive in real-world industrial environments. The robot has two arms and hands, which allow it to lift items weighing up to 22 pounds. Thanks to its strong structure and careful engineering, KR1 can retrieve items from high shelves and handle breakable products without damage. It performs these tasks using a wheeled base that allows for smooth, agile movement across standard warehouse floors. Kinisi intentionally avoided complex legged systems to simplify setup and improve stability. KR1 can operate for up to eight hours on a single charge. It features hot-swappable batteries and an auto-docking system that allows for fast recharging with minimal human intervention. These features make it ideal for continuous use in busy fulfillment centers where downtime costs money.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "AI-powered warehouse robot learns tasks on the fly",
      "KR1 doesn't just move intelligently, it learns. Kinisi equipped the robot with built-in AI that allows it to adapt in real time to its surroundings. It recognizes obstacles, modifies its arm movement and executes precise trajectories even as the warehouse layout changes. This means workers don't need to reprogram the system each time workflows shift. One of KR1's most impressive features is its ability to learn from demonstration. Warehouse staff can guide the robot through a task once, and KR1 can replicate it accurately without complex coding. This speeds up onboarding and makes it easy to scale up operations. In a recent demo video, KR1 moved across a warehouse floor on its own. It approached various shelving units, selected a range of items, and placed them into totes with deliberate and smooth movements. It then transported the loaded containers to the correct location, all while avoiding obstacles and adjusting to its environment in real time.",
      "The Kinisi 01, also known as KR1, is a powerful autonomous humanoid robot. (Kinisi Robotics)",
      "This robot works offline without relying on cloud computing",
      "While many robots rely on cloud computing, Kinisi took a different approach. KR1 processes data locally, which means it can function reliably even in environments with weak or unstable internet connections. Local processing also improves response times and enhances data privacy. This design ensures KR1 continues working even during network disruptions. It also allows the robot to make split-second decisions, which is essential in fast-paced warehouses.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Where this humanoid warehouse robot can work beyond logistics",
      "KR1 is already proving useful in logistics, but its design makes it suitable for a wide range of industries. In addition to streamlining warehouse fulfillment, KR1 is built to assist with tasks in retail stocking, light manufacturing, and maintenance work. Kinisi developed the robot to blend into existing workflows, which eliminates the need for expensive infrastructure upgrades. Because the robot combines physical strength with the ability to learn, it can handle repetitive tasks that require both accuracy and endurance. As a result, companies can reduce labor costs, improve workplace safety and increase operational flexibility.",
      "The Kinisi 01, also known as KR1, is a powerful autonomous humanoid robot. (Kinisi Robotics)",
      "How much does KR1 cost? Here's what we know",
      "During a recent presentation at Automate 2025, Kinisi CEO Brennand Pierce revealed that the robot currently costs around $4,000 per month. That rate appears to be part of a subscription-based model, which may include the robot, its onboard AI and ongoing support. Instead of selling KR1 outright, Kinisi is targeting small to mid-size warehouses with a flexible, monthly pricing strategy.",
      "This approach allows businesses to adopt automation without making large upfront investments or overhauling their infrastructure. Although the company hasn't confirmed what the monthly fee includes, the model positions KR1 as a scalable, low-risk solution for logistics teams looking to boost productivity fast.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Kinisi KR1 shows that the future of work is already here. This robot lifts like a human, moves like a worker and learns like a fast-thinking employee.

      "A team of academic researchers has uncovered a new Android security exploit that raises a lot of questions about the platform\u2019s permission system. The technique, named TapTrap, uses user interface animations to visually deceive you into granting sensitive permissions or performing harmful actions. Unlike earlier tapjacking attacks, TapTrap Android attack works by launching transparent system prompts over regular app interfaces. The result is a near-invisible layer that silently captures your taps and interactions.",

      "NEW GOOGLE AI MAKES ROBOTS SMARTER WITHOUT THE CLOUD",
      "A person holding an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the TapTrap Android exploit tricks you into granting permissions",
      "As reported by Bleeping Computer, TapTrap takes advantage of how Android handles activity transitions between apps. A malicious app can launch a system-level screen using the standard start Activity function but modify how the screen appears using a custom animation. By setting both the start and end opacity to a very low value, such as 0.01, the activity becomes nearly invisible to the user.",
      "Touch input is still fully registered by the transparent screen, even though users only see the visible app underneath. Attackers can also apply a scaling animation that enlarges a specific user interface element, such as a permission button, so that it fills the screen. This increases the chance that a user will unknowingly tap the button.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The researchers released a video showing how this technique could be used in a gaming app to quietly launch a Chrome browser permission prompt. The prompt asks for camera access, and the user taps \"Allow\" without realizing what they have done. Because the malicious screen is transparent, there are no visual cues to suggest anything suspicious is happening.",
      "Image of an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why 76% of Android apps are vulnerable to TapTrap",
      "To assess how widespread the vulnerability might be, the researchers tested nearly 100,000 apps from the Play Store. About 76% were found to be potentially vulnerable, not because they are malicious, but because they lack key safeguards. These apps had at least one screen that could be launched by another app, shared the same task stack, failed to override the default transition animation, and did not block user input during the transition.",
      "Android enables these animations by default. Users can only disable them through settings that are typically hidden, such as Developer Options or Accessibility menus. Even the latest Android version, tested on a Google Pixel 8a, remains unprotected against this exploit.",
      "GrapheneOS, a security-focused operating system based on Android, confirmed that its current version is also affected. However, it plans to release a fix in its next update.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Google has acknowledged the issue and said a future Android update will contain a mitigation. While no exact timeline has been announced, Google is expected to change how input and animations are handled to prevent invisible tap interception.",
      "The company added that developers must follow strict Play Store policies and that any app found abusing this vulnerability will face enforcement actions.",
      "A person holding an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4 ways you can stay safe from TapTrap attack",
      "1) Consider a mobile security app:\u00a0Use a trusted antivirus or mobile security app that can detect suspicious behavior or alert you to apps using overlays or accessibility features improperly.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "2) Be selective about the apps you install:\u00a0Avoid installing apps just because they\u2019re trending or have flashy ads. Check developer credibility, recent reviews and app permissions before downloading.",
      "3) Stick to the Google Play Store:\u00a0While not perfect, the Play Store has better safeguards than random APK sources. Avoid installing apps from third-party stores or unknown websites.",
      "4) Pause before granting permissions:\u00a0If an app suddenly asks for access to your camera, microphone, or other sensitive features, take a moment. Always ask yourself if this app really needs this permission right now.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "TapTrap shows that security threats do not always come from complex code or aggressive malware. Sometimes, small oversights in visual behavior can open paths for serious abuse. In this case, the danger lies in what users do not see. People trust what they can see on their screens. This attack breaks that link by creating a visual mismatch between intent and outcome.",

If shoppers can't find what they're looking for, or if the listings are vague, they may head elsewhere. Starfish addresses this by automating the tedious parts of listing creation. That helps sellers spend less time writing and more time selling. For Amazon, better listings mean higher conversion rates and happier customers. Plus, this move positions Amazon to compete more directly with Google Shopping, which also aims to be a central hub for product information.",

      "Amazon\u2019s Starfish AI is expanding globally",
      "Amazon is testing Starfish's effectiveness with A/B comparisons, measuring sales performance of AI-enriched listings versus standard ones. It's also rolling out bulk listing tools and preparing to expand the system globally. This isn't just about improving Amazon's website. It's about changing the way product information is gathered, created and shared at scale.",
      "A person shopping on Amazon\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What does this mean for you as an Amazon shopper or seller",
      "If you're a shopper on Amazon, this could mean faster access to clearer, more accurate product listings, especially for obscure or hard-to-find items. As Amazon's AI fills in missing details and improves titles and descriptions, the results should help you make better decisions with less research.",
      "For sellers, this streamlines the work of creating listings. If you've struggled to write compelling descriptions or keep up with Amazon's catalog standards, the Starfish project may do much of the heavy lifting. That could save time, reduce errors and improve sales performance.",
      "However, there are some trade-offs. As Amazon scrapes more data from across the web to power its listings, brands and smaller websites may worry about how their product information is being used. And if AI-generated content becomes widespread, quality and trust in listings may vary depending on how well the system works.",
      "In short, expect a more automated Amazon shopping experience, with both conveniences and questions about how your data and the broader web are being used to power it.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Amazon's Starfish project signals a major shift in how e-commerce works. By combining web scraping, AI models and deep integration into its Marketplace, Amazon hopes to automate one of the most time-consuming parts of online selling. For buyers and sellers, this could mean more convenience and better results. But it also raises important questions about transparency, data ownership and the future role of AI in shaping what we see online.",

Three flaws were disclosed, each allowing an attacker to gain some level of unauthorized access. The most serious flaw lets an attacker read or manipulate data by exploiting a custom protocol used by the chip.

However, we do not know if this fix was intentional or accidental.",

If you haven't seen an update yet, it should be arriving soon, though some may already be available.",
      "However, there's a catch. According to a report by German outlet Heise, many of the most recent firmware updates for affected devices were released before Airoha provided its official fix. This means some products may still be running vulnerable code, despite appearing up to date.",
      "To make matters more complicated, consumers typically aren't notified directly about these updates. Firmware patches for headphones and similar devices often install silently, or in some cases, may not be delivered at all.

      "1. Regularly check for firmware updates:\u00a0Visit the manufacturer's app or website to manually check for firmware updates, even if you haven\u2019t received a notification. Automatic updates aren\u2019t always reliable, especially for headphones and earbuds.",
      "2. Turn off Bluetooth when not in use:\u00a0Disabling Bluetooth when you're not actively using it reduces your exposure window and makes it harder for attackers to target your device.",
      "3. Use devices in low-risk areas:\u00a0Since these attacks require close proximity, avoid using Bluetooth audio devices in crowded or unfamiliar public places where someone nearby could exploit vulnerabilities.",
      "4. Pair devices with trusted sources only:\u00a0Avoid pairing your Bluetooth headphones with unfamiliar phones, computers or public terminals. Once paired, those devices can sometimes maintain a connection or reestablish one without your knowledge, increasing the risk of abuse if they're compromised.",
      "5. Remove unused paired devices: Go into your Bluetooth settings and delete old or unfamiliar pairings. This helps prevent unauthorized reconnections from previously trusted devices that may now be compromised.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The real concern here isn\u2019t the Bluetooth flaw itself, but what happens when the software inside everyday devices fails quietly. Vulnerabilities like this aren\u2019t unusual, but the way they are handled often leaves users in the dark. As long as consumers can\u2019t see or control the software running inside their own headphones, problems like this will keep happening.",

      "\"Unfortunately, a lot of credentials are harvested and sold on the dark web between different threat actor groups despite strong passwords or MFA barriers. Maybe someone lost their password or an administrator had theirs saved on a laptop that was part of another breach. Once those passwords are collected, they get traded or sold,\" Daniel explained.",
      "While brute-force attacks still happen, most criminals don't waste time hammering away at complex passwords. Instead, they exploit simpler routes: snatching passwords from old breaches, targeting users directly or hijacking password vaults, especially those managed by social media admins.",

That typically comes through MFA channels. But most executives don't manage their own social media accounts. It's usually someone on their team or a designated admin.

      "Researchers at the China Building Materials Academy (CBMA) and their partners designed the material to weigh just 12.5 pounds per cubic foot. That's about one-tenth the weight of standard concrete. Its strength comes from a network of microscopic bubbles, each coated with a special maleated rosin. This structure allows the foam to crush in a controlled way and cushion even the heaviest aircraft.",

      "An airliner taking off \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why traditional runway safety systems fall short",
      "The most dangerous parts of any flight are takeoff and landing. To reduce risk, airports use Runway End Safety Areas (RESAs). These zones are meant to stop planes that overshoot the runway. In the past, airports used sand, soil, grass, or water pools for this purpose. But each of these materials has serious drawbacks.",
      "Soil becomes unstable in wet or freezing conditions. Water can freeze in winter and attract wildlife, creating new hazards. Sand and grass don't always perform well, especially with heavier aircraft. These weaknesses have made it clear that airports need a more reliable and consistent safety solution.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How marshmallow concrete works: The science behind the softness",
      "Marshmallow concrete is engineered with a precise strength between 0.30 and 0.35 megapascals. If it's too strong, it won't crush and absorb energy. If it's too weak, it won't slow the plane. The research team compared the process to blowing bubbles into a concrete mix. These bubbles create the soft, crushable texture that helps stop a plane during an emergency.",
      "To make the bubbles strong enough to last until impact, the team used a special air-entraining agent. This forms a tough coating around each bubble. As a result, the material stays intact until an aircraft overruns the runway, then it collapses at the right moment to maximize safety.",
      "An airliner coming in for a landing (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Durability and cost benefits of marshmallow concrete for airports",
      "Unlike some international systems that rely on expensive calcium sulfoaluminate cement, marshmallow concrete uses ordinary cement, making it far more affordable for airports, especially those with limited budgets. The team also developed a two-stage strength-control system that helps the material adapt to harsh climates and maintain consistent performance throughout the year.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Real-world data from 14 airports in China, including one in the challenging climate of Tibet, show that the material's properties fluctuated by just three percent over a year. This result is well below the design tolerance of ten percent, which means airports can depend on the material to perform reliably, regardless of the weather.",
      "A China Building Materials Academy researcher at work\u00a0 (CBMA)",
      "Marshmallow concrete airport safety: The future standard?",
      "With its unique combination of low cost, environmental resilience, and life-saving performance, marshmallow concrete is poised to become the new global standard for runway safety. The material has already been installed at 14 Chinese airports, where it has demonstrated consistent and reliable performance even in extreme conditions. As more airports seek affordable ways to enhance safety, marshmallow concrete offers a promising solution that can save lives and reduce costs worldwide.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you fly in the U.S., whether for business, vacation, or visiting family, marshmallow concrete could soon make your journeys safer. While this breakthrough is currently being used at airports in China, its performance is turning heads worldwide, including among U.S. aviation experts looking for better runway safety solutions.",
      "Runway overruns don\u2019t happen often in the United States, but when they do, the consequences can be deadly. Think of high-traffic airports like LAX, JFK, or Atlanta, where a single overrun can disrupt thousands of flights and put lives at risk. Marshmallow concrete offers a low-cost, highly effective safety upgrade that could prevent these incidents or dramatically reduce their severity.",
      "The best part? This isn't some billion-dollar overhaul. Because it uses standard cement and is designed to work in all kinds of weather, including harsh winters and extreme heat, it\u2019s a practical option for airports from Maine to Arizona. That means even smaller regional airports across the U.S. could benefit.",
      "You may never see this material, but it could be quietly protecting your flight behind the scenes, ready to absorb impact and bring a plane to a safe stop if something goes wrong. As U.S. airport authorities and the FAA explore more innovative, more cost-effective ways to modernize infrastructure, marshmallow concrete could be one of the safest bets in American aviation's future.",

By combining strength, flexibility, and affordability, this new material offers airports a smarter way to protect passengers and crews.

In fact, the threat is so serious that the U.S. Civil Air Administration once built a \"chicken gun\" to fire bird carcasses at planes to test their resilience.",
      "Traditional deterrents, like drones, dogs, falcons and even gas-powered cannons, have been used for years. But wildlife adapts quickly, and these methods don't always keep animals away for long.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How robot coyotes work to scare off birds and animals",
      "Enter the robot coyote. The ERDC, in partnership with wildlife biologists Stephen Hammond and Jacob Jung and the USDA National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC), has spent five years developing these unique machines. The idea is simple. Most animals instinctively avoid coyotes, so why not use that fear to keep them away from airfields?",
      "The first prototypes, Coyote Rovers, started as Boston Dynamics Spot robots. However, these proved too slow to scare off wildlife. The team switched to four-wheeled Traxxas X-Maxx motorized cars, which can reach speeds of 20 mph. Each vehicle carries a plastic coyote dummy, blending just the right amount of realism and intimidation, all for about $3,000 each.",

      "Inside the U.S. Army\u2019s testing of robot coyotes on airfields",
      "The robot coyotes have already been tested at several military airfields, including Naval Air Station Pensacola, Fort Campbell and Naval Air Station Whiting Field. These early trials showed promise. The robot coyotes successfully deterred birds and other animals, helping to keep runways clear and safe.",
      "But the ERDC isn't stopping there. The goal is to make these robot coyotes even smarter. Future versions may include programmed routes, exclusion zones and the ability to identify specific species. Imagine a robot coyote that can recognize a flock of geese and adjust its tactics on the fly.",

      "What the future holds for airport wildlife control technology",
      "The ERDC and USDA-NWRC are continuing to refine these robot coyotes for airfield wildlife control. New features are on the horizon, including onboard computers, artificial intelligence, cameras and sensors. The aim is to create a robust system that can operate autonomously, navigate tough terrain and adapt to changing conditions. These advances could revolutionize how airfields, and perhaps even commercial airports, manage wildlife hazards.",
      "Robot coyotes for airfield wildlife control \u00a0 (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Robot coyotes for airfield wildlife control are a creative and practical answer to a longstanding problem. By blending technology and biology, the U.S. Army is making airfields safer for everyone. As these systems become more advanced, we may see them used in airports around the world.",

      "Google Drive is one of the world's most popular cloud storage services, trusted by millions for its convenience and integration with other Google products.",
      "However, when considering it as a backup solution for your important data, it's essential to weigh both its strengths and limitations. We'll explore the pros and cons of Google Drive, focusing on security, privacy, functionality and its suitability as a backup tool.",

      "16 BILLION PASSWORDS LEAKED IN MASSIVE DATA BREACH",
      "A phone with a Google Drive app on the homescreen (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Security: Strong protections, but user vigilance needed",
      "Google Drive employs robust security measures, including 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for data at rest and in transit. Additionally, users can enable two-factor authentication and manage sharing permissions to protect their files. However, like all cloud services, Google Drive is not immune to security threats.",
      "Phishing attacks targeting Google accounts remain common, and attackers may exploit weak passwords or compromised credentials. Furthermore, some third-party integrations request extensive permissions, which could be misused if not carefully managed. While Google has experienced security incidents in the past, such as the 2018 Google+ data breach, these have not directly impacted Google Drive. It's important to note that most major cloud storage providers face similar risks, and Google provides tools to help users mitigate them.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "To stay safe, you should regularly audit account access, and use strong passwords. By taking these steps, you can significantly reduce your exposure to security risks.",
      "Privacy: Automated scanning and user control",
      "Google Drive scans files for malware and policy violations using automated systems. While this process helps protect users, some privacy-focused individuals may feel uneasy knowing that their files are subject to automated review. Google is transparent about these practices and states that no human reviews your content unless required by law.",
      "If you require higher levels of privacy, you can use additional client-side encryption before uploading files to Google Drive. This ensures that only you hold the decryption keys, further protecting your sensitive information.",
      "Google Drive share settings (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Internet dependency: Plan for offline access",
      "Like most cloud storage solutions, Google Drive relies on an internet connection to sync and access files. However, you can make files available offline using Google Drive's desktop app or by enabling offline mode in your browser. Planning ahead ensures you can access important documents even during internet outages or while traveling.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Upload limits: Consider your backup needs",
      "Google Drive imposes a daily upload limit of 750 GB per user. If you need to back up large amounts of data, you may find this limit restrictive, as uploads will pause once you reach the cap and resume the next day. While some competitors may not have explicit daily limits, they often enforce fair use policies or bandwidth restrictions. Be sure to compare providers based on your specific backup needs.",
      "Illustration of devices uploading data to Google Drive in the cloud (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Not a dedicated backup solution, but still useful",
      "It's important to recognize that Google Drive is primarily designed for file storage and synchronization, not as a comprehensive backup tool. It lacks some advanced backup features, such as scheduled backups, full system image recovery, and granular file versioning for all file types. However, you can enhance its capabilities by using third-party backup software that integrates with Google Drive, allowing for more automated and reliable backups.",
      "An image of remote servers (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Is Google Drive right for you?",
      "Google Drive offers strong security, seamless integration with other Google services and generous free storage. While it has some limitations as a dedicated backup solution, it remains a reliable choice for everyday file storage, sharing and collaboration. By understanding its strengths and potential risks, and by taking proactive security measures, you can use Google Drive safely and effectively.",
      "If you need advanced backup features or require strict privacy controls, consider supplementing Google Drive with specialized backup software or exploring\u00a0alternative cloud storage providers. Ultimately, the best solution depends on your unique requirements and how you choose to manage your data.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Google Drive stands out for its convenience and integration with other Google services. However, it\u2019s important to understand both its benefits and its limitations. With a few smart security steps and the right backup strategy, you can make the most of what Google Drive offers. Remember, the best storage solution is the one that fits your needs and gives you peace of mind.",

On Tuesday, the organization\u2019s executive chairman, Rev. Johnnie Moore, sent a letter to Tom Fletcher, the United Nations' under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator .",
      "\"As you are aware, the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate. Despite the extraordinary volume of aid inside Gaza, the vast majority of it remains warehoused, undelivered, or looted. The result is millions of civilians without consistent access to food aid,\" Moore wrote.In his letter, Moore asserts that while U.N. agencies have blamed the stalled aid on a \"lack of permissions\" and security concerns, the reality is much different.",

One, Israel lost faith in the prior system because of the second problem, which was diversion.

      "The effects of both President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine on NATO have forced swift and potentially permanent changes in the alliance.",
      "Following last month's announcement that the majority of NATO's 32 members had agreed to increase defense spending to hit 5% of each nation's GDP, Trump drew headlines after he drastically changed his tone and declared the alliance was no longer a \"rip-off.\" But his previously tough stance saw undeniable results in how the security group operates.",
      "\"Trump has changed the game,\" Peter Doran, an expert on Russia, Ukraine, and transatlantic relations, and an adjunct senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said. \"[Then] there's Vladimir Putin, who has clearly awakened the Europeans to the danger that Russia presents to them.\"",
      "Beginning in his first term, Trump made clear his resentment that only five NATO allies were meeting their 2% GDP defense spending pledges, and those criticisms rang loudly following his return to the campaign trail for the 2024 election amid Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "Questions ran rampant over whether Trump would not only continue to provide strong U.S. support for Ukraine, but whether Washington would remain a reliable ally for Europe when confronted with the reality of a war-ready Russia.",

      "Though an increasing number of NATO nations began upping their defense spending commitments following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, several allies began pushing for changes before Trump even re-entered the White House.",
      "Trump not only threatened to remove troops from Europe and divert them to positions in Asia, but he suggested he might not come to the defense of a NATO ally should they be attacked, infamously saying at a February 2024 campaign event, \"You don\u2019t pay your bills; you get no protection. It\u2019s very simple.\"",
      "\"I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want,\" he said in regard to the threat of a Russian attack on a NATO nation.",
      "But his tough rhetoric appeared to yield results.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte \u2014 who has shared a good relationship with Trump \u2014 jokingly referred to Trump's geopolitical tendencies for unconventional statesmanship, particularly after he used the f-word in a fiery rant about a breakdown in the Iran-Israel ceasefire during last month\u2019s summit when he said, \"Daddy\u202fhas to sometimes use strong language.\"",

      "\"Donald Trump's a real contrast to Joe Biden,\" Peter Rough, a senior fellow and the director of the Hudson Institute\u2019s Center on Europe and Eurasia, told Fox News Digital. \"Joe Biden, bear hugged the NATO allies to the point of smothering them with adoration, and that caused them, I think, to sit back and relax a little bit.",
      "\"Donald Trump, by contrast, exposes the allies to just enough hostile power to encourage them to do more, but it doesn't expose them so much that it might invite a Russian attack,\" he added. \"And I think that's the art of the deal, so to speak.\"",

      "\"If Vladimir Putin and the Russians in the post-Cold War period had sought to engage Europe and chosen more of a democratic future, there might not be a NATO Alliance today,\" Rough said. \"But Putin has given NATO a real reason to exist, and President Trump has done his part by\u2026 cajoling, pushing, nudging the allies.\"",
      "But not everyone is convinced that the changes NATO is undergoing are permanent.",
      "RUSSIA THREATENS WEST WITH \u2018PREEMPTIVE STRIKES\u2019 AS NATO LOOKS TO DELIVER PATRIOTS 'AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE'",

      "\"But that's what happens in NATO when confronted with an external crisis,\" he added.",
      "Upon Trump\u2019s re-election there was increased concern about how the U.S. would be perceived by its allies, whether it was still considered a trusted partner or if it was returning to isolationist tendencies not seen since the lead up to World War II.",
      "US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meet during the NATO Heads of State and Government Summit in The Hague, Netherlands on June 25, 2025.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "\"The answer is very clearly no,\" Doran argued. \"If anything, Trump came back and did exactly the same thing he did in the first administration, and that was to remind the Europeans that they are chronically under-spending on defense.",
      "\"If anything, Trump hasn't changed at all. It's the Europeans' awareness that they need to spend more, and they have responded positively to that challenge, and that is very encouraging,\" he added.",

      "\"But if that anxiety translates to\u2026 real policy victories and partnerships with Europe, then I think it can be a healthy thing,\" Rough said.",

      "\"I think it's really important that 16- and 17-year-olds have the vote because they're old enough to go out to work, they're old enough to pay taxes, so to pay in. And I think if you pay in, you should have the opportunity to say what you want your money spent on, which way the government should go,\" British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters on Thursday. \"I'm really pleased that we're able to bring more young people into our democracy.\"",
      "\"Young people already contribute to society by working, paying taxes and serving in the military. It's only right they can have a say on the issues that affect them,\" Rayner wrote on X. The deputy prime minister also elaborated in a statement, adding: \"We cannot take our democracy for granted, and by protecting our elections from abuse and boosting participation we will strengthen the foundations of our society for the future.\"",
      "The minimum age of service in the British Armed Forces is 16, but those under 18 need written consent from a parent or guardian and may not be deployed to combat zones.",
      "British opposition politicians accused the Labour Party of trying to manipulate the electorate in their favor by lowering the voting age.",
      "\"Why does this government think a 16\u2011year\u2011old can vote but not be allowed to buy a lottery ticket or an alcoholic drink, marry or go to war, or even stand in the elections they\u2019re voting?\" Member of Parliament (MP) Paul Holmes, a conservative, said in the House of Commons on Thursday. \"Isn\u2019t the government\u2019s position on the age of maturity just hopelessly confused?\"",

      "Holmes accused Labour of \"governing by press release\" and questioned whether allowing bank cards \u2013 which do not include photographs \u2013 as a form of voter ID will undermine security measures at the ballot box.",
      "Nigel Farage, leader of the right-wing Reform UK Party, said giving 16- and 17-year-olds the right to vote \"is an attempt to rig the political system.\"",
      "\"The problem with this is, not only do half of youngsters not want the vote, but they have to stay at school now until they're 18,\" Farage said in a video shared to X. \"The educational establishment is full of left-wing prejudice, is full of anti-reform bias, and frankly, if 16 to 18 year olds at school are going to be able to vote, we're going to have to make sure that our education system is teaching kids to make their own minds up and not indoctrinating them.\"",
      "The change still requires parliamentary approval but was a campaign promise by the Labour Party, which won last year's general election and holds majority control. The next general election is in 2029.",
      "Rayner noted that 16- and 17-year-olds can already vote in Scotland and Wales in local elections and country-level parliamentary elections. The minimum voting age for local elections in England and Northern Ireland is 18.",

      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba confirmed the agreement, saying the 15% rate was the lowest so far among countries that sell more goods to the United States than they buy from it.",
      "\u201cWe have exerted all our efforts to protect our national interests,\u201d he told reporters in Tokyo on Wednesday. \u201cAmong the countries that have a trade surplus with the United States, we have achieved the greatest results.\u201d",

      "Since Trump\u2019s so-called Liberation Day on April 2, the administration has yet to strike any formal trade deals, instead signing a handful of framework deals that can be turned into fully fledged deals later.",

      "As part of the agreement, Trump said Japan would \u201cinvest, at my direction, $550 Billion Dollars into the United States, which will receive 90% of the Profits.\u201d It was unclear how such an investment would work.",
      "Japan is already the biggest foreign investor in the United States, directly investing $754.1 billion last year according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.",

      "Trump was referring to claims made by National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe in social media posts and television appearances that they had found Obama administration officials manipulated intelligence and conspired to undermine the legitimacy of Trump\u2019s electoral victory in 2016.",

Before it could reach the President, it was abruptly pulled 'based on new guidance.' This key intelligence assessment was never published,\u201d Gabbard wrote in one post.",
      "The Obama administration, however, never claimed that Russian cyberattacks impacted the election results. \u201cI can assure the public that there was not the kind of tampering with the voting process that was of concern \u2026 the votes that were cast were counted \u2014 they were counted appropriately,\u201d Obama said from the White House, days after receiving the December 2016 brief to which Gabbard referred.",

      "Another special counsel, appointed by then-Attorney General Bill Barr and championed by Trump, investigated claims that the Russia-related investigations were politicized for over three years. John Durham's report was critical of the FBI's handling of the probe, saying that it found senior \"FBI personnel displayed a serious lack of analytical rigor toward the information they received\" \u2014 but nothing to the level of criminality now alleged by Trump.",

      "As contaminated Guadalupe River water receded following the deadly flooding in Kerrville, Texas, this month, residents returned to find their homes, vehicles and businesses destroyed. Shelled-shocked and in urgent need to rebuild, many turned to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the embattled organization created to assist people in the aftermath of natural disasters.",
      "The responses they received ranged from \u201cfantastic\u201d to unhelpful to frustrating,  residents told NBC News. Their experiences come as FEMA faces a future in which it may be dramatically reshaped or shuttered altogether at the direction of the Trump White House and Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the agency.",
      "Timothy Gloria, of Kerrsville, said his FEMA experience has been exasperating. He was called home from his job the morning of the floods by a neighbor who was hanging onto a tree as waters rose. Gloria arrived around 6 a.m. to find his friend safe, but Gloria\u2019s and his father\u2019s cars, his motorcycle and an outside air conditioning unit were washed away, and the fence around his home was destroyed.",
      "A few days later, on the phone with a FEMA worker, he said he answered 21 questions about the damage to his property to receive emergency relief.",
      "FEMA initially awarded him $50, he said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s like gas money,\u201d Gloria, 41, told NBC News. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t even get the $50. It was approved, but I still haven\u2019t seen it.\u201d He said the FEMA website indicated the money had been transferred to his account.",
      "Further frustrating him, he said, his initial contact with a FEMA representative stopped answering his calls.",
      "\u201cShe was nowhere to be found,\u201d he said. \u201cI was expecting a lot more from FEMA.\u201d",
      "John Mroczek lost a motorhome and two motorcycles in the flood. His head spinning, he sought out FEMA, which had set up a response center in the gymnasium at a church on Washington Street. Upon arrival, he was immediately struck by the agency\u2019s presence.",
      "\u201cFEMA is there waiting for you,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were fantastic. They sign you in, you sit down, and they get right to it. They\u2019ll do anything, from setting up your phone with its app to guiding you to whatever you need.\u201d",
      "The stark contrast in experiences with FEMA in Kerrville serves as a case study for the agency that President Donald Trump has said he wants \u201cremade.\u201d DHS Secretary Noem  has said the agency \u201cshould not exist\u201d as is. On Monday, the head of urban search and rescue at FEMA, Ken Pagurek, announced he would step down amid sweeping changes at the agency, including the requirement that Noem approves contracts over $100,000. Meanwhile, despite some staff cuts, the agency plows ahead in Texas, where 132 people died.",
      "All of this comes as 20 states have announced a lawsuit against FEMA over the termination of a pre-disaster mitigation program that, over the last four years, provided nearly $4.5 billion in funding to 2,000 projects across the country.",
      "FEMA and DHS did not respond to several requests for comment.",
      "But former FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell told NBC News that the contrasting reaction to the agency\u2019s efforts is not surprising. \u200b\u200b",
      "\u201cRecovery is really complex,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a tendency by many to oversimplify what it takes to recover and rebuild a community, and especially to rebuild it in a way that makes it more resilient.\u201d",
      "Criswell added that FEMA is not an agency that comes in and takes over. Rather, it supplements local and state authority before, during and after natural disasters. \u201cIt really takes a partnership between either the individual and their case worker or the local emergency manager and the state with their FEMA representative,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have to work together to help rebuild the community in a way that is going to also make it stronger and more resilient to future weather events like the one they experienced.\u201d",
      "Shortly after the flooding disaster in Texas, Rob Kelly, the county judge, or chief executive, said businesses\u2019 losses in Kerrville are likely to hover around $240 million. The county is reportedly considering raising property taxes to help with the infrastructure rebuild, which has prompted local protests. Kelly said FEMA would reimburse the city for emergency response costs. \u201cBut they\u2019re slow,\u201d he noted. \u201cThe last time we had a big FEMA project, it took at least two, if not three years\u201d to receive funding, he said.",
      "Teresa Offut, the office manager at Rio Robles RV Park in Kerrville, said FEMA\u2019s most glaring response failures \u2014 including Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and Mississippi in 2005, Hurricane Maria 2017 in Puerto Rico and Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina in 2024 \u2014 were not apparent in Kerrville.",
      "\u201cIt seems they are determined to get this one right,\u201d Offut said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been incredible in helping people get settled after this tragedy. They are helping with insurance claims, walking people through that process to make sure all forms are complete, all processes are done correctly. They\u2019re helping with contacting the right people and just settling people down because they\u2019ve lost so much and it\u2019s so overwhelming.\u201d",
      "Mroczek said he has been in hurricanes and tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico, wildfires in Montana and an earthquake in California. \u201cI hope these natural disasters aren\u2019t following me,\u201d he joked.",
      "But in the aftermath of each case, he did not have to work with FEMA; only insurance companies.",
      "Mroczek said FEMA\u2019s response in Kerrville has been so strong that he \u201ccan\u2019t even describe how helpful they are,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll rearrange your phone, if you\u2019re old and not very tech savvy. They will stay with you for hours until you understand what can happen and what they can do. They give you the websites and they lead you off to the right agency to help with your concerns.\u201d",
      "Public perception of FEMA is sometimes fueled by a misunderstanding of what it does, Criswell said. Lorena Guillen, owner of Blue Oak RV Park and Howdy\u2019s restaurant in Kerrville, for example, was expecting FEMA to aid in the recovery of her businesses. All 28 motor homes on her property were washed away in the floods and her restaurant next door suffered severe damage. The land could not be insured against damage from a flood, she said.",
      "However, FEMA typically does not provide businesses with cash but guidance and other resources. In this case, it directed her to the Small Business Administration, which Guillen said could supply her with a loan.",
      "\u201cHow the heck am I going to get a freaking loan that I have to pay back on top of my mortgage?\u201d she said. \u201cMy business is gone. It\u2019s going to take about a year to get it up and running again.\u201d",
      "Her restaurant suffered damages from the flooding, including \u201choles the size of buses in the walls,\u201d and electricity and plumbing outages that Guillen has paid to fix. She was astounded to learn FEMA does not help small businesses with financial assistance.",
      "\u201cBut what about us?\u201d said Guillen, whose restaurant employs 16 workers. \u201cWe bring in the tourists. We hire local residents. Many, many, many businesses are in the same boat. So to get nothing from FEMA? Crazy.\u201d",
      "Following disasters, FEMA becomes \u201ca reimbursement agency,\u201d Criswell said. States and local governments spearhead rebuilding and FEMA reimburses them for rebuilding damaged infrastructure that everyday people deal with. On top of that, individuals can also ask for assistance, which pays for things like a place to stay.",
      "After a few days, the \u201cwaist high\u201d water that infiltrated Gloria\u2019s home receded, he said, leaving a filthy collection of mud and water under his 11-year-old daughter\u2019s bedroom.",
      "\u201cYou walk into my house and you smell some dirty river water that we\u2019re just living on top of,\u201d he said.",
      "Like most residents in Kerrville, he did not have flood insurance on his home. And he is desperate to have the potentially hazardous \u201cgunk\u201d removed from beneath his daughter\u2019s bedroom. At the end of last week, FEMA said he would receive $6,719 toward home repairs, which have been estimated to cost $50,000, he said.",
      "He called the FEMA support of his home \u201ca joke.\u201d",
      "Gloria said he\u2019s applied for five different types of aid, but has been frustrated by the bureaucracy and red tape he\u2019s encountered every step of the way.",
      "Criswell, though, said FEMA is set up this way for a reason.",
      "\u201cThere are checks and balances, and so people get kind of frustrated with the type of documentation that FEMA might ask for to prove occupancy or to prove home ownership, or the types of losses,\u201d Criswell said.",
      "The overall losses and the back-and-forth with FEMA have taken a toll on Gloria, he said. \u201cI fall into depression, so I keep working because if I sit still, I have to look at the flood damages,\u201d Gloria said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know when it will ever get back to normal \u2014 or if FEMA will help me get back to normal.\u201d"

      "His interviewers, Kyle Forgeard and Aaron \u201cSteiny\u201d Steinberg, are members of the Nelk Boys, a group of social media influencers known for their vlogs and prank videos. The group, which has amassed more than 8.5 million subscribers on YouTube, attracted even more fans after its content began to highlight more conservative political figures, including President Donald Trump, whom the podcast interviewed in 2022, 2023 and 2024.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s hourlong interview, which dropped on the Nelk Boys\u2019 \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d on Monday, was met with overwhelmingly critical reception online, with viewers accusing the podcasters of asking softball questions and neglecting to push back against Netanyahu\u2019s claims.",
      "Netanyahu and his government continue to face worldwide outrage over the war in Gaza that followed the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "The podcast\u2019s YouTube channel lost more than 10,000 subscribers within a day, according to the social media tracking platform Social Blade. On YouTube, top comments on the episode were critical of the hosts\u2019 apparent lack of preparedness.",
      "\u201cI see so much stuff about what\u2019s going on in Israel and Iran and Palestine, and to be honest, I just really don\u2019t know what is going on there,\u201d Forgeard said in the episode. Steinberg said he was similarly hoping to \u201cget educated\u201d by interviewing Netanyahu.",
      "At one point, the topic of discussion turned to Netanyahu\u2019s and Trump\u2019s shared affection for hamburgers. Asked about his go-to McDonald\u2019s order, Netanyahu revealed that he prefers Burger King, leading Steinberg to respond, appalled: \u201cThat\u2019s your worst take, I think.\u201d",
      "Throughout the rest of the interview, Netanyahu condemned anti-Israel protesters as \u201cun-American\u201d and contrasted life in Israel with life under the oppressive regime in Iran. He also railed against New York\u2019s Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, calling his proposals for the city \u201cnonsense.\u201d (Mamdani has called Israel\u2019s military actions in Gaza \u201cgenocide\u201d and has said he would arrest Netanyahu, who is the subject of a warrant for his arrest from the International Criminal Court, if he visited New York City.)",
      "Asked why he\u2019s \u201cso hated worldwide,\u201d Netanyahu answered: \u201cWell, a lot of propaganda. First of all, I\u2019m not hated worldwide.\u201d He said Israel has received a lot of goodwill from many in Europe, claiming that Israel\u2019s attack on Iran also \u201cliberated them, because those Iranian missiles were geared at Europe, too, and ultimately at America.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe propaganda is there, I don\u2019t deny it,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cBut people also have, you know, sometimes the truth beckons. And what Israel did with President Trump is safeguard free societies from a menace. I mean, this Iranian regime hangs gays from cranes.\u201d",
      "On Monday, 25 countries, including Britain, Japan and many European nations, called on Israel to end the war in Gaza \u2014 a sign of Israel\u2019s traditional allies\u2019 dismay over the conflict\u2019s humanitarian toll. Close to 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023, according to Palestinian health authorities, with much of the enclave\u2019s population driven from their homes and pushed to the edge of starvation.",
      "The Israeli military and government officials have repeatedly accused Hamas of exploiting civilian sites, including hospitals and schools, as cover for its operations, an accusation that health officials and Hamas have denied.",
      "Israel has also faced mounting accusations of war crimes and genocide, including in a case brought by South Africa before the International Court of Justice, the United Nations\u2019 top court. The court last year ordered Israel to do everything it could to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza. Both Israel and the United States have rejected accusations of genocide.",
      "Online, clips of Netanyahu\u2019s interview drew viral backlash from viewers, many of whom accused the Nelk Boys of platforming \u201cgenocide propaganda\u201d and compared interviewing Netanyahu to interviewing Adolf Hitler.",
      "Far-left political streamer Hasan Piker and far-right white supremacist Nick Fuentes were among those who criticized the latest \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d episode Monday during separate livestreams on their platforms.",
      "\u201cYou just basically presented someone who is a war criminal, someone who is doing a genocide, in a somewhat neutral light,\u201d Piker told Forgeard and Steinberg in his stream. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t be neutral when you have someone like Benjamin Netanyahu directly in an opportunity to talk to him. But that\u2019s what happened, so there is moral culpability here for you guys individually.\u201d",
      "He added that while he would agree to interview Netanyahu if he were given the opportunity, he would be \u201cwell-equipped\u201d to fact-check his statements and push back against potentially dubious claims.",
      "Forgeard, in response, countered that their style of interviewing could \"give us the opportunity to get the biggest people in the world.\"",
      "\"And I think you\u2019ll know by the 'Full Send Podcast' when you watch it, it\u2019s like, 'Hey, these guys are going to get big guests. We might not necessarily get these guys grilling these people,'\" Forgeard said. \"And that\u2019s just what you\u2019re going to come to expect.\"",
      "Fuentes, in his own stream with Forgeard and Steinberg, also questioned the moral equivalency between himself, who has faced condemnation online for his views and beliefs, and \u201ca foreign head of state who is killing women and children.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is somebody who\u2019s in the process of committing what is effectively an ethnic cleansing and a genocide,\u201d Fuentes said.",
      "The interview struggled to land positively even among some supporters of Netanyahu\u2019s military agenda. In The Times of Israel on Tuesday, contributor Elkana Bar Eitan expressed his disappointment that Netanyahu \u201cblew it\u201d on the podcast, despite the lack of pushback he got from the hosts.",
      "\u201cIt was painful to witness how Netanyahu, once a master communicator, missed this opportunity and showed that he\u2019s lost his touch, even in English,\u201d he wrote in an opinion piece. \u201cDespite the friendly atmosphere and softball questions, Netanyahu came across as completely detached from reality.\u201d",
      "A representative for the \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d declined to comment.",
      "In a video responding to the backlash, Steinberg and Forgeard said they plan to \u201cgive the other side the opportunity\u201d to speak on their next episode, though it\u2019s unclear what guest they\u2019re referring to.",
      "\u201cSomeone has to do it,\u201d Forgeard said. \u201cAnd if we have to take the fall and be the bad guys for having the controversial people on, I think we\u2019re willing to do it.\u201d"

These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction.\"",
      "When reporters on Tuesday asked Trump about the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, he pivoted to what he called Obama's \"criminality.\"",
      "\u201cAfter what they did to me \u2014 and whether it\u2019s right or wrong, it\u2019s time to go after people. Obama\u2019s been caught directly,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cWhat they did in 2016 and 2020 is very criminal. It\u2019s criminal at the highest level. So that\u2019s really the things you should be talking about.\u201d",
      "\u201cLook, he\u2019s guilty. It\u2019s not a question,\u201d Trump added. \u201cThis was treason. This was every word you can think of. They tried to steal the election. They tried to obfuscate the election.\u201d",
      "Trump was referring to claims made by National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe in social media posts and television appearances that they had found Obama administration officials manipulated intelligence and conspired to undermine the legitimacy of Trump\u2019s electoral victory in 2016.",
      "Gabbard posted on social media on Friday that she was making a criminal referral to the Justice Department.",
      "At an event with congressional Republicans later Tuesday, Trump praised Gabbard and again accused Obama of being part of an effort to rig the elections. \u201cThese are vicious, horrible people,\u201d he said of the former president and others.",
      "Rodenbush said the Trump administration is being misleading about the information it's using to push its claims.",
      "\"Nothing in the document issued last week undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election but did not successfully manipulate any votes. These findings were affirmed in a 2020 report by the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee, led by then-Chairman Marco Rubio,\" Rodenbush said.",
      "Asked to comment on Obama's statement, White House spokesperson Davis Ingle said, \"The White House is appreciative of Director Gabbard\u2019s commitment to transparency and effort to end the weaponization of government against American citizens.\u201d",

      "\u201cOn Dec 8, 2016, IC officials prepared an assessment for the President\u2019s Daily Brief, finding that Russia 'did not impact recent U.S. election results' by conducting cyber attacks on infrastructure. Before it could reach the President, it was abruptly pulled 'based on new guidance.' This key intelligence assessment was never published,\u201d Gabbard wrote in one post.",
      "The Obama administration, however, never claimed that Russian cyberattacks impacted the election results. \u201cI can assure the public that there was not the kind of tampering with the voting process that was of concern \u2026 the votes that were cast were counted \u2014 they were counted appropriately,\u201d Obama said from the White House, days after receiving the December 2016 brief to which Gabbard referred.",
      "The Obama White House said that Russia sought to interfere in the campaign by leaking hacked documents and using bots and troll farms to spread misinformation about the election \u2014 a finding that was later backed by special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and a Senate report.",
      "Another special counsel, appointed by then-Attorney General Bill Barr and championed by Trump, investigated claims that the Russia-related investigations were politicized for over three years. John Durham's report was critical of the FBI's handling of the probe, saying that it found senior \"FBI personnel displayed a serious lack of analytical rigor toward the information they received\" \u2014 but nothing to the level of criminality now alleged by Trump.",
      "The Senate report, meanwhile, was unequivocal about Russia's actions.",
      "\u201cThe Committee\u2019s bipartisan Report found that Russia\u2019s goal in its unprecedented hack-and-leak operation against the United States in 2016, among other motives, was to assist the Trump Campaign. Candidate Trump and his Campaign responded to that threat by embracing, encouraging, and exploiting the Russian effort,\" the report said.",
      "Democratic lawmakers said the administration is trying to rewrite history in order to assuage Trump.",
      "\u201cThis is just another example of the DNI trying to cook the books, rewrite history, and erode trust in the intelligence agencies she\u2019s supposed to be leading,\u201d Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said in a statement.",
      "House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California told NBC News on Monday that \u201cit\u2019s all a distraction.\"",
      "\"[T]hey\u2019ll release anything if it buys them another day or two to not talk about Epstein or to get the angry mob to talk about Epstein,\u201d Aguilar said.",
      "The Russia investigation is only one of a number of old grievances that Trump has revived in recent days while coping with backlash from MAGA supporters about the handling of the Epstein case.",

      "Detainees in Alligator Alcatraz, a new facility in the Everglades, described what they called torturous conditions in cage-like units full of mosquitoes, where fluorescent lights shine bright on them at all times. Detainees here also called attention to unsanitary conditions, as well as lack of food and reliable medical treatment for their chronic conditions.",
      "\u201cDetention conditions are unlivable,\u201d said Tessa Petit, executive director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, during a news conference Tuesday outside the facility.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s push to quickly ramp up immigration arrests has led to overcrowding at Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. As of June 20, more than 56,000 people were spending the night in detention centers nationwide on any given day. That\u2019s 40% more than in June 2024 and the highest detention population in U.S. history, according to a Human Rights Watch report. Nearly 72% of those detained have no criminal history.",
      "Concerns over detention conditions intensified this week after the HRW report, published Monday, documented \u201cabusive practices\u201d at three Florida immigration detention centers over the past six months. In addition, the New York Immigration Coalition released video showing dozens of men laying on foil sheets on the floor of a crowded immigration processing center in New York City.",
      "NBC News recently reported on similar allegations coming from immigration advocates and detainees held in detention centers across California, Texas, Louisiana, Washington and New Jersey. They described experiencing hunger, food shortages and sickness.",
      "'It\u2019s like a dog cage'",
      "In Tuesday\u2019s news conference, Sonia Vichara held her mobile phone up to a microphone so her husband, Rafael Collado, could publicly describe from Alligator Alcatraz the conditions he has endured over the past two weeks.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a dog cage,\u201d Collado, who is Cuban, said in his native Spanish. He said that a combination of floodwater from recent storms, limited access to showers and poor sanitation have caused him to get fungus on his feet.",
      "As he was describing how detainees are stripped naked every time they are moved to a different cell and there's not a set schedule to take his blood pressure medication, Collado was told by a guard to hang up, he said, ending the call.",
      "Vichara said her husband had been showing up to his immigration appointments for years until he was detained recently during a routine check-in at an ICE field office in Miramar.",
      "Another detainee, Juan Palma, also spoke to NBC Miami from inside Alligator Alcatraz on Monday.",
      "\u201cI feel like my life is in danger,\u201d Palma, who is Cuban, said in Spanish. He described feeling \u201cin a state of torture,\" being swarmed by mosquitoes during his sleep and unable to tell night from day because the facility's fluorescent lights are always on.",
      "Palma also reported being allowed to shower only every three to four days and being kept in a cage-style unit with 32 other people.",
      "Both Vichara and Palma\u2019s wife, Yanet Lopez, said their respective husbands have criminal records, but they did their time. NBC Miami reported that Palma\u2019s record included grand theft, credit forgery and battery. Vichara did not provide details of Collado\u2019s record only limiting herself to say, \u201cHe did made a mistake, but he paid for it for 10 years.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s no excuse to put detainees in harm\u2019s way, Petit said.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about exposing people to illnesses and even to their death. That is a human rights violation, doesn\u2019t matter if you are an immigrant,\u201d she said.",
      "DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin has denied all allegations of inhumane conditions at Alligator Alcatraz and at immigration detention centers across the nation, telling NBC News in an email Tuesday, \u201cAll detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with their family members and lawyers. Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority.\u201d",
      "McLaughlin also said that ICE \u201chas worked diligently to obtain greater necessary detention space while avoiding overcrowding,\u201d adding that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem \u201chas called on states and local government to help with bed and detention space capacity.\u201d",
      "Concerns rise as detainee population rises",
      "Janeisy Fern\u00e1ndez D\u00edaz, the mother of Michael Borrego Fern\u00e1ndez, a Cuban national being held in Alligator Alcatraz, called for the facility's closure Tuesday.",
      "\u201cI want this place to close,\u201d she said on behalf of her son, who is one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed last week by the American Civil Liberties Union against the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "In the complaint, four people being held in Alligator Alcatraz and their attorneys allege that the federal government has interfered with their ability to access detainees and provide them counsel, as well as \u201charsh and inhumane conditions\u201d at the facility.",
      "Borrego Fern\u00e1ndez reported that people held in Alligator Alcatraz \u201care only allowed one meal a day (and given only minutes to eat), are not permitted daily showers, and are otherwise kept around the clock in a cage inside a tent,\u201d the complaint states. He also reported instances of physical assaults and excessive use of force by guards, along with a lack of medical care and attention.",
      "According to Thomas Kennedy, a spokesperson for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, Borrego Fern\u00e1ndez has spent more than 17 days at the facility, raising questions over the facility's operating standards.",
      "Alligator Alcatraz is not a traditional detention facility since it's operated and financed by the state of Florida to enforce federal immigration laws.",
      "NBC News has a pending information request to Florida officials, asking for a list of detainees and a copy of the standards outlining detention rules at the facility.",
      "During Tuesday's news conference, immigration advocates made it a point to reject the Alligator Alcatraz name, which began as a political moniker invented and adopted by Republican leaders and is now the facility's official name.",
      "It is not the only immigration facility in Florida facing allegations.",
      "Based on interviews with 11 current and former detainees at Krome North Service Processing Center, the Broward Transitional Center and the Federal Detention Center between January and June, as well as data analysis and conversations with 14 immigration lawyers, Human Rights Watch concluded in its report that people at these facilities were subjected to \"dangerously substandard medical care, overcrowding, abusive treatment, and restrictions on access to legal and psychosocial support.\"",
      "The report also found that detainees were forced to sleep on cold, concrete floors without bedding and were given \"substandard\" food."

      "Similar to baking soda, apple cider vinegar has multiple uses outside of cooking, including getting rid of fruit flies. In the summer, I always add apple cider vinegar (not white distilled vinegar), such as this one from Lucy\u2019s, to a small bowl or condiment dish, cover it tightly with plastic wrap and poke small holes on the top with a toothpick. The smell of the apple cider vinegar acts like a magnet for flies. Additionally, Delah Gomasi, managing director and CEO of cleaning services company MaidForYou, highly recommends using both apple cider vinegar and a bit of dish soap for getting rid of fruit flies. \u201cThe main reason a mixture of apple cider vinegar and dish soap works so well in eradicating fruit flies is because the apple cider vinegar attracts the fruit flies whilst the dish soap traps them in the mixture,\u201d he says.",

      "What attracts flies in the home?",
      "There are a few common causes for flies around the home, according to our experts. While there are a few different types of flies, in addition to other flying insects that are often confused for one another, like mosquitoes and gnats, many of them are typically caused by the following factors:",
      "Fruit and sugar: Both fruit flies and house flies, which are categorized as \u201cfilth flies,\u201d are extremely attracted to the smell of fruit, according to Bloom.  \u201cIn the home, they are typically introduced as eggs on fruit and produce which then emerge once fermentation starts,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can see this relationship if you look at fruit stands.\u201d This problem arises when the fruit is left out, unwashed, overripe and/or rotting in a trash, fridge or cabinet or on a countertop. Additionally, fruit flies gravitate toward sugar substances like soda, fruit juice and candy.",
      "Fermentation: Similarly, fruit flies are often attracted to the smell of fermented foods and drinks, such as beer, wine, kombucha, yogurt, cheese and bread. While you keep these items in the fridge, things like small spills or crumbs left on the counter can attract flies. Plus, when you throw these items out, they can still attract flies due to residual matter. This is why Bloom recommends regularly rinsing out containers, cans and bottles before throwing them out to prevent flies.",
      "Decaying matter and filth: Other types of filth flies, such as the house fly, may gravitate towards fruit, but they\u2019re also attracted to dirtier materials, according to Bloom. This includes leaking drains, dirty mops, compost and pet litter.  This could also include bits of food sitting in your garbage disposal.",
      "Windows and weather: Lastly, leaving windows and doors open, even for a few seconds, gives flies the easiest entry into your home. That said, you may also notice an increase in flying insects like flies, fruit flies, mosquitoes and fungus gnats during late spring and throughout summer, according to Williams. \u201cFlies and fruit flies have more access to food sources in the warmer months, as they\u2019re attracted to rotting produce that is more abundant this time of year,\u201d he says. In other words, a more humid environment makes it easier for flies to survive and reproduce.",

      "How we tested the best mineral sunscreens for dark skin",
      "Our NBC Select staff tested over 100 sunscreens for six weeks to find the very best formulas for summer (and beyond). While testing, we tried dozens of mineral sunscreens and of those, we found some brown skin-friendly formulas for different skin types and activities. We tested on a range of brown skin tones and skin types, including dry, oily, sensitive and acne-prone skin, and wore the sunscreens to work, to the gym, outdoors, and more. Here is some of the key criteria we kept in mind while testing:",

If so, how long does it take to absorb/fade? Does it reappear when sweating? Usage: How often did you use the sunscreen? What did you do while wearing it?

It\u2019s formulated to work with all skin types, hydrates the skin\u2019s moisture barrier with prebiotics, and evens skin tone with vitamin C, according to the brand. It has a creamy texture that feels more like a primer than sunscreen, and a light, orange-ish tint. Although I can\u2019t speak to exactly how universal the tint is, the sunscreen absorbs within minutes and gives me zero white cast while blending really well into my skin. I also love how well it holds up on my oilier skin \u2014 even on my shiniest days, the most I\u2019ll get is a soft glow as my oil starts to break through after a few hours of wear.

It has a very fluid, lightweight texture that sits on your skin without feeling too heavy, and is gentle enough to use on sensitive skin.

      "Lastly, to avoid a white cast, look for lightweight, sheerer formulas that are more likely to seamlessly absorb into your skin (and always check reviews).",
      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Mineral sunscreens typically leave a white cast because of key active ingredients zinc oxide and titanium oxide, which tend to reflect light in a way that leads to a white-ish finish, especially on darker skin. The ingredients themselves are also naturally white, which is why many mineral options come in tinted versions to help counteract the ingredients\u2019 powdery coloring.",
      "Mineral sunscreens are sometimes referred to as physical sunscreens, because they sit on the skin and shield it physically from UV rays, according to board-certified dermatologist Dr. Hadley King. Chemical sunscreens, on the other hand, penetrate the skin, rather than sitting on top of it, to absorb UV rays like a sponge.",
      "In a word \u2014 yes. There\u2019s a huge misconception that those with darker skin don\u2019t need sunscreen, which is largely due in part to inaccuracies about the protection that melanin provides. Though melanin, which is the pigment that determines your skin color, naturally provides sun protection, it\u2019s very minimal \u2014 meaning that regardless of skin color, you absolutely still need to use sunscreen.",
      "Dermatologists and estheticians have told us multiple times that sunscreen should be reapplied every two hours, no matter your skin tone. If you\u2019re using a water- or sweat-proof formula, check the suggested reapplication times, which tend to last a bit under two hours in the 40-80 minute range.",
      "Why trust NBC Select?",
      "I\u2019m an associate SEO reporter for NBC Select, covering skin care and wellness topics like sunscreens for dark skin and acne spot treatments. For this piece, myself and the NBC select staff tested dozens of mineral sunscreens to find the formulas that work best for dark skin.",

      "How to shop for plastic food container alternatives",
      "Many plastic food container sets have chemical additives (many of which companies aren\u2019t required to disclose) with adverse health effects. This includes BPA, phthalates and PFAS \u2014 and those are only the handful of ones researchers know about, according to Woodruff. The easiest way to avoid leaching consequences is to simply avoid plastic food containers altogether. Here\u2019s how to find the best plastic-free container:",
      "Glass is arguably the best material to look for as an eco-friendly alternative to plastic food containers, according to experts. To a lesser extent, stainless steel containers can also be a reliable option. Glass allows for versatility since it\u2019s usually oven-, microwave- and dishwasher-safe, and isn\u2019t susceptible to leaching like plastic. Stainless steel doesn\u2019t always have these features, though it isn\u2019t susceptible to breaking or cracking and it often allows food to stay warm for longer. Also, many glass food storage containers have plastic lids, even if they\u2019re free of BPA, PFAS and other chemicals.",
      "If you plan on only using storage containers to prepare food \u2014 whether it be on the stove or in the oven \u2014 and then transfer food to them, then they don\u2019t need to be oven- or microwave-safe. If you don\u2019t want to have to dirty more dishes or transfer the food to a plate for reheating, then you should make sure that whatever you buy is microwave or oven safe. If you\u2019re someone who likes to meal prep and then freeze food, be sure to purchase something that\u2019s freezer compatible.",
      "In addition to buying new containers, Woodruff also recommends reusing store-bought glass containers, like those for condiments or sauces, to store food (not necessarily heat it), similar to how you would a mason jar. Doing this can help you save money and it reduces your single-use plastic consumption.",
      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Leaching is what happens when molecular particles and chemicals in microplastics, like BPA and PFAS, slough off from plastic (in this case, food containers) and get into food, according to Woodruff. While this happens at any temperature, leaching is much more probable when you heat the plastic material, according to Woodruff. This is because heat agitates the molecules in the plastic, making them more susceptible to breaking apart. Additionally, some chemicals, such as BPA, leach more when you prepare acidic foods, such as tomato-based sauces, in them.",
      "Many people and organizations call PFAS \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because of how long they take to degrade and break down in the environment, according to The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Since these chemicals last so long they eventually make their way into food, water and animals, according to the EPA. From there, they can lead to health complications in humans, like infertility and cancer, according to Woodruff.",

      "Actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, best known for his role as Theodore \u201cTheo\u201d Huxtable on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d died Sunday at age 54 in an accidental drowning in Costa Rica.",
      "Warner starred on the groundbreaking sitcom for the entirety of its eight-season run 1984 to 1992, becoming a defining television presence for millions of viewers.",
      "The actor went on to build a multifaceted career in television, film, music, poetry and podcasting that spanned four decades.",
      "Following the news of his death, TODAY.com is revisiting Warner\u2019s most recent appearance on TODAY.",
      "See Malcolm-Jamal Warner's final TODAY appearance below.",
      "Last June, Warner stopped by the 3rd Hour of TODAY to talk about his new newly launched podcast, \"Not All Hood,\" as well as his extensive career in entertainment and the cultural significance of the series that made him famous.",
      "In the interview, Warner displayed the same thoughtful perspective that had guided his career decisions from adolescence.",
      "Sharing a laugh with longtime TODAY anchor Al Roker, Warner joked that he felt like he\u2019d \u201cspent so much of life in this building\u201d at 30 Rock, adding \u201cwe grew up together\u201d in reference to Roker. The weatherman quipped back that he was \u201cmore like his dad.\u201d",
      "The conversation revealed Warner\u2019s continued evolution as an artist and communicator. He spoke passionately about his podcast \u201cNot All Hood,\u201d or \u201cNAH\u201d for short, describing it as his most vulnerable creative endeavor yet.",
      "Warner co-hosted the show with his friends Candace O. Kelley and Weusi Baraka. Its intent, he said in a clip from the podcast, was to \"acknowledge and talk about the different facets\" of the Black community.",
      "\u201cWe have curated a safe space for the three of us to really talk and be honest about the things we feel,\u201d Warner explained on TODAY.",
      "\u201cThere are times where I know there are things that I say that won\u2019t necessarily jive with a lot of people, but this is a place where we want to discuss all lanes of the Black community, and all of those lanes don\u2019t necessarily agree all the time but this is a place where we can have civil discourse and respectful challenging,\u201d he continued.",
      "Warner shared that his perspective on representation was shaped by his early experience on \u201cThe Cosby Show.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy history, the way I came into this business, was a show that had such an impact on culture, everything. White America, Black America, America. And just as that show and that family can not represent all of Black people \u2026 there\u2019s so many of those lanes that coexist and even within those different lanes of the Black community, we can acknowledge each other and even if we don\u2019t agree we can still acknowledge, respectfully, that we are all part of the Black community,\u201d he said.",
      "In addition to his cultural work, Warner remained an actor. He starred in nearly the entirety of \"The Resident\" as surgeon AJ Austin and recently made appearances in \"Grown-ish\" and \"9-1-1.\"",
      "Warner traced his career longevity back to early guidance from his mother, who provided crucial perspective when \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d became a cultural phenomenon.",
      "\u201cWhen 'Cosby' first hit I was 14 years old ... and my mom says to me, \u2018Listen, baby, it\u2019s great this show is the phenomenon that it is, but you know how this business is. This show could be over next year. What are you going to do when the show\u2019s over?\u2019\u201d he recalled.",
      "\"I had a really wonderful journey. And a lot of that had to do with my mom and my dad as well.\"",
      "Malcolm-Jamal Warner",
      "\u201cSo it\u2019s always had me thinking about longevity and knowing that being seen as a child star and being taken seriously as an adult actor may not be a smooth transition.\u201d",
      "That forward-thinking approach served him well, he said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got my head on straight, my soul and dignity is intact. I had a really wonderful journey. And a lot of that had to do with my mom and my dad as well,\u201d Warner reflected.",
      "As the interview wrapped, Warner was asked if he had any words of wisdom to share. He offered these words: \u201cVulnerability can be a scary thing, even when we\u2019re on the mend. Black boys boast bravado not to seem broken, and often so do Black men.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump said Tuesday on Truth Social that his administration had reached a deal with Japan, one of the largest U.S. trading partners, to lower its tariff rate to 15% as part of a sweeping trade agreement.",
      "That rate is lower than the 24% that Trump threatened Japan with on April 2 and the 25% he said he would hit Japanese imports with in a letter on July 7. Before Trump\u2019s current term, the effective U.S. tariff rate on Japanese imports was less than 2%, according to World Bank data.",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba confirmed the agreement, saying the 15% rate was the lowest so far among countries that sell more goods to the United States than they buy from it.",
      "\u201cWe have exerted all our efforts to protect our national interests,\u201d he told reporters in Tokyo on Wednesday. \u201cAmong the countries that have a trade surplus with the United States, we have achieved the greatest results.\u201d",
      "Aug. 1 is the latest deadline Trump has imposed on countries to make deals to avoid tariff rates that Trump himself had set in dozens of letters he fired off on social media. Even though that deadline had been delayed before, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday on Fox Business Network that it was a \u201cpretty hard deadline.\u201d",
      "Since Trump\u2019s so-called Liberation Day on April 2, the administration has yet to strike any formal trade deals, instead signing a handful of framework deals that can be turned into fully fledged deals later.",
      "Japan has been furiously trying to avoid as much of a hit from Trump\u2019s global tariffs as possible. Japan\u2019s lead trade negotiator has visited the United States at least eight times, most recently Monday, when he met with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick for more than two hours.",
      "As part of the agreement, Trump said Japan would \u201cinvest, at my direction, $550 Billion Dollars into the United States, which will receive 90% of the Profits.\u201d It was unclear how such an investment would work.",
      "Japan is already the biggest foreign investor in the United States, directly investing $754.1 billion last year according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.",
      "Trump touted the announcement at an event with congressional Republicans later Tuesday, saying the tariffs \u201ckicked in better than anybody other than me and a few of the people in the room thought could happen.\u201d",
      "He added that Japan would form a joint venture with the United States related to liquefied natural gas in Alaska.",
      "Japan was the fifth-biggest source of U.S. imports last year, with American consumers and companies buying nearly $150 billion of goods from the country, according to Commerce Department data.",
      "The talks came at a tough time politically for Ishiba, whose Liberal Democratic Party recently lost both houses of parliament. Ishiba pledged to stay on as leader, in part to address economic headwinds.",
      "Trump had recently downplayed the chances of an agreement with Japan.",
      "\u201cThe Japanese are tough, but ultimately you have to understand we\u2019re just going to send a letter saying, \u2018This is what you\u2019re going to pay, otherwise you don\u2019t have to do business with us.\u2019 But there\u2019s a chance,\u201d he said June 16.",
      "In May, Trump approved a long-delayed takeover of U.S. Steel by Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel. As part of the deal, Nippon agreed to create at least 70,000 jobs through a $14 billion investment, according to both companies and the White House. The companies later upped that to 100,000 jobs but clarified that the additions included \u201cdirect, indirect, and induced jobs.\u201d"

      "SREBRENICA, Bosnia \u2014 Nedzad Avdic stood on a gravel plateau with four men and boys with their hands tied behind their backs, preparing for death. Just 17, Avdic had been captured by Bosnian Serb forces days earlier. Now, he stood yards from an execution squad.",
      "Avdic said he heard shots, felt sharp pain in his right side and right arm and blacked out. When he woke up, more prisoners were being lined up for execution. When the small truck that brought him to the site drove away, Avdic and another wounded man escaped in the darkness. After walking through the woods for days, they crossed into Muslim-controlled central Bosnia.",
      "Last week, Avdic recounted his experience to members of the German parliament at an event in Berlin marking the 30th anniversary of the fall of the United Nations-protected \u201csafe area\u201d of Srebrenica. Two international courts have ruled that Bosnian Serbs\u2019 systematic killing of male Bosnian Muslim prisoners \u2014 at least 7,000 in total \u2014 was the first genocide in Europe since World War II.",
      "The following day, members of the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD party, argued in parliament that the mass killings did not constitute genocide. \u201cThe Serbs shot men there, but generally spared women and children,\u201d Alexander Wolf said in a speech.",
      "A second AfD member, Martin Sichert, invoked a conspiracy theory, warning that Muslims were waging a \u201cbirth jihad\u201d in Germany, a reference to Muslim immigrants someday outnumbering Germans. \u201cSrebrenica reminds us to end multiculturalism before it\u2019s too late,\u201d Sichert warned.",
      "As disinformation spreads online, denialism about war crimes \u2014 both past and ongoing \u2014 is growing increasingly common worldwide, experts warn. From current conflicts in Ukraine, Israel and Gaza to past atrocities in Syria, Bosnia and Rwanda, as well as the Holocaust, basic facts are now disputed or dismissed.",
      "Denialism is proving politically profitable, as well. In February, the AfD won the second-most seats in Germany\u2019s parliament, the best showing by a far-right party since World War II. In Bosnia, a local Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, has gained support by spreading conspiracy theories about Srebrenica, calling it \u201can arranged tragedy.\u201d He dismisses the identification of 6,981 victims \u2014 part of the largest DNA identification project in history\u2014 as a hoax.",
      "Dodik's office did not respond to a request for comment. After this article was published, Sichert said in an email that he believes it's critical to investigate the causes of massacres \"because this way the death of the people at least has a little meaning.\"",
      "He went on to ask why is Srebenica recognized as a genocide but not Hiroshima. \"Because victors write history,\" Sichert said. \"Every civilian casualty should be considered equally no matter who won the war.\"",
      "Wolf, in a separate email, said that \"commemoration should not be one-sided\" and cited the killings of Serbs in the village of Kravica by Bosnian Muslim forces from Srebrenica during the war.",
      "But war crimes prosecutors and journalists found that of forty-five Serbs who died in Kravica, thirty-five were soldiers, including five who were killed after being taken prisoner. The number of Bosnian Muslims killed by Serb forces after being taken prisoner is in the thousands.",
      "Growing Denialism",
      "At a conference in Srebrenica marking the 30th anniversary of the mass killings here, the heads of the Kigali Genocide Memorial in Rwanda and the Auschwitz-Birkenau and Stutthof concentration camp museums in Poland warned that spreading lies online about war crimes has also become financially profitable.",
      "War crimes denialism generates so much traffic online that making money \u2014 not political or ideological gain \u2014 appears to motivate some of its purveyors.",
      "At one point, the directors discussed whether better influencers might help, and several of them agreed that they could.",
      "Avdic is determined to be one of them. As denialism spreads, he is more determined than ever to use what is left of his life to speak for the men and boys who died beside him on that gravel 30 years ago.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s becoming more aggressive day by day,\u201d he said, referring to denialism. \u201cYou have to know that we are all foreign bodies on this Earth, and we will all evaporate naturally sooner or later.\u201d",
      "A U.N.-protected \u2018safe area\u2019",
      "I first met Avdic 30 years ago covering the war in Bosnia as a reporter for The Christian Science Monitor. After the fall of Srebrenica, rumors spread that Bosnian Muslim men were describing mass executions. Avdic, then a shell-shocked teenager whose father was later found in a mass grave, was one of nine men who told me they had survived mass executions. When I later visited the gravel plateau beside an earthen dam in the village of Petkovci, I found two human femurs.",
      "Avdic and his father were among the roughly 10,000 Bosnian Muslim men who fled Srebrenica on foot when Bosnian Serb forces attacked in July 1995. The surrounded town had been declared an internationally protected \u201csafe area,\u201d but the United States, Europe and 600 Dutch U.N. peacekeepers did little to protect it",
      "Women, children and elderly men took refuge at a large battery factory that Dutch peacekeepers had turned into their main base. And men, most of them unarmed, set off through the woods on a 60-mile trek to Muslim-controlled central Bosnia.",
      "When Serb forces attacked the column, Avdic and his father were separated in the chaos. \u201cI lost him,\u201d Avdic recalled. \u201cI lost him immediately.\u201d He continued walking with strangers but was eventually captured. Two days later, he and other men were taken to the gravel plateau, and the executions began.",
      "Needing to speak",
      "For the next 12 years, Avdic testified at war crimes trials about the executions under a pseudonym and lived far from Srebrenica, fearing for his safety. In 2007, he returned to Srebrenica, his hometown. He and other Bosnian Muslims felt a duty to return to the area and preserve its Muslim community. Avdic, who had grown up in a village outside the town and also lost four uncles and three cousins in the killings, found being in Srebrenica comforting.",
      "\u201cI have less nightmares,\u201d he said, shrugging his shoulders. \u201cI cannot explain it.\u201d",
      "In 2014, when he visited the execution site during an event with mothers of the victims, he was filled with a desire to speak publicly about the mass killing he survived.",
      "\u201cWhen I came to the place, something forced me to say something; I felt a strong need to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cWords started to flow, something stronger than me.\u201d",
      "He met his wife, Elvisa, a Bosnian Muslim survivor whose uncle and cousin also died in the executions, in Srebrenica in 2008. The following year, they married. Now, Nedzad works as a manager at a company in Srebrenica that produces parts for luxury car interiors. Elvisa works at a local meteorological station. They have three daughters who attend local school alongside Serb children. Serbs and Muslims coexist but generally don\u2019t discuss the war.",
      "\u201cHatred destroys, first of all, those who hate,\u201d Avdic said.",
      "In recent years, Avdic has given dozens of speeches about the massacres in multiple countries and called for the protection of civilians in Ukraine and Syria. Speaking about Srebrenica is difficult but cathartic. \u201cIt was my choice to go to Berlin,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not something that I wish. It is emotional, and it is difficult for me.\u201d",
      "Local Bosnian Muslims have transformed the cavernous former car battery factory that Dutch U.N. peacekeepers used as a base into a museum documenting the genocide. Across the street, the headstones of the thousands of Muslim men and boys killed in the massacres cover a lush green field and hillside.",
      "In recent years, though, Muslims have slowly left Srebrenica, many of them citing economic and safety concerns. Once a majority-Muslim town, Srebrenica is now roughly half-Serb, half-Muslim.",
      "Elvisa, Avdic\u2019s wife, said she worries about her children\u2019s future.",
      "\u201cI was 13 years old then in 1995. My daughter is now 13 years old,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m more emotional about that time. When we are older, we care more and we feel more.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur grandmother was killed,\u201d she added. \u201cThey cut her throat.\u201d",
      "Defiance and threats",
      "Avdic said provocations still happen, including when a local priest once played Serb nationalist songs to taunt Muslim residents.",
      "\u201cHe will die with his evil,\u201d Avdic said of the priest.",
      "As denialism spreads, Serb nationalists have grown more defiant. In nearby towns, Avdic is sometimes recognized and mocked by them.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of them,\u201d he said, though he acknowledged the danger. \u201cYou never know what could happen, because I\u2019m a witness.\u201d",
      "Avdic and his wife are torn. Leaving Srebrenica might be better for their children, but Avdic believes it is his duty to raise his family here and speak for the men and boys who died beside him.",
      "\u201cI will die proud,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I believe my children will be proud they were born here.\u201d"

    "summary": "A judgment by the U.K.\u2019s Supreme Court that said the legal definition of \u201cwoman\u201d is based on biological sex came a blow to campaigners for trans rights.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Soccer fans know it as \u201challowed ground,\u201d so when Billie Sky Walker walked onto the field at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium two years ago, she achieved a dream held by players around the world.",
      "Before a Community Shield men\u2019s match between Manchester City and Arsenal in August 2023, she proudly donned an official shirt as a representative of the Football Association, the regulatory body for soccer in England, that read, \u201cThe FA is for all.\u201d",
      "Today, the 28-year-old is barred from playing in FA-organized tournaments following a landmark judgment by Britain\u2019s Supreme Court in April that said the legal definition of \u201cwoman\u201d is based on biological sex \u2014 a huge blow to campaigners for transgender rights that could have far-reaching implications for a wide range of life in the U.K., be it admission to changing rooms or decisions on hospital beds, equal pay claims and domestic violence shelters.",
      "After the judgment, a number of sporting governing bodies, including the FA, changed their rules so that only those born biologically female are allowed to play, excluding Walker and 28 other transgender players across England from the association. The Scottish Football Association followed suit, and Northern Ireland\u2019s Irish Football Association appears likely to do the same.",
      "Describing the ruling as \u201cconfusing and upsetting,\u201d Walker said she had been welcomed \u201cinto this space\u201d by her cisgender peers, or women whose gender matches the sex they were assigned at birth.",
      "Calling the decision to bar Walker \u201cheartbreaking,\u201d her former teammate Lucy Leiter, 24, said it was not the case that \u201conly trans women think they should play,\u201d adding, \u201cThe support has been unequivocal from everyone I\u2019ve ever played with.\u201d",
      "Walker, who said she felt that she was a girl from the age of 5 and transitioned at the age of 24, said that playing soccer on a women\u2019s team \u201creally established a huge essence of who I am, because it gave me the safety and comfort and knowledge that I\u2019m enough.\u201d",
      "Intense debate",
      "The Supreme Court ruling came amid intense and sometimes toxic public debate in the U.K. over the intersection of transgender and women\u2019s rights. The debate has also simmered in the U.S., where President Donald Trump has made it one of his signature issues by signing an executive order in February banning trans women from women\u2019s sports at the national level.",
      "In December 2022, Scottish lawmakers approved a bill that allowed anyone over the age of 16 to change their gender identity using gender certificates, removing the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria, the medical term for the distress that results from the conflict between someone\u2019s gender identity and sex assigned at birth.",
      "The campaign group For Women Scotland later brought a legal case against the semiautonomous government, arguing that sex-based protections should apply only to people who were born female.",
      "And Britain\u2019s central government blocked the law the following year, invoking for the first time a section of the 25-year-old act that gave the Scottish Parliament control over most of its own affairs.",
      "The For Women Scotland case nonetheless worked its way through the court system, reaching the Supreme Court this spring.",
      "After the court\u2019s 12 justices ruled unanimously in the group\u2019s favor, the presiding judge, Lord Hodge, said the decision should not be seen as \u201ca triumph of one side over the other,\u201d and emphasized that transgender people remain protected under the law.",
      "For Women Scotland campaigners celebrated the verdict with hugs, tears of happiness and Champagne as they left the courtroom.",
      "\u201cThere was elation and disbelief and, yes, I was absolutely thrilled,\u201d Susan Smith, one of the group\u2019s co-founders, told NBC News in a telephone interview last month. \u201cIf people were entitled to say that their sex in law had changed, you can\u2019t control who applies for that.\u201d",
      "For Smith and her group, the issue of legal gender recognition touches on who gets to make decisions about women\u2019s lives and bodies, including their access to spaces from hospital wards to rape crisis centers and prisons."

      "A podcast popular among young men shocked the internet this week with an unexpected interview guest: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "But Netanyahu\u2019s bid to appeal to young people appeared to backfire online, where the interview drew widespread criticism from viewers across the political spectrum.",
      "His interviewers, Kyle Forgeard and Aaron \u201cSteiny\u201d Steinberg, are members of the Nelk Boys, a group of social media influencers known for their vlogs and prank videos. The group, which has amassed more than 8.5 million subscribers on YouTube, attracted even more fans after its content began to highlight more conservative political figures, including President Donald Trump, whom the podcast interviewed in 2022, 2023 and 2024.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s hourlong interview, which dropped on the Nelk Boys\u2019 \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d on Monday, was met with overwhelmingly critical reception online, with viewers accusing the podcasters of asking softball questions and neglecting to push back against Netanyahu\u2019s claims.",
      "Netanyahu and his government continue to face worldwide outrage over the war in Gaza that followed the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "The podcast\u2019s YouTube channel lost more than 10,000 subscribers within a day, according to the social media tracking platform Social Blade. On YouTube, top comments on the episode were critical of the hosts\u2019 apparent lack of preparedness.",
      "\u201cI see so much stuff about what\u2019s going on in Israel and Iran and Palestine, and to be honest, I just really don\u2019t know what is going on there,\u201d Forgeard said in the episode. Steinberg said he was similarly hoping to \u201cget educated\u201d by interviewing Netanyahu.",
      "At one point, the topic of discussion turned to Netanyahu\u2019s and Trump\u2019s shared affection for hamburgers. Asked about his go-to McDonald\u2019s order, Netanyahu revealed that he prefers Burger King, leading Steinberg to respond, appalled: \u201cThat\u2019s your worst take, I think.\u201d",
      "Throughout the rest of the interview, Netanyahu condemned anti-Israel protesters as \u201cun-American\u201d and contrasted life in Israel with life under the oppressive regime in Iran. He also railed against New York\u2019s Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, calling his proposals for the city \u201cnonsense.\u201d (Mamdani has called Israel\u2019s military actions in Gaza \u201cgenocide\u201d and has said he would arrest Netanyahu, who is the subject of a warrant for his arrest from the International Criminal Court, if he visited New York City.)",
      "Asked why he\u2019s \u201cso hated worldwide,\u201d Netanyahu answered: \u201cWell, a lot of propaganda. First of all, I\u2019m not hated worldwide.\u201d He said Israel has received a lot of goodwill from many in Europe, claiming that Israel\u2019s attack on Iran also \u201cliberated them, because those Iranian missiles were geared at Europe, too, and ultimately at America.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe propaganda is there, I don\u2019t deny it,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cBut people also have, you know, sometimes the truth beckons. And what Israel did with President Trump is safeguard free societies from a menace. I mean, this Iranian regime hangs gays from cranes.\u201d",
      "On Monday, 25 countries, including Britain, Japan and many European nations, called on Israel to end the war in Gaza \u2014 a sign of Israel\u2019s traditional allies\u2019 dismay over the conflict\u2019s humanitarian toll. Close to 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023, according to Palestinian health authorities, with much of the enclave\u2019s population driven from their homes and pushed to the edge of starvation.",
      "The Israeli military and government officials have repeatedly accused Hamas of exploiting civilian sites, including hospitals and schools, as cover for its operations, an accusation that health officials and Hamas have denied.",
      "Israel has also faced mounting accusations of war crimes and genocide, including in a case brought by South Africa before the International Court of Justice, the United Nations\u2019 top court. The court last year ordered Israel to do everything it could to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza. Both Israel and the United States have rejected accusations of genocide.",
      "Online, clips of Netanyahu\u2019s interview drew viral backlash from viewers, many of whom accused the Nelk Boys of platforming \u201cgenocide propaganda\u201d and compared interviewing Netanyahu to interviewing Adolf Hitler.",
      "Far-left political streamer Hasan Piker and far-right white supremacist Nick Fuentes were among those who criticized the latest \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d episode Monday during separate livestreams on their platforms.",
      "\u201cYou just basically presented someone who is a war criminal, someone who is doing a genocide, in a somewhat neutral light,\u201d Piker told Forgeard and Steinberg in his stream. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t be neutral when you have someone like Benjamin Netanyahu directly in an opportunity to talk to him. But that\u2019s what happened, so there is moral culpability here for you guys individually.\u201d",
      "He added that while he would agree to interview Netanyahu if he were given the opportunity, he would be \u201cwell-equipped\u201d to fact-check his statements and push back against potentially dubious claims.",
      "Forgeard, in response, countered that their style of interviewing could \"give us the opportunity to get the biggest people in the world.\"",
      "\"And I think you\u2019ll know by the 'Full Send Podcast' when you watch it, it\u2019s like, 'Hey, these guys are going to get big guests. We might not necessarily get these guys grilling these people,'\" Forgeard said. \"And that\u2019s just what you\u2019re going to come to expect.\"",
      "Fuentes, in his own stream with Forgeard and Steinberg, also questioned the moral equivalency between himself, who has faced condemnation online for his views and beliefs, and \u201ca foreign head of state who is killing women and children.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is somebody who\u2019s in the process of committing what is effectively an ethnic cleansing and a genocide,\u201d Fuentes said.",
      "The interview struggled to land positively even among some supporters of Netanyahu\u2019s military agenda. In The Times of Israel on Tuesday, contributor Elkana Bar Eitan expressed his disappointment that Netanyahu \u201cblew it\u201d on the podcast, despite the lack of pushback he got from the hosts.",
      "\u201cIt was painful to witness how Netanyahu, once a master communicator, missed this opportunity and showed that he\u2019s lost his touch, even in English,\u201d he wrote in an opinion piece. \u201cDespite the friendly atmosphere and softball questions, Netanyahu came across as completely detached from reality.\u201d",
      "A representative for the \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d declined to comment.",
      "In a video responding to the backlash, Steinberg and Forgeard said they plan to \u201cgive the other side the opportunity\u201d to speak on their next episode, though it\u2019s unclear what guest they\u2019re referring to.",
      "\u201cSomeone has to do it,\u201d Forgeard said. \u201cAnd if we have to take the fall and be the bad guys for having the controversial people on, I think we\u2019re willing to do it.\u201d"

      "Despite all his years of experience and technical training, the doctor\u2019s voice trembled when he recalled how organized crime groups have taken control of emergency rooms and medical facilities in some parts of Mexico.",
      "\u201cThey force us to come in through threatening phone calls, in the early hours of the morning, and they tell us: \u2018We\u2019re just a few meters from where you live, and you\u2019re with your family. If you don\u2019t treat this person, we\u2019re going to pick you up right here,\u2019\u201d said the doctor, who works at a health center in Guanajuato, in central Mexico, and who requested complete anonymity for fear of reprisal.",
      "In many regions of Mexico, organized crime attacks have affected hospitals, even taking over operating rooms and emergency rooms, where hitmen kidnap medical personnel to force them to treat the wounded in the frequent clashes they wage with other cartels.",
      "The doctor interviewed by Noticias Telemundo in Guanajuato claimed that, on one occasion, he was contacted in the early hours by a high-ranking local drug operative, who made an unusual request.",
      "\u201cI received a call requesting treatment for a person who had been shot by a firearm. And they arrived at the main entrances of the hospitals with long guns, demanding treatment for their patient,\u201d the doctor said. On several occasions, the doctor said, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel forced him to use his equipment to treat hitmen.",
      "Noticias Telemundo confirmed that both the local boss and the hitman whose life was saved later died in a confrontation with the Mexican army. For the safety of the doctor interviewed in Guanajuato, their names are being withheld.",
      "According to the United Nations International Narcotics Control Board, cartels and criminal groups continue to contribute to the high levels of violence in Mexico.",
      "\u201cOrganized crime continues to be a key player in the lives of Mexicans. This is evident because some criminal groups have managed to force the Mexican state to lose control of certain territories, and because of the corruption and impunity that allow them to continue to reign and expand their capabilities,\u201d Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, co-director of the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center at George Mason University, said in an interview with Noticias Telemundo.",
      "So far, official data shows that from September 2024 to April 2025, there was a 32.9% decrease in the daily average of intentional homicide victims, falling from 86.9 victims per day to 58.3.",
      "However, disappearances increased significantly: In the first 100 days of Claudia Sheinbaum\u2019s administration, 4,010 disappearances were recorded, an average of 40 per day, compared with the figure of 25 recorded during the previous six-year term.",
      "\u201cThere are many missing people who, in reality, have already been kidnapped by drug traffickers and buried in so-called narco-graves,\u201d said David Saucedo, a security analyst based in Mexico City. \u201cThe cartels are hiding the bodies, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing a reduction in homicides in several states across the country. But it\u2019s not that there are fewer deaths; there are fewer bodies. They\u2019re hiding the bodies,\u201d Saucedo asserted.",
      "'This shouldn't be normal'",
      "According to the latest report from the Mexican government, Guanajuato is the state with the most (980 from January to April 2025). In February 2025, the daily average reached 12.5. Last year, the National Survey of Victimization and Perception of Public Safety revealed that 87.5% of the population considered public safety to be the state\u2019s most serious problem.",
      "\u201cIn Guanajuato, the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel is fighting over drug trafficking with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, and that\u2019s generating a lot of violence,\u201d Correa-Cabrera explained. \u201cThese organized crime groups are fighting for control of spaces because they need more street space, there are more feuds, and that\u2019s leading to more injuries and deaths, so they\u2019re taking control of medical centers.\u201d",
      "Noticias Telemundo visited Guanajuato to document the case of a health center in the city of Celaya, where wounded drug traffickers were treated. According to a state intelligence report, until three years ago, the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel used the San Ferm\u00edn Clinic to treat its wounded hitmen. However, in November 2022, gunmen from the Jalisco New Generation Cartel killed two men there and set fire to the now-abandoned facility.",
      "\u201cThe hospital where I work in Guanajuato isn\u2019t the only one that\u2019s suffered this, nor am I the only doctor who\u2019s experienced this. We see in the news that these people are arriving at certain public hospitals,\u201d the Guanajuato doctor said, adding that \u201cI can say that more colleagues have experienced this. One lives with anxiety, and this shouldn\u2019t be normal for us.\u201d",
      "Due to the strong presence of criminal groups, the Guanajuato state police have implemented operations in clinics and hospitals in several municipalities of the state, to prevent drug cartels from continuing to infiltrate those places.",
      "\u201cWhen people injured with a firearm arrive, the prosecutor\u2019s office sends us a custody request. When these people arrive, we coordinate to provide security at the hospitals,\u201d said Bernardo Cajero, director of the Celaya police and in charge of these security operations.",
      "However, the Guanajuato doctor explained that although the Silver Code has been established in Mexico \u2014 a protocol that requires authorities to be notified when there are episodes of violence or when a person with a gunshot wound arrives at a health center \u2014\u00a0this is not always followed.",
      "\u201cThey come and take our cellphones, cut us off from communication, and start threatening us, saying that if they see anything strange, they could hurt us themselves,\u201d the doctor said, with fear in his voice. \u201cOne of the things they\u2019re asking is that we not activate Code Silver and that we not notify the authorities.\u201d",
      "'It affects us all'",
      "Although there are no official figures on armed takeovers of health centers, the Guanajuato case is not unique in Mexico. In April 2024, a 10-person armed group entered a private medical center in Cuernavaca and shot and killed a patient in intensive care. In September, gunmen threatened staff at the Mexican Social Security Institute in Mazatl\u00e1n with the phrase \u201cIf they die, you die,\u201d forcing them to care for their wounded. Two months later, two attacks were reported at the Culiac\u00e1n General Hospital.",
      "\u201cWhat the drug cartels do is take over hospitals, kidnap nurses, doctors, specialists, blood banks, operating rooms, and whatever else they need. They are hospital centers where the wounded are seen and treated, so they can return to their criminal activities,\u201d Saucedo said.",
      "In 2022, a report by Insecurity Insight for the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition \u2014 a group of nongovernmental organizations focused on protecting health care \u2014 warned that Mexico had documented the most violent incidents against health care workers in Latin America: at that time, 14 recorded incidents, including three deaths, five kidnappings, two destroyed or damaged medical facilities and a damaged or looted  medical unit.",
      "\u201cBefore, they would leave their wounded in clinics, but then they would be finished off by rival groups,\u201d Saucedo said, \u201cnow, for added security, many drug trafficking groups are setting up private hospitals for themselves.\u201d",
      "Saucedo and other experts cited as examples of this trend the complaints about the hospital built by the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as   \u201cEl Mencho,\u201d and the mobile clinic set up by the Sinaloa Cartel\u2019s Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada.",
      "Researchers like Correa-Cabrera warn that these incidents also occur in other countries experiencing major security crises, such as Haiti, Ecuador and the Argentine city of Rosario, or in contexts of conventional warfare, such as the conflicts in Syria, Lebanon, Somalia and Libya, among others.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t something new; this is part of any armed conflict, low-intensity conflict, or war,\u201d Correa-Cabrera said, \u201cbecause health care for members of these warring groups is very important.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the Guanajuato doctor says the tension generated by these incidents, in which armed groups enter hospitals, is sometimes so great that medical staff request vacation time and psychological support.",
      "\u201cThe first thing is to save that person\u2019s life, regardless of the situation or the accusations, because they are human beings,\u201d the doctor said, \u201cbut it affects us all; it can cause trauma. In fact, there were colleagues who asked for their leave, and anyone would do that. It\u2019s normal when you live with that every day.\u201d",

      "On July 11, armed police raided the home of Vitaliy Shabunin, the co-founder of Ukraine\u2019s Anti-Corruption Action Center. He has accused President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of \u201ctaking the first, but confident steps toward corrupt authoritarianism,\u201d including backing laws offering amnesty to those accused of corruption in the defense industry, and passing over an independently selected candidate for a key anti-graft role.",
      "The move has perturbed even some of Zelenskyy\u2019s supporters \u2014 people who are simultaneously worried about the heavy-handed and potentially spurious crackdown on dissent, and that such criticisms against the Ukrainian leader might be used in bad faith by opponents in Moscow or Washington.",
      "\u201cThis is the red line which President Zelensky has crossed \u2014 and the red line is in a very wrong direction in terms of the development of Ukraine,\u201d said Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, the Kyiv-based watchdog that Shabunin co-founded. She said the State Bureau of Investigations did not have the necessary court documents for the search.",
      "Shabunin has been charged with evading military service and fraud, with prosecutors alleging that while on secondment from the front lines to continue his activism back in Kyiv, he conducted activities unrelated to his military service. His defense team and supporters say the secondment was all aboveboard and ordered by his superiors, and that the allegations are trumped up and political.",
      "The case has caused grave alarm for many inside Ukraine and abroad, with even some of those who praise Zelenskyy for making progress on corruption flagging it as cause for concern that he may be engaging in some of the same questionable practices they\u2019d hoped he was rooting out.",
      "Zelenskyy pledged to reduce corruption when he was elected in 2019, and many expert observers say he has been effective at doing so, but the tide of criticism around Shabunin\u2019s arrest comes when the president is under intense pressure to fight off Russia and keep alive support from the United States and the West that has been at risk of faltering.",
      "It\u2019s not just Shabunin\u2019s own organization that\u2019s concerned. A group of 59 nongovernmental and civil society organizations, both inside Ukraine and abroad, have signed an open letter to Zelenskyy saying the arrest \u201cbears signs of political motivation, abuse of rights\u201d and either \u201cgross incompetence\u201d or \u201ca deliberate attack to pressure\u201d Shabunin.",
      "NBC News has contacted Zelenskyy\u2019s office and the State Bureau of Investigations for comment but has not received a response.",
      "The president has been a longtime vocal advocate on the issue of fighting corruption, particularly when it comes to suggestions from the U.S. and elsewhere that the billions of dollars in military aid his country is receiving might be being misappropriated.",
      "\u201cWhere we saw risks that something could be happening with weapons, we cracked down hard,\u201d he told the \u201cLex Fridman Podcast\u201d in January.",
      "Last year Shabunin himself dismissed the idea that foreign arms could be embezzled, telling the BBC that \u201call weapons supplied by Western allies end up in the hands of Ukrainian troops who use them effectively. It is impossible to steal Western weapons.\u201d",
      "Shabunin appeared in court Tuesday and was released on \u201crecognizance\u201d \u2014 essentially released without having to post bail \u2014 until the next hearing Aug. 20.",
      "The German Marshall Fund, a Washington think tank and one of the international signatories of the letter to Zelenskyy, said Ukraine had made \u201cmonumental strides\u201d on corruption in the past 11 years.",
      "Nevertheless, \u201cit\u2019s always concerning when a government targets its vocal critics with flimsy charges in politically motivated investigations,\u201d said Josh Rudolph, managing director and senior fellow of Strategic Democracy Initiatives at the fund. \u201cAlthough this is not a sign of corruption per se, it displays an alarming disregard for the fundamental values of freedom and the rule of law at a time when the international community has been rallying around Ukraine because it is defending those very values from Russia\u2019s brutal assault.\u201d",
      "Shabunin is not the only recent arrest to cause alarm. The opposition UDAR party, headed by former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, says that a raid in April on the home of Kyiv City Council deputy Dmytro Bilotserkivets \u2014 again, they said, without the necessary documents \u2014 was a clear attempt to put pressure on political dissent.",
      "Corruption in Ukraine is a fraught and delicate topic, ripe for weaponization often in bad faith.",
      "Russia uses it as an example to support its otherwise untrue criticisms \u2014 such as Ukraine being run by neo-Nazis \u2014 while American and European politicians hold up such examples to bolster their pre-existing arguments about whether to support Kyiv\u2019s defense against Moscow.",
      "\u201cThe issue of corruption in Ukraine has long been highly politicized,\u201d said Mariya Omelicheva, a professor at the Pentagon-funded National War College in Washington, D.C.",
      "Ukrainian \u201ccorruption is almost always co-opted \u2014 either by Ukraine\u2019s supporters or, more problematically, by its adversaries,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is particularly sensitive in the current U.S. political climate, where both parties \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 have used Ukrainian corruption narratives for domestic political purposes.\u201d",
      "There is also a feeling among some Ukrainians that President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d focus has allowed officials abroad to act with greater impunity knowing Washington\u2019s hitherto exacting gaze is currently less troubled by world affairs.",
      "\u201cOur international partners, particularly the United States, don\u2019t care anymore about good governance and anti-corruption and reforms,\u201d Kaleniuk said. Washington \u201cfor the last 12 years had a powerful impact on how Ukraine develops, and the U.S. was usually tough on good governance, anti-corruption reforms and developments critical for democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now America doesn\u2019t care about that.\u201d",
      "While it\u2019s true Trump historically spoke warmly of Russian President Vladimir Putin and appeared to accept many of his war demands, in recent weeks he has been increasingly hostile to the Kremlin and signaled a renewed support for Ukraine, pledging Patriot missiles for Kyiv and tariffs on Moscow.",
      "It\u2019s also true that Ukraine \u2014 and Zelenskyy \u2014 have achieved some progress in the corruption fight in recent years. Transparency International, the best known international group that tracks this topic, says Ukraine has steadily improved in its annual \u201cCorruption Perceptions\u201d index \u2014 although it still ranks 105 of 180 countries worldwide.",
      "Nevertheless, domestically there are plenty of Ukrainians alarmed at what they see is a negative direction of travel when it comes to corruption in their country. Though the immediate fight is against Russia, the ultimate battle is for their values of liberty and democracy, supporters say, without which the battlefield struggle becomes pointless.",
      "\u201cWe are fighting for freedoms and for dignity,\u201d Kaleniuk said. If those are lost, \u201conly Russia will applaud.\u201d",
      "Alexander Smith and Freddie Clayton reported from London. Erin McLaughlin from Washington, D.C., and Anastasiia Parafeniuk and Daryna Mayer from Kyiv."

      "After her long-running talk show ended amid allegations of workplace bullying, DeGeneres, 67, bought a home in England\u2019s picturesque Cotswolds region with her wife, \u201cArrested Development\u201d star Portia de Rossi, 52.",

    "story": [
      "A genetic test may one day predict a child\u2019s risk of obesity in adulthood, paving the way for early interventions.",
      "Certain genetic variants can affect how a person\u2019s body stores fat or make them more prone to overeating. Genetic variation can also predict how well a person will respond to different weight loss drugs.",
      "In a study published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, more than 600 researchers from around the world worked together to compile genetic data from more than 5 million people \u2014 the largest and most diverse genetic dataset to date. They also used genetic data from 23andMe.",
      "From the dataset, the researchers were able to create what\u2019s known as a polygenic risk score, which takes into account which genetic variants a person has that have been linked to a higher BMI in adulthood.",
      "The score, the researchers said, could be used to predict a person\u2019s risk of obesity as an adult \u2014 before they even turn 5.",
      "\u201cChildhood is the best time to intervene,\u201d said study co-author Ruth Loos, a professor at the University of Copenhagen\u2019s Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research. (Research conducted at the center is not influenced by drugmaker Novo Nordisk, though some of the study authors had ties to pharmaceutical companies that make weight loss drugs.)",
      "The findings come as obesity is rising around the world. Rates of obesity in adults have more than doubled globally since 1990, and adolescent rates have quadrupled, according to the World Health Organization. About 16% of adults worldwide have obesity and the situation is worse in the United States, where more than 40% of adults have obesity, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics show.",
      "Twice as effective",
      "The new test is not the first that predicts a person\u2019s risk of obesity, but Loos and her team showed it was about twice as effective as the method doctors currently use to assess their patients. That polygenetic score can account for about 8.5% of a person\u2019s risk for having a high BMI as an adult. The new score increased that to about 17.6%, at least in people with European ancestry.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty powerful risk indicator for obesity, but it still leaves open a lot that is unknown,\u201d said Dr. Roy Kim, a pediatric endocrinologist at Cleveland Clinic Children\u2019s who was not involved with the research.",
      "Based on this score, more than 80% of a person\u2019s risk for obesity can be explained by other factors, such as where they live, what kinds of foods they have access to, and how much they exercise.",
      "The test was not nearly as effective in predicting obesity risk in non-Europeans. It explained about 16% of the risk for having a high BMI in East Asian Americans, but just 2.2% in rural Ugandans.",
      "About 70% of people whose data was included in the study were of predominantly European ancestry. About 14% were Hispanic and typically had a mix of ancestries. About 8% were of predominantly East Asian descent and just under 5% were of predominantly African ancestry. These samples were predominantly from African American people, who largely had mixed ancestry. Just 1.5% were of predominantly South Asian ancestry.",
      "Loos said the new score is a big step forward, but that it\u2019s still a prototype. The next step is to collect more \u2014 and more diverse \u2014 data on people with African ancestry in particular to improve how well the score works for everyone, not just white people.",
      "She said the score could offer one indicator \u2014 what high blood pressure is to heart disease, for example \u2014 that could help predict a person\u2019s risk of developing obesity.",
      "\u201cObesity is not only about genetics, so genetics alone can never accurately predict obesity,\u201d Loos said. \u201cFor the general obesity that we see all over the world, we need other factors such as lifestyle that need to be part of the predictions.\u201d Genetics play a bigger role in severe obesity, meaning a BMI of more than 40, she added.",
      "Still, identifying a person\u2019s genetic risk early on in childhood and intervening early with lifestyle coaching could make a big difference, she said. Research has shown that about 55% of children with obesity go on to have obesity in adolescence, and that about 80% of those individuals will have obesity in adulthood.",
      "\u201cBehavioral things are really important,\u201d Kim said. \u201cTheir environment, their access to healthy food, exercise opportunities, even their knowledge about healthy foods all affect a person\u2019s obesity risk.\u201d",
      "How important are genetics, really?",
      "Although studies in identical twins have found that genetics can account for as much as 80% of the reason a person has obesity, lifestyle factors still play a huge role, Kim said.",
      "\u201cEven with the same genetic makeup, people can have different body types,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a very young age in my practice, we educate patients about the importance of eating protein-rich foods, a lot of fruits and vegetables and not too many refined carbs.\u201d",
      "Dr. Juliana Simonetti, co-director of the Comprehensive Weight Management Program at the University of Utah, has been using genetic testing in her adult patients for about five years. She said understanding a person\u2019s genes can help doctors better treat weight gain.",
      "\u201cObesity is not homogeneous. We have different kinds and different presentations,\u201d said Simonetti, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study.",
      "Simonetti uses a person\u2019s genes to determine if a patient struggles with satiety, or feeling full.",
      "\u201cThey eat but do not feel full,\u201d Simonetti said, adding that this is a disorder caused by genetic mutations affecting certain pathways in the body. People who have these mutations \u201ctend to have higher weight,\u201d she said.",
      "But such mutations do not tell the whole genetic story of obesity, Simonetti said. The genes that a person inherits from either parent, even if they are not mutations, also determine how a person\u2019s body stores weight or uses energy. Both can play a big role in obesity risk.",
      "Genetic testing is also starting to be able to determine how well certain weight loss drugs will work for a person, Simonetti said, but she added this is just the beginning.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about three out of 80 mutations that we can treat,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are getting better, and the more data we have, I\u2019m hopeful that we are going to do a better job in being more precise in understanding treatment responses.\u201d"

      "The U.S. shipbuilding industry is looking for help. A South Korean company is answering the call.",
      "Hanwha Philly Shipyard CEO David Kim, nodding to the gargantuan vessels under construction just off the Delaware River, on Wednesday offered the kind of vision that has brought some optimism back to the U.S. shipbuilding community.",
      "\u201cYou take that level of experience, the technology that we have, the know-how, the process expertise, and so clearly, we believe we have a lot to bring to the Philly Shipyard, as well as to the U.S. maritime industrial base, in terms of modernization capacity,\u201d he said on a walkthrough of the shipyard.",
      "Hanwha Group bought the Philly Shipyard in December for $100 million and plans to invest multiple times that amount in the yard, training over a thousand new workers and bringing in new high-tech equipment. The company hopes to build naval ships and become the first U.S. builder of specialized liquefied natural gas tankers.",
      "Shipbuilding in the United States has been all but dormant. China, South Korea, Japan and Europe all produce far more ships than the United States, with the few shipyards still operating in the country concentrating on military ships.",
      "Revitalizing shipbuilding has been one of the areas President Donald Trump has pointed to as part of a broader effort to bring manufacturing back to the United States \u2014 a move some see as shortsighted considering the costs associated with building the kind of gigantic modern ships that remain a core part of how goods and commodities move around the planet."

      "The parish priest, the Rev. Gabriel Romanelli, \u201csustained light injuries,\u201d the patriarchate said.

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Chinese authorities in Hong Kong have launched a criminal investigation after more than a dozen female students and teachers at the University of Hong Kong accused a male law student of using AI to generate deepfake porn images of them.",
      "The probe, announced Tuesday by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, came after an outcry from students at the university, the city's oldest, who said it hadn't done enough to protect them or punish the accused.",
      "\"The images were organized into folders named after the victims, totaling 700+ images (including the original photos),\" read a widely circulated letter that was posted Saturday on Instagram from an account run by three unnamed victims.",
      "The accused, referred to in the letter only as \u201ca male law student,\u201d took photos of the victims from social media and used AI software to generate pornographic images with their faces, according to the letter. The images were discovered on his laptop reported to the university in February. They were not known to have been widely distributed.",
      "In March, the university interviewed some of the victims, and in April informed one of them that the accused student had written a 60-word \"apology letter.\"",
      "While NBC News was unable to confirm the authenticity of that letter, and the account did not respond to a request for comment, the university said it was \"aware of the social media posts concerning a student allegedly using AI tools to create indecent images.\"",
      "\u201cThe University has already issued him a warning letter and demanded him a formal apology to his affected peers,\u201d the university said Saturday in a statement.",
      "Deepfake porn is a type of nonconsensual pornography that involves altering existing images or creating entirely new ones using readily available AI tools to make it appear that a person has participated in sexual acts.",
      "Regulations in Hong Kong around the technology are currently sparse. While it criminalizes \u201cpublication or threatened publication of intimate images without consent,\u201d it does not explicitly outlaw their generation.",
      "In the U.S., regulations govern dissemination, with President Donald Trump signing legislation in May that bans nonconsensual online publication of AI-generated porn, but federal law does not explicitly prohibit personal possession, and a district judge ruled in February that possessing such images was protected by the First Amendment.",
      "After it was rocked by a number of scandals similar to the one playing out in Hong Kong, South Korea passed a law last year that criminalizes not only the possession but also the consumption of such content.",
      "Though the University of Hong Kong said that it had undertaken various steps on behalf of the victims, \u201cincluding class adjustments,\u201d the victims wrote in the letter that the university\u2019s inaction had resulted in them being forced to share the classroom with the suspect \u201cat least four times, causing unnecessary psychological distress.\u201d",
      "Outrage has since grown in the wider student community, which has demanded more stringent action. That prompted a response from the city\u2019s top official, Chief Executive John Lee, who said at a news briefing Tuesday that universities have the \u201cresponsibility of developing students\u2019 moral character,\u201d adding institutions should \u201cdeal with student misconduct seriously.\u201d",
      "\u201cAny conduct that causes harm to others may constitute a criminal offense and may also infringe individual rights and also privacy,\u201d he said.",
      "The university did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News, but it told the South China Morning Post this week that it was conducting a review of the incident and vowed further action if victims demanded more.",
      "\u201cThe university is now further reviewing the case and will take further actions when appropriate to ensure a safe and respectful learning environment,\u201d it said."
