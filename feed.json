      "The publicist for Scottish painter Jack Vettriano says he has been found dead in his apartment in France",
      "LONDON -- Scottish painter Jack Vettriano, known for his works depicting elegant men and women on dreamlike beaches, has been found dead in his apartment in France, his publicist said Monday. He was 73.",
      "British media reported there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death on Saturday.",
      "Vettriano, born Jack Hoggan in Fife, Scotland on Nov. 17, 1951, was a self-taught artist who created some of the world's most recognizable contemporary paintings.",
      "His 1992 painting \u201cThe Singing Butler\u201d \u2014 featuring a couple in evening dress dancing on a storm-swept beach as their butler and maid proffered umbrellas \u2014 became a best-selling image in Britain.",
      "In 2005, elusive street artist Banksy based a satirical painting titled \u201cCrude Oil (Vettriano)\u201d on \u201cThe Singing Butler,\u201d adding a sinking oil liner and two figures lugging a barrel of toxic waste to the composition to send an environmental message.",
      "Vettriano left school at 15 to become a mining engineer but took up painting after a girlfriend gave him a box of watercolors for his 21st birthday. His breakthrough came in 1998 when he submitted two paintings to the Royal Scottish Academy\u2019s annual show. Both sold on the first day.",
      "Although some art critics dismissed his work, he enjoyed commercial success and held exhibitions in London, Hong Kong, New York and elsewhere. Actor Jack Nicholson and lyricist Tim Rice were among those who acquired Vettriano's work.",
      "\u201cJack Vettriano\u2019s passing marks the end of an era for contemporary Scottish art,\u201d his publicist said in a statement. \"His evocative and timeless works will continue to captivate and inspire future generations.\u201d"

      "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- At the Oscars ceremony, they were there. At the after-parties, they were barely there.",
      "Celebrities bared a lot more than their emotions on Oscar night. The naked fashion trend was on full display at places like the Vanity Fair party carpet, where guests clearly bought into the idea that less is more.",
      "Among them: actor-director Olivia Wilde, who wore a sheer, embroidered lace negligee by Chlo\u00e9, \u201cwith metal ends and embroidered lace lingerie panties,\u201d according to the designer.",
      "While Wilde's outfit had a demure bohemian charm, actor Julia Fox leaned much further toward naked, arriving in a see-through wrap dress where the only adornment seemed to be strategically placed hair extensions.",
      "Doja Cat sang \u201cDiamonds Are Forever\u201d on the telecast during a James Bond tribute segment in what looked like only diamonds, with little fabric in between. Then she showed up at the Vanity Fair party in a custom Balmain strapless gown with fringes, which the designer said \u201cwas crafted by 39 artisans over the course of 3,450 hours.\u201d The inspiration: an Oscar statue reflecting the female form \u2014 and that form was celebrated, beneath all the hand-threaded glass beads in nine different shades of gold.",
      "Kendall Jenner drew attention at the Vanity Fair fete with a vintage 1992 Mugler number in black lace that was actually made of rubber. \u201cWhite Lotus\u201d actor Leslie Bibb decided to go with the popular nude-sparkle look.",
      "Although the trend may feel somewhat new \u2014 as evidenced by the chatter around the recent Grammys carpet appearance by Bianca Censori and Ye \u2014 naked fashion has been in vogue for a number of years, noted Madeline Hirsch, features director at InStyle Fashion.",
      "\u201cThough it originated on the runway, the naked dress trend is fed largely by celebrity red carpet moments \u2014 stars and their stylists can\u2019t seem to get enough,\u201d Hirsch said in an email. She added that in 2025, sheer lace is the most prominent expression of the trend \u2014 not a surprise since bohemian style is resurgent.",
      "Though many Oscar attendees, of course, opt for much more traditional looks both before and after the ceremonies, it tends to be at the after-parties where the naked look pops up the most, Hirsch said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the time when attendees can let down their hair after hours, and generally speaking, it\u2019s a lower stakes red carpet and less formal event than the ceremony itself,\u201d Hirsch said. \u201cNext-to-naked dressing matches that energy.\u201d"

      "When Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora\u201d swept the 97th Academy Awards on Sunday, its five wins, including best picture, heralded a different kind of Oscar winner. \u201cAnora,\u201d about an erotic dancer (Mikey Madison, the best actress winner ) who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, is atypically sexually explicit for a best picture winner \u2014 a class that includes more staid movies like \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d and \u201cDriving Miss Daisy.\u201d A young woman\u2019s relationship to her own sexuality has not been, historically speaking, in the Oscars' wheelhouse.",
      "But that\u2019s just one quality that makes \u201cAnora\u201d unique as a best picture winner. The film, made for $6 million and distributed by Neon, was made with little interest in the mainstream. If anything, \u201cAnora\u201d was more oriented to the Cannes Film Festival, the French citadel of cinema, where it won the Palme d\u2019Or last May \u2014 a prize that Baker said meant the most to him.",
      "But, increasingly, these are converging movie worlds. In the last five years, four Palme d\u2019Or winners have been nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards, including Bong Joon Ho\u2019s \u201cParasite\u201d (also distributed by Neon), which became the first non-English language movie to win Hollywood\u2019s top prize.",
      "\u201cAnora,\u201d a film that inverts a Hollywood fairy tale like \u201cPretty Woman,\u201d is \u2014 like many of the winners on Sunday \u2014 an unabashedly modern movie and a film comfortable, even proud of the label of \u201ccinema.\u201d In a movie industry where manufactured franchise stewardship rules the day, \u201cAnora\u201d was celebrated, in part, because it's the real deal.",
      "It's also a more traditional choice than it might seem. Baker, a filmmaker who has sworn off making a series, a studio film or anything for streaming, is an apostle of '70s cinema. At an Oscars that host Conan O\u2019Brien called \u201cthe 97th Longform Content Awards,\u201d \u201cAnora\u201d \u2014 which shared some of the same Brooklyn streets as \u201cThe French Connection\u201d \u2014 stood for upholding an increasingly threatened theatrical legacy, with Baker ardently defending a very old-fashioned thing: the big screen.",
      "\u201cFilmmakers, keep making films for the big screen. I know I will,\u201d Baker said from the Dolby Theatre stage. \u201cDistributors, please focus first and foremost on the theatrical releases of your films. Parents, introduce your children to feature films in movie theaters and you will be molding the next generation of movie lovers and filmmakers. And for all of us, when we can please watch movies in a theater and let\u2019s keep the great tradition of the moviegoing experience alive and well.\u201d",
      "The coronation of \u201cAnora\u201d was a triumph for independent moviemaking, but that\u2019s also been a battle waged and won before. We\u2019ve seen \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d best \u201cAvatar\u201d and \u201cMoonlight\u201d defeat \u201cLa La Land.\u201d Last year\u2019s crowning of \u201cOppenheimer\u201d was, if anything, an exception in a string of smaller best pictures that haven't fit the Oscar mold. \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d the 2023 winner, was antic, lewd and about the furthest thing possible from \u201cOscar bait.\u201d",
      "What was different this year was that the stiffest competition for \u201cAnora\u201d wasn\u2019t \u201cWicked\u201d or \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d or any other studio product. It was \u201cConclave\u201d and \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d All of the major award winners on Sunday hailed from movies made independently. At the Oscars, the studios are out of the picture.",
      "That trend has been developing for years, but the 97th Academy Awards showed just how much things have changed. In the best animated category, where Universal and DreamWorks\u2019 \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d was the heavy favorite, \u201cFlow,\u201d a wordless Latvian movie made with open-source software, triumphed instead.",
      "\u201cAny kid now has tools that are used to make these now Academy-winning films,\u201d \u201cFlow\u201d director Gints Zilbalodis said backstage. \u201cSo I think we\u2019re going to see all kinds of exciting films being made from kids who might not have had a chance to do this before.\u201d",
      "That win, like those for \u201cAnora,\u201d suggested the academy\u2019s international voters have emerged as a dominant bloc. When the academy, reacting to pressure to diversify its ranks, brought in new members in recent years, it cast a wide net overseas. Hundreds of new international voters \u2014 people more likely to favor what succeeds in Cannes or Venice \u2014 now significantly sway the Oscars.",
      "What does that mean for the Academy Awards going forward? A further tilt toward indie and arthouse cinema will surely alienate some viewers. \u201cAnora,\u201d with $16 million in domestic ticket sales, is one of the lowest-grossing best picture winners ever. Oscar producers did everything they could to lean into bigger films, opening with a lavish medley by \u201cWicked\u201d stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, cutting repeatedly to a mascot sandworm from \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d and even paying James Bond tribute.",
      "The 007 musical number was oddly timed, coming on the heels of the franchise\u2019s creative takeover by Amazon MGM Studios after decades of Broccoli family stewardship. It seemed to only highlight how much of Hollywood\u2019s regular, day-to-day business of brand management lay outside the new Oscar landscape.",
      "But just as assuredly as an \u201cAnora\u201d Academy Awards might turn some away, it could also inspire a new generation of cinephiles. \u201cAnora\u201d is at turns screwball farce, neorealistic drama, capitalism satire and devastating tragicomedy. It\u2019s arguably one of the best best picture winners of recent years, a movie that tries on nearly every genre before concluding in an unforgettable scene that catapults \u201cAnora\u201d into something classic and outside of time.",
      "What aftershocks will follow Baker's Oscar romp remains to be seen. But shortly after the Academy Awards concluded, 3.9 magnitude tremors were felt in nearby Burbank \u2014 a fitting coda for the small quake of \u201cAnora.\u201d"

      "AL-TUWANEH, West Bank -- Just last week, Israeli troops came and tore down a Palestinian family\u2019s shed in this remote, hilly corner of the West Bank, residents say. It was the latest instance of destruction targeting a collection of hamlets whose population is threatened with expulsion.",
      "Palestinians in the Masafer Yatta area cheered the Oscar win of the documentary \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d which depicts life in the beleaguered community, and hoped it will bring them some help.",
      "In al-Tuwaneh, one of the hamlets that make up Masafer Yatta, Salem Adra said his family stayed up all night for the Oscar ceremony. They watched as his older brother, Basel Adra, the film\u2019s co-director, came on stage to accept the award for best documentary.",
      "\u201cIt was such a huge surprise, such joy,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land\u201d follows Basel Adra as he risks arrest to document the destruction of Masafer Yatta at the southern edge of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, joined by his co-director, Israeli journalist and filmmaker, Yuval Abraham.",
      "The joint Palestinian-Israeli production has won a string of international awards, starting at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2024. Five years in the making, it gained greater resonance amid Israel\u2019s devastating military campaign in Gaza that forced almost its entire population from their homes, as well as increasing raids in the West Bank that have caused the displacement of tens of thousands of Palestinians.",
      "At the same time, the film has raised hackles in Israel, scarred by the bloody the Oct. 7, 2023 attack by Hamas that triggered the war.",
      "Salem Adra, who at times helped his brother film for the movie, said he hoped the Oscar win \u201copens the world\u2019s eyes to what\u2019s happening here in Masafer Yatta.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a win for all of Palestine and for everyone who lives in Masafer Yatta,\u201d he said.",
      "He said that since the film was first released, threats and pressure against his family have increased. Their car has been stoned by settlers. After the movie won an award at the Berlin International Film Festival a year ago, the military returned over and over to the family home, and once detained his father, searching his phone and asking, \u201cWhy are you filming?\u201d",
      "The Israeli military designated Masafer Yatta as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered residents, mostly Arab Bedouin, to be expelled. Israel said the Bedouin did not have permanent structures in the area. But families say they have lived and herded their sheep and goats across the area long before Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "After a 20-year legal battle by residents, Israel\u2019s Supreme Court upheld the expulsion order in 2022. The around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but troops regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards \u2013 and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.",
      "Salem Adra said the latest destruction came Wednesday, when troops tore down the shed of a family in a nearby hamlet.",
      "Standing on a stony ridge above al-Tuwaneh, Salem Adra said Jewish settlers backed by the military have set up 10 outposts around the village since Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Shepherd Raed al-Hamamdeh, 48, led his herd of goats across the rocky land. He pointed to one outpost \u2013 with tents and a trailer flying the flag of an Israeli military unit \u2013 on the other side of a small valley. Farmers no longer tend the olive grove in the valley for fear of being attacked.",
      "Al-Hamamdeh said the military uses drones to drive off herds if they get too close to the outposts. \u201cSettlers attack. When we herd sheep, we can\u2019t go far as you can see. Only up to this point can we reach,\u201d he said. He pointed to the rubble of a house that he said settlers had destroyed, driving out the family and burning their furniture.",
      "In Israel, the film garnered little media attention since its release \u2014 and what attention it did get has been angry. When it won the documentary prize at the Berlin festival, its Israeli director Abraham came under fire for an acceptance speech that called for an end to the war in Gaza without mentioning Hamas\u2019 initial attack and taking of the hostages held in Gaza.",
      "In his Oscar acceptance speech, Abraham spoke of both. But that did little to calm criticism in Israel. Culture and Sports Minister Miki Zohar called the win \u201ca sad moment for the world of cinema.\u201d He said the film distorted reality and accused its creators of using \u201cdefamation\u201d of Israel as a way help promote the documentary.",
      "Usually, Israeli films that are nominated for prestigious international prizes receive boastful accolades in Israel.",
      "But after the Hamas attack, \u201ceveryone is in mourning or in trauma, we can hardly hear any other voice on any other subject,\u201d Raya Morag, a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem who specializes in cinema and trauma, said last week.",
      "On Monday, she said it wasn\u2019t yet clear if the win will bring the documentary more attention in Israel. But, she said, \u201cit won\u2019t be possible for people to ignore the message of the two directors, including for people that haven\u2019t seen the film.\u201d",
      "In his acceptance speech Sunday night, Basel Adra called on the world \u201cto stop the injustice and to stop the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian people.\u201d",

      "On Monday, his brother Salem walked down from the ridge along with his 4-year-old son to a family home.",

      "Carnival always breathes life into the economy of Vila Vintem, on Rio de Janeiro\u2019s west side, but this year there\u2019s even more, with its Unidos de Padre Miguel samba school back in the top parade league for the first time in 57 years",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Carnival always breathes life into the economy of Vila Vintem, a favela on Rio de Janeiro's west side, but this year the pulse is even stronger with its Unidos de Padre Miguel samba school returning to the top samba parade league for the first time in almost 60 years.",
      "As one of Rio's 12 top-tier samba schools, Unidos de Padre Miguel will have its shot at fame, perhaps even glory \u2014 all while bringing in more money into its community.",
      "Last year, competing in the second division, Padre Miguel received about 900,000 reais ($150,000) from City Hall, missing out on the lucrative sponsorship deals and revenue from television rights, pre-Carnival parties and ticket sales enjoyed by top-flight samba schools. But their victory in last year's Carnival secured their place in the main event that kicks off Sunday night.",
      "The shift has sent Padre Miguel\u2019s budget this year ballooning more than tenfold, to about 11 million reais ($2 million), including nearly 2 million reais from the city, according to the samba school's deputy chairman Dr. Willie Baracho.",
      "The school has already invested a significant portion into the community, funding local seamstresses, carpenters and welders for parade preparations.",
      "Vila Vintem is already experiencing the positive effects. Several of the favela's formerly jobless residents told The Associated Press they have bought smartphones and household appliances.",
      "Padre Miguel's new headquarters, nearing completion, will relocate rehearsals and other community activities from a hangar-like space that served as a vital center for the community during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cOur samba school has projects, it helps people, distributes food, throws parties for our children,\u201d Luana Borges, 42, said as she fixed details on several costumes, some bearing the school's traditional red and white colors.",
      "\u201cWhen Carnival comes, it offers opportunities to people like me,\" said Borges, who used to be unemployed.",
      "Nearly all samba schools sit in working-class neighborhoods around Rio\u2019s metropolitan region and compete against each other in the legendary Sambadrome parade grounds. Favelas in Rio are typically associated with dense, hillside neighborhoods, but they feature other geographies, too. The 14,000-resident Vila Vintem cropped up almost a century ago on flatlands next to a railway under construction.",
      "When first settled, the swampy area was said to be worth not even a \u201cvintem,\u201d the cheapest coin at the time, akin to a penny. Decades passed before basic services arrived, sometimes only after residents agreed to do the work themselves.",
      "Even with its new Carnival windfall, Padre Miguel remains a financial underdog.",
      "Baracho said its more popular rivals don\u2019t depend as much on city money, and can bring in up to 18 million reais ($3 million) when accounting for corporate sponsorships, sales of merchandise, coveted parade positions and cover charges for their pre-Carnival parties.",
      "While Padre Miguel employs almost all locals, Baracho said wealthier samba schools can spend over 1 million reais, for instance, on coaches and dancers, whose performance is one of the categories scored by judges.",
      "\u201cThe sky is the limit for some, but we fight,\u201d Baracho said. \u201cWe managed to get promoted because we are invested in our people, we work hard to foster our own creativity.\"",
      "Padre Miguel will be the first samba school to parade on Sunday night. Their procession will tell the story of Iya\u0301 Nasso\u0302, the founder of the first space in Brazil for rituals of the Afro-Brazilian faith Candomble.",
      "Experts say the best path for scrappy samba schools like Padre Miguel to sustain their community impact is to focus on avoiding relegation, rather than pursuing Carnival\u2019s top prize, amounting to 20% of the revenue of the tickets sold for the Champions Parade, which takes place the following weekend.",
      "\u201cThere's little chance for a samba school to win the title coming from the second division,\" said F\u00e1tima Costa de Lima, a Carnival researcher and scenic arts professor at Santa Catarina State University. \u201cIt happened before, but it is rare. The main goal for a samba school like (Padre Miguel) is to stay on.\u201d",
      "Ingrid Lima Leal has worked for Padre Miguel for 15 years, and paraded with the school for even longer. The 66-year-old says that creating jobs in Vila Vintem and being at the world-famous parade is worth every cent. She wants to see more next year \u2014 hopefully still in the top division.",
      "While sewing a white costume in her home workshop, Leal expressed the \u201camazing emotion\u201d of marching in the parade wearing something she helped create.",
      "\u201cCarnival brings a lot of jobs. Not only here, but everywhere,\u201d she said.",

      "On the patio inside, Harvey Keitel was thrilled to see Willem Dafoe and gave him a kiss on the cheek. The two, who co-starred in \u201cThe Grand Budapest Hotel,\u201d were soon joined by actor Lily-Rose Depp. Behind them, actor Michael Keaton snuck by to see a friend, while Mulaney and his wife, actor Olivia Munn, huddled in a corner chatting with actor Zoey Deutch.",
      "Brody held court with some admirers elsewhere, while \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d filmmaker Brady Corbet stayed close to his partner and co-writer Mona Fastvold. Strong navigated the room in sneakers and actor Julie Delpy tried to get a word with Moore.",

      "Most attendees were bedecked head to toe in Chanel, a fashion house that has been intertwined with cinema since its earliest days.",
      "In 1930, Samuel Goldwyn invited Gabrielle Chanel to Hollywood to dress film stars including Gloria Swanson. On her return to Paris, Chanel collaborated with French filmmakers like Jean Renoir and dressed many of the new wave actresses such as Jeanne Moreau and Romy Schneider.",
      "Finch, a British producer and entrepreneur, helped kick off Saturday's event before attendees took their seats in the dining room with a brief speech about being guests in this country and not standing for tyranny, which had Corbet cheering enthusiastically.",
      "Finch said the best part of the evening is when it\u2019s over and he is certain people have had fun.",
      "\u201cAlso, when I get to see these people the next day win an Academy Award,\u201d Finch said. \u201cCelebrating film is always the most amazing part of the night.\u201d",

      "PARIS -- Oscar contender \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" was named the best French film of the year at the C\u00e9sars awards \u2014 France's equivalent of the Oscars \u2014 and under-fire Karla Sofia Gasc\u00f3n, the star of Jacques Audiard\u2019s Mexico-set melodrama, made a rare public appearance.",
      "The musical is one of the most celebrated films of the year but has also been criticized for its depiction of Mexican culture and engulfed in controversy because of Gasc\u00f3n's previous social media posts disparaging Muslims, George Floyd and diversity at the Oscars.",
      "Although Gasc\u00f3n, who was nominated in the best actress category along with her co-star Zoe Salda\u00f1a, did not win a C\u00e9sar, the night in Paris was triumphal for \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d which swept seven trophies.",

      "Old posts from Gascon\u2018s X account resurfaced in January, some going as far back as 2016, that took aim at Muslims\u2019 dress, language and culture in her native Spain. She also suggested that Islam be banned. And less than a month after George Floyd, a Black man, was killed by a white Minneapolis police officer in 2020, Gasc\u00f3n offered her assessment of Floyd \u2014 whose death prompted widespread reckoning with police brutality and racism \u2014 as a drug addict who \u201cvery few people ever cared\u201d for.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n, who stars as the titular transgender ex-cartel boss in \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d has withdrawn from promoting the film, which has 13 Oscar nominations. Audiard has condemned her comments.",
      "If it manages to steer through the backlash and go home the big winner at the Oscars on Sunday, it would hand Netflix its first best picture win. Gasc\u00f3n is the first openly trans actor nominated for best actress and a win would be even more historic, although her chances of taking the award home now appear very slim.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n, who has issued an apology for her old posts, attended the 50th anniversary of the C\u00e9sars ceremony presided over by Catherine Deneuve at the Olympia theater in Paris. She wore a black dress and posed for photographers but did not speak to reporters.",

      "Julia Roberts was also in Paris on Friday to receive an honorary C\u00e9sar for her career achievements. She was called onto the stage by Clive Owen, with whom she starred in \u201cCloser\u201d and \u201cDuplicity,\u201d and was treated to a standing ovation."

      "Actor Lily James, ballet dancer Maria Bogdanovich and model Ana Beatriz Barros were among the guests who sat cozily on curving sofas for the back-to-back shows. Armani also invited Italian senator-for-life Liliana Segre, a Holocaust survivor, and figures from Milan's cultural institutions.",
      "The opening look encapsulated the sensorial complexity of the fall-winter 2025-26 womenswear collection, titled \u201cRoots.\u201d A swirl of lush faux fur framed the face, while liquidy silken trousers caught the light, and a leather-trimmed tweed jacket pulled it all together.",
      "Sure-footed flat booties were the footwear of the season\u2014some featuring radiant strips of leather, others with gentle folds of velvet.",
      "Each ensemble was a perfect combination of soothing neutrals, harmonizing seemingly contrasting materials. Trousers were either loose and pleated at the front or gathered loosely like jodhpurs, as the designer drew inspiration from the East. Jacket were made from contrasting jacquards or delicate quilting.",
      "Feather-light, sometimes sheer evening wear sparkled with beading occasionally patterned like geodes. Sculpted bodices added a couture element, standing away from the body.",
      "\u201cFor Giorgio Armani, each collection is a return to his roots, reaffirmation of an authentic style that evolves, drawing on itself, while remaining firmly anchored in reality,\u201d the show notes said.",
      "Armani, 90, was escorted by two glittering models as he took his final bow. As has been customary, Armani's was the last major runway show of Milan Fashion Week before the crowd decamped to continue womenswear fashion previews in Paris."

The official red carpet preshow on ABC and Hulu starts at 6:30 p.m. Unofficial E! red carpet coverage begins at 4 p.m. EST and The Associated Press will livestream arrivals beginning at 3 p.m.",
      "Light rain was in the forecast for Sunday morning in Los Angeles, which is still recovering from wildfires that devastated the Pacific Palisades and Altadena neighborhoods earlier this year.",
      "The fires affected many throughout the film industry and within the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences. Some even called for the cancellation of Hollywood\u2019s awards season. While his Pacific Palisades house was spared, O\u2019Brien has been living out of a hotel the last two months. Oscar producers have said the show will celebrate the city\u2019s resilience.",
      "The lead nominee is Netflix\u2019s \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d with 13 nominations, but that film has seen its chances crater following uproar over years-old offensive tweets by its star, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, the first openly trans actor nominated for best actress.",
      "The favorite is Sean Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora,\u201d about a sex worker who weds the son of a Russian oligarch.

      "Its closest competition is \u201cConclave,\u201d the papal thriller starring Ralph Fiennes. It won at the BAFTAs and the SAG Awards, wins that came just as Pope Francis was hospitalized for double pneumonia. Oscar voting concluded before the pope fell ill.",
      "Also in the mix are \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d nominated for 10 awards, and the musical hit \u201cWicked,\u201d also with 10 nominations. Several of the early craft Oscars could be shared between \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d",
      "For the first time, an actor is nominated for playing the sitting U.S. president. Sebastian Stan is nominated for best actor for his performance as a young Donald Trump in \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d as is his co-star, Jeremy Strong, for playing Roy Cohn. Trump has called those involved with the film \u201chuman scum.\u201d",

      "While the supporting acting categories feature overwhelming favorites in Zoe Saldana (\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d) and Kieran Culkin (\u201cA Real Pain\u201d), both best actor and best actress are close contests.",
      "In best actress, Demi Moore (\u201cThe Substance\u201d) is most likely to win, but Mikey Madison (\u201cAnora\u201d) or Fernanda Torres (\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d) could pull off the upset.",
      "Adrien Brody is favored in best actor for his performance in \u201cThe Brutalist. But Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet stands a decent chance of beating him, for his performance as Bob Dylan in \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d The 29-year-old Chalamet, who won at the Screen Actors Guild, would become the youngest best actor winner ever, edging Brody\u2019s record, set in 2003 in his win for \u201cThe Pianist.\u201d",
      "This year's Oscars are unspooling after a turbulent year for the film industry. Ticket sales were down 3% from the previous year and more significantly from pre-pandemic times. The strikes of 2023 played havoc with release schedules in 2024. Many studios pulled back on production, leaving many out of work. The fires, in January, only added to the pain.",
      "Last year\u2019s telecast, propelled by the twin blockbusters of \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cBarbie,\u201d led the Oscars to a four-year viewership high, with 19.5 million viewers. This year, with smaller independent films favored in the most prominent awards, the academy will be tested to draw as large of an audience.",
      "With a not particularly starry array of best song nominees, the academy has done away with performances of original songs this year.

      "An artist in Denmark aims to raise awareness of the suffering caused by modern pig production with an art installation that opened Friday that includes three piglets who will be denied food and water and will starve to death.",
      "Chilean-born Marco Evaristti is courting controversy to make a point about the treatment of pigs in Denmark, where about 25,000 piglets die daily as a result of the conditions in which they are bred.",
      "The central exhibit at Copenhagen's \u201cAnd Now You Care\u201d exhibition is a makeshift cage created with shopping carts containing three piglets. As the exhibition opened Friday evening, they were still fine, but they will not be given food and drink, and can be expected to die of hunger within a few days.",
      "Evaristti says on his Instagram page that the exhibition \u201cis a confrontation with Denmark's bloody reality\u201d in slaughterhouses, and that he urges people to reduce their meat consumption and support agriculture that improves animal welfare.",
      "Denmark's largest and oldest animal welfare organization, Animal Protection Denmark, says it is grateful for Evaristti's interest in the problem, but disagrees with how he wants to convey it.",
      "\u201cWe completely understand the indignation\u201d of the artist, said Birgitte Damm, a spokesperson for the organization. \u201cBut we do not agree that three piglets, three individual living beings, should be starved and prevented from drinking until they die from it. It is illegal and it is abuse of the animals.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fact that happens to thousands each day in the industry doesn\u2019t make it right,\u201d she said. But she also praised the artist for asking \u201cthe large questions about who we are as human beings or want to be, and what we are doing to fellow creatures in the name of enormous amounts of mass-produced cheap meat.\u201d",
      "Damm explained that sows are bred in the Danish pig industry to produce about 20 piglets at a time, but only have 14 teats, forcing the piglets to compete for breastmilk, and leading to the starvation of many. She said some 25,000 piglets die every day from starvation or the result of the conditions in which they are held in Denmark.",
      "It's not Evaristti's first controversial project.",
      "One of his projects included goldfish in blenders, tempting viewers to press the button and create goldfish soup.",
      "In 2006 he used some of his own body fat removed via liposuction to prepare meatballs, and then ate some of them.",
      "He described that project called \u201cPolpette Al Grasso Di Marco\u201d as a critique on people overconsuming and then buying their way to slimness with liposuction, and at the same time an attempt to transcend the taboo of cannibalism.",

    "story": [
      "The Metropolitan Opera is staging a production of Herman Melville's masterpiece about a white whale, \u2018Moby-Dick",
      "When Leonard Foglia was invited to direct an opera based on Herman Melville\u2019s masterpiece about a white whale, his first reaction was: \u201cMoby-Dick. That\u2019s great!\u201d",
      "\u201cThen I ran to a used bookstore and got the book,\u201d he recalled, \u201cand I thought: \u2018Oh my God, what am I in for here?\u2019 It\u2019s so daunting. I didn\u2019t panic, but I thought, \u2018How do we do this?\u2019\u201d",
      "How he and his collaborators did it will be on display at the Metropolitan Opera beginning March 3. The opera is composed by Jake Heggie to a libretto crafted by Gene Scheer.",
      "To begin with, Scheer had to whittle a novel of more than 600 pages down to a 64-page libretto. He kept as much of Melville\u2019s language as possible, and estimates that 40% to 50% of his libretto can be found in the original text, though he often tweaked the phrasing to make it more singable.",
      "Heggie and his initial partner, Terrence McNally (who withdrew for health reasons), had already decided to lop off the opening chapters, which take place on land. They set the entire opera aboard the whale-hunting ship Pequod.",
      "Another crucial change was renaming the narrator, calling him Greenhorn to reflect his status as a novice aboard the ship. Now the book\u2019s famous opening line, \u201cCall me Ishmael,\u201d is transposed to the very end of the opera when the character has matured.",
      "\u201cIn the novel, Ishmael is telling a story that happened many years ago,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cBut in the theater, you want to see it happen in real time. \u2026 We\u2019re watching him take in all the experiences so that when he says \u2018Call me Ishmael,\u2019 he\u2019s ready to write the book. In essence, this opera is the education of Ishmael.\u201d",
      "Tenor Stephen Costello, who is performing the role for the fifth time and is the lone cast holdover from the Dallas premiere in 2010, sees his character as \u201cthe only one who really has an arc.",
      "\u201cHe goes on the Pequod because there was nothing for him on land,\u201d Costello said. \u201cSo he\u2019s either going to die at sea or figure out who he is.\u201d",
      "In addition to Costello, the Met cast includes tenor Brandon Jovanovich as the vengeance-obsessed Captain Ahab. Pip, his cabin boy, is written as a \u201ctrousers role\u201d (a male character portrayed by a woman) and will be sung by soprano Janai Brugger. Starbuck, the first mate, will be baritone Peter Mattei, and bass-baritone Ryan Speedo Green will sing the part of Queequeg. Karen Kamensek conducts the eight performances through March 29.",
      "The opera, commissioned to celebrate the opening of a new opera house in Dallas, has been a success from the beginning, drawing praise from audiences and critics \u2014 and even scholars.",
      "Bob Wallace, a professor at Northern Kentucky University and past president of the Melville Society, admired the opera so much that he wrote a book about its creation.",
      "\u201cScheer and Heggie did a brilliant job of shrinking the novel to make it fit the stage and yet preserve so much of the essence of it,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "As much as critics admired Scheer\u2019s adaptation and Heggie\u2019s tuneful, atmospheric and at times gripping score, they lavished special praise on the physical production, with sets by Robert Brill and projections by Elaine J. McCarthy.",
      "The action, Steve Smith wrote in The New York Times, \u201cplayed out against a multimedia-enriched staging that ranged from striking to near-miraculous.\u201d",
      "Perhaps the most stunning effect is the way animated projections superimposed on a climbing wall that is curved a bit like a skateboard ramp create the illusion of the crew leaving the Pequod to board three whaling boats.",
      "\u201cA lot of the excitement and thrill of watching this is due to the work of the production team,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cLenny kept saying to me, \u2019You imagine it the way you want it, and let me figure out how to do it.\u201d",
      "That often involved imposing unusual physical demands on the singers. For instance, when Pip gets lost at sea, his character sings the equivalent of an operatic mad scene dangling high above the stage, with projections making it appear he\u2019s treading water.",
      "\u201cI said to Janai when we first rehearsed it,\u201d Foglia recalled, \u201cOK, you can just get mad at me now, because you have to sing your hardest aria hanging from not even a full harness, just a single wire.\u201d",
      "In addition, Queequeg and Greenhorn climb up and down ladders to sing at the top of the mastheads. Ahab, who has lost a leg in a prior encounter with Moby-Dick, has to hobble on a wooden prosthesis. And Greenhorn \u2014 finally named Ishmael \u2014 ends the opera grabbing onto a whale hook from a passing ship that lifts him to safety.",
      "\u201cI joke with them that everything opera singers count on in life \u2014 having both feet planted on the ground \u2014 I\u2019ve taken away from them,\u201d Foglia said.",

      "BERLIN -- Forget SpongeBob SquarePants, Sesame Street and the sourdough starter craze: a depressed German loaf of bread named Bernd das Brot is celebrating his 25th anniversary as the reluctant star of a children's television program that accidentally became equally popular with adults.",
      "A cult classic in Germany, Bernd das Brot (Bernd the Bread) is a puppet renowned for his deep, gloomy voice, his perpetual pessimism and his signature expression, \"Mist!\" (Think \u201ccrap!\u201d in English.)",
      "Played and voiced by puppeteer J\u00f6rg Teichgraeber, Bernd is a television presenter who wants nothing to do with TV and can\u2019t wait to go home to stare at the wallpaper.",
      "This year, his friends \u2014 a sheep and a flower bush \u2014 are urging him to become a bread influencer.",
      "Born as a sketch on the back of a napkin in a pizzeria, creator Tommy Krappweis drew Bernd's infamous grimace after co-creator Norman C\u00f6ster's face when they were asked to come up with mascots for KiKA, a German children\u2019s public television channel.",
      "Comic artist Georg Graf von Westphalen designed Bernd as a pullman loaf \u2014 white bread typically sliced for sandwiches \u2014 with short arms and a permanent scowl. Bernd channels German stereotypes with his grumpy disposition, penchant for complaining and dry sense of humor and irony.",
      "Bernd's first episode aired on KiKA in 2000 alongside his more-optimistic pals, Chili the Sheep and Briegel the Bush.",
      "Because KiKA is a children's channel, there was typically dead air from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. On Jan. 1, 2003, the network put Bernd's short episodes into the night loop for the first time.",
      "The move brought an adult audience \u2014 often those sitting at home and smoking pot, or returning after a long night of partying \u2014 into Bernd's world, cementing his popularity as a German cult classic.",
      "In 2004, Bernd won the Adolf Grimme Prize \u2014 the German television equivalent of an Emmy \u2014 because the jury said he represents \u201cthe right to be in a bad mood.\u201d",
      "\u201cBernd shows you that you are less vulnerable with humor and self-irony. And perhaps the most important point is: It\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t feel well sometimes. That\u2019s completely fine,\u201d Krappweis, Bernd's creator, said in a KiKA Q&A about Bernd's anniversary.",
      "Bernd is depressed for a multitude of reasons, including his failed attempt to be the mascot for a bakery's advertising campaign (that's how he ended up as a TV presenter, as a last resort).",
      "But it's in Episode 85 that we finally learn about Bernd's broken heart.",
      "\u201cA long, long time ago I fell in love with a beautiful, slim baguette. She was so incredibly charming and funny,\u201d Bernd tells Chili and Briegel. \u201cBut unfortunately it was in vain.",
      "\u201cShe only had eyes for this run-of-the-mill multigrain bread with its 10 types of grain. It was so depressing.\u201d",
      "Despite Bernd\u2019s best efforts \u2014 one of his catchphrases is \u201cI would like to leave this show\u201d \u2014 the episodes have never become stale. He sings, he dances, he\u2019s been to space. He's the star of merchandise, a video game and headlines like \u201cGive Us Our Daily Bernd.\u201d",
      "He was even kidnapped! In 2009, his 2-meter-tall (6.56 feet) statue was stolen from his traditional place outside the town hall in Erfurt, where KiKA is based.",
      "A claim of responsibility surfaced on YouTube, by sympathizers of a group of demonstrators who were protesting a company that had produced cremation ovens for the Nazi extermination camp Auschwitz. The demonstrators, however, denied involvement in Bernd\u2019s kidnapping and the video was removed from the internet.",
      "Bernd was held hostage for nearly two weeks before being discovered unharmed in an abandoned barracks.",
      "KiKA is honoring Bernd's 25th anniversary \u2014 despite his complaints \u2014 with new episodes, an update to his hit song and online activities for kids and adults alike. The celebrations begin now, as Bernd\u2019s birthday is Feb. 29.",
      "The latest series will premiere in September as Bernd, Chili and Briegel launch the social media channel \u201cBetter with Bernd\" in their efforts to make him into a bread influencer.",

      "Working with Streep is a little like a political consultant's first client being elected president. If she likes you and word gets around, other students will follow. Teaching actors now represents about 40% of his business, the 69-year-old said.",

That was especially true with Chalamet, who needed to sing and play at the same time for a character whose artistry is the centerpiece of the film.",
      "\u201cWhen the actors come to you, they're kind of vulnerable,\u201d Saltzman said. \u201cThey want to do a great job.\u201d",
      "Saltzman had more than 50 sessions with Chalamet, starting in person and retreating to Zoom during the pandemic. It wasn't easy. Chalamet had to learn some 25 songs in the script.",
      "\u201cSometime in 2018 I had my first lesson with this great guitar teacher named Larry Saltzman who at some point became less of a teacher and more a co-sanity artist through COVID,\u201d Chalamet recalled during a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI think we were keeping each other sane. We would Zoom three, four times a week and doing songs that never made it into the movie.\u201d",
      "It helped that Saltzman is a Dylan buff. Focusing on imparting \u201cthe guitar playing of \u2018pre-electric Bob,\u2019\u201d he taught his charge so well that Chalamet was a musical guest as well as host on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d performing obscure Dylan cuts last month. Saltzman says, in the course of their sessions, Chalamet \u201cwent the extra mile\u201d and unearthed \u201cvery early, obscure\u201d Dylan songs that weren't even in the script.",
      "Saltzman generally likes teaching actors more than common folk, in part because there's a specific goal: They need to learn certain songs to inhabit a particular character. When it's open-ended \u2014 someone just wants to learn the guitar \u2014 it can be more of a challenge, he said. Saltzman also believes that it's an advantage to not be a regular teacher, someone who may approach clients with a more rigid style.",
      "Actor Johnny Cannizzaro said he appreciated Saltzman's calming \u201cbedside manner\u201d and felt welcome in an apartment filled with guitars. Cannizzaro has the role of E Street Band member \u201cLittle Steven\u201d Van Zandt in the upcoming Bruce Springsteen biopic, \u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was never really a moment where he expressed any sort of frustration or impatience with me during a session,\u201d said Cannizzaro, who has background playing keyboards but not guitar. \u201cIf anything, he would express some excitement when you grasped something he was teaching. That put me at ease.\u201d",
      "Saltzman also studied film of Van Zandt so he wasn't just teaching Cannizzaro guitar \u2014 he was showing specifics of how Van Zandt plays, the actor said.",
      "Beyond teaching, Saltzman's time is divided between studio work, playing in New York clubs accompanying different artists and Broadway \u2014 he's just about to begin \u201cSmash.\u201d",
      "It's an eye-opening experience for him to later see his students on screen. That was particularly the case when he saw \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d and marveled at Chalamet's ability as an actor.",
      "All the more reason to watch the Oscars, and to take some pride in his own work.",
      "\u201cIn my own humble way, I'm a small gear in that machinery,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is rewarding is knowing that in some small way I'm contributing to making a better film.\u201d",

      "A new album documents jazz legend Ella Fitzgerald in concert in Oakland, California, in 1967",
      "The setting is less grand than suggested by the title of a new Ella Fitzgerald album, \u201cThe Moment of Truth: Ella at the Coliseum.\u201d In this case, the coliseum is not in Rome or Los Angeles, but the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Arena in Oakland, California.",
      "Jazz giant Fitzgerald\u2019s presence elevated any event, however, and that was the case on June 30, 1967, when she performed at a concert that also included The Duke Ellington Orchestra and other luminaries.",
      "\u201cThe Moment of Truth\u201d documents Fitzgerald\u2019s set, and her incomparable alto is in typically fine form. She bounces and glides, blares and coos, bellows and whoops and scats and swings to the audience\u2019s delight. \u201cIf you love her, clap!\u201d someone shouts.",
      "The album, which will be released Friday, features performances of nine songs unearthed from the private tape collection of Verve Records founder Norman Granz. The vinyl release offers outstanding sound quality and extensive, informative liner notes by the critic Will Friedwald. He notes that while it was unusual for Fitzgerald to sing contemporary pop tunes, the set includes her only known performance of two classics from the mid-1960s \u2014 the Burt Bacharach and Hal David penned \"Alfie\u201d and Bob Crewe's \u201cMusic to Watch Girls By.\u201d",
      "Fitzgerald is accompanied by a piano trio, and on several songs by the Ellington orchestra, with whom she had a lengthy 1960s collaboration. Ellington doesn\u2019t play, however, and the understated arrangements leave the spotlight entirely to Fitzgerald. She\u2019s in a playful mood in her on stage banter, teasing a late arrival, impersonating Louis Armstrong, and ruling out a striptease.",
      "Her singing is radiant as she turns sophisticated melodies into a thrill ride. Their direction is as unpredictable as a pinball, with rhythmic daring and inventiveness that could make an arena sway. And it probably did.",
      "Fitzgerald flies high on \u201cMack the Knife,\u201d and displays jazzy verve on Benny Goodman\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Be That Way\u201d and the Tony Bennett staple \u201cThe Moment of Truth,\u201d while \u201cYou\u2019ve Changed\u201d shimmers with bluesy beauty. On \u201cLet\u2019s Do It (Let\u2019s Fall in Love),\u201d her phrasing is as clever as Cole Porter\u2019s lyrics. In her version, she injects references to the Beatles,James Bond, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor.",
      "As Friedwald notes, Fitzgerald rarely drew from the Burt Bacharach-Hal David catalogue. But her interpretation of their classic ballad \u201cAlfie\u201d is a marvel of technique, emotional investment and creativity, including a brief digression. Fitzgerald navigates the complicated melody and rhythm with ease. It's an exemplar of the album, because as always, in keeping with the advice of the lyrics, her heart leads the way.",

      "Senate Republicans in Georgia have advanced two bills restricting gender-affirming care for transgender people",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia's Senate passed two bills Monday that would ban most gender-affirming care for minors and people incarcerated in state prisons, mirroring moves by Republicans across states and a handful of executive orders by President Donald Trump targeting transgender people.",
      "The chamber voted 34-19 for a bill that would ban puberty blockers and most gender-affirming care for people under 18, including those already undergoing treatment. Georgia lawmakers in 2023 banned most gender-affirming surgeries and hormone replacement therapies for transgender minors unless they were already receiving treatment. The law lets doctors prescribe puberty blockers.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re asking (minors) to make changes that will have changes to the rest of their lives,\u201d bill sponsor Republican Sen. Ben Watson, of Savannah, said Monday. \u201cIt is not a fair decision to them. It is not a fair decision to the parents.\u201d",
      "A second bill sponsored by Senate Majority Whip Randy Robertson passed 37-15 and would ban most gender-affirming care for people incarcerated in state prisons.",
      "Last month, the chamber passed bills to ban transgender people from playing in school sports and cut off public funding for gender-affirming care for adults. The four bills will now head to the House for debate.",
      "Opponents said Republicans are playing politics by targeting transgender people and that lawmakers should focus on helping Georgians with more pressing issues such as housing and healthcare. They say both bills infringe on the rights of transgender people and their families to make decisions about gender-affirming care.",
      "\u201cThis body has promulgated bill after bill attacking trans people with the ultimate goal of making trans fols disappear. We\u2019ve been here before,\" said Senate Minority Whip Kim Jackson, a Stone Mountain Democrat who is openly lesbian.",
      "At least 26 states have adopted laws restricting gender-affirming care for minors, and most are facing lawsuits. A study released in January found that fewer than 1 in 1,000 adolescents with commercial insurance during a five-year period received gender-affirming medications such as puberty blockers or hormones.",
      "Jackson and other Democrats proposed a failed amendment to Watson\u2019s bill that would let minors receiving treatment keep going to avoid the medical and emotional ramifications of stopping midway.",
      "Sens. Elena Parent and Sonya Halpern, both Atlanta Democrats, reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the rights of transgender people but broke with their party to vote for Robertson\u2019s bill because they said they do not think taxpayers should pay for gender-affirming care for people in prison. Parent proposed an amendment to make an exception for incarcerated people already undergoing hormone replacement therapy that failed.",
      "\u201cI will not let my party be dragged into an argument that makes us look out of touch with the very people we claim to represent,\u201d Halpern said.",
      "Sen. Sally Harrell, an Atlanta Democrat who has two transgender children, took the stand toward the end of the evening.",
      "\u201cIt felt like we were debating a political football instead of people,\" Harrell said of a debate on the school sports bill. \"And so I came to this well to remind people that we are talking about very real people \u2014 parents, children, families.\u201d",

The disease is most common when a woman has an Rh negative blood type and her baby\u2019s is Rh positive.",

      "\u201cHe did it for the right reasons. As humble as he was, he did like the attention. But he would never do it for the attention,\u201d Mellowship said, adding his grandfather had been surprised to be recognized by Guinness World Records in 2005 as the person who had donated the most blood plasma in the world.",
      "The record was beaten in 2022 by American Brett Cooper from Walker, Michigan.",
      "The Australian Red Cross Blood Service said Harrison was renowned as the \u201cMan with the Golden Arm.\u201d",

      "Jarrod Mellowship said his own wife, Rebecca, also needed the treatment when three of their four children were born.",
      "There is speculation that Harrison developed a high concentrations of anti-D as a result of his own blood transfusions during major lung surgery when he was 14.",
      "\u201cAfter the surgery, his dad, Reg, told grandad you\u2019re only really alive because people donated blood,\u201d Jarrod Mellowship said. \u201cThe day he turned 18, he started donating.\u201d",

      "Measles has sickened nearly 150 mostly unvaccinated people in rural West Texas, and a school-age child has died",
      "SEMINOLE, Texas -- Measles had struck this West Texas town, sickening dozens of children, but at the Community Church of Seminole, more than 350 worshippers gathered for a Sunday service. Sitting elbow-to-elbow, they filled the pews, siblings in matching button-down shirts and dresses, little girls\u2019 hair tied neatly into pink bows.",
      "Fathers shushed babbling toddlers as their wives snuck out to change infants' diapers.",
      "A little girl in this mostly Mennonite congregation was among those who\u2019d fallen ill with the highly contagious respiratory disease, senior pastor David Klassen said \u2014 but she\u2019s doing fine, and she happily played through her quarantine. He heard that at least two Mennonite schools shut down for a bit to disinfect.",
      "What he hasn\u2019t heard: Any direct outreach from public health officials on what to do as the number of those sickened with measles has grown to 146 and a school-age child has died. And though Klassen is a trusted church and community leader, his congregants haven\u2019t asked about whether they should vaccinate their kids \u2014 and he wouldn\u2019t want to weigh in.",
      "\u201cWith this measles situation, I can honestly just tell you we haven\u2019t taken any steps as a church,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did leave it up to the mothers.\u201d",
      "As measles \u2014 a preventable disease the U.S. considered eliminated in 2000 \u2014 spreads through West Texas\u2019 rural expanse, Klassen is sticking to an approach on vaccines that is a key tenet for Mennonites. Family leaders are the top decision-making authority \u2014 not outside recommendations, certainly not government mandates.",
      "Alongside measles in this region, where voters overwhelmingly supported President Donald Trump, there\u2019s another outbreak: one of misinformation about vaccines, distrust of local public health officials and fear of governmental authority overruling family autonomy. And on the national stage, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the country\u2019s top health official and an anti-vaccine activist, dismissed the Texas outbreak as \u201cnot unusual.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo I trust all the vaccines? No,\u201d Klassen said. \u201cAnd I get from (Kennedy) that he doesn\u2019t trust all the vaccines, either. And he is very well educated in that; I\u2019m not.\u201d",
      "In an opinion piece for Fox News Digital, Kennedy wrote about the value of the vaccine but stopped short of calling on families to get it, saying the decision is \u201ca personal one.\u201d He urged parents to speak to their health care providers about options.",
      "Vaccine skepticism has also been spurred by state lawmakers who this year filed more than a dozen bills that would strengthen or expand vaccine exemptions, which Texas already allows for \u201creasons of conscience, including a religious belief.\u201d",
      "At hospitals in Lubbock, 80 miles to the north and on the front lines of the outbreak, babies with measles are struggling to breathe.",
      "Dr. Summer Davies, a Texas Tech Physicians pediatrician, said she has treated about 10 of the outbreak\u2019s patients, most very young or teens. She said children have had to be intubated, including one younger than 6 months old. Others come in with such high fevers or severe sore throats that they refuse to eat or drink to the point of dehydration.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard as a pediatrician, knowing that we have a way to prevent this and prevent kids from suffering and even death,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do agree that the herd immunity that we have established in the past isn\u2019t the same now. And I think kids are suffering because of that.\u201d",
      "In Lubbock County, 92% of kindergarteners are up to date on their measles, mumps and rubella shots, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. That\u2019s lower than the 95% threshold experts say is needed to prevent measles from spreading. Gaines County, which includes Seminole, has an 82% MMR vaccination rate, though rates for homeschooled or private school students may be much lower. The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide. Many Mennonite families don\u2019t send children to public schools.",
      "All of the children admitted with measles to Covenant Children\u2019s Hospital in Lubbock were unvaccinated, officials said last week. Dr. Lara Johnson, the hospital\u2019s chief medical officer, told The Associated Press that Covenant has seen more than 20 patients, including children, teens and pregnant mothers, since the outbreak began in late January.",
      "News of a measles case in Seminole, population 7,200, put doctors on a \u201cshared high alert,\u201d said Dr. Martin Ortega, a family physician for Texas Tech Physicians in Odessa, about an hour away. The small towns of West Texas may look completely isolated on a map, with little between them beyond oil and gas facilities and sprawling desert. But the region is connected by its people, who regularly travel long distances to grocery stores, hospitals and houses of worship.",
      "Many doctors are seeing measles cases for the first time in their careers. In Lea County, New Mexico, 30 minutes west of Seminole, nine measles cases with no clear connection to the Texas outbreak, rattled doctors and parents. An unvaccinated infant in Austin also tested positive for measles after an overseas vacation.",
      "It\u2019s \u201ca little bit surreal,\u201d said Dr. Rumbidzai Mutikani, a pediatrician at Nor-Lea Hospital District\u2019s Hobbs Medical Clinic. Parents were so concerned \u201cour phones were just ringing,\u201d Mutikani said.",
      "Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock\u2019s public health department, said West Texas' rural landscape is a major challenge, not just in getting to patients and transporting test samples, but also in getting the word out.",
      "A lot of the messaging is word of mouth, she said, but they are working on public-service announcements featuring trusted Gaines County residents, putting up billboards about measles, handing out flyers and posting in WhatsApp groups.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic caused \u201ca lot of distrust in public health\u201d and government requirements, Wells said. On Facebook, people have accused her of making up the measles outbreak. They hope her department loses its funding.",
      "It\u2019s \u201creally hurtful stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re really working to help encourage vaccines for our community and help those kids that are infected to make sure they get medical treatment so that we don\u2019t end up with another death.\u201d",
      "The reality on the ground can be nuanced, however.",
      "Brownfield Mayor Eric Horton is pro-Trump, he said, but also pro-MMR vaccine.",
      "His county was hard-hit by COVID-19, Horton said, with nearly 90 deaths. So when measles cases came to his town of 8,600, Horton feared for his community. He said the local hospital has been busy administering vaccines since the outbreak started.",
      "\u201cOut here on the south plains of Texas, we are conservative people, but we also are not anti-vaxxers,\u201d he said.",
      "Across the region, people echoed this sentiment about routine childhood vaccinations in interviews with the AP and The Texas Tribune. Often, though, they are less supportive of COVID-19 and flu shots.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that (Mennonites) don\u2019t vaccinate, and they put other people\u2019s families and children at exposure for it,\u201d said Stephen Spruill, a 36-year-old trucker from Seminole.",
      "But \"this is America. People have the right to choose.\u201d",
      "Macey Lane, 31, of Hobbs, said: \u201cI do support Donald Trump. I don\u2019t support not requiring vaccines.\u201d\u201c",
      "All of Lane\u2019s kids are vaccinated. Praising Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s vote against Kennedy\u2019s nomination, she said the fact that \u201cthe only Republican that went against RFK was a polio survivor says a lot.\u201d But she said she voted off other issues: her religious beliefs, stance on abortion and who would be best for the region\u2019s oil and gas industry.",
      "\u201cAs far as RFK being an anti-vaxxer, this is the most important thing: People have to make a decision for themselves and be as informed as they possibly can,\u201d Horton said.",
      "But in doctors' offices throughout the region, pediatricians see the consequences of that stance.",
      "Mutikani, the Hobbs pediatrician, said she\u2019s seen vaccine hesitancy increase in recent years as parents come to her with worries that line up with what\u2019s trending on social media. \u201cVirulent\u201d misinformation is especially worrisome in rural areas with few news sources or where many people who don\u2019t regularly see doctors live, she said.",
      "And having \u201cthese really big, respected public figures openly going against the grain, going against research and what we know, it makes it really, really difficult,\u201d she said.",
      "Most Texans are still vaccinating their kids, including Jennifer Sanchez, a 26-year-old Odessa resident. She took her 6-year-old and 1-year-old to the local public health department last week to get the measles vaccine.",
      "She is disinfecting her house out of an abundance of caution, wishing she had more information on how to stop the spread.",

      "Eating greasy food can keep you awake at night",
      "Anyone who has ever suffered in bed after eating three slices of pizza could surmise there is some relationship between food and sleep quality.",
      "For Marie-Pierre St-Onge, the director of Columbia University\u2019s Center of Excellence for Sleep and Circadian Research, years of studying the relationship confirmed it.",
      "Data from large-scale population studies showed that eating a lot of saturated fat and simple carbohydrates made it harder to get deep, restorative sleep, she said. The inverse was also true. People who don\u2019t get enough sleep, for example, were more likely to be obese.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a cycle of having poor sleep leading to poor dietary choices, and lower dietary quality that further propels poor sleep,\u201d St-Onge said.",
      "If bad food could keep you awake, she wondered, can good food help you sleep? Her research led to a new cookbook, \u201cEat Better, Sleep Better,\u201d co-written with Kat Craddock, editor-in-chief of the food magazine Saveur.",
      "St-Onge said the answer is yes. The book's recipes reflect her findings that people with high-fiber diets report better sleep, and the dishes rely heavily on what she called sleep-supporting ingredients.",
      "Nuts, seeds and whole grains such as barley, buckwheat and kasha contain melatonin, a compound the body also produces naturally to regulate the circadian rhythm. Research suggests the anti-inflammatory properties of ginger and turmeric improve sleep quality, as do the phytochemicals in brightly colored fruits and vegetables like squash, cherries, bananas and beefsteak tomatoes, St-Onge said.",
      "Besides the properties of particular ingredients, the combination of certain foods is key to encouraging your body to produce the hormones it needs to fall and stay sleep, she said. Tryptophan, for example, is an essential amino acid only found in food, but it requires nutrients such as magnesium, zinc and B vitamins to be converted into melatonin and serotonin.",
      "St-Onge noted that people shouldn\u2019t expect to fall dead asleep after loading up on certain ingredients at dinner. Food has to be processed, with chemical reactions transforming nutrients over time before they are absorbed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s making sure you have a healthy diet across the day to have the nutrients at the ready,\u201d she said.",
      "Recipes were developed for every meal of the day, plus snacks and desserts, the authors said. The two then arranged them into a 28-day meal plan designed to improve your sleep.",
      "Craddock said developing the recipes came naturally because the research stressed using a variety of foods she likes to cook with anyway. The challenge was making sure the recipes fell within the nutritional requirements.",
      "\u201cMy instincts are to go hard on bacon and butter and cheese and heavy cream, and she pared a lot of that back,\u201d Craddock said.",
      "Instead of bacon, Craddock said, she could achieve similar flavors with a little olive oil and smoked paprika. \u201cIt was a bit of a dance back and forth between my more restaurant approach to making foods delicious and her nutritional goals.\u201d",
      "A Creole gumbo recipe, for instance, is inspired more by a vegetarian version often served during Lent than the heavier traditional one. The andouille often used \u2014 a pork product high in saturated fat \u2014 is swapped out for healthier chicken sausage. Adding more than a pound of mixed greens makes it more like a vegetable stew, and brown rice adds a complex carbohydrate.",
      "With numerous charts and scientific research, the book is a practical guide to improving your diet in general. But Craddock said it also introduces people to international ingredients and dishes so they might think beyond what they eat every day.",
      "\u201cIf you dig a little deeper and look a little further, there are healthful and flavorful and exciting ingredients from many cultures that are right in our own backyard,\u201d she said.",

Use a slotted spoon to transfer the sausage to a heatproof bowl and reserve. Lower the heat to medium-low, then stir the flour into the oil that remains in the pot and cook, stirring frequently, just until the mixture, or roux, smells toasty, about 5 minutes. Add the onions, scallions, celery, bell pepper and bay leaves, season lightly with salt and black pepper, and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot frequently, until the onions are translucent, 12\u201314 minutes.",
      "Stir in the garlic powder, thyme, oregano and cayenne, if using, then add the greens a little at a time, allowing them to wilt before adding more, until they all fit in the pot. Stir in the chicken stock. Increase the heat to medium-high, bring the liquid to a full boil, and then decrease the heat to low, cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the broth has thickened and the greens are meltingly tender and have turned from bright green to a muted olive color, 30\u201345 minutes (if you\u2019re using hardier greens like collards, they will take a bit longer to cook, while softer varieties like baby spinach will cook quickly).",
      "Stir in the reserved sausage, cover and continue cooking for 15 minutes. Adjust the seasoning with more salt and black pepper, then ladle into soup bowls. Top each bowl with a scoop of rice and a lemon wedge and serve hot."

    "story": [
      "There's a mid-March deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown, and hesitation is surfacing among congressional Republicans about potential cuts to Medicaid",
      "WASHINGTON -- Every time a baby is born in Louisiana, where Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson handily won reelection last year, there\u2019s more than a 60% chance taxpayers will finance the birth through Medicaid.",
      "In Republican Rep. David Valadao \u2019s central California district, 6 out of 10 people use Medicaid to pay for doctor visits and emergency room trips.",
      "And one-third of the population is covered by Medicaid in GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski's Alaska, one of the nation\u2019s costliest corners for health care.",
      "Each of these Republicans \u2014 and some of their conservative colleagues \u2014 lined up last week to defend Medicaid, in a departure from long-held GOP policies. Republicans, who already have ruled out massive cuts to Social Security and Medicare, are turning their attention to siphoning as much as $880 billion from Medicaid over the next decade to help finance $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.",
      "But as a deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown nears, hesitation is surfacing among Washington's Republican lawmakers \u2014 once reliable critics of lofty government social welfare programs such as Medicaid \u2014 who say that deep cuts to the health care program could prove too untenable for people back home.",
      "\u201cI've heard from countless constituents who tell me the only way they can afford health care is through programs like Medicaid,\u201d Valadao said on the House floor. \u201cAnd I will not support a final reconciliation bill that risks leaving them behind.\u201d",
      "And on Wednesday, President Donald Trump, too, made his position on Medicaid clear: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to touch it.\u201d",
      "States and the federal government jointly pay for Medicaid, which offers nearly-free health care coverage for roughly 80 million poor and disabled Americans, including millions of children. It cost $880 billion to operate in 2023.",
      "Johnson has ruled out two of the biggest potential cuts: paying fixed, shrunken rates to states for care and changing the calculation for the share of federal dollars that each state receives for Medicaid. Just a few years ago, Johnson spearheaded a report that lobbied for some of those changes during the first Trump administration.",
      "Johnson insisted in a CNN interview that the focus will instead be ferreting out \u201cfraud, waste and abuse, in Medicaid, although it's unlikely to deliver the savings Republicans seek.",
      "GOP pressure over Medicaid is mounting, with some state party leaders joining the calls to preserve the program. States are already struggling with the growing cost of sicker patients and could be left to cover more if the federal government pulls back. In some states, the federal government picks up over 80%.",
      "More than a dozen Minnesota GOP lawmakers wrote the president recently warning that \u201ctoo deep of a cut is unmanageable in any instance.\u201d Gov. Joe Lombardo, R-Nev., told Congress in a letter that \u201cproposed reductions would put lives at risk.\" In Alaska, state Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, a Republican and nurse, cited \u201chuge concerns\u201d during a floor speech.",
      "Nationally, 55% of Americans said the government spends too little on Medicaid, according to a January poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s now a very popular program that touches a very broad cross-section of American society,\u201d said Drew Altman, president of the health care research firm KFF. \u201cRoughly half of the American people say that they or a family member have at one time been served by the program.\u201d",
      "Significant changes to Medicaid are still on the table. They have to be for Republicans get the savings they need to pay for tax cuts.",
      "Work requirements, which could save as much as $109 billion over the next decade, seem to have solid support among GOP members, with some individual Republican-led states already moving to implement them.",
      "Republicans also could consider cuts in benefits or coverage, as well as eliminating a provider tax that states use to finance Medicaid, Altman added.",
      "Democrats warn that reductions are inevitable and could be dire.",
      "Starting Monday, TV ads will caution people across 20 congressional districts that hospitals are at risk of closing and millions of people could lose coverage if Republicans cut Medicaid \"to fund massive tax cuts for Elon Musk and billionaires.\u201d The Democratic super political action committee House Majority Forward has launched the seven-figure campaign.",
      "Trump and Republicans have for years called to lower government spending on health care, but they have struggled to formulate a serious plan that gains traction. Trump, for example, has spent nearly a decade arguing for an overhaul of the Affordable Care Act. His efforts to repeal the Obama-era national health care law failed during his first term and in his most recent presidential campaign he offered only \u201cconcepts of a plan\u201d to adapt the program.",
      "Michael Cannon, a director of health studies at libertarian Cato Institute, believes Medicaid needs an overhaul because it is a significant part of the federal budget and a contributor to the nation's growing debt.",
      "But Republicans, he said, are not looking at serious ways to drive down the cost of health care.",
      "\u201cThe only reason for the cuts right now is to pay for the tax cuts,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cNone of them are talking about the need to do better health reform.\u201d",

      "Nurse Tosha Trostle wrote that she had begged the attacker to let her go and that he pushed the gun against her neck and spine. When they encountered police, she prayed as she heard gunshots and smelled smoke, then heard bullet casings hitting the floor, she wrote.",
      "\u201cI eventually fell into the floor under the weight of the shooter\u2019s body. The officers told me to run. I struggled to get out from under him,\u201d Trostle wrote. \u201cI remember his limp cold hand against my face as I pushed away with my feet.\u201d",
      "She fell twice trying to get to her feet before an officer guided her into another room.",
      "Phone and Facebook messages were left for Trostle on Wednesday. A nurse from the hospital who didn\u2019t want to be identified by name because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss the events confirmed the posting was from Trostle\u2019s Facebook account.",
      "Authorities say Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz, 49, brought a gun and zip ties to UPMC Memorial Hospital in York on Saturday morning and was holding hostages when responding officers fatally shot him.",
      "West York Patrolman Andrew Duarte, 30, was shot and killed. Two other officers and three hospital employees were wounded, authorities said.",
      "Trostle recounted that she had been drawing blood when she heard a commotion and went into a hallway.",
      "\u201cAfter all I thought I was responding to a staff assist, patient fall, one in a dozen possible occurrences; not an active shooter. When I rounded the corner of the back hall I was met in the distance by the shooter holding my coworker, Jess, at gunpoint,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Her colleague, Jessica Breighner, was forced to zip-tie her.",
      "\u201cI saw the fear in her eyes, fear does not sound like enough really though,\u201d Trostle wrote.",
      "The attacker\u2019s shoes became etched into Trostle\u2019s mind as she lay at his feet, thinking the gun might have jammed and then hearing him reload, she added.",
      "\u201cSo many things happened I cannot recount step by step,\" she wrote, \"but how I remember those red sneakers.\"",
      "Jason Huff, Breighner\u2019s partner of more than 20 years, also described the incident in a separate Facebook post on Wednesday that said the attacker had pulled the trigger three times with the gun against Breighner\u2019s head, but it was apparently out of ammunition.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when she knew it was time to take her shot,\u201d Huff wrote. \u201cShe broke her zip ties while he reloaded and ran -- thank God.\u201d",
      "Huff told The Associated Press she hopes to talk publicly about it later, with the others who survived the attack.",
      "Huff wrote on Facebook that before fleeing, Breighner had to \u201clisten to this criminal call and warn someone to clean out the apartment and get the jewelry because he\u2019s not coming home and was ready to die.\u201d",
      "York County District Attorney Tim Barker said Saturday that Archangel-Ortiz appeared to have had recent contact with the intensive care unit \u201cfor a medical purpose involving another person\u201d but declined to elaborate.",
      "Asked about the nurses\u2019 accounts, a UPMC spokesperson said the health system prioritizes safety and privacy but referred questions to law enforcement.",
      "Trostle said the attacker \u201chauled me off the floor pushing me into the adjacent wall,\u201d where Breighner's photo was among pictures of the group\u2019s leadership on the wall.",
      "\u201cPushing the gun into my neck and spine. I begged to go home to my children. He petted my head and promised I would that I was doing everything right,\u201d Trostle wrote.",
      "She said he directed her to take him to the floor where the most people were. As they went through a doorway, they encountered what she called \u201ca wall of armed officers aimed at us.\u201d",
      "After the shooting, she was led down a stairway. In the days since, the memory has haunted Trostle and her family, she said.",
      "\u201cMy physical injuries do not even compare fractionally to what injuries are unseen,\u201d Trostle wrote. \u201cI live with immense sadness and guilt of all who responded, their mental and physical injuries.

      "\"While there is always more change to advocate for, this contract is a huge step in the right direction and lays a great foundation to build upon to ensure continued quality care for our community and quality of life for our members,\" Jahnavi Chandrashekar, MD, an internist at Providence St. Vincent and member of the bargaining team, said at the time. \"It means that when we go back to work, we will have safer staffing, be able to better recruit and retain hospitalists, and can spend more time with our patients.

      "\u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d starring Natalie Morales and Sonequa Martin-Green, confronts a dark reality of post-combat struggle with as much humor and playfulness as it does trauma and sorrow",
      "Even for a film titled \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d the opening scenes of Kyle Hausmann-Stoke\u2019s movie have a startling rhythm.",
      "First, two female American soldiers are riding in a Humvee in Afghanistan 2016 blasting Rihanna\u2019s \u201cUmbrella.\u201d They are clearly friends, and more concerned with the music coming through loudly than enemy fire. Merit (Natalie Morales) tells Zoe (Sonequa Martin-Green) that they ever set foot in \u201csome dopy group therapy,\" to please kill her.",
      "Cut to years later, they\u2019re sitting in a counseling meeting for veterans and Morales\u2019 character has a sour look at her face. She turns to her friend: \u201cDid we survive the dumbest war of all time just to sit here all broken and kumbaya and ouchie-my-feelings?\u201d",
      "But after this rush of cavalier soldiering and bitter sarcasm comes a sobering moment. Merit blinks her eyes and is instead staring at an empty chair. Zoe isn\u2019t there at all.",
      "\u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d co-starring Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris, confronts a dark reality of post-combat struggle with as much humor and playfulness as it does trauma and sorrow. It comes from a real place, and you can tell. Hausmann-Stoke is himself a veteran and \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d is dedicated to a pair of his platoon mates who committed suicide. The opening titles note the film was \u201cinspired by a true story.\u201d",
      "Audience disinterest has characterized many, though not all, of the films about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and the output has pretty much dried up over the years. \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d feels like it was made with an awareness of that trend and as a rebuke to it.",
      "This is an often breezy and funny movie for what, on paper, is a difficult and dark story. But the comic tone of \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d is, itself, a spirited rejection to not just the heaviness of many films about veterans but of the grief that can consume those who have dealt with loss and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "Throughout the film, Zoe appears only to Merit, ala Brad Pitt in \u201cFight Club,\u201d singing alongside her as she drives or impatiently waiting for Merit to come home from a run. Whether this, following some unspecified end to Zoe, is a healthy thing or not for Merit is increasingly in doubt. Merit needs to cling to her friend, or her memory of her. But Zoe also rolls her eyes at any suggestion of talking through her feelings. Zoe, as an apparition, is both the cause and relief to her pain.",
      "There are a few other points of view, courtesy of two of our finest actors. Freeman plays the counselor of Merit\u2019s mandatory group sessions. He refuses to let Zoe coast. To pressure her to share and participate, he threatens withholding Zoe's certification.",
      "Meanwhile, Merit\u2019s grandfather, Dale (Harris), a Vietnam vet, has just been diagnosed with early Alzheimer\u2019s. Merit is tasked with keeping an eye on him at his rural lakeside cabin and helping him into a retirement community \u2014 a prospect that infuriates him. As Merit\u2019s original inspiration for joining the army, Dale \u2014 stubborn and tight-lipped \u2014 epitomizes an earlier generation of soldier.",
      "In toggling between the present and wartime flashbacks, \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d is sometimes a bumpy ride. The interplay between Merit and Zoe also shifts, beginning more like a buddy comedy and veering toward horror-film haunting, especially when Merit hesitantly agrees to a date with a worker at the prospective retirement home (Utkarsh Ambudkar).",
      "But the movie\u2019s earnestness carries it through these less smooth moments. So does the cast. Any opportunity to see Freeman or Harris, still at the top of their games, is a chance to be treasured. Freeman is typically sage and Harris characteristically fiery. But the leads are even better. Morales is at her finest as a cynical soldier, devoted to her friend but little else. And with compelling poise, Martin-Green (\"The Walking Dead\") carries a movie that at times can feel scattershot but never not sincere.",
      "\u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d a Briarcliff Entertainment release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language. Running time: 101 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "The Department of Veterans Affairs has temporarily suspended billions of dollars in contract cuts after an uproar that critical veterans health services were harmed, lawmakers and veterans service organizations said Wednesday",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Department of Veterans Affairs has temporarily suspended billions of dollars in planned contract cuts following concerns that the move would hurt critical veterans' health services, lawmakers and veterans service organizations said Wednesday.",
      "The pause affects hundreds of VA contracts that Secretary Doug Collins a day earlier described as simply consulting deals, whose cancellation would save $2 billion as the Trump administration works to slash costs across the federal government.",
      "\u201cNo more paying consultants to do things like make Power Point slides and write meeting minutes!\u201d Collins posted to X Tuesday, in a post that was then lauded by Elon Musk, President Donald Trump's cost-cutting chief at the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "The Associated Press has obtained the full list of 875 affected contracts, which shows the cuts would affect everything from cancer care to the ability to assess toxic exposure. The list underscores how the Trump administration\u2019s approach to broad spending reductions has immediate and potentially unintended consequences, generating significant concern not just among Democrats but also Republican lawmakers.",
      "The VA said in a statement to the AP that its review of the contracts \u201cis ongoing and not final.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not be eliminating any benefits or services to Veterans or VA beneficiaries, and there will be no negative impact to VA health care, benefits or beneficiaries. We are always going to take care of Veterans at VA. Period,\u201d VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz said in a statement.",
      "One contract that was on the chopping block supports assessing veterans' disability ratings. Those evaluations are one of the most important steps needed for a veteran to qualify to have their medical care covered and receive financial compensation if they were wounded due to their military service. An inaccurate rating can have a long-term impact on their access to care and financial support.",
      "Another contract is intended to identify and integrate data between the Pentagon, VA and other agencies to support the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022, a bill passed in 2022 to increase veterans\u2019 access to care.",
      "Some of the other contracts marked for cancellation also directly affect veterans' care.",
      "At a joint House and Senate hearing Wednesday with veterans services organizations, Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal submitted a partial list of the affected contracts his office had received and submitted it for the congressional record.",
      "If carried out, these cuts \u201cwill harm veterans and taxpayers for years to come,\u201d Blumenthal said in a statement.",
      "In an internal VA email sent Tuesday and seen by the AP, a VA contracting official said DOGE targeted contracts broadly categorized as \u201cconsulting\u201d but they included ones that if terminated would halt chemotherapy and imaging services.",
      "Contracts to calibrate radiation detection equipment, to support cancer care and veterans cemetery management, among others were also targeted. Another would directly affect the ability to assess toxic exposure because it supports more than 24,000 research requests to look through the National Archives and Records Administration and other government sources to validate service and toxic exposure events.",
      "Former VA Secretary David Shulkin, who served in the Trump administration in his first term, said that while the agency has gotten larger and there are likely savings to be found, the VA grew, in part, to meet the large expansion of veterans enrolling to get care under the PACT Act. More than 740,000 veterans signed up for coverage after the law passed, according to a September 2024 VA press release.",
      "\u201cI do think slowing down and pausing to see what the consequences are, even if they are unintended consequences, is important to do,\u201d Shulkin told The Associated Press.",
      "Veterans service organizations called for \u201dimmediate transparency\u201d on what contracts were affected.",
      "\u201cWith funding suddenly stripped from contractors processing claims, conducting medical screenings and expanding outreach, there are growing concerns veterans will face delays, denials and disruptions in accessing critical services,\u201d said Rosie Torres, executive director of Burn Pits 360.",
      "The group advocates for veterans who face life-altering respiratory illnesses and cancers due to toxic exposure to dangerous air particle matter generated from massive trash-burning fires at overseas bases.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Forest Service has terminated $75 million awarded to the Arbor Day Foundation to help disadvantaged communities plant trees",
      "Arthur Johnson has lived in New Orleans' Lower 9th Ward for nearly three decades, long enough to appreciate the trees that filter pollution from the big ships traveling the nearby Mississippi River and that offer shade on sweltering summer days.",
      "When Hurricane Katrina roared through two decades ago, it wiped out 200,000 trees across the city, including many in Johnson's neighborhood and several in his own yard. The city has struggled ever since to restore its tree canopy.",
      "Those efforts will be set back by the U.S. Forest Service's decision in mid-February to terminate a $75 million grant to the Arbor Day Foundation, which was working to plant trees in neighborhoods that might not otherwise be able to afford them. The program is the latest victim of a drive by President Donald Trump's administration against environmental justice initiatives.",
      "In New Orleans, part of the money was going to the environmental group Sustaining Our Urban Landscape (SOUL), which has planted more than 1,600 trees in the historically Black community but has now paused plans for another 900.",
      "Those are trees that largely low-income residents otherwise couldn\u2019t afford to plant or maintain, said the 71-year-old Johnson, who runs a local nonprofit, the Lower 9th Ward Center for Sustainable Engagement and Development, that has helped SOUL with its work and done some tree plantings of its own in the area.",
      "\u201cYou're not just cutting out the tree, the environment\u201d with such cuts, said Johnson. If those trees aren\u2019t replaced and more aren\u2019t continually added, \u201cit really takes a toll on the sustainability of the Lower 9th Ward and its community.\u201d",
      "The benefits of trees are vast. They capture stormwater and replenish groundwater. They help clean the air in polluted areas, improve mental health, and cool air and surfaces of the built environment, especially during heat waves that are growing more intense and frequent with climate change.",
      "One study by the UCLA Luskin Center found that shade can reduce heat stress on the human body from 25% to 35% throughout the day. And much research shows that low-income and communities of color have fewer trees \u2014 and are hotter \u2014 than better-off neighborhoods.",
      "The Arbor Day Fund's grant was part of former President Joe Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, which sent $1.5 billion to the forest service\u2019s Urban and Community Forestry program. In a Feb. 14 email canceling the grant, the Forest Service wrote that the award \"no longer effectuates agency priorities regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and activities.\u201d",
      "But Dan Lambe, the Arbor Day Foundation's chief executive, said the projects weren't just going to serve disadvantaged people. They were going to benefit every member of the community, he said. In total, 105 nonprofits, municipalities and Indigenous organizations \u2014 from Alaska to Florida to Maine \u2014 have lost funding for critical environmental projects, the foundation said.",
      "\u201cThis was an opportunity to make a really meaningful impact on people\u2019s lives, so it\u2019s been disappointing,\" Lambe said.",
      "The Forest Service didn't say if other recipients of the $1.5 billion forestry investment also had grants terminated. In a statement, its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said the agency was following directions to comply with Trump's executive orders.",
      "\u201cProtecting the people and communities we serve, as well as the infrastructure, businesses, and resources they depend on to grow and thrive, remains a top priority for the USDA and the Forest Service,\u201d the agency said.",
      "For SOUL in New Orleans, losing the grant means they don't have the money to water trees already planted, and they've had to drop plans to hire three people. Another $2.5 million grant is on hold due to the federal funding freeze, and founder and executive director Susannah Burley said the nonprofit's survival is uncertain. Its annual budget is a little more than $1 million.",
      "\u201cWe kind of are lost because we don\u2019t know if we should be planning to close our doors or if we should be planning for next season,\u201d she said.",
      "For others who were set to get Arbor Day Foundation money, the loss is not existential but still devastating. In the city-county of Butte-Silver Bow in southwest Montana, forester Trevor Peterson was going to use a $745,250 grant to buy chain saws, rigging gear and other essential tools, remove up to 200 dead or dying cottonwoods and plant as many as 1,000 trees as part of a decades-long effort to replenish trees cut to make way for copper mining. He wanted to help organize large community events focused on education, hoping to impart the knowledge necessary for future stewardship of the urban forest.",
      "\u201cWe will now have to go back to the drawing board to determine where to go from here,\u201d he said.",
      "Jackson County, Oregon, was awarded a $600,000 grant to replant trees after wildfires in 2020 destroyed thousands of homes and charred more than 60,000 trees. The town of Talent lost two-thirds of its trees.",
      "The nonprofit Oregon Urban Rural and Community Forestry, founded in the fires' aftermath, fought for years to get a single dollar, recalled Mike Oxendine, the group's founder and director.",
      "The grant money from the Arbor Day Foundation was being used to help low-income and disadvantaged mobile home park residents \u2014 among the hardest-hit by the fires \u2014 identify and remove hazardous trees badly burned or killed, and replant trees for shade and cooling.",
      "\u201cThis is a rural red area that needs it badly,\u201d said Oxendine. \u201cWe hit temperatures that exceed 110 degrees every summer now. We go through massive droughts and we\u2019re always prone to wildfire here.\u201d",
      "The loss of funding will create a \u201ctremendous burden\u201d for the organization, he said.",

      "The number of babies born in South Korea has rebounded for the first time in nine years",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- The number of babies born in South Korea rebounded for the first time in nine years in 2024, welcome news for a country grappling with one of the the world\u2019s most serious demographic crises.",
      "South Korea\u2019s statistics agency said Wednesday that 238,300 babies were born last year, an increase of 8,300 from a year earlier. It said the country\u2019s fertility rate \u2014 the average number of babies born to each woman in their reproductive years \u2014 was 0.75 in 2024, up from 0.72 in 2023.",
      "It\u2019s the first time that the yearly number of births has increased since 2015.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say this is a considerably meaningful rebound,\u201d Choi Yoon Kyung, an expert at the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education, said Thursday. \u201cWe still have to see figures in the next few years to find whether it was a temporary rebound or it was driven by structural changes.\u201d",
      "Park Hyun Jung, a senior official at the Statistics Korea, said that her agency assessed the increase in births was partly attributable to an increase in marriages among couples who delayed weddings during the COVID-19 pandemic period.",
      "Park said that another factor behind the rebound was a growing number of people entering their early 30s. She also cited a government survey showing a small increase in the number of young people hoping to have children after marriage.",
      "Official data show South Korea\u2019s fertility rate has been the lowest in the developed world in recent years. In 2022, it was the only country whose fertility rate was below 1 among members of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "The low fertility rate poses a major potential threat to South Korea\u2019s economy, Asia's fourth largest, as it will cause labor shortages and greater welfare spendings. South Korea\u2019s central and regional governments have been increasingly offering a variety of financial incentives and other support programs to those who give birth to children.",
      "But experts say that it will be extremely difficult to address the country's demographic challenges as young people don't want to have babies, owing to a mix of factors that make it difficult to raise them in the brutally competitive, fast-changing country. They cite expensive housing, low levels of social mobility, the huge cost of raising and educating children and a culture that requires women to handle far more of childcare.",
      "Park said that the fertility rate will likely stay on an upward trend at least for another year. But observers say it remains to be seen whether the rate will go back down as post-pandemic marriages even out. The country\u2019s demographic structure will also eventually see a drop in people in their early 30s.",
      "Some experts argue that the government should focus on supporting young couples who want to have babies, rather than providing broad programs meant to address diverse social problems.",
      "\u201cThere are still people with solid wills to have a family and babies. When we help them realize their hopes, our fertility rate won\u2019t suffer a steep, 45-degree drop,\u201d Choi said."

Cases were most common in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia where incomes are low and health services insufficient.",
      "In places where measles have largely been eradicated, cases have been spread by travelers from other countries.",
      "While measles-related deaths declined slightly in 2023, the number of outbreaks increased. Major outbreaks took place in 57 countries in 2023, including India and Indonesia, Russia, Yemen and Iraq. The largest number of cases in 2023 was 311,500 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "The worldwide rate of childhood vaccinations has fallen in recent years, to 83% in 2023 from 86% in 2019, partly due to disruptions in immunization and health care due to the pandemic.",
      "The WHO estimates that vaccination helped to prevent more than 60 million deaths worldwide between 2000 and 2023, as efforts to get the shots to more people ramped up. In 2000, 800,062 people are estimated to have died of measles. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, major epidemics caused about 2.6 million deaths a year.",
      "Measles is so highly infectious that 95% immunity is required to prevent epidemics, the WHO says. Put another way, it infects about 9 of 10 people exposed if they lack immunity.",

      "A bill that would strip gender identity protections from Iowa\u2019s civil rights code has received final legislative approval and now goes to the governor",
      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- Iowa lawmakers became the first in the nation to approve legislation removing gender identity protections from the state\u2019s civil rights code Thursday, despite massive protests by opponents who say it could expose transgender people to discrimination in numerous areas of life.",
      "The measure raced through the legislative process after first being introduced last week. The state Senate was first to approve the bill on Thursday, on party lines, followed by the House less than an hour later. Five House Republicans joined all Democrats in voting against it.",
      "The bill would remove gender identity as a protected class from the state\u2019s civil rights law and explicitly define female and male, as well as gender, which would be considered a synonym for sex and \u201cshall not be considered a synonym or shorthand expression for gender identity, experienced gender, gender expression, or gender role.\u201d",
      "The measure would be the first legislative action in the U.S. to remove nondiscrimination protections based on gender identity, said Logan Casey, director of policy research at the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ+ rights think tank.",
      "The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who signed earlier policies banning sports participation and public bathroom access for transgender students. A spokesperson for Reynolds declined to comment on whether she would sign the bill. If she does, it will go into effect on July 1.",
      "Hundreds of LGBTQ+ advocates streamed into the Capitol rotunda on Thursday waving signs reading \u201cTrans rights are human rights\u201d and chanting slogans including \u201cNo hate in our state!\u201d There was a heavy police presence, with state troopers stationed around the rotunda. Of the 167 people who signed up to testify at a 90-minute public hearing before a House committee, all but 24 were opposed to the bill.",
      "Protesters who watched the vote from the House gallery loudly booed and shouted \u201cShame!\u201d as the chamber adjourned. Many admonished Iowa state Rep. Steven Holt, who floor managed the bill and delivered a fierce defense of it before it passed.",
      "Supporters of the change say the current law incorrectly codified the idea that people can transition to another gender and granted transgender women access to spaces such as bathrooms, locker rooms and sports teams that should be protected for people who were assigned female at birth. Holt said the inclusion of gender identity in the civil rights codes threatens recent \u201ccommonsense\u201d laws to ban transgender participation in sports and access to bathrooms.",
      "\u201cThe legislature of Iowa for the future of our children and our culture has a vested interest and solemn responsibility to stand up for immutable truth,\u201d Holt said.",
      "The Iowa lawmakers\u2019 actions came as the Georgia House backed away from removing gender protections from the state\u2019s hate crimes law, which was passed in 2020 after the death of Ahmaud Arbery.",
      "Iowa\u2019s current civil rights law protects against discrimination based on race, color, creed, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin or disability status.",
      "Sexual orientation and gender identity were not originally included in the state\u2019s Civil Rights Act of 1965. They were added by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2007, also with the support of about a dozen Republicans across the two chambers.",
      "Iowa state Rep. Aime Wichtendahl was the last Democrat to speak out Thursday against the bill removing those protections, becoming emotional as she offered her personal story as a transgender woman, saying: \"I transitioned to save my life.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe purpose of this bill and the purpose of every anti-trans bill is to further erase us from public life and to stigmatize our existence,\u201d Wichtendahl said. \u201cThe sum total of every anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ bill is to make our existence illegal.\u201d",
      "About half of U.S. states include gender identity in their civil rights code to protect against discrimination in housing and public places, such as stores or restaurants, according to the Movement Advancement Project. Some additional states do not explicitly protect against such discrimination but it is included in legal interpretations of statutes.",
      "Iowa\u2019s Supreme Court has expressly rejected the argument that discrimination based on sex includes discrimination based on gender identity.",
      "Several Republican-led legislatures are pushing to enact more laws this year creating legal definitions of male and female based on the reproductive organs at birth following an executive order from President Donald Trump.",
      "Trump also signed orders laying the groundwork for banning transgender people from military service and keeping transgender girls and women out of girls and women\u2019s sports competitions, among other things. Most of the policies are being challenged in court.",

      "Dr. Hector Granados treats children with diabetes at his El Paso clinics and makes hospital rounds under the shadow of accusations that have thrown his career into jeopardy: providing care to transgender youth",
      "EL PASO, Texas -- On the Texas border, Dr. Hector Granados treats children with diabetes at his El Paso clinics and makes hospital rounds under the shadow of accusations that have thrown his career into jeopardy: providing care to transgender youth.",
      "In what's believed to be a U.S. first, Texas is suing Granados and two other physicians over claims that they violated the state's ban on gender-affirming care for minors, calling the doctors \u201cscofflaws\u201d in lawsuits filed last fall that threaten to impose steep fines and revoke their medical licenses. He denies the accusations, and all three doctors have asked courts to dismiss the cases.",
      "The cases are a pivotal test of intensifying Republican efforts to prevent such treatments, including President Donald Trump's executive order that would bar federal support for gender-affirming care for youth under 19.",
      "Some hospitals have already begun unwinding services for pediatric patients. But, so far, only Texas is demonstrating what punishing doctors looks like when bans are allegedly broken.",
      "Granados, in an interview with The Associated Press, said he was meticulous in halting transgender care before Texas' ban took effect in 2023. He denied that he continued prescribing puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to transitioning patients and said he was initially unclear which patients, who are not named in the lawsuit, he is accused of wrongfully treating.",
      "The other accused doctors \u2014 both in Dallas \u2014 are under temporary court orders not to see patients and only practice medicine in research and academic settings.",
      "\u201cLooking at the patients was hard because they were kind of disappointed of what was going on,\u201d Granados said of ending their care. \u201cBut it was something that needed to be followed because it\u2019s the law.\u201d",
      "The lawsuits are believed to be the first time a state has brought enforcement under laws that ban or restrict gender-affirming care for minors, which Republicans have enacted in 27 states, including this month in Kansas over the Democratic governor\u2019s veto. Although those accused of violating bans face criminal charges in some states, they do not in Texas.",
      "Nationwide, doctors and hospital executives are reevaluating transgender health programs that carry a widening risk of litigation and losing federal funding. For transgender Americans, the climate has narrowed options for care and deepened fears.",
      "Trump has launched a broad charge against transgender rights quickly in his second term, signing executive orders that include barring schools from using federal education dollars to support students who are socially transitioning. Supporters say restrictions protect vulnerable children from what they see as a \u201cradical\u201d ideology about gender and making irreversible medical decisions.",
      "The Texas lawsuits were brought by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has previously gone beyond the state's borders to launch investigations into gender-affirming treatment.",
      "His office did not respond to requests for an interview. At a court hearing Wednesday involving the Dallas doctors, an attorney in Paxton\u2019s office declined to comment and referred questions to the agency\u2019s press office.",
      "\u201cI will enforce the law to the fullest extent to prevent any doctor from providing these dangerous drugs to kids,\u201d Paxton said in a statement this month.",
      "Granados is one of two pediatric endocrinologists in El Paso, a desert city of about 700,000 where mountains rise in the distance.",
      "Granados, 48, is from Ciudad Juarez, the neighboring Mexican city that sprawls out south of El Paso. He said that after attending medical school in Mexico he completed additional training in New York and Connecticut but he wanted to return to what he said is an underserved region.",
      "He opened a gender clinic at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso before starting his own practice in 2019. Before the ban, Granados said, treating transgender youth was just an extension of his practice that also treats youth with diabetes, growth problems and early puberty.",
      "He said he accepted transgender patients only if they had first received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria from a mental health provider.",
      "\u201cIt was not different from doing everything else that a pediatric endocrinologist does,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just taking care of children who required that specific therapy.\u201d",
      "Emiliana Edwards was among them. Now 18, she called Granados an \u201camazing\u201d caregiver who carefully explained her gender-affirming treatment. But at her first appointment after Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed the ban in 2023, Edwards said the room felt different, \u201clike there were wires everywhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt felt like we couldn\u2019t talk about anything really, even the most simple stuff,\u201d she said.",
      "Her mother, Lorena Edwards, said Granados put a \u201ccold stop\u201d to her daughter\u2019s care.",
      "\u201cIt was just: \u2018I don\u2019t provide that care anymore.\u2019 And it was done,\u201d she said.",
      "At the heart of Texas' lawsuits against Granados, Dr. May Lau and Dr. M. Brett Cooper are allegations of prescribing treatment to transition their patients' sex after the ban took effect.",
      "In one instance, the state accuses Granados of prescribing testosterone to a 16-year-old, alleging that although the doctor's records identify the patient as male, the teenager's sex assigned at birth is female. Granados and Lau are also accused of having instructed patients to wait until after the ban was in place to fill prescriptions.",
      "Granados does not dispute that he has continued prescribing puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy. He said those treatments are not for gender transition but for children with endocrine disorders, which occur when hormone levels are too high or too low.",
      "He said he prescribes testosterone for many reasons, including for patients whose testicles don\u2019t work or had to be removed because of cancer. Others have brain tumors, or surgery or radiation to the brain, that impact puberty. Patients with early onset puberty also need puberty blockers, he said.",
      "Attorneys for Lau said she has always complied with the law and the claims have no merit. Attorneys for Cooper did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "\u201cThis is really part of a bigger pattern of extremism within the state that even other states have shied away from replicating,\u201d said Sarah Warbelow, vice president of legal for the Human Rights Campaign.",
      "Transgender adults and youth make up less than 1% of the U.S. population, according to estimates by the Williams Institute, an LGBTQ+ research center at the UCLA School of Law.",
      "Granados' trial has been set for late October; trial dates have not yet been set yet for Lau and Cooper. While the cases are pending, Lau and Cooper agreed to practice medicine only in research and academic settings and not see patients.",
      "Neither Lau or Cooper attended the Wednesday hearing in their cases by a judge who is set to decide where their trials will be held.",
      "Under Texas' ban, the state medical board is instructed to revoke the licenses of doctors who are found to have violated the law.",
      "Lorena Edwards said she watched her daughter thrive during her transition then descend into melancholy as laws targeting transgender rights gained steam.",
      "Emiliana Edwards has switched to receiving treatment in neighboring New Mexico \u2014 where gender-affirming care is legal \u2014 but she said attacks on the transgender community have taken a toll on her mental health.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re normal people, too, and we\u2019re just trying to live,\u201d she said.",

      "China\u2019s annual major political event gets underway this week to endorse decisions already made by the all-powerful Chinese Communist Party",
      "BEIJING -- BEIJING (AP) \u2014 China\u2019s annual major political event gets underway this week, bringing together the nation\u2019s top leaders and thousands of provincial leaders to endorse decisions already made by the all-powerful Chinese Communist Party.",
      "The meetings and gathering during the National People's Congress, expected to last for about a week, are still important. The rubber-stamp parliament retains an important function: to signal the priorities of the government for the coming year and to disseminate instructions to party members and officials across the country.",
      "The messaging from leadership appears unchanged from previous years \u2014 stay the course on fostering innovation while also spurring domestic consumption.",
      "The question will be how they balance those two goals, and will it be enough to reinvigorate the economy? And to what extent will the government buffer the impact of what might be another phase in the U.S.-China trade war?",
      "This year also marks the end of China's current 5-year plan, and experts will be looking for clues on the government's priorities for the next, 2026 to 2030 plan.",
      "Here is what to watch for at this year\u2019s event:",
      "The National People\u2019s Congress kicks off on Wednesday, with Premier Li Qiang, China\u2019s top economic official, announcing the economic growth target for the year.",
      "Analysts expect it to come in at around 5% \u2013 holding the same target as the previous two years, and slightly lower than the 5.5% target in 2022. This would be no small feat considering China is still grappling with a sluggish real estate sector and lackluster consumer spending.",
      "Another uncertainty is trade tensions with the U.S. under President Donald Trump, who last month slapped a 10% tariff on Chinese imports while an additional 10% comes into effect on Tuesday. Forecasters at the International Monetary Fund are projecting a lower 4.6% growth rate this year.",
      "A commentary last Friday from the official Xinhua News Agency indicated that priority would be placed on boosting domestic demand and promoting innovation in science and technology.",
      "There's also anticipation of more government support for the private sector to fuel growth.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping met in February with business leaders, including Alibaba founder Jack Ma and Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei, signaling support for the private sector at the highest level of leadership. A draft bill is also to be deliberated during the Congress over making a fairer and more equitable business environment for the private sector.",
      "China has already released a slew of measures to prop up the economy. Much of these have fallen short of hopes for a bigger stimulus, and analysts are tempering expectations on what to expect from the Congress.",
      "\u201cI would not expect anything ... to come out that will really meaningfully shift that policy away from industrial policy and towards boosting consumption in meaningful, sufficient ways,\u201d said Jacob Gunter, lead analyst for the economics research team at the Mercator Institute for China Studies.",
      "Instead, experts say leaders are staying the course on pushing for innovation that would boost China\u2019s self-reliance.",
      "The purpose of the economy is no longer to improve household incomes and expand the middle class, Gunter said.",
      "\"This is not a development-oriented economy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a geopolitically oriented economy, and technology and industry are way more important for that.\u201d",
      "Li is expected to touch on foreign policy and Taiwan, but more attention will likely be on Foreign Minister Wang Yi.",
      "His annual press conference, to be held later in the week, will be closely watched to decipher China\u2019s stance on U.S.-China relations under Trump. After the first 10% tariffs in February, China retaliated with a 15% tariff on American coal and liquefied natural gas, as well as 10% on crude oil, agriculture machinery and large-engine cars.",
      "\u201cBeijing\u2019s response to Trump\u2019s initial 10% tariffs was measured \u2014 restrained enough to signal openness to negotiations yet firm enough to demonstrate its willingness to escalate if necessary,\u201d Neil Thomas and Jing Qian wrote in a report for the Asia Society Policy Institute.",
      "They note that China\u2019s president might use speeches in closed-door meetings during the Congress to send signals on bilateral relations, as he did two years ago when Xi named the United States as leading \u201ccontainment encirclement and suppressions\u201d against China.",
      "Also closely watched will be China\u2019s relations with Russia and its position on the Ukraine war. At a recent Group of 20 foreign minister\u2019s meeting in South Africa, Wang said a \u201cwindow for peace is opening\u201d in Ukraine, and that China supported \u201call efforts committed to peace, including the recent consensus reached by the United States and Russia.\u201d",
      "The legislature is made up of nearly 3,000 delegates from China\u2019s provinces, ministries, People\u2019s Liberation Army, party organizations and various groups that represent workers and other interests.",
      "Their role is largely ceremonial in that the body does not have any real power to decide on legislation. Any vote is usually unanimous or near-unanimous to formalize decisions already taken by Communist Party leaders behind closed doors.",
      "Still, the Congress is a rare opportunity to see what the central government\u2019s sees as priorities and goals, and the reports and speeches during it can give indications of the future direction of government policy.",
      "An advisory body, the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, will meet at the same time. Members include business leaders, athletes, academics, religious leaders and representatives of ethnic groups. The concurrent meetings of the two bodies are known as the Two Sessions.",

      "Not even one of Trump\u2019s most fervent fans in Greenland \u2014 who proudly wears a MAGA hat, and a T-shirt emblazoned with Trump pumping his fist and the words: \u201cAmerican Badass\u201d \u2014 wants to be American.",
      "But like other Greenlanders, he wants stronger ties to the U.S. and to open for business beyond Denmark, which colonized them 300 years ago and still exercises control over foreign and defense policy.",
      "\u201cWhen Trump came to office, he wanted to talk to Greenlanders directly without going through Denmark. He wants to negotiate with us and that\u2019s why the Danish are very afraid,\u201d said J\u00f8rgen Boassen, who has visited the White House and welcomed Donald Trump Jr. when he recently visited Nuuk.",
      "The American president's comments set off a political crisis in Denmark. The prime minister went on a tour of European capitals to garner support, saying the continent faced \u201ca more uncertain reality,\u201d while her country moved to strengthen its military presence around Greenland.",
      "For some, it\u2019s been dizzying, a rollercoaster of emotions since Trump\u2019s threats, since his son landed in Nuuk in January in a TRUMP-emblazoned plane and since his father posted on social media: \u201cMAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!\u201d with a message to Greenlanders: \u201cWe\u2019re going to treat you well.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen that was happening, I felt like I was hit in the stomach,\u201d said Qupanuk Olsen, a mining engineer and social media influencer running in the election for the Naleraq party.",
      "Around her, supporters gathered at a bay filled with giant pieces of ice in Nuuk waving the red and white national flag that represents the sun and the ice that covers most of Greenland.",
      "\u201cI could feel that the ground will no longer ever be the same again,\" she said. \"It\u2019s as if we were on sea ice and it started to break, and we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next.\u201d",
      "Journalists from afar have descended on Nuuk, asking locals what they think of Trump\u2019s words. Pro-Trump media influencers known as the Nelk Boys arrived handing out MAGA hats and $100 bills to children in Nuuk\u2019s streets.",
      "\u201cEven though there are strong feelings of sadness, despair, confusion, I think we\u2019re also stronger than ever. We\u2019re fighting it for our people and that gives me hope,\u201d said Aka Hansen, an Inuk filmmaker and writer. She is suspicious of Trump\u2019s intentions but still thanks him for turning the world\u2019s attention to her homeland.",
      "\u201cWe went through all the emotions \u2014 at first very funny, very light, then very serious,\u201d said Hansen, who worked with Conan O\u2019Brien when the comedian came to Nuuk in 2019 to shoot an episode poking fun at Trump\u2019s idea of buying Greenland. \u201cNow, with all the international press that\u2019s been here, we\u2019ve been given a voice that\u2019s being taken seriously.\u201d",
      "Like many other Greenlanders, she doesn\u2019t want to be ruled by another colonial power. But she feels Trump\u2019s rhetoric has increased the momentum for independence from Denmark.",
      "The former colonial ruler is accused of committing abuses against her island\u2019s Inuit people, including removing children from their families in the 1950s with the excuse of integrating them into Danish society and fitting women with intrauterine contraceptive devices in the 1960s and 1970s \u2014 allegedly to limit population growth in Greenland.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a historic moment for Greenland ... compared to two months ago when nobody was talking about independence,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cNow, everybody\u2019s talking about it.\"",
      "A former colony of Denmark, Greenland gained self-rule in 1979 and now runs itself through its parliament. A treaty with the United States, and a U.S. military base in Greenland, also gives Washington say over the territory\u2019s defense.",
      "Greenland is massive \u2014 about one-fifth the size of the United States or three times the size of Texas. Its land mass is in North America, and its Arctic capital city is closer to New York than to Copenhagen.",
      "\u201cDenmark is just a middle man in that whole setup. And we don\u2019t need that middle man anymore,\u201d said Juno Berthelsen, a candidate in the election for Naleraq party. He says Trump has given Greenland leverage to negotiate with Denmark. \u201cOur political goal is to have our own defense agreement, so that we connect directly with the U.S. in terms of defense and security.\u201d",
      "His party, he said, aims to invoke an article in a law that would give Greenland increased autonomy and eventually a path to full independence.",
      "Asked to describe Greenland\u2019s moment, he said: \u201cIf I had to pick one word, it would be exciting. And full of opportunities.\u201d",
      "In his first term in office, Trump began to talk about acquiring Greenland from Denmark, a longtime U.S. ally. Back in 2019, most dismissed it. But it had a ripple effect.",
      "\u201cIt was not taken that seriously back then as it is today. But it was important for Greenland because he, without wanting, did Greenlanders a favor,\u201d said Ebbe Volquardsen, a professor of cultural history at the University of Greenland. \u201cHe underlined the value of being in a union with Greenland.\u201d",
      "Greenland\u2019s economy depends on fisheries and other industries as well as on an annual grant of about $600 million from Denmark. When Trump showed interest in buying Greenland because of its strategic location and mineral resources, he highlighted that annual sum as the amount of what other nations would be willing to pay to have a military or commercial presence in Greenland, Volquardsen said. With that, he gave Greenland leverage for more autonomy and possible reparations for abuses committed by its former colonial ruler.",
      "\u201cThat was important because the narrative in Denmark until that date \u2026 had been that Greenland is receiving this funding as a kind of aid or altruistic gift,\u201d Volquardsen, said.",
      "Life in Nuuk seemed to go on as usual in mid-February, except for a \u201cheat wave.\u201d After weeks of subzero temperatures, it made the capital of Greenland several degrees hotter than Washington, D.C., the U.S. capital.",
      "Large chunks of powder blue ice were blown by winds, blocking boats on the harbor and creating a spectacle for residents who snapped photos under the pink light of a sunset. Some nights, the sky was lit up by spectacular streaks of green and other colors from the northern lights.",
      "You could almost forget that Greenland has become ground zero for a geopolitical showdown \u2014 if, that is, you ignored the front pages of local newspapers featuring images of Trump and the ticker tape in downtown with his name and the Greenlandic word \u201cAmerikamiut.\u201d",
      "On a frigid day, a group of kindergarteners in fluorescent vests walked in line behind their teacher as they crossed a road covered in ice and snow. A few blocks away, teenagers played hockey on a frozen pond.",
      "On a hill next to a statue of the Danish-Norwegian missionary who founded the city in 1721, bells tolled, and a recently married couple laughed as family members threw rice on them for good fortune outside Nuuk\u2019s wooden Lutheran cathedral. More than 90% of Greenlanders identify as Lutherans.",
      "After the wedding ceremony, guests converged at their home for a \u201cKaffemik,\u201d a traditional celebratory gathering where they share coffee and baked goods.",
      "Some Greenlanders say they felt safe while being largely unknown to the world. Now, though, that feeling has dissipated.",
      "Sitting with her husband at a dinner table filled with families chatting and laughing, Tukumminnguaq Olsen Lyberth, said the wave of attention and polarizing comments prompted some friends to delete Facebook accounts.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not use to having this big attention about us, so it\u2019s overwhelming. Before, no one knew about us. Now, it\u2019s a blitz of attention,\u201d said Olsen Lyberth, 37, a cultural history student at the University of Greenland.",
      "\u201cI feel like this is the longest January,\u201d she said jokingly \u2014 in February. \u201cIt\u2019s all of it. Everything feels too overwhelming.\"",

Afghans and Venezuelans were the other top nationalities of asylum seekers, with around 87,000 and 74,000 applications respectively.",
      "The number of Ukrainians still registered under the EU's \u201ctemporary protection\u201d program at the end of 2024 but not included in asylum figures. The majority are being hosted in Germany and Poland. The temporary protection directive, an exceptional EU mechanism created for situations of mass displacement, was activated for the first time in 2022 following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and has been extended as the war marks its third anniversary.",
      "Ukrainians with temporary protection do not need to apply for asylum to live, work, study or receive medical care in the European Union, albeit for a limited period of time. The European Asylum office said last year some 27,000 Ukrainians applied for permanent refugee status, up 90% from 2023. Half of those asked for protection in France.",
      "The percentage of first-time applicants who were granted refugee status or another form of protection. The recognition rate remained stable compared to 2023 but varied widely among nationalities, the agency said. For example, 90% of Syrians had their asylum requests recognized, while 96% of asylum seekers from Bangladesh were rejected. There were also a \u201cnear-record\u201d 981,000 cases pending an initial response, reflecting a backlog that hasn't been seen since the peak of the refugee crisis in 2016 that overwhelmed authorities and asylum systems.",

      "A political mission sent to Guinea-Bissau by West Africa\u2019s regional bloc to resolve an electoral dispute has left the country",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- A mission by a West African regional bloc sent to Guinea-Bissau to resolve a dispute over elections there has left the country, following threats by President Umaro Sissoco Embalo, according to a statement.",
      "The dispute over the end date of Embalo\u2019s term has escalated tensions and raised fears of unrest in the small West African nation of Guinea-Bissau, which has endured multiple coups since gaining independence from Portugal over 50 years ago.",
      "The opposition argues that Embalo\u2019s term, which began in 2020, should have ended last week while the country\u2019s supreme court ruled that it ends on Sept. 4. Last month, Embalo announced that the next presidential and parliamentary elections will be held on Nov. 30.",
      "The bloc, known as ECOWAS, said its mission left early on Saturday. It was deployed from Feb. 21 to Feb. 28 together with the United Nations Office for West Africa and the Sahel to help broker a consensus on when to hold the presidential election.",
      "ECOWAS is West Africa's top political and economic authority, often collaborating with states to solve various domestic challenges. In recent years, however, it has struggled to reverse coups in the region and disputes with citizens complaining of not benefitting from their country's natural resources.",
      "Embalo says he has survived two attempts to overthrow him. After the most recent one in Dec. 2023, which involved a shootout between the national and presidential guard, he dissolved the opposition-controlled parliament, accusing it of passivity.",
      "Last week, Embalo met with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss potential economic and security ties as Russia has emerged as the security partner of choice for a growing number of African governments, displacing traditional allies such as France and the United States."

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- The speaker of New Zealand \u2019s Parliament told lawmakers he would not consider further complaints about the use of the country\u2019s M\u0101ori name, Aotearoa, in Parliament, after one lawmaker made a bid to have it banned.",
      "\u201cAotearoa is regularly used as a name of New Zealand,\u201d Speaker Gerry Brownlee said in a ruling on Tuesday at Parliament in Wellington. \u201cIt appears on our passports and it appears on our currency.\u201d",
      "The conflict over a word increasingly prominent in New Zealand life arose last month when one lawmaker objected to another\u2019s use of the term. It reflects the way enthusiasm for the Indigenous language among New Zealanders of all ethnicities has at times prompted a backlash \u2014 including about what the country should be called. It was also the latest salvo in the so-called \u201cculture war\u201d-style friction between two political parties.",
      "Ricardo Men\u00e9ndez March, from the left-leaning Green Party, used the name Aotearoa during a question to a government minister. The composite word means \u201cland of the long white cloud\" in te reo M\u0101ori, the M\u0101ori language.",
      "Winston Peters \u2014 who is deputy prime minister, foreign minister and leader of the populist party New Zealand First \u2014 objected in a point of order.",
      "\u201cWhy is someone who applied to come to this country in 2006 allowed to ask a question of this parliament that changes this country\u2019s name without the referendum and sanction of the New Zealand people?\u201d Peters asked Brownlee. Men\u00e9ndez March, who was born in Mexico, is a New Zealand citizen, which is a requirement for all lawmakers.",
      "Peters asked Brownlee to bar use of the term Aotearoa in Parliament. On Tuesday, Brownlee said lawmakers were already permitted to address Parliament in any of New Zealand\u2019s three official languages \u2014 English, te reo M\u0101ori and New Zealand Sign Language.",
      "\u201cThat really is the end of the matter,\u201d he said. Brownlee had earlier asked Men\u00e9ndez March to consider using the phrase \u201cAotearoa New Zealand\u201d to refer to the country, \u201cto assist anyone who might not understand the term,\u201d but said he would not require it.",
      "\u201cIf other members do not like certain words, they don\u2019t have to use them,\u201d Brownlee said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a matter of order and I don\u2019t expect to have further points of order raised about it.\u201d",
      "Peters told reporters that Brownlee was \u201cwrong\u201d and that he would not answer questions in which New Zealand was referred to as Aotearoa. Men\u00e9ndez March did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Other lawmakers refer to New Zealand by its M\u0101ori name. But it's not the first time Peters and his party have fixed on Men\u00e9ndez March.",
      "In January, the Green Party complained to the Prime Minister and Brownlee after Peters\u2019 deputy, Shane Jones, heckled during a Parliamentary debate with a remark about Mexicans \u2014 while Peters told two other Green lawmakers who immigrated to New Zealand that they should \u201cshow some gratitude\u201d to the country.",

      "One former lawmaker, Peter Dunne, wrote in an opinion column in February that the squabble was more about New Zealand First shoring up its populist brand with supporters than it was about the language itself.",
      "The M\u0101ori language is growing in popularity, after decades of advocacy by M\u0101ori leaders reversed its fortunes. M\u0101ori \u2014 who make up close to 20% of New Zealanders \u2014 were discouraged from speaking the language after British colonization, and by the turn of the 21st century it was expected to die out completely.",
      "Individual words, such as Aotearoa, are now part of daily New Zealand conversation for many \u2014 including non-M\u0101ori. Some endorse an official moniker change for the country, which was named by a Dutch cartographer.",
      "Opponents say that, before colonization, M\u0101ori did not have a collective term for the whole of New Zealand. Aotearoa was the name used for the country\u2019s North Island.",
      "The official name of the country can only be changed by law."

    "story": [
      "Pope Francis has stabilized enough after two respiratory crises to be taken off noninvasive mechanical ventilation and resume receiving just high flows of supplemental oxygen via a nasal tube to help him breathe, the Vatican says",
      "ROME -- Pope Francis had stabilized enough Tuesday after two respiratory crises to be taken off noninvasive mechanical ventilation and receive just high flows of supplemental oxygen, as he continued his more than two-week long fight against double pneumonia, the Vatican said.",
      "Francis, 88, woke up and was resuming respiratory physiotherapy after sleeping through the night, the Vatican said.",
      "The Vatican said as of Tuesday morning, Francis no longer needed to wear the mechanical ventilation mask that covers his nose and mouth to pump oxygen into his lungs and was just receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal tube.",
      "He had to resume using the mask on Monday after suffering two respiratory crises that required doctors to extract \u201ccopious\u201d amounts of mucus from his lungs. Doctors performed two bronchoscopies, in which a camera-tipped tube was sent into his airways with a sucker at the tip to suction out fluid.",
      "The 88-year-old pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, remained alert, oriented and cooperated with medical personnel, the Vatican said. The prognosis remained guarded, meaning he was not out of danger. Doctors didn\u2019t say if he remained in stable condition, though they referred to the crises in the past tense.",
      "The fact that Francis no longer needed the ventilation mask by Tuesday morning was a sign that he had stabilized some after the crises, but still within what doctors have said was a complex respiratory picture.",
      "The crises were a new setback in what has become a more than two-week battle by the frail pope to overcome a complex respiratory infection.",
      "The Vatican said the mucus that had accumulated in Francis' lungs was his body\u2019s reaction to the original pneumonia infection and not a new infection, given laboratory tests don\u2019t indicate any new bacteria.",
      "Dr. John Coleman, a pulmonary critical care doctor at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, said the episodes were more concerning than the last one on Friday, in which Francis had a coughing fit, inhaled some vomit that needed to be extracted, was put on the noninvasive mechanical ventilation for a day and then didn\u2019t need it anymore.",
      "The use of bronchoscopies reflects a worrying level of mucus and phlegm in the lungs, Coleman said. \u201cThe fact that they had to go in there and remove it manually is concerning, because it means that he is not clearing the secretions on his own,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s taking little steps forward and then steps back,\u201d said Coleman, who is not involved in Francis\u2019 care.",
      "Francis, who is not physically active, uses a wheelchair and is overweight, had been undergoing respiratory physiotherapy to try to improve his lung function. But the accumulation of the secretions in his lungs was a sign that he doesn\u2019t have the muscle tone to cough vigorously enough to expel the fluid.",
      "Doctors often use noninvasive ventilation to stave off an intubation, or the use of invasive mechanical ventilation. Francis has not been intubated during this hospitalization. It\u2019s not clear if he has provided any advance directives about the limits of his care if he declines or loses consciousness.",
      "Catholic teaching holds that life must be defended from conception until natural death. It insists that chronically ill patients, including those in vegetative states, must receive \u201cordinary\u201d care such as hydration and nutrition, but \u201cextraordinary\u201d or disproportionate care can be suspended if it is no longer beneficial or is only prolonging a precarious and painful life.",
      "Francis articulated that in a 2017 speech to a meeting of the Vatican\u2019s bioethics think tank, the Pontifical Academy for Life. He said there was \u201cno obligation to have recourse in all circumstances to every possible remedy.\u201d He added: \u201cIt thus makes possible a decision that is morally qualified as withdrawal of \u2018overzealous treatment.\u2019\u201d",
      "Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, who heads the academy which helps articulate the Catholic Church\u2019s position on end-of-life care, said Francis is like any other Catholic and would follow church teaching if it came to that.",
      "\u201cToday the pope is giving us an extraordinary teaching on fragility,\u201d he told reporters Monday. \u201cToday the pope, not through words but with his body, is reminding all of us, we elderly people to begin with, that we are all fragile and therefore we need to take care of each other.\u201d",
      "Francis\u2019 hospitalization, which hits 18 nights Tuesday, is by no means reaching the papal record that was set during St. John Paul II\u2019s numerous lengthy hospitalizations over a quarter century. The longest single hospitalization occurred in 1981, when John Paul spent 55 days in Gemelli for a minor operation and then to be treated for a serious infection that followed.",

      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- Inflation in Europe eased to an annual 2.4% in February, supporting the case for another interest rate cut from the European Central Bank - but leaving open how far the central bank will go in lowering borrowing costs for an economy that's still struggling to show robust growth.",
      "The February figure for the 20 countries that use the euro currency was down from 2.5% in January as energy inflation dwindled and major economy France saw a rate of only 0.9%, the European Union's statistical agency Eurostat reported Monday.",
      "The lower consumer price inflation figure supports the view that the ECB is succeeding in its battle to get inflation back to its target of 2% and can focus on supporting tepid growth. The bank's rate-setting council is expected to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter point to 2.5% on Thursday. That rate influences borrowing costs throughout the economy, and a cut will make it easier to borrow money to buy a house or expand a factory.",
      "A rate cut Thursday had already been pencilled in by analysts but the new figure gives added support for a cut.",
      "Growth worries have come to the fore after the eurozone stagnated in the last three months of 2024, as consumers still smarting from an outbreak of inflation remained cautious in their spending habits. Business worried about possible new tariffs on exports to the US under President Donald Trump. Political paralysis in France, where no party has a majority in parliament to address an outsized budget deficit, and the transition to a new government in Germany after the Feb. 23 national election have also left businesses uncertain about the future.",
      "Recent surveys of purchasing managers by S&P Global suggested the eurozone economy just barely grew in February.",
      "The big question at Thursday's interest rate meeting is whether bank President Christine Lagarde will drop clues about how far the bank will go in cutting rates. While inflation is well down from its peak of 10.6% in October, 2022, some indicators of prices pressures remain elevated. Costs for services \u2014 a broad category ranging from haircuts and hotel rooms to concert tickets and medical care \u2014 remained at 3.7%",
      "At its last meeting on Jan. 30, the bank said the benchmark rate was still high enough to restrict growth; dropping that mention on Thursday could be seen as a signal that future cuts will be more limited.",
      "A top ECB official argued in a recent speech that recent changes in the economy may constrain how far the bank can go in cutting rates.",
      "Recent evidence suggests \u201cthat the era during which risks to inflation have persistently been to the downside is likely to have come to an end,\u201d said Isabel Schnabel, a member of the six-member executive board that runs the bank day to day at its Frankfurt headquarters. Schnabel argued that the so-called neutral rate at which the economy is neither held back nor stimulated has risen in recent years."

      "The extraordinarily frank criticism from Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, speaking in a parliamentary debate on Ukraine, diverged from the more nuanced tone that French President Emmanuel Macron has adopted in the wake of the clash at the White House on Friday and dropped the diplomatic niceties that customarily mark French-U.S. relations.",

      "LONDON -- The leaders of Britain and France are spearheading a desperate diplomatic drive to shore up Europe\u2019s security, bolster Ukraine\u2019s defenses and ensure the Trump administration doesn\u2019t seek a ceasefire on terms that reward Moscow for invading its neighbor.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer and President Emmanuel Macron have been thrust to the fore by a U.S. administration that has embraced Moscow and derided Kyiv. Strikingly, their efforts are taking place outside the major institutions that have helped order Europe for decades: the EU and NATO.",
      "\u201cWe are at a crossroads in history,\u201d a somber Starmer said after a summit Sunday that he convened in support of Kyiv, three years into a grinding war.",
      "Starmer spoke after a dizzying week in which Ukraine and its allies went from hope to gloom to grim resolve.",
      "Diplomatic efforts to shore up American support for Kyiv appeared to be paying off as first Macron and then Starmer flew to Washington for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump. The meetings were cordial and Trump took a softer tone toward Ukraine, though he would not commit to providing U.S. security guarantees for Kyiv as part of a negotiated peace.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to sign a deal granting the U.S. access to rare earth minerals that, Kyiv and its allies hoped, would bind the countries closer together. But then came Friday\u2019s extraordinary on-camera berating of Zelenskyy by Trump and Vice President JD Vance, who accused Ukraine\u2019s leader of being insufficiently grateful for U.S. support. Zelenskyy was asked to leave the White House without signing the deal.",
      "Starmer had already invited Zelenskyy, Macron and more than a dozen other leaders to London for a Sunday debrief. It now became a crisis summit. Starmer told them that European nations \u201cmust do the heavy lifting\u201d to protect the continent\u2019s security.",
      "In addition to boosting defense spending, that means increasing support for Ukraine, drawing up a peace plan with Kyiv at its heart and bolstering Ukraine\u2019s defenses after a ceasefire. As part of that plan, France and the U.K. are working to recruit other countries to send troops to Ukraine to protect a ceasefire in what Starmer calls a \u201ccoalition of the willing.\u201d",
      "In a stunning shift from just a few weeks ago, when the United States\u2019 leading role in Ukraine was taken for granted, Starmer said \u201cthe U.K., France and others will work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting\u201d \u2014 and only then discuss it with the United States.",
      "Neither the EU nor NATO \u2014 two pillars of the postwar European order \u2014 are well placed to help Ukraine forge a path forward right now.",
      "The EU is due to hold a summit on Ukraine on Thursday, but efforts to support Kyiv are constrained by the 27-nation bloc\u2019s need for unanimity. Hungary\u2019s pro-Russia Prime Minister Viktor Orban is playing spoiler, opposing draft conclusions that center on the defense of Ukraine and its place at the negotiating table and urging the EU to follow \u201cthe example of the United States\u201d and start direct discussions with Russia.",
      "NATO, meanwhile, is facing a transatlantic rift as its most important member, the U.S., is led by a president who has long questioned the value of the alliance and now is pushing for a quick ceasefire that Ukraine and its allies fear will favor Russia.",
      "Into the breach have stepped age-old frenemies, Britain and France \u2014 Europe\u2019s only nuclear powers apart from Russia.",
      "Their two leaders both face major domestic problems. Macron has no majority in parliament. Starmer won a a landslide election victory in July but faces a sluggish economy and plummeting popularity.",
      "They make a contrasting team \u2014 Macron outspoken, Starmer more reticent. Macron has strongly criticized Trump\u2019s statements that echo Russia\u2019s narrative and American moves to negotiate with Moscow  while sidelining Ukraine. Starmer talks of being a bridge between Europe and the U.S. administration and has refrained from directly criticizing Trump.",
      "But they agree on the importance of supporting Ukraine against Russia in this moment \u2014 and there aren't a lot of other leaders who could fill the role. Germany, the other EU heavyweight along with France, is in between leaders as the winner of recent elections, Friedrich Merz, works to form a coalition.",
      "Macron has long called for Europe to take more responsibility for its own defense, and was the first leader to suggest European troops could be deployed to Ukraine after a ceasefire.",
      "Pushing the narrative again, Macron suggested on Sunday that France and the U.K. were proposing a partial 30-day truce that would see fighting stop \u201cin the air, on the seas and energy infrastructures.\u201d",
      "Starmer\u2019s spokesman cautioned that is only one of \u201cvarious options on the table,\u201d and Macron\u2019s office acknowledged there is no agreement yet on details.",
      "In some ways, it's an extraordinary match-up five years after Britain left the European Union.",
      "But even as testing times draw Britain closer to its European neighbors, Starmer still speaks of being a transatlantic \u201cbridge.\u201d He insisted Sunday that the U.S. remains an \u201cindispensable\u201d partner for Europe and that any Ukraine peace deal \u201cmust have strong U.S. backing.\u201d British Defense Secretary John Healey plans to fly to Washington this week for talks with his U.S. counterpart Pete Hegseth.",
      "\u201cWe must strengthen our relationship with America,\u201d Starmer told lawmakers on Monday. \u201cWe will never choose between either side of the Atlantic.\u201d",
      "For many Britons and Europeans, that is currently an unpopular sentiment. But Leslie Vinjamuri, director of the U.S. and Americas program at the Chatham House think tank, said Starmer \u201cunderstands the incredible significance of this moment for keeping the U.S. engaged.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe short-term urgent imperative is to keep America in, and to work with the U.S. to manage the future of a ceasefire, of a deal, of Ukraine\u2019s position in Europe,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat's the alternative?\u201d",

      "A search is underway for a Philippine fighter jet with two pilots who lost contact during a night combat assault in support of ground forces battling communist insurgents",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- A Philippine fighter jet with two pilots on board has lost contact during a night combat assault in support of ground forces battling communist insurgents in a southern province, and an extensive search is underway, officials said Tuesday.",
      "The FA-50 jet lost communication during the mission with other air force aircraft around midnight Monday before reaching a target area. The other aircraft were able to return safely to an air base in central Cebu province after carrying out assaults, the air force said without providing other details for security reasons.",
      "A Philippine military official told The Associated Press that the incident happened in a southern province, where a counterinsurgency mission against New People's Army guerrillas was underway. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to discuss the sensitive situation publicly.",
      "\"We are hopeful of locating them and the aircraft soon and ask you to join us in prayer during this critical time,\u201d air force spokesperson Col. Ma. Consuelo Castillo said.",
      "The pilots could eject from the supersonic jets in case they encounter any problem that could lead to a crash. Rescuers could locate them if their emergency locating transmitters emitted signals.",
      "Castillo refused to say if rescuers have detected such signals but added that the military is \u201cstill very optimistic that they are safe.\u201d",
      "It was not immediately clear if the rest of the FA-50s would be grounded following the incident.",
      "The Philippines acquired 12 FA-50s multi-purpose fighter jets starting in 2015 from South Korea\u2019s Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd. The 18.9 billion peso ($331 million) contract had been the biggest under a military modernization program that has been repeatedly stalled by a lack of funds. The Philippines plans to acquire another 12 fighter jets from South Korea.",
      "The military estimates about 1,000 communist guerrillas remain after decades of battle setbacks, surrenders and factional fighting. Peace talks brokered by Norway collapsed under previous President Rodrigo Duterte after both sides accused the other of continuing deadly attacks despite the negotiations.",
      "In 2023, the government and the communist rebels agreed to resume talks aimed at ending one of Asia\u2019s longest insurgencies. But the talks still have not restarted under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.",
      "Aside from anti-insurgency operations, the jets have been used in a range of activities, from major national ceremonies to patrolling the disputed South China Sea."

      "Both countries have struggled to find their footing in recent weeks in the new reality of migrants heading south, turned back by the closure of the United States border to asylum seekers since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January.",
      "The security ministers from both countries met Monday in Pe\u00f1as Blancas, a border post between Nicaragua and Costa Rica where southbound migrants will board buses to a Costa Rican government facility at the Panama border.",

      "CULIACAN, Mexico -- Before dawn, an elementary school principal in the capital of Mexico's Sinaloa state checks various chats on his phone for word of shootouts or other incidents. If there\u2019s danger, he sends a message to his students\u2019 parents suspending classes.",
      "It isn\u2019t the only new routine in Culiacan, a city of 1 million residents that for the past six months has been the battlefield for the two main factions of the Sinaloa drug cartel.",
      "The violence has limited the hours to bury the dead. Bands that played big parties now play for money at intersections. Any loud noise sends children scurrying for cover. And those who live on the shifting front lines fear for their lives daily.",
      "This is the first extended period of violence that has touched Culiacan's residents because there was safety in the cartel\u2019s total domination. Now, many residents are grateful for the pressure applied by U.S. President Donald Trump to get Mexico to go after the cartels and some are optimistic that this difficult period could change the persistent view that the cartel has been their protector.",
      "It started in September, more than a month after Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada \u2014 the Sinaloa cartel's oldest and most astute leader \u2014 says he was kidnapped by one of the sons of former leader Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n and taken to the U.S. where they were both arrested.",
      "It unleashed a power struggle between both cartel factions and the unwritten agreement to not attack residents uninvolved in the drug trade was broken.",
      "There were carjackings, kidnappings, innocents caught in crossfires and cartel roadblocks where gunmen would scan people\u2019s cell phones looking for any trace of contact with the other side. According to government data, there have been more than 900 killings since September.",
      "A resident of Costa Rica, a small town south of the capital, traced the front line on the horizon: on one side the \u201cChapos,\u201d on the other the \u201cMayos.\u201d He, like most others, requested anonymity because of the danger.",
      "An old man there said he saw gunmen dump two bodies in the street.",
      "And sometimes people just disappear. Julio H\u00e9ctor Carrillo, 34, never arrived home from visiting a relative in late January. According to his brother-in-law, Mario Beltr\u00e1n, his only transgression was not respecting the locals' self-imposed curfew.",
      "His family didn\u2019t dare to put up signs for their search, instead sticking to social platforms. A search collective looking for the disappeared found a body that is undergoing DNA testing.",
      "\u201cAt no other time in the last 30 to 40 years that we have crime stats, have we had so many families with disappeared (relatives),\u201d said Miguel Calder\u00f3n of the State Public Security Council, a citizen organization.

      "\u201cTruly, we\u2019re very tired, very tired of being among the bullets,\u201d said a 38-year-old small business owner who has imposed his own family security protocol: no cycling for their 18-year-old son, who they take everywhere, including to visit his girlfriend, and track in real time through his cell phone.",
      "Their 7-year-old daughter asks in the morning: \u201c\u2018Dad, am I going to be able to go to school today? Did you already check (Facebook)?\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are things you can\u2019t hide from children,\u201d he said.",
      "How Mexican authorities are addressing the violence has changed notably in the past month and locals believe Trump is the reason.",
      "When it started, Mexico was led by President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who minimized cartel violence and expressed no interest in going after cartel leaders. His close ally, Sinaloa Gov. Rub\u00e9n Rocha did the same. Rocha\u2019s spokesman, Feliciano Castro, maintains that the U.S. set off the violence by arresting Zambada.",
      "Things changed when Trump won the election. Shutting down illegal immigration and going after drug traffickers were among his campaign promises and he's threatened to impose 25% tariffs Tuesday. Mexico\u2019s new President Claudia Sheinbaum had already shown herself willing to take a more aggressive hand with the cartels, especially Sinaloa, whose main business is fentanyl.",
      "The number of security operations and arrests in Sinaloa have multiplied and now there is direct federal supervision of all security action.",
      "\u201cWe have never seen such an overwhelming and daily operation against the cartels,\u201d said Ismael Boj\u00f3rquez, a veteran Sinaloa journalist covering organized crime, who was critical of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s hands-off approach.",
      "In December, authorities seized more than a ton of fentanyl in Sinaloa compared to just 286 pounds in all of Mexico in the first six months of 2024.",
      "In the last 10 days of February, authorities dismantled 113 synthetic drug labs, according to preliminary state data. Authorities have not clarified if they produced fentanyl or methamphetamine. It\u2019s unknown what, if any, role U.S. intelligence played.",
      "In Culiacan, authorities took down more than 400 cartel surveillance cameras, double what authorities had.",
      "The recent actions have weakened both cartel factions but the government can\u2019t let up if it really wants to decimate them, Boj\u00f3rquez said.",
      "\u201cI never thought (Trump) would have so much power to do that \u2026 but I\u2019m grateful,\u201d said the owner of a beer store stopped at a police checkpoint.",
      "A 55-year-old woman sitting on a bench watching a forensics team load a murder victim's body into a truck agreed. The day before, she had attended a Mass for her son-in-law who was killed five months earlier by a stray bullet while he was walking with his daughter a few blocks away.",
      "\"We leave home but we don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll return,\u201d she said.",
      "In the halls of Socrates Elementary school in downtown Culiacan, signs explain what to do in case of a shootout and children drill suddenly dropping to the ground when the alarm sounds.",
      "Principal Victor Manuel Aispuro says he can't remember what it was like to have all of his nearly 400 students in school. Some 80 families fled the city and there were days when no more than 10 kids attended. He decides each day if there will be in-person classes.",
      "The last time he closed was late last month when intense firefights and low-flying helicopters panicked residents. Two key cartel members were arrested.",
      "In January, one of his students, a 9-year-old boy, was killed along with his 12-year-old brother and their father in a carjacking. Thousands of residents took to the streets in a rare public display of indignation.",
      "At a workshop, a nongovernmental organization of ex-police led students through an exercise writing down what scares them. One listed spiders, gun shots and white trucks (the preferred cartel transportation). Another said he\u2019s afraid of being extorted or killed.",
      "\u201cThe people are full of a sense of collective anguish, anxiety, social anger and that\u2019s different from other crises,\u201d said Calder\u00f3n, the coordinator of the citizen security group. He said he hopes it could dissolve the complicity of citizens, who for years saw the cartel as protectors, heroes or figures to emulate."

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis was up and receiving therapy on Monday after apparently overcoming a setback in his recovery from pneumonia. The Vatican said he is stable, off mechanical ventilation and is showing no sign of new infection following a respiratory crisis late last week.",
      "\u201cThe pope rested well all night,\u201d the Vatican said in its update from Gemelli hospital, where Francis has been hospitalized since Feb. 14.",
      "On Monday, he had coffee and breakfast and was undergoing therapy.",
      "Earlier, doctors reported the 88-year-old pope spent all day Sunday without using the noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask that pumps oxygen into his lungs that he had to use following the coughing episode and crisis on Friday. Francis did continue to receive high flow supplemental oxygen through a nasal tube.",
      "The respiratory crisis sparked fears of a new lung infection because Francis inhaled some vomit. Doctors aspirated it and said they needed 24 to 48 hours to determine if any new infection took hold.",
      "On Sunday evening, they said Francis remained stable, with no fever or signs of an infection, indicating he had overcome the crisis. His prognosis remained guarded, however, meaning he wasn\u2019t out of danger.",
      "Francis on Sunday also received a visit from the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and his chief of staff, Archbishop Edgar Pena Parra. The content of their talks wasn\u2019t known, but even when at the Vatican, Francis meets at least weekly with them.",
      "He again skipped his weekly noon blessing to avoid even a brief public appearance from the hospital. Instead, the Vatican distributed a message written by the pope from the 10th floor in which he thanked his doctors for their care and well-wishers for their prayers, and prayed again for peace in Ukraine and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cFrom here, war appears even more absurd,\u201d Francis said in the message, which he drafted in recent days. Francis said he was living his hospitalization as an experience of profound solidarity with people who are sick and suffering everywhere.",
      "\u201cI feel in my heart the \u2018blessing\u2019 that is hidden within frailty, because it is precisely in these moments that we learn even more to trust in the Lord,\u201d Francis said in the text. \u201cAt the same time, I thank God for giving me the opportunity to share in body and spirit the condition of so many sick and suffering people.\u201d",
      "The Argentine pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, was admitted to Gemelli on Feb. 14 after his bronchitis worsened and turned into a complex pneumonia in both lungs.",
      "On Sunday night at the Vatican, Cardinal Konrad Krajewski presided over the evening Rosary prayer in St. Peter's Square.",
      "\u201cLet us pray together with the entire church for the health of the Holy Father Francis,\u201d said Krajewski, who is the pope's personal Almoner, a centuries-old job of handing out alms. Francis has elevated the job to make it an extension of his own personal charity.",

      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- A South African woman went on trial Monday charged with kidnapping and selling her young daughter in a case that gained national attention.",
      "Kelly Smith is charged alongside her partner and another man over the disappearance of her daughter Joshlin more than a year ago. Joshlin, who was 6 when she disappeared, is still missing following a nationwide police hunt.",
      "Smith \u2014 whose full name is Racquel Chantel Smith \u2014 was charged with kidnapping and human trafficking. Prosecutors alleged she organized the abduction of her daughter in return for payment with the help of her partner Jacquin Appollis and friend Steveno van Rhyn.",
      "All three defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges as the trial opened in a sports hall in the small coastal town of Saldanha Bay. The trial was moved to the hall to give members of the community an opportunity to attend.",
      "Smith won sympathy across South Africa in the early days of Joshlin's disappearance and neighbors joined together to help police search for the child in sand dunes near the impoverished settlement of shacks and small houses where they lived. Smith claimed she left Joshlin with Appollis on the day she went missing in February 2024 and hadn't seen her again.",
      "The case took a shocking twist when police took Smith in for questioning and later arrested her. Another woman who was arrested was not charged and is reportedly due to testify as a state witness.",

      "Vendors are a fixture at Rio\u2019s Carnival street parties",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Sweat streamed down Talita Ferreira Sanches\u2019 face as she pushed a cart loaded with beer and water up the winding, cobblestone streets in Rio de Janeiro last month, calling out to glitter-covered revelers decked out in fishnet tights.",
      "The 22-year-old from an area outside Rio had spent the night sleeping on a street in bohemian neighborhood Santa Teresa, covering herself with just a sheet, so she could arrive in time for the early-morning Carnival party \u201cHeaven on Earth\u201d.",
      "\u201cCarnival represents a lot of joy and all the money that we make,\u201d said Ferreira Sanches, who has worked as a street vendor for the last four years. She makes around 1,500 reais ($260) a day during Carnival \u2014 about the same as the country's monthly minimum wage.",
      "\u201cEvery year, we have an objective. Last year we bought a fridge and a television, this year we want to buy a wardrobe and a stove,\u201d she said, pocketing cash with one hand while dishing out ice-cold drinks with the other.",
      "Like musicians and stilt walkers, vendors are a fixture at Rio's street parties. Known in Portuguese as \u201cambulantes\u201d or \u201ccamelos,\" they scour Instagram pages for times and locations, coordinate on WhatsApp groups, then race across parks and up hills, from Rio\u2019s downtown to Copacabana beach, all to place themselves and their carts in the thronging crush of thousands \u2014 or hundreds of thousands \u2014 of thirsty revelers.",
      "Peddlers provide much-needed party fuel and hydration, and can themselves partake in the buzzing, joyous atmosphere. More than that, though, it's an economic lifeline, allowing them to pay off debts, buy presents for their kids and set them up for the rest of the year.",
      "But as opportunity to cash in has grown, more and more vendors have joined the rush \u2014 and drawn pushback. There are nearly 500 registered street parties this year, and hundreds more unofficial ones, considerably more than the pre-pandemic era, and they all need cold beer and water.",
      "Rio\u2019s City Hall conducted a lottery for 15,000 authorized vendors at this year\u2019s Carnival \u2014 5,000 more than last year, but observers say there are far more vendors than spots.",
      "Selling without a permit renders them vulnerable to harassment, seizure of their merchandise and even violence from Rio\u2019s municipal guard, according to the United Street Vendors' Movement \u2014 known by its acronym MUCA.",
      "The ballooning number of vendors in recent years has created tensions with party organizers, said Pericles Monteiro, the director of Heaven on Earth, which he founded in 2001. Party facilitators and revelers have accused hawkers of blockading the procession by setting up shop in the middle of its path with their heavy carts.",
      "\u201cWe couldn\u2019t walk, we felt suffocated,\u201d Monteiro said of Heaven on Earth's procession two years ago. The group didn\u2019t get to the square where the show was supposed to end on time, and had to walk almost in silence until reaching the designated area. When they got there, peddlers had barbecues fired up and vans parked in the street, leaving little room for performers, musicians or revelers.",
      "\u201cWe support street vendors. People have to work and they have an important role. We are aware of that. But the way it has been done, the intensity \u2014 there really has been a serious problem hindering the party\u2019s development,\u201d Monteiro added.",
      "Vendors are aware of the grievances, and the impact on their reputation. This year, union SindInformal and other groups launched a campaign to promote respect, proper organization and security during Carnival, and recommended buying from vendors surrounding the party rather than in the middle of the mayhem.",
      "Fear of repercussions and clashes also prompted MUCA to produce a manifesto this year calling for \u201cmess with harmony.\u201d The document said criticism and attacks targeting vendors spark backlash against an already marginalized community.",
      "\u201cVendors are seen as dangerous, as tarnishing the city\u2019s reputation, as causing public disorder,\u201d said Fl\u00e1via Magalh\u00e3es, who researches street sellers at the Paulista University in Sao Paulo. \u201cBut vendors sustain a festive street culture that is very important for the city\u2019s tourism.\u201d",
      "They also face dire working conditions, struggling to access toilets, working long hours without stopping for food and struggling to find a legal place to leave their merchandise, according to a 2019 report by MUCA and Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. They often spend hours on public transport each day trekking into the city from the poor periphery.",
      "During Carnival, being based in the city center is a game-changer, said Maria de Lourdes do Carmo, 50, known as Maria of the Street Vendors.",
      "Do Carmo has been a vendor for three decades, often hawking caipirinhas to foreign tourists in Santa Teresa's cobblestone hills; the municipal guard doesn't tend to crackdown up there, she said. She ran for a city council seat in last year\u2019s election to fight for greater respect for her peers, but lost.",
      "Since last year, Rio state's public prosecutors have been leading discussions on preventing violence against itinerant workers while also trying to tackle the municipality's failure to better organize their activity, for example by providing sanctioned deposits for their goods.",
      "And City Hall this year is attending to a long-standing demand for childcare services. Authorities will provide a daycare center for vendors\u2019 children during street parties and samba schools\u2019 parades, with food, cultural activities and games, Rio\u2019s department of social assistance said in an email.",
      "For D\u00e9bora Silva Pereira, 42, enduring the long, exhausting days away from her family is worth it, firstly because Carnival buoys her family's income. On a good day, she makes 3,000 reais \u2014 what she normally earns in 10 days during the rest of the year, selling women's clothing. But she also enjoys the mixture of work and play.",
      "\u201cWe meet people and make friends. The money makes it worth it, but experiences even more so,\u201d she said."

      "Chinese manufacturers reported stronger orders in February as importers rushed to beat higher U.S. tariffs",
      "BANGKOK -- Chinese manufacturers reported an uptick in orders in February as importers rushed to beat higher U.S. tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, as a Chinese state media report said that Beijing was considering ways to retaliate.",
      "Trump earlier imposed a tariff of 10% on imports from China and that will rise to 20% beginning Tuesday. He also ended the \u201cde minimis\u201d loophole that exempted imports worth less than $800 from tariffs, in a blow to companies whose online sales direct to consumers had soared in recent years.",
      "The Global Times, a newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party, said Monday that Beijing was studying both tariffs and non-tariff moves to counter Trump's higher tariffs. Asked about that report, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said that \u201cChina will take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard own legitimate rights and interests.\u201d",
      "\u201cU.S. agricultural and food products will most likely be listed,\u201d it said, citing an unnamed source. Last week, Chinese Commerce Ministry officials had said the two sides were in a \u201cdialogue\u201d about trade.",
      "The stronger-than-expected data came as Chinese leaders gathered in Beijing for the annual session of the National People\u2019s Congress. Lawmakers are expected as usual to endorse policies and priorities set by the ruling Communist Party, which could include some fresh help for the economy as it slows to annual growth many economists forecast will fall to about 4.5% this year.",
      "Surveys of factory managers showed China\u2019s official purchasing managers index rose to 50.2% from 49% in January, though that was just above the 50 level that marks the break between contraction and expansion. The new orders index rose to 51.1.",
      "Steady industrial production suggests that government spending and \u201cfront running\u201d to beat the higher tariffs supported stronger business activity last month, Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report.",
      "\u201cBut growth still looks at risk of slowing this quarter, at least partially reversing the pick-up in Q4 (October-December). And that\u2019s before the hit from tariffs is felt in earnest,\u201d Huang wrote.",
      "Another survey released Monday, the Caixin manufacturing PMI survey, showed a similar improvement. That survey tends to show trends in smaller and export-oriented companies, Lynne Song of ING Economics said in a commentary.",
      "\u201cThis could be a valuable gauge of the impact new tariffs are having on the manufacturing sector. With an additional 10% tariff set to come into effect tomorrow, this seems likely,\u201d she said.",
      "Sudden increases in tariffs and other factors have raised uncertainty over the outlook for the world's second largest economy, which grew at a 5% annual pace last year, just meeting Beijing's official target.",
      "Premier Li Qiang will present an annual work report to the congress as it opens on Wednesday that traditionally provides the annual growth target for this year, among other policies and economic updates.",
      "2025 is the last year of leader Xi Jinping's \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d blueprint for upgrading Chinese industries to become global leaders in advanced technology. It also marks the end of China\u2019s 14th five-year plan, the party's traditional mid-term policy-setting document.",
      "A key priority is likely to be outlining ways to get Chinese consumers to spend more, a weak point in the state-dominated economy following the disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic. The government has moved to provide more support for private industry in recent months as part of that effort. Exports and targeted spending increases have also helped."

      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk's car company is required each year to report to investors all the bad things that could happen to it, and the latest version lists every imaginable threat from costly lawsuits to out-of-control battery fires to war and another epidemic.",
      "But there\u2019s barely any mention in the latest annual update of Musk\u2019s full-bore entry into right-wing politics, which some experts say is turning off potential customers who don\u2019t share his views.",
      "\u201cIt's marketing 101: Don\u2019t involve yourself in politics,\u201d said New York brand consultant Robert Passikoff. \u201cPeople will stop buying your products.\u201d",
      "It may be too late.",
      "Tesla sales plunged 45% in Europe in January, according to research firm Jato Dynamics, even as overall electric vehicle sales rose. That comes after a report of falling sales in California, its biggest U.S. market, and the first annual drop globally for the company last year.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t even want to drive it,\u201d said Model 3 owner John Parnell, a Democrat from Ross, California, adding that he also is cancelling his order for the company's Cybertruck, losing a $100 deposit. \u201cHe's destroying the brand with his politics.\u201d",
      "Car industry analysts say it's too early to say for sure how much damage Musk is causing to Tesla because so many other factors could explain its current troubles. It's best selling vehicle, the Model Y, is coming out with a new version this year, leading potential Tesla buyers to hold off purchases right now. And European and Chinese manufacturers are finally catching up to the world's EV leader, offering cars with battery life and dependability that are competitive.",
      "But, if anything, that makes Musk\u2019s political comments even more reckless, auto analysts say.",
      "\u201cMusk thinks he can say anything he wants to and doesn\u2019t think Tesla will suffer any consequences,\u201c said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. \u201cTesla was in the sweet spot. Now it has competition.\u201d",
      "The sales numbers were particularly bad in Germany and France in January, down roughly 60% each, more than the average decline for the more than two-dozen European countries surveyed. Sales in France fell another 26% in February.",
      "More worrisome was the breakdown for Tesla\u2019s individual models. Sales of Tesla\u2019s Model 3 dropped 33% across all European countries even though that car is not being updated and there is no reason for buyers to wait",
      "\u201cPart of the population is not happy with his views, his political activism,\u201d said Jato senior analyst Felipe Munoz who had shrugged off the boycott threat earlier this year, but is now having second thoughts.",
      "Many Tesla buyers used to be wealthy, environmentally-conscious professionals, often liberal, who were attracted to Musk's talk about how his EVs could help save the planet from fossil-fuel destruction.",
      "Not anymore.",
      "\u201cI used to be adored by the left,\u201d Musk said in an interview with Tucker Carlson on February 18 as his stock was halfway through a nearly 30% plunge for the month. \u201cLess so these days.\u201d",
      "His decision to spend $270 million on Donald Trump's presidential campaign and publicly back him was risky enough for his business. Then he doubled down, pursuing a slash-and-burn strategy as head of Trump's government efficiency team and taking his political revolution and incendiary talk abroad.",
      "He has backed the far-right, pro-Russian, anti-Muslim party in German y, called the British p rime minister an \u201cevil tyrant\u201d who runs a \u201cpolice state,\" and stated recently about a U.S. neighbor and major Tesla market, \u201cCanada is not a real country.\"",
      "The backlash has been fierce.",
      "Tesla showrooms in the U.S. have been besieged by protesters, its vehicles vandalized and bumper stickers appearing on its cars with sayings such as, \u201cI bought it before Elon went nuts.\u201d",
      "An effigy of Musk was hung in Milan and image of him doing a straight-arm salute projected on a Tesla factory outside Berlin. In London, a bus stop poster of him above the word \u201cswasticars\u201d lit up social media. A Polish government minister called for a Tesla boycott.",
      "\u201cI will not buy a Tesla again,\" said Jens Fischer, a 50-year-old microscope salesman in Witten, Germany, who thinks Musk is \u201cdestabilizing democracy\u201d and has slapped one of those \u201cElon went nuts\u201d stickers on his Model 3. \u201cI\u2019d sell if I got a good offer.\u201d",
      "Tesla investor Ross Gerber says Musk has somehow managed to marry the world's best product with the world's worst marketing.",
      "\u201cPeople want to buy stuff that makes them feel good, you don't want politics involved,\" said Gerber, a money manager whose portfolios hold nearly $60 million in Tesla stock. \u201cIt's even worse when you have such divisive issues, whether it\u2019s firing climate scientists or taking aid away from starving African children.\u201d",
      "Boycotts have a habit of fizzling out, and Morningstar's Goldstein says that buying a car is too big a decision and costs too much to make them successful targets, anyway.",

      "The recently announced U.S. tariffs on steel imports mean that countries like China, which export to the U.S., will need to find new markets \u2014 and that could lead to steel dumping in places like India",
      "BENGALURU, India -- Rows of small factories line the streets of a dusty suburb in Bengaluru, where workers weld and cast Indian-made steel into everything from car parts to kitchen sinks. Here, U.S. President Trump\u2019s announcement to impose high trade tariffs on steel imports has some unexpected supporters.",
      "Many industry workers and experts expect that the result of tariffs will be that cheap steel gets dumped in places like India. That's because the announced 25% tariff will make it too expensive for many companies in countries like China and South Korea to keep exporting to the U.S.",
      "For B. Praveen of Sun Techpro Engineering, which makes products from steel metal sheets, it means his \u201cwafer-thin\u201d profit margins will probably grow as the steel he buys gets cheaper.",
      "\u201cFor thousands of companies like mine, this can be a good thing,\u201d he said. Businesses such as Praveen's employ over 200 million Indians and are key drivers of India's economy.",
      "But cheaper steel in India isn't good for everyone. In February Naveen Jindal, the president of the Indian Steel Association, which represents all India\u2019s steelmakers, said that he was \u201cdeeply concerned,\u201d especially since \u201cIndia is one of the few major markets without any trade restrictions,\u201d making it a target for potential steel dumping. And the increased competition could impact efforts by India to produce its own steel more cleanly. The current production of most Indian steel releases high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, which cause climate change. Reduction efforts could be cut in the interest of keeping profits up.",
      "India is the world\u2019s most populous nation and one of the fastest-growing major economies. Steel demand is rising rapidly due to fast-paced urbanization, infrastructure, and industrial growth, and the government expects steel production to increase from 120 million tons to 300 million tons in the next five years.",
      "Currently, up to 12% of India's greenhouse gas emissions come from steelmaking according to the Global Energy Monitor, an organization that tracks energy projects around the globe. It found this could likely double in five years if more steel is produced as per the government's plans.",
      "Henna Khadeeja, a research analyst with GEM, explained that unlike China, Europe, or the United States, Indian steelmakers still mostly use coal-based blast furnaces to make steel, which are more high-emitting. In September last year, the Indian government said it would invest $1.72 billion to help the steel industry transition to cleaner methods of steelmaking.",
      "But Khadeeja said all the new steel expansion plans that have been announced are for coal-based steel production facilities. \u201cRight now, the focus is mostly on producing as much steel as possible. The strategy is mostly to retroactively decarbonize the steel once the capacity is built in place,\" she said.",
      "Building more coal-based blast furnaces make it more difficult for India to export its steel in the future, particularly to Europe, said Easwaran Narassimhan of the New Delhi-based think tank Sustainable Futures Collective. The European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a tax on carbon emissions that Europe will begin charging for all products imported to the bloc from next year, would likely turn off any buyers from steel made with coal-based blast furnaces.",
      "\u201cChina\u2019s steel production is less emissions-intensive, which means it\u2019s going to face a lesser impact from European carbon taxes,\u201d said Narassimhan. \u201cAny amount of short-term pain today is going to be worth in the long run.\"",
      "India too has ambitious climate goals and wants to produce 500 gigawatts of clean power \u2014 enough to power nearly 300 million Indian homes \u2014 by the end of this decade. The South Asian nation recently crossed the milestone of installing 100 gigawatts of solar power, most of which was installed in the last 10 years.",
      "India also aims to go net zero \u2014 that is to stop adding planet-warming gas to the atmosphere, either by preventing the emissions in the first place or removing an equivalent amount through natural or technological means \u2014 by 2070.",
      "Indian steelmakers said they recognize the need to emit less but are apprehensive about how much it'll cost them. \u201cIf you're not financially viable, you cannot exist as a business,\u201d said Prabodh Acharya, chief sustainability officer at JSW Group, one of India's biggest steel companies.",
      "\u201cSteel is essential for the growth of society and economy. We need to find the right balance between growth, economy and decarbonization,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "China's leaders are overseeing a spell of deflation, or falling prices, that contrasts with inflationary pressures prevailing elsewhere in the world",
      "BEIJING -- When he bought an apartment near a good high school in northeast Beijing in 2020, Zhou Fujin expected that renting it out would cover most of his mortgage. But the apartment's value and the rent he is getting have plummeted in the past couple years, straining his family\u2019s finances.",
      "China is experiencing a spell of deflation, or falling prices, that contrasts with inflationary pressures prevailing elsewhere in the world. Cheaper prices can be a blessing for some, but deflation is a symptom of relatively weak demand and stalling economic growth.",
      "Such challenges are the backdrop to the annual session of China's parliament, which begins Wednesday. It's unclear what the ruling Communist Party might do to tackle the problem, though some economists expect more government spending. Observers also will be watching for changes to the annual economic growth target, which has hovered near 5% for the past two years.",
      "These are broad, long-term problems. Falling housing prices have left many families reluctant to spend, while factories keep churning out goods.",
      "Economy-wide, prices fell in 2023 and 2024, the longest bout of deflation since the 1960s. The gross domestic product deflator \u2013- the broadest measure of price changes in an economy -\u2013 dipped to -0.8% in the last three months of 2024, compared to -0.5% the quarter before, meaning that deflation has intensified.",
      "Deflation is an abstract economic concept but it reflects very concretely in Zhou\u2019s personal balance sheet, as it does for millions of others. Zhou\u2019s apartment, in Beijing\u2019s Miyun district, cost 2 million yuan ($275,000) when he bought it in 2020, and he financed it with an 800,000 yuan ($110,000) bank loan. The rent he charges has fallen from 2,300 yuan ($316) monthly to 1,700 yuan ($234). His monthly mortgage payment is more than 3,000 yuan ($413), and the apartment is now worth only about 1.4 million yuan ($193,000), he says.",
      "Around the time Zhou bought his apartment, the government began cracking down on excess borrowing by real estate developers, pushing the industry into crisis and many property companies into default. The father of two runs a real estate brokerage firm, which has been hemorrhaging money over the past four years. He has since expanded into home decoration services, helping him to break even.",
      "\u201cGiven that I work in the real estate sector, my income has been greatly affected,\u201d Zhou told The Associated Press. \u201cMy biggest spending is on bank mortgages, my car and my children's education. I've cut other expenditures such as travel. Even my children have realized that money is not easy to earn, and they are willing to spend less.\u201d",
      "Lu Wanyong, who owns a picture framing workshop in Beijing, says he gets only one or two customers a day, down from more than a dozen before the pandemic. Many now prefer to fix broken picture frames rather than buy new ones. Fewer new homeowners come in looking to decorate their apartments.",
      "Lu\u2019s family has burned through its savings and he fears that soon he won\u2019t be able to pay his shop\u2019s 6,000 yuan ($825) rent.",
      "\u201cI am considering shifting to other industries, but the problem is that I am not familiar with any of them. And as a matter of fact, which industry is easy to work in nowadays?\u201d he pondered.",
      "Deflation can be harder for governments to tackle than inflation, experts say, because that requires fixing the underlying issues behind it.",
      "In China\u2019s case, it\u2019s a combination of excess capacity \u2014 manufactured goods produced in such quantities the market cannot absorb them all -\u2013 and the reluctance of consumers to spend and businesses to invest, due to concerns about the sluggish economy. Also, the housing crisis has wiped out an estimated $18 trillion of household wealth, according to a Barclays report, on top of job losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cWhen the real estate market is booming, people believe that they are very rich,\u201d said He-Ling Shi, an associate professor of economics at Australia's Monash University. \u201cIf people believe that they\u2019re rich, they tend to spend their income on consumption. But with the decrease in the price of housing in most parts of China, people believe that they\u2019re no longer as rich as before, so \u2026 they want to increase their savings and reduce their consumption.\u201d",
      "When prices fall, companies' profits also take a hit. That can spur a so-called \u201cdeflationary spiral\u201d of layoffs that further reduce household incomes, leading to even less consumption and potentially to a recession or depression. Fitch Ratings in November warned that deflation is becoming entrenched in China and urged its leaders to adopt policies that can boost demand.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed new 20% tariffs on Chinese exports that are expected to shave up to 1.1 percentage points off China\u2019s GDP growth this year in a \u201csevere scenario\u201d where Chinese exports to the U.S. fall by half, said Erica Tay, director of macro research at Maybank Investment Banking Group.",
      "Deflation is a ticklish issue for China\u2019s leaders, who began cutting interest rates and required mortgage down-payments last fall. They have launched programs to get local governments to buy unsold apartments to rent out as affordable housing and are encouraging banks to lend more money.",
      "But top leaders tend to focus their public comments on the ruling party's accomplishments and avoid directly mentioning deflation, a thorny problem with no quick fixes.",
      "\u201cThey try to do their best to avoid the word \u2018deflation\u2019 because they believe that will make consumers even more panicked,\u201d Shi said. \u201cIf they become more panicked, they will further reduce their consumption and therefore make the situation worse.\u201d",
      "Some economists, including Michael Pettis, a professor of finance at Guanghua School of Management at Peking University, say the economy can only be rebalanced if consumers gain purchasing power. That requires reducing the share of wealth going into unproductive investments.",
      "The government has sought to encourage more spending by issuing vouchers, while shying away from more fundamental economic reforms.",
      "\u201cEconomic recovery should be linked to a rise in people\u2019s incomes\u201d said Sun Lijian, professor at the School of Economics at Fudan University. \u201cThe government should provide vouchers to help people purchase what they need; this has proven to be an effective way.\u201d",
      "Louis Kuijs, chief Asia economist for S&P Global Ratings, says China needs to address long-term, chronic problems including excess industrial production and inefficient state industries. Revamping health care, pensions and education systems would make people \u201cmore comfortable about their financial situation.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the short term, simply anything that increases household incomes will help on the consumption side,\u201d Kuijs said, \u201cbut probably more importantly is that structural reform element \u2026 and that requires beefing up of the government\u2019s role in health, education and social security.\u201d",

      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned oil giant Aramco has reported a $106.25 billion profit in 2024, down 12% from the prior year on lower energy prices",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil giant Aramco reported a $106.25 billion profit in 2024 on Tuesday, down 12% from the prior year as lower energy prices now squeeze the kingdom's multi-trillion-dollar development plans.",
      "Already, Saudi's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been digging a straight-line city in the desert for his $500 billion project at NEOM in Saudi Arabia\u2019s western desert on the Red Sea. He also will need to build tens of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of new stadiums and infrastructure ahead of the kingdom hosting the 2034 FIFA World Cup.",
      "Meanwhile, he's also pledged potentially $600 billion in U.S. investments to President Donald Trump to entice him to the kingdom on his first foreign trip as president. Saudi Arabia is also the possible venue for a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin over Moscow's war on Ukraine.",
      "All that and OPEC+ moving toward increasing production means Saudi Arabia likely will need to take on new debt to fund the crown prince's vast ambitions.",
      "A filing on Riyadh's Tadawul stock exchange showed Aramco, formally known as the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., had revenues of $436 billion in 2024. That compares to $440.88 billion in 2023.",
      "Aramco reported a $121 billion annual profit in 2023, down from its 2022 record due to lower energy prices as well.",
      "\u201cThe decrease was primarily driven by lower revenue and other income related to sales, higher operating costs, as well as lower finance and other income,\u201d Aramco said in its filing.",
      "Stock in Aramco traded around $7.33 a share Tuesday, down from a high over the last year of $8.71. It has fallen over the past year as oil prices have dropped. Benchmark Brent crude is at $73 \u2014 down 10% this year.",
      "Aramco has a market value of $1.74 trillion, making it the world\u2019s sixth-most valuable company behind Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Amazon and Alphabet, which owns Google.",
      "Aramco will pay dividends of $21.36 billion for the fourth quarter, which includes a far-smaller performance dividend of $220 million. The company expects to pay dividends of $85.4 billion this year, which is far lower and will further erode cash that Saudi Arabia's monarchy can expect for the year.",
      "\u201cOur strong net income and increased base dividend illustrate Aramco\u2019s exceptional resilience,\" Aramco CEO and President Amin H. Nasser said in a statement.",
      "The Aramco results come as OPEC+, an alliance of the oil cartel and other energy-producing states, met online Monday and agreed to proceed with an increase in oil production starting in April. It's the first oil production increase by the group since 2022 and likely will push down oil prices further.",
      "The OPEC+ decision follows criticism by Trump of the cartel as well.",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s vast oil resources, located close to the surface of its desert expanse, make it one of the world\u2019s least expensive places to produce crude. For every $10 rise in the price of a barrel of oil, Saudi Arabia stands to make an additional $40 billion a year, according to the Institute of International Finance.",
      "The Saudi government owns the vast majority of the firm\u2019s shares. Saudi Aramco publicly listed a sliver of its worth back in late 2019 and has weighed offering more shares publicly.",

      "NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks are drifting in mixed trading Monday following the latest discouraging signal on the U.S. economy and ahead of President Donald Trump\u2019s latest deadline on tariffs.",
      "The S&P 500 was 0.2% lower in morning trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3 points, or less than 0.1%, as of 10:25 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.4% lower.",
      "Wall Street is coming off a rocky couple of weeks, starting after the S&P 500 set a record following a parade of fatter-than-expected profit reports from big U.S. companies. Then, the market dove sharply amid several weaker-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy, including a couple showing U.S. households are getting much more pessimistic about inflation because of the threat of tariffs.",
      "The latest report to show less economic strength than expected came Monday morning on U.S. manufacturing. Overall activity is still growing, but not by as much as economists had forecast. Perhaps more discouragingly, manufacturers are seeing a contraction in new orders. Prices, meanwhile, rose amid discussions about who will pay for Trump's tariffs.",
      "\u201cDemand eased, production stabilized, and destaffing continued as panelists\u2019 companies experience the first operational shock of the new administration\u2019s tariff policy,\u201d said Timothy Fiore, chair of the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing business survey committee.",
      "A set of tariffs announced by Trump on Canada, Mexico and China is set to take effect on Tuesday, but he has shown he can pull back on such announcements at the last minute. That\u2019s what he did a month ago, when he delayed implementation of the taxes on imports from Canada and Mexico.",
      "The hope on Wall Street is that Trump is using the threat of tariffs as a tool for negotiations and that he\u2019ll ultimately go through with policies that would mean less damage for the global economy and trade. Tariffs could raise prices on everyday items even more for U.S. households, when high inflation has proven to be stubborn to subdue fully.",
      "The market's recent slump has hit Nvidia and some other formerly high-flying areas of the market particularly hard. They were mixed on Monday, with Nvidia down 4.4% but Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla up 1.9%.",
      "Elsewhere on Wall Street, Kroger fell 1.5% after the grocery chain\u2019s Chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen resigned following an internal investigation into his personal conduct.",
      "Stocks of companies enmeshed in the cryptocurrency economy did better after Trump said over the weekend that his administration was moving forward with a crypto strategic reserve.",
      "MicroStrategy, the company that's now known as Strategy and has been raising money to buy bitcoin, rose 5.9%. Coinbase, the crypto trading platform, gained 3.6%.",
      "Tuesday will bring not only potentially new tariffs but also earnings reports from several big U.S. retailers, including Target, Best Buy, Ross Stores and AutoZone.",
      "Such reports are always highly anticipated because they can shed light on how well U.S. consumers are doing, and spending by U.S. households is the main engine for the world\u2019s largest economy. But these reports could carry extra resonance following data showing U.S. households may not be waiting for tariffs to hit to change their behavior.",
      "All the way across the Pacific in China, manufacturers reported an uptick in orders in February as importers rushed to beat higher U.S. tariffs and a Chinese state media report said that Beijing was considering ways to retaliate.",
      "Trump had imposed a tariff of 10% on imports from, China and that's scheduled to rise to 20% beginning Tuesday. He also ended the \u201cde minimis\u201d loophole that exempted imports worth less than $800 from tariffs.",
      "In Hong Kong, Chinese bubble tea chain Mixue Bingcheng\u2019s stock soared 43% following its $444 million debut on the market. The company claims to be the world\u2019s largest food retail chain, with more than 45,000 outlets, and its jump came as the Hang Seng index rose 0.3%.",
      "Indexes rose by even more across Europe and in Tokyo. European markets leaped after a report showed an easing of inflation in February. That should help the European Central Bank, which investors widely expect will deliver another cut to interest rates later this week.",
      "Germany\u2019s DAX surged 2.5%, and France\u2019s CAC 40 jumped 1.2%. Stocks outside the United States have performed better than the S&P 500 this year, even with Trump\u2019s promises for \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies",
      "In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury slumped to 4.19% from 4.24% just before the manufacturing report's release. It's come down sharply since January, when it was approaching 4.80%, as worries have built about the possibility of a slowing U.S. economy.",
      "Often, falls in Treasury yields can give a boost to stock prices because they make loans cheaper to get and give a boost to the economy. But the reason for this recent drop in yields, softer economic growth expectations, mean that's not the case this time, according to Morgan Stanley strategists led by Michael Wilson.",

Pakistani personnel returned fire, the official said.",
      "There was no comment on the exchange from the Taliban government in Kabul.",

      "The tariffs announced by the Commerce Ministry are due to take effect from March 10, though goods already in transit will be exempt until April 12.

The move came in retaliation for an increase in flat U.S. tariffs on Chinese products \u2013 from 10% to 20% \u2013 that came in effect at the same time.",

      "\u201cYou know that governments historically have messed with GDP,\u201d Lutnick said on Fox News Channel's \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d \u201cThey count government spending as part of GDP. So I\u2019m going to separate those two and make it transparent.\u201d",
      "Doing so could potentially complicate or distort a fundamental measure of the U.S. economy's health. Government spending is traditionally included in the GDP because changes in taxes, spending, deficits and regulations by the government can impact the path of overall growth. GDP reports already include extensive details on government spending, offering a level of transparency for economists.",

      "\u201cA more accurate measure of GDP would exclude government spending,\u201d Musk wrote on his social media platform. \u201cOtherwise, you can scale GDP artificially high by spending money on things that don\u2019t make people\u2019s lives better.\u201d",
      "The argument as articulated so far by Trump administration officials appears to play down the economic benefits created by some forms of government spending that can shape an economy's trajectory.",
      "\u201cIf the government buys a tank, that\u2019s GDP,\u201d Lutnick said Sunday. \u201cBut paying 1,000 people to think about buying a tank is not GDP. That is wasted inefficiency, wasted money. And cutting that, while it shows in GDP, we\u2019re going to get rid of that.\u201d",
      "The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis published its most recent GDP report on Thursday, showing that the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.3% in the final three months of last year.",
      "The report makes it possible to measure the forces driving the economy, showing that the gains at the end of last year were largely driven by greater consumer spending and an upward revision to federal government spending related to defense. Still, the federal government's component of the GDP report for all of 2024 increased at 2.6%, slightly lower than overall economic growth last year of 2.8%.",
      "In the GDP report, government spending accounts for almost one-fifth of people's personal income, which totaled more than $24.6 trillion last year. This includes Social Security payments, benefits for military veterans, Medicare and Medicaid and other programs. But the report also measures the amount of people's personal incomes that are paid in taxes to the government.",
      "The government is not always a contributor to GDP growth and can subtract from it, which is what happened in 2022 as pandemic-related aid expired.",
      "Lutnick said that the Trump administration would balance the federal budget with spending cuts, saying that would help growth and reduce the interest rates paid by consumers.",
      "\u201cWhen we balance the budget of the United States of America, interest rates are going to come smashing down,\u201d Lutnick said. \u201cThis is going to be the best economy anybody\u2019s ever seen. And to bet against it is foolish.\u201d"

      "Pezeshkian, who defended Hemmati, emphasized that the government is locked in a tough battle with the West. He called for greater unity and cooperation from Parliament to face these challenges.",
      "The decision comes amid rising tensions over Iran\u2019s nuclear program and worsening relations with the West. Iran\u2019s economy has been severely affected by international sanctions, especially after the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal. In 2015, the rial was worth 32,000 to the dollar, but by the time Pezeshkian took office in July, it had plummeted to 584,000 to the dollar. Recently, it dropped even further, with exchange shops in Tehran trading 930,000 rials for each dollar.",
      "During the impeachment proceedings, Mohammad Qasim Osmani, a lawmaker supporting Hemmati, argued that rising inflation and exchange rates were not the fault of the current government or Parliament. He pointed to the budget deficit left by the previous administration, which he said contributed to the economic instability. Osmani also cited recent geopolitical events as factors that undermined public confidence, causing many people to convert their savings into foreign currency, which in turn further devalued the rial.",
      "Hemmati acknowledged the tough economic climate during his five months in office, including a 10% reduction in inflation. However, he acknowledged that inflation remained high, standing at 35%. He assured lawmakers that his team was working hard to address the issue, but warned that the process would take time.",

    "story": [
      "The U.K. government has provided provisional approval to the creation of a second runway at Gatwick Airport outside London",
      "LONDON -- The U.K. government gave its provisional backing Thursday to the creation of a second runway at Gatwick Airport outside London if certain improvements were met, including on noise reduction \u2014 a move that has been met with incredulity from environmental campaigners.",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said in a written statement that she was \"minded to approve\u201d the expansion, which would involve moderately moving Gatwick's northern standby runway used for planes to taxi or as a backup.",
      "The original Gatwick project, which was rejected but then revised by planning inspectors, means that the final approval may be delayed by nine months.",
      "Under the new plan, Gatwick will have to ensure at least 50% of passengers traveling to and from the airport do so by public transport and take steps to mitigate noise.",
      "Gatwick, which is about 40 miles (65 kilometers) south of London and serves more than 40 million passengers a year, is the country's busiest single-runway airport, and second-busiest overall behind London's Heathrow Airport.",
      "Under the plan, Gatwick will have to move the current emergency runway 12 meters (39 feet) north away from the main runway in order to meet international safety standards. That would allow it to be used for departures of narrow-bodied planes such as Airbus A320s and Boeing 737s.",
      "The project, which will be funded privately, is expected to cost 2.2 billion pounds ($2.8 billion), could be completed by the end of the decade, if construction begins later this year.",
      "The expansion would allow it to cater for another 100,000 flights a year, taking capacity up to more than 380,000. It's projected to create 14,000 new jobs and generate 1 billion pounds ($1.26 billion) in annual economic benefits to the country.",
      "Gatwick, which is majority-owned by France-based VINCI Airports, has until April 24 to formally respond to the new proposals, while Alexander is expected to make a final decision shortly after that date, although a deadline has been extended to Oct. 27.",
      "Gatwick CEO Stewart Wingate welcomed Thursday's announcement, saying that the airport will \u201cengage fully\u201d in the extended process for a final decision.",
      "\u201cBy increasing resilience and capacity, we can support the U.K.\u2019s position as a leader in global connectivity and deliver substantial trade and economic growth in (southeast England) and more broadly,\u201d he said.",
      "Climate change activists, however, have railed against the new Labour government's provisional thumbs-up, which came just a few weeks after it gave its full backing to the construction of a third runway at London's Heathrow Airport, the country's busiest, as part of its drive to bolster the U.K.'s anemic economic growth over recent years. The government has made airport expansion a central plank of its growth plan.",
      "\u201cSuch a decision would be one that smacks of desperation, completely ignoring the solid evidence that increasing air travel won\u2019t drive economic growth,\u201d said Greenpeace U.K.\u2019s policy director, Doug Parr. \u201cThe only thing it\u2019s set to boost is air pollution, noise and climate emissions.\u201d"

      "Fans wanted to see Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter work out at two positions and how the top quarterback duel would go when the NFL scouting combine opened",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- When the NFL scouting combine opened, everyone wanted to see Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter work out at two positions and how the top quarterback duel would go.",
      "Those hopes were dashed in Indianapolis.",
      "Hunter skipped both on-field opportunities and quarterbacks Cam Ward and Shedeur Sanders joined the growing list of top prospects who opted to work out at their college pro days instead of at the combine.",
      "Fans must now wait days or weeks for the full picture to come into view, though the combine still was filled with interesting twists and intriguing plots that will be discussed between now and the draft, which begins in Green Bay on April 24.",
      "Here's a look at some of the top stories from the combine:",
      "Armand Membou, OT, Missouri. He came to Indy in the mix to be the first offensive lineman drafted this year, and after measuring in at 6-foot-4, 332 pounds he dazzled with his athleticism. Membou ran the 40-yard dash in 4.91 seconds, led all offensive linemen with a broad jump of 9 feet, 7 inches and had a 34-inch vertical jump. That should be enough to cement his status as a high first-round pick.",
      "Shemar Stewart, DE, Texas A&M. It was another big guy on the opposite side of the ball who stole the spotlight on the first night of workouts. He put up elite numbers in the 40 \u2014 a time of 4.59 and a 10-yard split of 1.58 seconds \u2014 before posting a broad jump of 10-1 to go with a 40-inch vertical jump. All four numbers were top five in his position group, and he should be moving up the rankings between now and draft day.",
      "Jaylin Noel, WR, Iowa State. The 5-foot-10, 194-pound receiver certainly appeared to have something to prove this weekend \u2014 and he did. Noel was one of the few players to participate in every test and he aced them all. He was one of a record 10 receivers with a sub-4.4 40, finishing in 4.39 with a 10-yard split of 1.51. He had the best vertical (41 1/2) and top broad jump (11-2) at his position and even did a group-best 23 reps on the bench press. His 20-yard shuttle (4.17) and three-cone drill (6.82) times also made the top five. And a strong showing catching passes made it a good weekend for Noel.",
      "Jihaad Campbell, LB, Alabama. With Jalon Walker of Georgia sitting out, Campbell quickly became the feature attraction in his position group. He didn't disappoint in the three drills he tried. Campbell's 4.52 time in the 40 was third among linebackers, just a few ticks off Kain Medrano's group-leading 4.46. Only two linebackers bettered Campbell's 10-yard split, 1.53, and he finished second in the broad jump at 10-7. He may not go ahead of Walker but his workout might help narrow the gap.",
      "Maxwell Hairston, CB, Kentucky. After missing five games with a shoulder injury last season, Hairston made a splashy entrance at Lucas Oil Stadium. On the second night of workouts, he ran the 40 in 4.28 seconds \u2014 the fastest overall time all week \u2014 and only one cornerback topped his 10-yard split of 1.5. Hairston's encore was a 39 1/2-inch vertical jump and a broad jump of 10-9, finishing second and third in those tests, respectively.",
      "Nick Emmanwori, S, South Carolina. The 220-pound safety came within a whisker of sweeping the top spot in all four drills in which he participated. He had the best 10-yard split time, 1.49, the best broad jump (11-6), the top vertical jump (43) and a 40 time of 4.38, second only to Marcus Sigle of Kansas State who ran it in 4.37. His draft stock should be soaring as the next phase of pre-draft evaluations begins.",
      "Will Campbell, OT, LSU. A strong overall workout Sunday may have solidified Campbell's spot among top tackles. But some scouts worry Campbell's arms are shorter than the preferred 33-inch length for a tackle. He can alleviate more concerns on his pro day.",
      "Kaleb Johnson, RB, Iowa. Some thought Johnson was a top-five back prior to the combine. But Johnson decided to participate in just the 40-yard dash and his time of 4.57 seconds was only better than four other running backs. A better pro day showing would help.",
      "Jalen Milroe, QB, Alabama. When last season started, some thought the athletic Crimson Tide quarterback might be a first-round pick. Instead, his stock steadily declined during the season and an uneven throwing performance in Indy may create more doubts.",
      "Mike Green, Edge, Marshall. He's believed to be a first-round talent, but the questions about Green have less to do with what he does on the field than what happened off it. Green told reporters Wednesday he transferred from Virginia after a second sexual assault allegation, something team officials probably will dig into more now \u2014 if they hadn't already.",
      "Jack Bech, WR, TCU. The player with perhaps the most inspirational story in Indy \u2014 his older brother, Tiger, was killed in the New Year's Day attack in New Orleans \u2014 didn't run the 40 but showed he was strong, tough and physical enough to warrant being drafted.",
      "Riley Leonard, QB, Notre Dame. After leading the Fighting Irish to a national runner-up finish, Leonard went to work on cleaning up his footwork and midrange and deep throws. He looked more polished in Indy. The question is whether he can demonstrate more improvement at his pro day.",
      "Harold Fannin Jr., TE/H-back, Bowling Green. Last season, he broke FBS single-season records for receptions and yards receiving by a tight end. His top regular-season games came against Texas A&M and Penn State, too. What he did Thursday was show he could run, with a time of 4.71, sixth best among tight ends.",
      "Marcus Yarns, RB, Delaware. The former FCS star proved he belonged on the big stage. The 5-11, 193-pound back had a 4.45 in the 40, a top-10 finish in the 10-yard split and vertical jump and a solid showing in the on-field position workouts.",

      "\u201cI am thrilled to announce my ownership role in the first Canadian WNBA team, the Toronto Tempo,\u201d said Williams. \u201cThis moment is not just about basketball; it is about showcasing the true value and potential of female athletes \u2014 I have always said that women\u2019s sports are an incredible investment opportunity. I am excited to partner with Larry and all of Canada in creating this new WNBA franchise and legacy.\u201d",
      "Williams, one of the greatest tennis players in history, will play an active role in future jersey designs.",
      "She made her professional tennis debut at age 14 at a tournament in Canada in 1995, and her last event was the 2022 U.S. Open.

      "Joe Gibbs knows quite a lot about what it takes to win a championship",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- Joe Gibbs knows quite a lot about what it takes to win a championship.",
      "As an NFL coach, he won three Super Bowls. As a NASCAR team owner, his drivers have won five Cup Series titles.",
      "And he certainly likes what he sees in Christopher Bell's consecutive victories, first in Atlanta, and then in Austin on Sunday. In both races, Bell hung around late and made the right moves to snatch victory.",
      "From the race shop to the garage to the cockpit, Gibbs senses a championship chemistry brewing.",
      "\u201cI think in football every now and then you have a team that really had a great feeling about themselves, were really confident, and a great chemistry,\u201d the 84-year-old Gibbs said after Bell's latest victory.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't happen very often, and it doesn't carry over from one year to the other. But when you kind of get that, I think it's a great feeling when you see it as a coach or an owner. I think that's what we have with the 20 team,\u201d Gibbs said.",
      "Bell has shown he can win in a variety of ways on very different tracks.",
      "Bell won in Atlanta when he snatched the win in overtime on the oval superspeedway. On the road course at the Circuit of the Americas, he led just eight of 95 laps but won a four-car duel over the final 13.",
      "He first chased down Kyle Busch for the lead, then held off Daytona 500 winner William Byron and Tyler Reddick for the victory.",
      "And it took clean racing to get everyone to the finish line. Bell and Busch had a confrontation after last year's race in Austin, but the pair avoided the kind of bumper banging that would have started another one.",
      "The Austin victory was Bell's 11th career win and his third on a road course. He now has four consecutive seasons with multiple victories. He is also the first driver since Kevin Harvick in 2018 to win two of the first three races of the season.",
      "\u201cThe last two weeks at Atlanta and here, I kind of won without the fastest car, so it\u2019s really nice to get those back that I lost last year,\u201d Bell said. \u201cI\u2019m excited about what\u2019s to come. We have high expectations and high hopes and goals for this year.\"",
      "The series next heads to Phoenix, where Bell is the defending champion, and then Las Vegas.",
      "Crew chief Adam Stevens has already put down a marker on both races.",
      "\"There\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t go win the next two weeks,\u201d Stevens said. \u201c(Austin) has no bearing on next week whatsoever, and everybody is going to bring their best stuff and do their best job. But I really have so much faith in this team and Joe Gibbs Racing as a whole, and especially my driver, that I know we\u2019ll be a factor.\u201d",
      "And that's the confidence Gibbs has seen and heard in championship teams in the past, from the gridiron to pit lane.",
      "\u201cAdam, a great leader I think. He's got a young guy there (Bell) that's gaining confidence, and I think the whole team ... I do think it's hard to put everything together in Cup,\" Gibbs said. \"But I do think, like Adam said, we have it all together.\u201d",

      "Rodgers will become a free agent after the New York Jets release him. Jets general manager Darren Mougey and coach Aaron Glenn addressed the team\u2019s mutual decision and insisted the franchise\u2019s goal was to win now despite moving on from a four-time NFL MVP who had a disappointing two-year stint in New York.",

      "The Raiders would be an option for Rodgers if coaches believe he could fit into offensive coordinator Chip Kelly\u2019s system. A team official told the AP that evaluation hasn\u2019t been made yet. The person, speaking on condition of anonymity because the conversations are private, also said a reunion between Wilson and new Raiders coach Pete Carroll is unlikely. Darnold or Fields might be better fits for Las Vegas, which might select a quarterback with the sixth overall pick in the draft.",

The Commanders already added Samuel and only gave up a fifth-round pick so they have an opportunity to pursue Garrett.",

      "\u201cThat was never something that felt like ever got close, and it was never something that I allowed my mind to go to,\u201d McVay said of the possibility of a breakup with Stafford, whose agent was allowed to speak to other teams about the quarterback's potential value in a trade.",
      "The Rams got a deal done with the 37-year-old Stafford, whose return keeps them among the NFL's clear Super Bowl contenders for 2025.",
      "Los Angeles has made the playoffs three times in Stafford's four seasons, and the NFC West champion Rams gave the strongest challenge in the just-completed postseason to the eventual champion Philadelphia Eagles, who only narrowly won the teams' snowy divisional round meeting.",
      "The Rams haven't revealed the size of Stafford's pay raise, but McVay said the quarterback didn't add extra years to his contract. He is still signed through the 2026 season under the original four-year extension he accepted following the Rams' Super Bowl triumph in February 2022.",
      "\u201cThere was always an understanding that he wouldn\u2019t play under the number that he was due this coming year,\u201d McVay said. \"When he felt good with the way the season ended, and obviously we were all ecstatic about him wanting to continue to play, now it\u2019s just figuring out the semantics. ... There\u2019s no way to put an actual value on what he means, but what does it look like to be able to fit it (into) the landscape of our football team, where we\u2019re at, and what does that look like for the short and for the long term? Fortunately, we were able to come to a compromise and a conclusion that everybody feels really good about.\u201d",
      "Stafford also renegotiated his contract a year ago to get more guaranteed money. McVay has found a bright side to this annual chapter of offseason drama, which has included countless media debates and reports of other teams' interest in Stafford.",
      "\u201cLast year, (the negotiations) took about seven months,\u201d McVay said. \u201cThis year, about three weeks. So maybe it'll be about two, three days next year if we have to do this.\u201d",
      "Stafford was sharp for the Rams last season, passing for 3,762 yards with 20 touchdowns and eight interceptions while completing 65.8% of his throws. His return provides continuity and veteran leadership in McVay's offense, which also retained left tackle Alaric Jackson on a three-year, $57 million deal last week that kept him out of free agency.",
      "McVay said the Rams are eager to re-sign Jimmy Garoppolo as Stafford's backup, but they realize Garoppolo could get offers for more playing time.",

      "Topps\u2019 debut patch cards, which are autographed and contain a patch from the player\u2019s jersey for his debut, have become popular with major leaguers and longtime collectors",
      "GLENDALE, Ariz. -- Cam Booser's bumpy road to the major leagues included arm and back injuries, along with a stint as a carpenter in his native Seattle. Such an unlikely big league debut was worth commemorating, and he was determined to track down a specific memento \u2014 a one-of-a-kind baseball card that included a jersey patch from his uniform for his first game.",
      "So was his older sister, Kelsey.",
      "After scheming with the Neighborhood Card Shop in California for about a month, Kelsey surprised her younger brother with the prized card for one memorable Christmas present.",
      "\u201cThat was one of the cooler moments I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Cam Booser, a reliever who was traded from the Red Sox to the White Sox in December.",
      "Topps' debut patch cards, which are autographed and contain a patch from the jersey from the player's first MLB game, have captured the attention of some young major leaguers \u2014 even the ones with little previous interest in baseball cards \u2014 and longtime collectors. The patches are even part of this year's MLB The Show video game.",
      "The hype was ramped up by the pursuit of Paul Skenes' card after it was released in November. Dominic Canzone's mother managed to get her son's card for him, and Chandler Seagle's father presented his son's card to him. Joey Loperfido, an outfielder who made his major league debut last year, wrote \u201cDM me\u201d on the back of his card and offered an invitation to Thanksgiving in exchange for the memento \u2014 and got it back.",
      "\u201cI think it is a resemblance of a lifetime of work right in front of your eyes,\u201d Booser said.",
      "The debut patch cards are featured in Topps Chrome Update. Fanatics, which owns Topps, released a Major League Soccer version in December, and it plans to try the card in other properties as well.",
      "Some of the patch cards are inserted into Chrome Update, but many are distributed via redemption codes \u2014 where Topps ships out the one-of-one card in a protective case after it is claimed in an effort to protect its condition.",
      "There were 91 debut patch cards in the first year in 2023 and 251 last year. Jackson Merrill and Yoshinobu Yamamoto are among the sought after cards that haven't been publicly uncovered just yet.",
      "\u201cSo this was a completely different take on the traditional, let\u2019s call it, relic card,\u201d said Clay Luraschi, the head of product development for Topps. \u201cYou know, how can we work with Major League Baseball to create something that\u2019s exclusive for our trading cards versus receiving a jersey, cutting it up and making a card out of something that was used prior.\u201d",
      "The patches are sent to major league equipment managers before the season starts. When a player makes his debut, the patch is added to a sleeve on his jersey. It is removed after the game and authenticated before it is shipped back to Topps.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a collector. I\u2019ve never been a collector,\u201d Skenes said. \u201cI can imagine that it\u2019s cool for these kids to sort of feel that connection. I think the one thing that I would say you know potentially that hopefully it\u2019s giving them some hope and some relationship to the majors. Because we were all that kid at one point.\"",
      "The debut patch cards for Skenes \u2014 a hard-throwing right-hander who won the NL Rookie of the Year award with the Pittsburgh Pirates \u2014 and Jackson Holliday are part of a Fanatics Collect auction this month. Junior Caminero's card was sold for $66,000 in a Fanatics auction in December.",
      "Skenes' card was hotly pursued before an 11-year-old boy in Southern California opened the redemption on Christmas morning. The Pirates offered a package for the card in November that included two season tickets for 30 years, but the boy's family opted for the auction.",
      "The card was redeemed on Jan. 3, and Topps announced on Jan. 21 that it had been found. Topps posted on X on Jan. 4 that the Skenes card had yet to surface publicly, and published a video of Skenes talking about the card on Instagram on Jan. 8, along with the caption \u201cAre you accepting the Pirates offer if you pull this card??\u201d",
      "The 18 days between when the card was redeemed and Topps' public announcement led to some criticism from collectors who suspected it was a purposeful delay to help increase sales. A Fanatics Collectibles spokesman cited a variety of factors for the timing, including the holidays, protecting the anonymity of the family and the LA wildfires. The social media posts were attributed to the time it took for word of the card's discovery to filter through the large company.",
      "A Massachusetts man found a redemption for Loperfido's card and got in touch with the outfielder through social media. He drove the card to Loperfido's New Jersey home.",
      "Loperfido, who was traded from Houston to Toronto in July, gave the man money to cover his travel expenses, along with a bat, jersey and tickets and VIP passes for a Blue Jays game at Boston. Since the card hadn't been pulled yet, there was no Thanksgiving appearance.",
      "The 25-year-old Loperfido plans to raffle the card off to raise money for a non-profit organization that he volunteered with in college.",
      "\u201cIt captures an exciting and once-in-a-lifetime moment for guys in their career; their first game played in the big leagues,\u201d Loperfido said. \u201cI think it\u2019s special. ... People are looking for them. The guys coming up in the league, great players like Paul Skenes, these cards are really going to be worth something one day.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Organizers of a figure skating benefit event in Washington said they have already raised $1.2 million for victims of the D.C. plane crash and first responders.",
      "Monumental Sports & Entertainment on Monday said the Legacy on Ice tribute show Sunday in the nation's capital drew a sellout crowd of over 15,000 and more money is expected to come in over the next several weeks. After it was broadcast locally on Monumental Sports Network and streamed live on Peacock, NBC is set to air an encore performance on March 30.",
      "\u201cWe continue to be in awe of and grateful to this community, whose compassion and support was out in full force for the \u2018Legacy on Ice\u2019 event,\u201d Monumental chairman Ted Leonsis said in a statement. \u201cAgainst the backdrop of this massive tragedy, this region has provided a light in showcasing its generosity and empathy for the victims, their families, and the heroic first responders, and I encourage people to continue to donate if they can.\u201d",
      "The show featured performances from the likes of Johnny Weir, reigning world men's champion Ilia Malinin and back-to-back U.S. women's champion Amber Glenn, as well as poignant tributes to the 67 people who died when an Army helicopter collided with an American Airlines flight and crashed into the Potomac River just outside of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Jan. 29. That included 28 members of the figure skating community.",
      "\u201cBeing here in this region and knowing everyone on that flight in our community, it was a very traumatic experience for me and really just devastating for me to hear when all that happened,\u201d said Malinin, a Northern Virginia native who knew several of the skaters who were on the flight and was responsible for the idea that led to the event. \u201cI really wanted to have something that everyone could remember as a family, as a whole community that we remember them and they will be forever remembered.\u201d",
      "The poignant, two-plus-hour event was full of raw emotion, like 13-year-old Isabella Aparicio skating in memory of her brother, Franco, and father, Luciano, who were on the flight and weeping on her knees at the conclusion of her appearance. Maxim Naumov, who lost his parents in the crash, performed in their honor and wiped away tears as he left the ice, holding up an electric candle as applause rained down.",
      "\u201cIt really put me to tears and it put a lot of us to tears,\u201d Malinin said. \"I was really just proud of him for being able to kind of wrap his mind around this and really just get on that ice and perform with everything he\u2019s got.\u201d",
      "The event was put together a week after the crash, and the star-studded cast of some of U.S. figure skating's best of the past and present included Olympic champions Scott Hamilton, Brian Boitano, Kristi Yamaguchi and Nathan Chen.",
      "Monumental said nearly 500 first responders and approximately 150 family members of victims were in attendance. The money raised is set to be split among the 67 families affected, first responders and U.S. Figure Skating.",
      "\u201cWe want to raise a lot of money and make sure that a third goes to the skaters community, a third goes to the first responders and a third goes to the families,\u201d Leonsis told The Associated Press on Sunday. \u201cPeople care. The lesson in this is that, to me, if you personalize something like this, you can come together and do the right things in the right way. I\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve done.\u201d",

      "\u201cI am hopeful,\u201d ex-FIFA president Blatter, appearing frail one week before his 89th birthday, told reporters in German as he walked slowly down a flight of stairs toward the court house, reaching for the handrail to steady himself before wishing everyone a good day.",
      "He arrived 10 minutes after his co-defendant Platini, the former UEFA president and FIFA vice president.",
      "Blatter and Platini are facing a second trial nearly three years after they were acquitted by three federal judges. The charges relate to a Blatter-approved FIFA payment of 2 million Swiss francs (now $2.21 million) to Platini.",
      "When federal prosecutors published their initial indictment in November 2021, they said the payment \"damaged FIFA\u2019s assets and unlawfully enriched Platini.\u201d",

      "The former FIFA president is exiled from soccer until late in 2028 \u2014 when he will be aged 92 \u2014 because of an ethics prosecution of alleged self-dealing in eight-figure management bonuses paid for successfully organizing the men\u2019s World Cup in 2010 and 2014.",

      "Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost lander descended from lunar orbit on autopilot, aiming for the slopes of an ancient volcanic dome in an impact basin on the moon\u2019s northeastern edge of the near side.",
      "Confirmation of successful touchdown came from the company's Mission Control outside Austin, Texas, following the action some 225,000 miles (360,000 kilometers) away.",
      "\u201cYou all stuck the landing. We\u2019re on the moon,\u201d Firefly\u2019s Will Coogan, chief engineer for the lander, reported.",
      "An upright and stable landing makes Firefly \u2014 a startup founded a decade ago \u2014 the first private outfit to put a spacecraft on the moon without crashing or falling over. Even countries have faltered, with only five claiming success: Russia, the U.S., China, India and Japan.",

      "Launched in mid-January from Florida, the lander carried 10 experiments to the moon for NASA. The space agency paid $101 million for the delivery, plus $44 million for the science and tech on board. It\u2019s the third mission under NASA\u2019s commercial lunar delivery program, intended to ignite a lunar economy of competing private businesses while scouting around before astronauts show up later this decade.",
      "Firefly\u2019s Ray Allensworth said the lander skipped over hazards including boulders to land safely. Allensworth said the team continued to analyze the data to figure out the lander's exact position, but all indications suggest it landed within the 328-foot (100-meter) target zone in Mare Crisium.",
      "The demos should get two weeks of run time, before lunar daytime ends and the lander shuts down.",
      "It carried a vacuum to suck up moon dirt for analysis and a drill to measure temperature as deep as 10 feet (3 meters) below the surface. Also on board: a device for eliminating abrasive lunar dust \u2014 a scourge for NASA\u2019s long-ago Apollo moonwalkers, who got it caked all over their spacesuits and equipment.",
      "On its way to the moon, Blue Ghost beamed back exquisite pictures of the home planet. The lander continued to stun once in orbit around the moon, with detailed shots of the moon's gray pockmarked surface. At the same time, an on-board receiver tracked and acquired signals from the U.S. GPS and European Galileo constellations, an encouraging step forward in navigation for future explorers.",
      "The landing set the stage for a fresh crush of visitors angling for a piece of lunar business.",
      "Another lander \u2014 a tall and skinny 15-footer (4 meters tall) built and operated by Houston-based Intuitive Machines \u2014 is due to land on the moon Thursday. It\u2019s aiming for the bottom of the moon, just 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the south pole. That\u2019s closer to the pole than the company got last year with its first lander, which broke a leg and tipped over.",
      "Despite the tumble, Intuitive Machines' lander put the U.S. back on the moon for the first time since NASA astronauts closed out the Apollo program in 1972.",
      "A third lander from the Japanese company ispace is still three months from landing. It shared a rocket ride with Blue Ghost from Cape Canaveral on Jan. 15, taking a longer, windier route. Like Intuitive Machines, ispace is also attempting to land on the moon for the second time. Its first lander crashed in 2023.",
      "The moon is littered with wreckage not only from ispace, but dozens of other failed attempts over the decades.",

      "Unwanted phone calls are out of control",
      "LONDON -- Unwanted phone calls are out of control. Whether it's a robocall trying to sell you something or spam calls from scammers trying to rip you off, it's enough to make you want to stop answering your phone. So what can you do to stop them?",
      "The scourge of unwanted phone calls has been branded an epidemic by consumer groups, while the Federal Communications Commission says it's the top consumer complaint. The calls are a nuisance to many ordinary people, some of whom have complained to The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI need help on getting spam calls to stop,\u201d one reader said in an email. She's getting up to 14 calls a day despite the countermeasures she's employed.",
      "As the name implies, robocalls are automated calls to deliver recorded messages to a large number of phones. A robocall purely to deliver a message or collect a debt is allowed under U.S. regulations, but the Federal Trade Commission says robocalls with a recorded voice trying to sell you something are illegal unless you've given explicit written permission to receive them. Many robocalls are also probably scams, the FTC warns.",
      "If you're flooded by unsolicited calls, here are some ways to fight back.",
      "Smartphone users can turn on some built-in settings to combat unknown calls.",
      "Apple advises iPhone users to turn on the Silence Unknown Callers feature. Go to your \u201cSettings,\u201d then scroll down to \u201cApps,\u201d and then to \u201cPhone,\u201d where you'll see it under the \u201cCalls\u201d section. When you turn this on, any calls from numbers that you've never been in touch with and aren't saved in your contacts list will not ring through. Instead, they'll be sent to voicemail and show up in your list of recent calls.",
      "Android has a similar setting that allows you to block calls from private or unidentified numbers, although you will still receive calls from numbers that aren't stored in your contact list.",
      "Just keep in mind that you could also end up not getting important calls, which sometimes come from unknown numbers.",
      "If an unwanted call does get through, both Android and iPhone users can block the individual phone number by tapping on it in the recent callers or call history list. You can also enter numbers directly into your phone's block list.",
      "Sign up for the national Do Not Call registry, which is a list of numbers that have opted out of most telemarketing calls. The Federal Trade Commission, which runs the registry, says it only contains phone numbers and holds no other personally identifiable information, nor does the registry know whether the number is for a landline or a cellphone.",
      "The FTC says there are some exemptions, including political calls, calls from non-profit groups and charities, and legitimate survey groups that aren't selling anything. Also allowed are calls from companies up to 18 months after you've done \u2014 or sought to do \u2014 business with them.",
      "But it also warns that while having your number on the registry will cut down on unwanted sales calls, it won\u2019t stop scammers from making illegal calls.",
      "Other countries have similar registries. Canada has its own Do Not Call list while the U.K. has the Telephone Preference Service.",
      "Check whether your wireless carrier has a call-blocking service. Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T, three of the biggest U.S. networks, all have their own call filters for customers to block robocalls and report spam. There's typically a free basic version and an advanced version that requires a subscription fee.",
      "If your phone company's filters aren't good enough, try third-party apps to weed out unwanted callers.",
      "There are a host of smartphone apps available that promise to block spam calls, like Nomorobo, YouMail, Hiya, RoboKiller, TrueCaller and others. Many charge a monthly or annual subscription fee but some offer a free basic option. Some also can be installed on landline phones, but only if they use VOIP technology, not copper cables.",
      "The Associated Press hasn't tested any of these apps and isn't making specific recommendations. We recommend you read user reviews and try some out for yourself.",
      "Apple says the apps work by comparing a caller's number with a list of known numbers and labeling them, for example, spam or telemarketing. Then it might automatically block the call. \u201cIncoming calls are never sent to third-party developers,\u201d the company says.",
      "Did you know you can file a complaint with the FCC about specific spam calls? You can do so easily through an online form. It might not give you immediate satisfaction, but the National Consumer Law Center says data on complaints is the best tool federal agencies have for determining how big a problem robocalls are.",
      "While companies you've done business with can make robocalls to you, the National Consumer Law Center says it's probably because you gave consent - possibly hidden in fine print. But you can also revoke your consent at any time.",
      "Just tell the company representative that you want to \u201crevoke consent,\u201d and if that doesn't stop them, contact customer service and tell them that you don't consent to receive calls and want your number added to the company's \u201cdo not call\u201d list, the center says.",
      "You might be tempted to try to engage with the call in an attempt to get your number off the call list or be put through to a real person. The FTC warns against doing this and recommends that you just hang up.",
      "\u201cPressing numbers to speak to someone or remove you from the list will probably only lead to more robocalls,\u201d the agency says on its advice page. \u201cAnd the number on your caller ID probably isn\u2019t real. Caller ID is easy to fake\" and can't be trusted, it says.",
      "Cybersecurity company Kaspersky advises not even saying anything when you receive what you think is a robocall. We've all received scammy calls that start with something like \u201cHello, can you hear me?\u201d to which you've probably replied \u201cyes\u201d without thinking.",
      "Scammers \u201ccan then store the recording of your confirmation and use it for fraudulent activities,\u201d Kaspersky says. \u201cSo, avoid saying yes where possible.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- When Donald Trump started the biggest trade war since the 1930s in his first term, his impulsive combination of threats and import taxes on U.S. trading partners created chaos, generated drama -- and drew criticism from mainstream economists who favor free trade.",
      "But it didn\u2019t do much damage to the U.S. economy. Or much good. Inflation stayed under control. The economy kept growing as it had before. And America\u2019s massive trade deficits, the main target of Trump\u2019s ire, proved resistant to his rhetoric and his tariffs: Already big, they got bigger.",
      "The trade war sequel that Trump has introduced in his second term is likely to be a different matter altogether. Trump appears to have grander ambitions and is operating in a far more treacherous economic environment this time.",
      "His plans to plaster tariffs of 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada and to double a 10% levy on China Tuesday \u2013 and to follow those up by targeting other countries \u2013 would threaten growth, and push up prices in the United States, undermining his campaign pledge to eliminate the inflation that plagued President Joe Biden.",
      "The tariffs would be paid by U.S. importers, who would then try to pass along the higher costs to consumers through higher prices.",
      "Trump himself has warned of possible fallout. \u201cWILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!),\u201d Trump said in a social media post last month. \u201cBUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.\u201d",
      "For a while, most of the hostilities were on hold. Trump, who had said he would hit Canada and Mexico on Feb. 4, delayed imposing the tariffs for 30 days. Now they're scheduled to start Tuesday. He went ahead with 10% import taxes on Chinese goods \u2014 and Beijing promptly retaliated by hitting U.S. coal, big cars and other items \u2014 and plans to double them Tuesday.",
      "Trump views tariffs \u2013 taxes on imports \u2013 as an economic elixir that can restore factories to the American heartland, raise money for the government and pressure foreign countries to do what he wants.",
      "During his first term, Trump put tariffs on most Chinese goods and on imported solar panels, washing machines, steel and aluminum. The tax increases might have raised prices on those items, but they had little or no impact on overall inflation, which remained modest. Nor did they do much to restore factory jobs.",
      "Economists agree that a second Trump trade war could be far costlier than the first.",
      "\u201cThat was then. This is now,\u2019\u2019 said trade analyst William Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, his trade team carefully focused its tariff hit list to avoid or at least delay the impact on consumers. They targeted industrial products and not those \u201cthat would show up on Walmart\u2019s shelves,\u201d said Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official. \"That tamped down the impact.\u2019\u2019",
      "This time, by contrast, the tariffs are across the board \u2013 although the tariffs Trump plans Tuesday would limit hte levy on Canadian energy to 10%, showing that he was mindful of how much Americans in northern and midwestern states depend on oil and electricity from north of the border.",
      "In Boca Raton, Florida, the toy company Basic Fun is preparing to raise prices and absorb a hit to profits when the tariffs land.",
      "Ninety percent of Basic Fun\u2019s toys come from China, including Tonka and Care Bears. CEO Jay Foreman says the price on the Tonka Classic Steel Mighty Dump Truck is likely to rise later this year from $29.99 to as much as $39.99.",
      "Five years ago, the Trump administration spared toys, exempting them from its China tariffs. This time, Foreman said, \"we are now just going to forecast a lot of money draining out of the company.''",
      "Also worrying, economists say, is a retaliation clause the Trump team inserted in the tariff orders he signed last month.",
      "If other countries retaliate against Trump\u2019s tariffs with tariffs of their own \u2013 as China did and Canada and Mexico have threatened -- Trump will lash back with still more tariffs. That risks \u201csetting off a spiraling trade war\u2019\u2019 of tit-for-tat tariffs and counter-tariffs, said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University.",
      "Economists gathered Monday at a conference of the National Association for Business Economics were generally wary of the import taxes and their impact on the economy. Michael Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, estimated that the proposed duties could drag down economic growth by as much as a half-percentage point.",
      "One big difference between Trump\u2019s first term is that he's likely to get less pushback from his own aides. \u201cThis is true religion inside the White House right now, unlike the first term, when many of the president\u2019s advisers were deeply skeptical of this policy,\u201d Strain said.",
      "Diane Swonk, chief economist at the giant accounting firm KPMG, said the impact of tariffs this time would likely be much bigger than in 2018-2019. Among other things, the president is planning to impose what he calls \"reciprocal tariffs'' \u2014 and raise U.S. import taxes to match higher tariffs charged by other countries.",
      "\u201cThe breadth and scope are different,\u201d Swonk said. \u201cThe goals are different. It\u2019s not just one country, we\u2019re talking about multiple countries at the same time. And the rest of the world is ready to retaliate.\u201d",
      "One of those goals that Trump has cited more often than last time is using tariffs to raise revenue for the government, Swonk noted. Trump and some of his officials have talked about substituting tariff revenue for income taxes. If so, that would mean keeping the tariffs in place even if countries like Canada and Mexico agreed to Trump\u2019s demands on other issues, such as immigration restrictions.",
      "Perhaps the biggest difference is the economic backdrop Trump must contend with this time.",
      "Six years ago, inflation was low \u2014 maybe even too low, the Federal Reserve fretted. Trump's first-term tariffs didn't make a dent.",
      "Inflation isn't so benign anymore. Prices surged in the unexpected boom that followed the end of COVID-19 lockdowns. Inflation has come down from the four-decade high it hit in mid-2022, but it's still stuck above the Fed's 2% target and hasn't shown much improvement since summer.",
      "Trump\u2019s tariffs could rekindle the inflationary trend and convince the Fed to cancel or postpone the two interest rate cuts it had anticipated this year. That would risk keeping \"interest rates at their current elevated level for a longer period in 2025. That will push up mortgage and loan borrowing rates ... and reduce real growth,\u2019\u2019 said Boston College economist Brian Bethune.",
      "Outside a Harris Teeter supermarket near downtown Raleigh, North Carolina, Jacobs Ogadi had in his shopping bag an avocado, which almost certainly came from Mexico.",
      "The 62-year-old mechanic said it \u201cdoesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist\u2019\u2019 to know that Trump\u2019s tariffs run counter to his promises to rein in inflation. \u201cIf it goes up 25%, it\u2019s not the government, it\u2019s not the Mexican people paying for it,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWho pays for it? Us.\u2019\u2019",

      "The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race is usually billed as a 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer) race across Alaska. The route change means it's now 1,128 miles (1,815 kilometers). Mushers began their trek to the finish line in Nome from Fairbanks, the fourth time this century the race has been forced north from the Anchorage area.",
      "A lack of snow in the Anchorage area also caused headaches for race organizers Saturday during the ceremonial start. The parade-like route in Anchorage usually has mushers taking a leisurely course over 11 miles (17.70 kilometers) of city streets and trails with an auction winner riding in their sled.",
      "However, weeks of little-to-no new snowfall and warm temperatures in Alaska\u2019s largest city forced organizers to shorten the ceremonial start to less than 2 miles (3.22 kilometers), run over snow that was trucked in to cover downtown city streets.",
      "There are 33 mushers in this year\u2019s race, tied with the 2023 race for smallest field ever. Among them are two former champions, Ryan Redington and three-time winner Mitch Seavey.",

      "Authorities alleged Crimo perched on a roof and fired into crowds assembled for the annual Fourth of July parade in downtown Highland Park, 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Chicago.",
      "Prosecutors have submitted thousands of pages of evidence, as well as hours of a videotaped interrogation during which police say Crimo confessed to the shooting. But the 24-year-old has since pleaded not guilty.",
      "His defense attorneys have declined comment ahead of the trial, which is expected to last about a month.",
      "His father, Robert Crimo Jr., a onetime mayoral candidate, was charged in connection with how his son obtained a gun license. He pleaded guilty in 2023 to seven misdemeanor counts of reckless conduct and served less than two months in jail.",
      "He has attended his son\u2019s hearings, sometimes making eye contact with him during court. He declined to discuss the case in detail ahead of the trial.",
      "\u201cAs a parent, I love my son very much,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Bobby loves this country more than anyone would ever know.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors plan to call multiple law enforcement officers and survivors of the shooting to testify. They also will show videos of Crimo\u2019s statements to police. Some of the videos already have been shown in court as prosecutors tried unsuccessfully to have them thrown out.",
      "Crimo\u2019s erratic behavior has contributed to court delays.",
      "He fired his public defenders and said he would represent himself, then abruptly reversed himself. In June 2024, when he was expected to accept a plea deal and give victims and relatives a chance to address him publicly, he arrived at the court in a wheelchair and rejected the deal.",
      "Residents in the wealthy Highland Park community of roughly 30,000 set along Lake Michigan have mourned the losses deeply. Some potential jurors were excused because of their connections to the case.",
      "City leaders canceled the usual parade in 2023, opting for a \u201ccommunity walk.\u201d The parade was reinstated last year on a different route and with a memorial for the victims.",
      "\u201cOur community is once again reminded of the immense pain and trauma caused by the Highland Park shooting,\u201d Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering said in a statement ahead of jury selection. \u201cOur hearts remain with the victims, their families, and all those whose lives were forever changed by that devastating day.\u201d",
      "The victims killed in the shooting included Katherine Goldstein, 64; Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63; Stephen Straus, 88; Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78; Eduardo Uvaldo, 69; and married couple Kevin McCarthy, 37, and Irina McCarthy, 35.",
      "Survivors and their families have filed multiple lawsuits, including against the maker of the semiautomatic rifle used in the shooting and against authorities they accuse of negligence."

      "The California Highway Patrol says drug use and excessive speed were factors in last year\u2019s fiery crash of a Tesla Cybertruck that killed three college students near San Francisco",
      "PIEDMONT, Calif. -- Drug use and excessive speed were to blame for last year's fiery crash of a Tesla Cybertruck that killed three college students near San Francisco, the California Highway Patrol said in a preliminary report.",
      "Four people were in the Cybertruck when it veered off a road, slammed into a retaining wall and burst into flames shortly after 3 a.m. on Nov. 27 in Piedmont.",
      "\u201cOfficers determined that a combination of driving under the influence of drugs and unsafe speed were the causes\u201d of the crash, the highway patrol said in a statement last week.",
      "Although police officers who responded were unable to douse the flames with their fire extinguishers, the fire department put the blaze out quickly, officials said at the time.",
      "Piedmont Fire Chief Dave Brannigan said the day after the crash that the speed in extinguishing the flames meant it was unlikely that the Cybertruck\u2019s large lithium-ion battery had caught fire. He called the incident \u201cmore along the lines of a typical car fire.\u201d",
      "Killed in the single-vehicle crash were Soren Dixon, 19, Jack Nelson, 20, and Krysta Tsukahara, 19. The fourth occupant, Jordan Miller, 20, survived after someone in another car managed to pull him out of the wreckage. All four were home from college for Thanksgiving break and graduates of Piedmont High School, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Sunday.",
      "The Chronicle cited toxicology reports that determined the three victims who died had alcohol, cocaine and other substances in their system. Their deaths were ruled an accident because they were caused by asphyxia due to inhalation of smoke from the car, and burns were a \u201csignificant\u201d factor in their deaths, the autopsy report said.",
      "The highway patrol's investigation is ongoing and a final reported is expected within months, the agency said.",
      "The Cybertruck, which has been available for purchase for more than a year, has been recalled multiple times for safety problems, including once in November because a fault in an electric inverter can cause the drive wheels to lose power. Last April, the futuristic-looking trucks were recalled to fix gas pedals that can get stuck in the interior trim."

      "\u201cI do believe we need to be saved \u2014 from him,\u201d Adams said at a City Hall news conference.",
      "The comment was Adams' first public criticism of Cuomo since the former governor launched his campaign Saturday with a 17-minute video that blasted the city's leadership and described it as a threatening place where crime has spun out of control. It was also the public's first preview at how the race between the two scandal-scarred politicians may look in the months until June's Democratic primary election.",
      "Asked whether sexual harassment allegations against Cuomo \u2014 and his administration's undercounting of COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes \u2014 were \u201cdisqualifying,\u201d Adams responded that he doesn't believe in disqualifying a person unless they do something \u201cthat\u2019s really despicable.\u201d",
      "He said he had met with families of nursing home residents and that he believed the women who have made allegations against Cuomo. But, he said, those were issues Cuomo would have to answer for on the campaign trail.",
      "Reached for comment, Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi said: \u201cWe\u2019ll let the voters decide.\u201d",
      "Adams was indicted last year in a sweeping bribery case in which federal prosecutors allege Adams accepted luxury travel perks and illegal campaign contributions. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "The incumbent's woes deepened significantly this year after the U.S. Department of Justice moved to drop the case so Adams could help with Republican President Donald Trump's immigration agenda, leaving open the possibility that the case could be reinstated at a future date.",
      "Cuomo entered the race with an announcement that framed himself as an experienced moderate leader with the political knowhow to tackle the city's most pressing issues.",
      "But he has his own set of damaging baggage: Cuomo resigned in 2021 after a report from the state's attorney general found that Cuomo sexually harassed at least 11 women.",
      "He has also been criticized for his COVID-19 response, in particular a policy that early in the pandemic barred nursing homes from refusing to readmit coronavirus patients who were discharged from hospitals.",
      "Cuomo and Adams are among several candidates in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary race, which given the city's political bent, is widely viewed as the defining contest of the election. Also running in the primary is Comptroller Brad Lander, state Sen. Zellnor Myrie, state Sen. Jessica Ramos, state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani and former city Comptroller Scott Stringer."

      "Authorities believe the brothers are deceased and they clearly suspect John Skelton is responsible, though he has not been charged with killing his sons. By November, he is expected to complete a 15-year prison sentence for his failure to give the boys back to Tanya Zuvers, the sole conviction in the saga.",
      "A Lenawee County judge will begin hearing testimony Monday at an unusual hearing. The witness list includes Zuvers, as well as police investigators who will publicly discuss the yearslong effort to find any trace of Andrew, Alexander and Tanner Skelton.",
      "Since November 2010, Zuvers has prayed someone \"would cure her broken heart\" with news about their whereabouts or that John Skelton would explain what really happened, attorney R. Burke Castleberry said in a court filing.",
      "\u201cHeartbreakingly, none of that has occurred,\u201d he wrote.",

      "A court declaration also could \u201cgive someone authority to pursue a wrongful death claim or other civil claim,\u201d said Piwowarski, who is not involved in the case.",
      "Castleberry declined to comment ahead of the hearing. Skelton, 53, did not respond to an email sent to him in prison about the petition filed by Zuvers.",
      "The brothers, ages 9, 7 and 5, lived in Morenci, a small community next to the Ohio border, 100 miles (161 kilometers) southwest of Detroit. Zuvers was seeking a divorce from Skelton in fall 2010 and the boys were with him, a few doors away, on Thanksgiving.",
      "They were supposed to return to Zuvers the next morning. Instead, they were gone. Police later determined Skelton's phone was in Ohio at 4:30 a.m. before it was turned off and then turned back on at 6 a.m. in Morenci.",
      "Skelton denied harming his sons and said they were with an underground group for their safety, among other murky explanations, according to investigators.",
      "People spent weeks searching woods and waters in Michigan and Ohio. While in prison, Skelton told authorities that a man who helps people leave Amish communities might know about the boys, but Castleberry said it was \u201canother lie.\u201d",
      "Investigators at the court hearing \u201cwill detail the farfetched, unfathomable yarns John Skelton spun, leading authorities on one wild goose chase after another,\u201d Castleberry said.",

      "Canada is by far America\u2019s biggest foreign supplier of crude oil. In 2024, Canada shipped the U.S. $98 billion worth of crude, well ahead of No. 2 Mexico at $12 billion.",
      "For many U.S. refineries, there\u2019s not much choice. Canada produces the \u201ctype of crude oil that American refineries are geared to process,\u2019\u2019 Lincicome said. \u201cIt\u2019s a heavier crude. All the fracking and all the oil and gas we make here in the United States \u2013 or most of it \u2013 is a lighter crude that a lot of American refineries don\u2019t process, particularly in the Midwest.\u2019\u2019",
      "Of the tariffs on Canadian oil imports, Lincicome said, \u201chow the heck does that shake out? My guess is that it shakes out just through higher gas prices, particularly in the Midwest.\u2019\u2019",

      "Tariffs could raise the price for those raising a glass of tequila or Canadian whisky.",
      "In 2023, the U.S. imported $4.6 billion worth of tequila and $108 million worth of mezcal from Mexico, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade group. The U.S. imported $537 million worth of Canadian spirits, including $202.5 million worth of whisky.",
      "Canada and Mexico were also the second- and third-largest importers of U.S. spirits in 2023, behind the European Union, the council said.",
      "The council said the U.S. is already facing a potentially devastating 50% tariff on American whiskey by the European Union, which is set to begin in March. Imposing tariffs on Mexico and Canada could pile even more retaliatory action on the industry.",
      "Chris Swonger, the council\u2019s president and CEO, said he appreciates the goal of protecting U.S. jobs. But tequila and Canadian whisky \u2013 like Kentucky bourbon -- are designated as distinctive products that can only be made in their country of origin.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, tariffs on spirits products from our neighbors to the north and south are going to hurt U.S. consumers and lead to job losses across the U.S. hospitality industry, just as these businesses continue their long recovery from the pandemic,\u201d Swonger said.",
      "For American consumers still exasperated by high grocery prices, a trade war with Canada, Mexico and China could be painful. In 2024, the U.S. bought more than $49 billion in agricultural products from Mexico \u2013- including 47% of imported vegetables and 40% of fruits. Farm imports from Canada came to $41 billion. A 25% tariff could push prices up.",
      "\u201cGrocery stores operate on really tiny margins,\u2019\u2019 Lincicome said. \u201cThey can\u2019t eat the tariffs ... especially when you talk about things like avocados that basically all of them \u2013 90% -- come from Mexico. You\u2019re talking about guacamole tariffs.''",
      "U.S. farmers are nervous, too, that Canada and Mexico will retaliate by slapping tariffs on American products such as soybeans and corn. That\u2019s what happened in the first Trump administration. China and other targets of Trump tariffs hit back by targeting the president\u2019s supporters in rural America. Exports of soybeans and other farm products dropped, so Trump spent billions of U.S. taxpayer money to reimburse farmers for lost sales.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump was as good as his word,\u2019\u2019 said Mark McHargue, a Central City, Nebraska, farmer who grows corn, soybeans, popcorn and raises hogs. \u201cIt did take the sting out of it. That\u2019s for sure.\u2019\u2019 But he would prefer to see the government push to open foreign markets to American farm exports. \u201cWe would rather get our money from the market,\u2019\u2019 said McHargue, president of the Nebraska Farm Bureau. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel great to get a government check.\u2019\u2019",

      "A federal lawsuit accuses Atlanta police of systemically targeting critics of a police and firefighter training center",
      "ATLANTA -- Atlanta police have for years illegally targeted critics of a police and firefighter training center, according to a federal lawsuit filed on behalf of a protester who is one of dozens of \u201cStop Cop City\u201d activists facing domestic terrorism and racketeering charges.",
      "The lawsuit, filed on behalf of Jamie Marsicano, alleges that authorities view any critic of the training center as a would-be criminal and have repeatedly made arrests without cause, depriving protesters of their First Amendment rights and their civil rights protections against false arrest and malicious prosecution.",
      "The long-brewing controversy over the training center erupted in January 2023 after state troopers who were part of a sweep of the South River Forest killed an activist who authorities said had fired at them. Numerous protests ensued, with masked vandals sometimes attacking police vehicles and construction equipment to stall the project and intimidate contractors into backing out.",
      "Though the training center is nearly complete, dozens of defendants, including Marsicano, are facing a state racketeering charge that critics have decried as heavy-handed attempts to silence the movement, which emerged in the wake of the 2020 racial justice protests. Environmental activists and anti-police demonstrators argued that uprooting acres of trees for the facility would exacerbate environmental damage in a flood-prone, majority-Black area while serving as an expensive staging ground for militarized officers to be trained in quelling social movements.",
      "Marsicano, 31, was among 23 people arrested near a music festival in DeKalb County in March 2023, hours after a group of more than 150 masked festivalgoers trekked about three-quarters of a mile (1.2 kilometers) through the South River Forest and stormed the training center's construction site, with some lighting equipment on fire as others threw objects at retreating officers. The group then returned to the festival to blend in with the crowd.",
      "According to an arrest warrant, authorities said Marsicano, who uses they/them pronouns, was taken into custody because they had on \u201cmuddy clothing\u201d from crossing through the woods and possessed a shield, assertions that Marsicano's attorneys say are false.",
      "Marsicano's attorneys say their client was not among the group that attacked the construction site and never left the festival grounds until they were arrested while walking back to their vehicle after police ordered everyone to disperse.",
      "Marsicano was caught up in an \u201cindiscriminate mass arrest of legitimate festival attendees\u201d that was part of a pattern spearheaded by Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum of authorities targeting the \u201cStop Cop City\u201d movement, according to the lawsuit, which was filed Feb. 24.",
      "Marsicano was subsequently charged with domestic terrorism and, months later, was one of 61 charged with violating Georgia\u2019s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO.",
      "Marsicano was banned from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill campus after their arrest and completed their law degree remotely but has had difficulty finding a job and securing housing because of the charges, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Marsicano was \u201cpublicly broadcast to the world as a \u2018domestic terrorist\u2019 and \u2018RICO co-conspirator,\u2019 forever tarnishing Plaintiff\u2019s personal and professional life,\u201d the lawsuit said.",
      "The lawsuit lists more than a dozen instances in which authorities \u201cpretextually charged individuals deemed to be at or around Stop Cop City,\u201d including after a May 2022 protest where three people \u201cwalking home were selectively stopped for carrying Stop Cop City signs,\u201d and taken into custody. Those arrests, as well as others, have led to civil lawsuits that are pending.",
      "Marsicano's lawsuit names various law enforcement officials as well as the city of Atlanta, which it accuses of having made a \u201ccustom and practice\u201d of targeting critics of the training center.",
      "Neither the Atlanta Police Department nor a spokesperson for the city immediately responded to a request for comment.",
      "City officials say the $115 million, 85-acre (34-hectare) campus will replace outdated, far-flung facilities and boost police morale amid hiring and retention struggles. Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens has also said that the facility will teach the \u201cmost progressive training and curriculum in the country\u201d and that officials have repeatedly revised their plans to address environmental concerns."

      "South Carolina is preparing this week to execute a man by firing squad, a capital punishment method that hasn\u2019t been used in the U.S. in nearly 15 years",
      "HOUSTON -- South Carolina is preparing this week to execute a man by firing squad, a capital punishment method that hasn\u2019t been used in the U.S. in nearly 15 years.",
      "Since the Supreme Court lifted its ban on capital punishment in 1976, states have used five different execution methods: lethal injection, electrocution, lethal gas, firing squad and hanging.",
      "Brad Sigmon is scheduled to die Friday in South Carolina. He was convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend\u2019s parents with a baseball bat at their home in 2001.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at how the U.S. executes people:",
      "Lethal injection has been the preferred method in the modern era, with 1,428 carried out since 1976. Texas has done the most, killing 593 inmates, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit center.",
      "Twenty-eight states as well as the U.S. military and U.S. government authorize the use of lethal injection, in which an inmate has a deadly mixture of drugs injected into them as they are strapped to a gurney.",
      "But throughout its use, lethal injection has been plagued by problems, including delays in finding suitable veins, needles becoming clogged or disengaged and problems with securing enough of the required drugs.",
      "\u201cA number of states are beginning to experiment with new methods of execution ... because of the problems with lethal injection,\u201d said John Banzhaf, a professor emeritus of law at George Washington University Law School.",
      "Nine states authorize the use of electrocution, including Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Tennessee. Since 1976, 163 electrocutions have been carried out. But only 19 have been done since 2000.",
      "In this method, a person is strapped to a chair and has electrodes placed on their head and leg before a jolt of between 500 and 2,000 volts runs through their body. The last electrocution took place in 2020 in Tennessee.",
      "Texas used electrocution from 1924 to 1964, killing 361 inmates, according to the state's Department of Criminal Justice. The electric chair Texas used was nicknamed \u201cOld Sparky.\u201d It is now displayed at the Texas Prison Museum in Huntsville, where the state\u2019s death chamber is located.",
      "Lethal gas is authorized as the default execution method in eight states: Alabama, Arizona, California, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma and Wyoming.",
      "From 1979 to 1999, 11 inmates were executed using this method, in which a prisoner would be strapped to a chair in an airtight chamber before it was filled with cyanide gas.",
      "In 2024, Alabama revived this method when it became the first state to use nitrogen gas to execute Kenneth Eugene Smith. A mask is placed over a prisoner\u2019s face and nitrogen gas is pumped in, depriving the person of oxygen and resulting in death.",
      "Alabama's last such execution took place in February.",
      "Since 1977, only three inmates have been executed by firing squad and all were in Utah, with the last one in 2010, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "Five states including Idaho, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Utah authorize its use, but it is not the primary execution method. For this method, an inmate is usually bound to a chair and is shot through the heart by a group of prison staffers standing 20 to 25 feet (6 to 7.6 meters) away.",
      "Idaho has had firing squad executions on the books as a backup if lethal injection drugs are unavailable since 2023. But in the wake of last year\u2019s botched lethal injection attempt on Thomas Eugene Creech, lawmakers are considering a bill to make firing squads the primary execution method.",
      "The bill\u2019s sponsor, Republican Sen. Doug Ricks, has suggested Idaho could use a firing squad machine, triggering the guns electronically to eliminate the need for additional execution team members.",
      "In the U.S., hanging was the main method of execution until about the 1890s, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "Data collected by researchers of U.S. executions from 1608 to 2002 found 9,322 people were put to death by hanging, in which a person was blindfolded and their hands and legs were secured before a noose was placed around the neck and they fell through a trap door.",
      "But in capital punishment\u2019s modern era, only three individuals in the U.S. have been executed by hanging in 1993, 1994 and 1996. New Hampshire\u2019s remaining death row inmate could be executed by hanging if lethal injection is not available.",

      "The disastrous Oval Office meeting on Friday that exploded in acrimony when Trump and Vice President JD Vance accused Zelenskyy of refusing to negotiate peace and berated him for being ingrateful for U.S. support so far has cast doubts over the future of U.S.-Ukrainian relations.",
      "The Kremlin was quick to cast the White House encounter as a proof of Zelenskyy\u2019s reluctance to negotiate an end to the three-year conflict.",
      "\u201cWhat happened in the White House on Friday certainly showed how difficult it will be to get on the path to a Ukrainian settlement,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. \"The Kyiv regime and Zelenskyy do not want peace, they want the war to continue.\u201d",
      "He claimed that the White House blowup has proven President Vladimir Putin's statements about Kyiv's refusal to hold peace talks. Putin, who sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, has declared his openness for peace but demanded that Ukraine abandon its bid to join NATO and withdraw its troops from the four regions that Russia illegally annexed in 2022 but never fully captured.",
      "\u201cPresident Putin was right when he said that despite the openness of the Russian side to the negotiation process, these good intentions run into the unwillingness of the Kyiv regime to maintain such dynamics,\u201d Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. \u201cWe saw this to the full extent in Washington. In this situation, of course, Washington\u2019s efforts and Moscow\u2019s readiness alone will clearly not be enough, a crucial element is missing.\u201d",

      "\"As a minimum, Zelenskyy has shown an utter lack of diplomatic skills,\u201d Peskov told reporters.",
      "Commenting on the Ukrainian leader\u2019s refusal to recognize any loss of territory, Peskov said it reflected his reluctance to recognize the battlefield situation. \u201cYou have to be blind not to see it,\u201d he declared.",
      "Other Russian officials were even less diplomatic.",
      "Dmitry Medvedev, a deputy head of Russia\u2019s Security Council chaired by Putin, relished what he called a \u201cfierce scolding\u201d and a \u201cslap in the face\u201d for Zelenskyy and voiced hope for a quick end to U.S. military aid for Ukraine.",
      "Pro-Kremlin media and commentators derided Zelenskyy\u2019s attire and his negotiating style and described the meeting as a disaster for Ukraine.",
      "\u201cTrump wiped his feet on Zelenskyy and Ukraine like a doormat,\u201d commented hardline ideologue Alexander Dugin. \u201cZelenskyy was thrown out of the White House like a garbage alley cat,\u201d gloated pro-Kremlin military analyst Igor Korotchenko.",
      "Russia\u2019s flagship Sunday news show dedicated more than a third of its airtime \u2014 almost an hour \u2014 to the Trump-Zelenskyy clash, with anchor Dmitry Kiselyov mocking Zelenskyy for sporting his usual military-style garb at the White House and saying the Ukrainian leader \u201clooked like a loser\u201d and \u201cmade a scene\u201d in the Oval Office.",

      "\u201cRight now everything is being decided within a new big triangle -- Russia-China-the United States. It is in this triangle where a new world order will be developed,\u201d Kiselyov mused, dismissing Sunday\u2019s summit of European allies in London as \u201calmost clandestine\u201d and pointless.",
      "Commenting on the London summit, Peskov said it reflected the European reluctance to negotiate peace.",
      "\u201cThere is a group of countries that represent the party of war, which are declaring their readiness to continue to support Ukraine in a sense of supporting the war and ensuring the continuation of the hostilities,\u201d Peskov said. \u201cThere were statements made about the need to urgently provide an increased level of funding for Ukraine \u2013 clearly not for a peace plan but for the continuation of military operations.\u201d",

      "Federal employees face a midnight deadline to comply with Elon Musk\u2019s second demand for reports on their recent accomplishments",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal employees face a midnight deadline to comply with Elon Musk 's second demand for reports on their recent accomplishments, a request that has become a flashpoint within the government workforce.",
      "Musk and President Donald Trump have suggested that employees who don't comply could get fired. They've also described the requirement \u2014 a list of five things that each person did last week \u2014 as an unobjectionable way to increase accountability within a sprawling bureaucracy.",
      "But for many workers, the request has been a source of anxiety and confusion as the new administration tightens its grip on the federal government. Some agencies are still telling their workforces not to respond or to limit what they say in response, just as they did after Musk's first request last month.",
      "Judging by instructions that have circulated in recent days, the workforce will face a standing request for lists of accomplishments every Monday. There are roughly 2.4 million federal workers excluding active-duty military and postal workers, 80% of whom are based outside of the Washington, D.C. metro area.",
      "At the Food and Drug Administration, employees received three emails Monday on the topic \u2014 the first at about 6:45 a.m. Eastern letting them know about the request, the second before 8 a.m. telling them to await guidance, and the third after 11:30 a.m. explaining how they should respond.",
      "Employees were told to write back with \u201ca high level of generality\" and not include any sensitive data, discuss specific grants or identify colleagues that they're working with.",
      "There was similar guidance at the Department of Energy, which plays a key role in managing the country's nuclear arsenal.",
      "\u201cDo not include any sensitive or classified information, and do not send any links or attachments,\u201d wrote Energy Secretary Chris Wright. \u201cIf all your activities are sensitive, please reply \u2018All of my activities are sensitive.\u2019\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the State Department on Saturday told its workforce that department leadership would respond on their behalf. And the Federal Bureau of Prisons said employees could respond that \u201cdisclosure of my duties may compromise institution security or operations.\u201d",
      "The initial demand for lists of five accomplishments came last month. The Office of Personnel Management eventually told agencies that it was optional despite Musk\u2019s threat of layoffs for noncompliance.",
      "This time, some of the requests came from individual agencies, which have the power to hire, fire and discipline workers.",
      "Musk described the requirement as a \u201cpulse check\" during Trump's first Cabinet meeting of his second term.",
      "\u201cDo you have a pulse and two neurons?\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you have a pulse and two neurons, you can reply to an email.\u201d",

      "\u201cOn Friday night, in the Oval Office of the White House, a staggering scene unfurled before the lenses of the entire world, marked by brutality, a desire to humiliate, with the goal of making Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy fold through threats, so that he gives in to the demands of his aggressors,\u201d Bayrou said.",
      "\u201cAll this was summed up in one phrase before the planet\u2019s cameras: \u2018Either you find a deal with Putin or we will abandon you,\u2019\u201d Bayrou said, apparently referring to Trump's comments in the Oval Office. Trump's actual words to Zelenskyy were \u201cyou\u2019re either going to make a deal or we\u2019re out.\u201d",
      "Bayrou continued during the debate in France's parliament: \u201cFor the honor of democratic responsibility, for the honor of Ukraine and, I dare say, for the honor of Europe, President Zelenskyy did not fold and I think we can show him our appreciation,\u201d Bayrou continued.",
      "Lawmakers got to their feet in the National Assembly chamber to applaud.",
      "In opening the parliamentary debate, Bayrou said that Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and its diplomatic fallout have left Europe in grave peril. He spoke of \u201can historic situation that in our eyes is the most serious, the most destabilized, the most dangerous of all those that our country and our continent have experienced since the end of World War II.\u201d"

      "SCARBOROUGH, Maine -- SCARBOROUGH, Maine (AP) \u2014",
      "A group of lobster fishermen can sue one of the world\u2019s largest seafood watchdog groups for defamation, a federal court has ruled, over a report that described Maine lobster as an unwise choice for consumers.",
      "The threat to a rare whale species from getting tangled in fishing gear has prompted Monterey Bay Aquarium in California to caution against eating a variety of lobster that New England fishermen have harvested for centuries.",
      "Seafood Watch, a conservation program operated by the aquarium, placed lobster from the U.S. and Canada on its do-not-eat \u201cred list\u201d in 2022. Some retailers pulled lobster from stores after the recommendation.",
      "Judge John Woodcock ruled last month that the fishermen made a case that they suffered damage to their industry's reputation as a result of the red-listing, after the aquarium made a bid in U.S. District Court in Maine to have the 2023 lawsuit tossed. A spokesperson for the aquarium said Sunday it plans to appeal, but Woodcock's ruling means the lawsuit is moving forward.",
      "\u201cReputation and goodwill cannot be adequately replaced through awarding damages and this injury lingers as long as the \u2018red listing\u2019 does,\u201d Woodcock wrote.",
      "The lobster industry, based largely in Maine, is one of the most lucrative fisheries in the U.S., valued at more than half a billion dollars at the docks last year. Entanglement in lobster gear is also one of the most significant threats to the North Atlantic right whale, which numbers less than 400.",
      "The aquarium has a right to communicate its recommendations to the public, said Emerson Brown, the spokesperson for the aquarium, which plans to appeal the ruling \"to protect our ability to share critical information with the public.\u201d",

      "\u201cMaine lobstermen have been stewards of the ocean for generations, and we are committed to defending our livelihood against baseless claims,\" said Patrice McCarron, executive director of the association."

      "The state's homeland security commissioner, Jackie Bray, said terminations began Sunday and that on Monday the state would begin canceling health insurance for correctional officers who have remained on strike. Their dependents will also lose coverage.",
      "Fewer than 10 officers have been fired so far, Bray said, while thousands are in line to lose their health insurance benefits.",

      "Mid-State is located across the street from the Marcy Correctional Facility, where six guards have been charged with murder in the death of Robert Brooks, who was beaten by officers in December.",
      "\u201cNow that lawmakers feel an obligation to rein in these atrocities, guards are engaging in an illegal work stoppage as a distraction,\u201d Jose Saldana, the director of the Release Aging People in Prison Campaign, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cTo put it more bluntly, guards are holding hostage tens of thousands of incarcerated people, whose basic survival needs are often going unmet, in order to demand even more power to harm those in their custody,\u201d Saldana said.",
      "Corrections officers began walking out Feb. 17 to protest working conditions.",
      "Last Thursday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced a binding agreement between the state and officers' union to end the picketing. Officers were required to return to work by Saturday to avoid being disciplined for striking.",
      "The deal included ways to address staffing shortages and minimize mandatory 24-hour overtime shifts. It also offers a temporary bump in overtime pay, a potential change in pay scale and the suspension of a prison reform law that strikers blamed for making prisons less safe.",
      "The strike violated a state law barring walkouts by most public employees. Hochul deployed the National Guard to some prisons to take the place of striking workers.",
      "Corrections Commissioner Daniel Martuscello said Monday that the number of facilities with striking workers had dropped from 38 to 32.",
      "Visiting is still suspended at all state prisons, Martuscello said.",
      "The deal to end the strike included the 90-day suspension of a law limiting the use of solitary confinement. During the pause, the state was to evaluate if reinstating the law would \u201ccreate an unreasonable risk\u201d to staff and inmate safety.",
      "The state also agreed to pay overtime for the next month at a rate of 2\u00bd times regular pay instead of the usual 1\u00bd times and, within four months, to finish analyzing a union request to raise the salary grade for officers and sergeants.",
      "The state and union agreed to staffing and operational inefficiencies at each facility in an effort to relieve strain on existing staff.",
      "\"No matter when this ends or how this ends, our long term plan must be and is to recruit more corrections officers because our facilities run safer when we\u2019re fully staffed,\" Bray said, noting incentives that would include a $3,000 referral bonus for existing employees. \u201cThat work can\u2019t really begin in earnest until folks return to work and we end the strike.\u201d",

      "McMahon would face the competing tasks of winding down the Education Department while also escalating efforts to achieve Trump\u2019s agenda. Already the Republican president has signed sweeping orders to rid America\u2019s schools of diversity programs and accommodations for transgender students while also calling for expanded school choice programs.",
      "At the same time, Trump has promised to shut down the department and said he wants McMahon \u201cto put herself out of a job.\u201d",
      "A billionaire and former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, McMahon, 76, is an unconventional pick for the role. She spent a year on Connecticut\u2019s state board of education and is a longtime trustee at Sacred Heart University but otherwise has little traditional education leadership.",
      "McMahon's supporters see her as a skilled executive who will reform a department that Republicans say has failed to improve American education. Opponents say she\u2019s unqualified and fear her budget cuts will be felt by students nationwide.",
      "At her confirmation hearing, McMahon distanced herself from Trump\u2019s blistering rhetoric. She said the goal is to make the Education Department \u201coperate more efficiently,\u201d not to defund programs.",
      "She acknowledged that only Congress has the power to close the department, and she pledged to preserve Title I money for low-income schools, Pell grants for low-income college students, and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Yet she suggested some operations could move to other departments, saying Health and Human Services might be better suited to enforce disability rights laws.",
      "Weeks before McMahon's confirmation hearing, the White House was considering an executive order that would direct the education secretary to cut the agency as much as legally possible while asking Congress to shut it down completely. Some of McMahon\u2019s allies pressed the White House to hold the order until after her confirmation to avoid potential backlash.",
      "Created by Congress in 1979, the Education Department\u2019s primary role is to disburse money to the nation\u2019s schools and colleges. It sends billions of dollars a year to K-12 school and oversees a $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio.",
      "Trump argues the department has been overtaken by liberals who press their ideology on America\u2019s schools. During his campaign, he vowed to close it and grant its authority to states.",
      "Schools and states already wield significantly greater authority over education than the federal government, which is barred from influencing curriculum. Federal money makes up roughly 14% of public school budgets.",
      "Already, the Trump administration has started overhauling much of the department\u2019s work.",
      "Trump adviser Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency has cut dozens of contracts it dismissed as \u201cwoke\u201d and wasteful. It gutted the Institute of Education Sciences, which gathers data on the nation\u2019s academic progress, and the administration has fired or suspended scores of employees.",
      "Some of the cuts have halted work that\u2019s ordered under federal law. At her hearing, McMahon said the agency will spend money that\u2019s directed by Congress, and she played down DOGE\u2019s cuts as merely an audit.",
      "McMahon is a longtime Trump ally who left WWE in 2009 to launch a political career, running unsuccessfully twice for the U.S. Senate. She has given millions of dollars to Trump\u2019s campaigns and served as leader of the Small Business Administration during his first term.",

      "A look at the evolution of Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship over the years:",

      "During a 30-minute call, Trump dangled the possibility of a face-to-face meeting. But he also suggested that future U.S. military support for Ukraine might be contingent on its leader helping investigate business dealings there by Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son.",
      "The elder Biden was competing for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Trump seemed to want to weaken him 15 months out from Election Day.",
      "Trump denied wrongdoing and began referring to his exchange with Zelenskyy as a \u201cperfect\" phone call. Even Zelenskyy later insisted that he faced \u201cno blackmail.\u201d",
      "But Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House in December 2019 on abuse of power and obstruction of justice charges, only the third American commander in chief to be in that situation. He was acquitted by the Senate.",

      "Since then, the U.S. has provided more than $65 billion in military assistance to Ukraine. The Biden administration made steadfast military and political support for Zelenskyy's country a centerpiece of his foreign policy.",
      "As the war raged, the Biden White House staunchly defended continuing to provide support to Ukraine, even as some Republicans began grumbling about so much funding for a war that had no end in sight.",
      "In a speech to Congress in December 2022, Zelenskyy thanked \"every American\" for supporting his country.",
      "\u201cYour money is not charity,\u201d he said then. \"It\u2019s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.\u201d",
      "Trump, then campaigning for his second term, said repeatedly that Russia would never have invaded Ukraine if he'd been president and that he'd have no trouble solving the conflict.",
      "Upon taking office, he upended years of U.S. policy by dispatching negotiators to Saudi Arabia to meet with officials from Russian President Vladimir Putin's government, and also began hammering out the minerals deal that he and Zelenskyy had planned to sign Friday.",
      "Last September, Zelenskyy accompanied Biden to a Pennsylvania ammunition factory to thank the workers producing some of the most critically needed munitions for his country\u2019s fight with Russian ground forces.",
      "A few days later, he traveled to Trump Tower in Manhattan and discussed ending the war. In comments to Fox News Channel afterward, Trump said of the fighting, \u201cIt should stop and the president wants it to stop,\" meaning Zelenskyy.",
      "\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure President Putin wants it to stop and that\u2019s a good combination,\u201d Trump added. Zelenskyy invited Trump to visit Ukraine, to which Trump responded, \u201dI will.\"",
      "That trip came up again Friday, when Vance told Zelenskyy, \u201cYou went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition.\"",
      "Zelenskyy's September trip was not billed as political, though, and Trump's election opponent was Vice President Kamala Harris, not Biden. Still, Pennsylvania is a battleground state and some congressional Republicans at the time accused Democrats of using Zelenskyy's visit to bolster Harris politically.",
      "Last December, Trump met with Zelenskyy again during a visit to Paris to attend the reopening of the Notre Dame cathedral. It was a hastily arranged three-way meeting set up by French President Emmanuel Macron, who was trying to push the president-elect to maintain support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "As president, Trump has publicly prodded Zelenskyy that he had better move quickly to negotiate an end to Russia's war in Ukraine, or risk no longer having a country to lead.

      "WASHINGTON -- The head of a federal watchdog agency must remain in his job, a judge in Washington ruled on Saturday, saying President Donald Trump's bid to remove the special counsel was unlawful.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson sided with Hampton Dellinger, who leads the Office of Special Counsel, in a legal battle over the president's authority to oust the head of the independent agency that's likely headed back to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Dellinger sued Trump last month after he was fired, even though the law says special counsels can be removed by the president \u201conly for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d Jackson, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic president Barack Obama, quickly reinstated Dellinger in the job while he pursued his case.",
      "Jackson rejected the Trump administration's claims that the special counsel's removal protections are unconstitutional because they prevent the president from rightfully installing his preferred agency head.",
      "The judge said allowing the president to remove the special counsel at will would have a chilling effect on his crucial duties, which include guarding the federal workforce from illegal personnel actions, such as retaliation for whistleblowing.",
      "\u201cThe Special Counsel is supposed to withstand the winds of political change and help ensure that no government servant of either party becomes the subject of prohibited employment practices or faces reprisals for calling out wrongdoing \u2014 by holdovers from a previous administration or by officials of the new one,\u201d Jackson wrote in her decision.",
      "The Justice Department quickly filed court papers indicating it will challenge the ruling to Washington's federal appeals court. The case has already gone up once to the Supreme Court, which previously temporarily allowed Dellinger to remain in his job.",
      "The ruling comes as Dellinger is challenging the removal of probationary workers who were fired as part of the Trump administration\u2019s massive overhaul of the government. A federal board on Tuesday halted the terminations of several probationary workers after Dellinger said their firings may have been unlawful.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad and grateful to see the court confirm the importance and legality of the job protections Congress afforded my position,\" Dellinger said in a statement on Saturday. \"My efforts to protect federal employees generally, and whistleblowers in particular, from unlawful treatment will continue.\u201d",
      "The judge said the special counsel has a \u201cunique status and mission,\" which requires independence from the president to ensure he can carry out his responsibilities. The office investigates whistleblower claims of reprisal, can pursue disciplinary action against employees who punish whistleblowers and provides a channel for employees to disclose government wrongdoing.",
      "\u201cIf I don\u2019t have independence, if I can be removed for no good reason, federal employees are going to have no good reason to come to me,\u201d Dellinger told reporters outside Washington\u2019s federal courthouse after a recent hearing.",
      "The Office of Special Counsel is also responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, which restricts the partisan political activities of government workers. Dellinger\u2019s firing came as Trump administration employees have touted their support on social media for his policies even though the Hatch Act is meant to restrict political advocacy while on duty.",
      "The Justice Department employed sweeping language in urging the Supreme Court last month to allow the termination of the head of an obscure federal agency with limited power. Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in court papers that the lower court had crossed \u201ca constitutional red line\u201d by blocking Dellinger\u2019s firing and stopping Trump \u201cfrom shaping the agenda of an executive-branch agency in the new administration\u2019s critical first days.\u201d",
      "Dellinger was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term in 2024."

      "Stock markets around the world fell following the introduction of tariffs by President Donald Trump on goods entering the US from China, Canada and Mexico.",
      "Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, and 20% tariffs against China.",
      "Canada and China announced their own import taxes on US goods, while Mexico said it had \"contingency plans\", sparking fears of full-blown trade war.",
      "The three major stock market indexes in the US sank following the news, while the FTSE\u00a0100\u00a0index of the UK's biggest publicly-listed companies opened sharply lower on\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0and stock markets in Asia were also down.",
      "Analysts have warned tariffs could push up prices for US households and could also have a knock on effect on consumers across the world, including the UK.",
      "'We'll fight to the bitter end': China hits back at Trump tariffs",
      "Trump threatened to impose the tariffs, which are a tax added to a product when it enters a country - on Canada, Mexico and China in response to what claims is the unacceptable flow of illegal drugs and illegal immigrants into the US.",
      "But Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country was responsible for less than 1% of fentanyl entering the US and would retaliate with 25% tariffs on $150bn worth of US goods.",
      "\"There is no justification for [the US's] actions...Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,\" Trudeau said in a statement on Monday.",
      "He said Canada would first target $30bn worth of products, and target the remaining $125bn over 21 days.",
      "Any fresh duties Canada imposes will be in place \"until the US trade action is withdrawn\", he said, adding that his country would pursue \"non-tariff measures\" should US tariffs not cease - without specifying what those measures were.",
      "'Trade war'",
      "China swiftly announced its own counter measures, which include 10-15% tariffs on some US agricultural goods, including wheat, corn, beef and soybeans. China is the US's biggest buyer of these goods.",
      "\"If the United States... persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end,\" foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.",
      "Before the US tariffs on Mexican imports came into force, President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country had contingency plans.",
      "\"In this situation, we need composure, serenity, and patience. We have Plan A, Plan B, Plan C, and even Plan D,\" she said.",
      "Sheinbaum said she would speak more about Mexico's response on Tuesday.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Six things that could get more expensive for Americans under Trump tariffs",
      "In the US, the Dow Jones closed 1.5% lower and the S&P 500 ended the day down 1.8% on Monday, while in Asia on Tuesday, the Nikkei 225 dropped 1.2% and China's Hang Seng Index was down 0.3%.",
      "London's FTSE 100 was lower in early trading while the main stock exchanges in Germany and France also dipped.",
      "Trump has argued tariffs will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs, as well as raising tax revenues and grow the economy.",
      "However, such measures can have detrimental effects on both consumers and businesses - including the ones they set out to protect.",
      "Shoppers can be the ones who bear the bulk of tariffs in the form of higher prices, if they're passed on, as well as less choice.",
      "Meanwhile, tariffs tend to trigger retaliation from targeted countries, disadvantaging domestic businesses looking to export goods, meaning the measures can ultimately hold back trade, jobs being created and economic growth.",
      "'Global economic risks'",
      "Goods worth some $2bn cross the borders of the US, Canada and Mexico each day and their economies are deeply integrated.",
      "With the introduction of tariffs on that cross-border trade, companies importing goods might decide to pass on some or all of the extra costs onto consumers by putting prices up.",
      "They could also reduce imports, which would mean fewer products and therefore higher demand, which could also push up prices.",
      "Andrew Wilson, from the International Chamber of Commerce, said: \"What we're seeing is the biggest effective increase in US tariffs since the 1940s - with severe economic risks attached to that.\"",
      "\"The initial market moves are entirely reflective that we're now entering into a very risky scenario for global trade and for the global economy,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme",
      "He said Yale University had predicted these measures could cost US households in the region of $2,000 in this year alone.",
      "Price rises",
      "Analysis from TD Economics has suggested cars could go up in price by about $3,000.",
      "That is because parts cross the US, Canadian and Mexican borders multiple times before a vehicle is assembled.",
      "American consumers could also see the price of avocados go up as Mexican avocados make up nearly 90% of the US avocado market each year.",
      "Canada's billion-dollar maple syrup industry accounts for 75% of the world's entire maple syrup production so US households could see prices for the sweet treat rise too.",
      "Ella Hoxha, head of fixed income at Newton Investment Management, told the BBC: \"In terms of consumers, you're more likely looking at, certainly over the short term, increases in prices as companies pass some of those prices onto the consumer.\"",
      "Chris Torrens, vice president of the British Chamber of Commerce in China, added: \"It's a huge challenge for British business because of the historical links that the UK and the US have. [We are] Seeing what looks like the dismantling of a transatlantic alliance between the US and Europe.",
      "\"But, there is a real sense of hope for a stronger UK-China relationship.\""

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2w51kg8ldo",
    "published": "Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:01:51 GMT",
    "summary": "From handheld to space-based, new methane detectors are making it easier to track the greenhouse gas.",
    "story": [
      "In and around Washington DC, volunteers and activists have been walking through streets and homes to see how healthy the air is.",
      "They're armed with industry-grade monitors that detect the presence of several gases. The devices look a bit like walkie-talkies.",
      "But they are equipped with sensors that reveal the extent of methane, turning this invisible gas into concrete numbers on a screen.",
      "Those numbers can be worrying. In a 25-hour period, neighbourhood researchers found 13 outdoor methane leaks at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit. They have also found methane leaks within homes.",
      "A key concern has been health. Methane and other gases, notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves, are linked to higher risks of asthma.",
      "Djamila Bah, a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organisation Action in Montgomery, reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organisation.",
      "\"It's very heartbreaking and alarming when you're doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they can't change for now,\" Ms Bah says.",
      "Methane might be a hazard to human health, but it is also powerful greenhouse gas.",
      "While it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one-quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialisation.",
      "Methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors. Chief among these are fossil fuels, waste and agriculture.",
      "But methane is not always easy to notice.",
      "It can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers. It can also be visualised using infrared cameras, as methane absorbs infrared light.",
      "Monitoring can be ground-based, including vehicle-mounted devices, or aerial, including drone-based measurement. Combining technologies is especially helpful.",
      "\"There is no perfect solution,\" says Andreea Calcan, a programme management officer at the International Methane Emissions Observatory, a UN initiative.",
      "There are trade-offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis, which could extend to thousands of facilities.",
      "Thankfully, she has seen an expansion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade. So there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane, at any scale. And the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high-emitting events, she says.",
      "At a larger scale, satellites are often good at pinpointing super-emitters: less frequent but massively emitting events, such as huge oil and gas leaks. Or they can detect the smaller and more spread-out emitters that are much more common, such as cattle farms.",
      "Current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter, says Riley Duren, the CEO of the Carbon Mapper, a not-for-profit organisation that tracks emissions.",
      "He likens this to film cameras. A telephoto lens offers higher resolution, while a wide-angle lens allows a larger field of view.",
      "With a new satellite, Carbon Mapper is focusing on high resolution, high sensitivity and rapid detection, to more precisely detect emissions from super-emitters. In August 2024 Carbon Mapper launched the Tanager-1 satellite, together with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Earth imaging company Planet Labs.",
      "Satellites have struggled to spot methane emissions in certain environments, such as poorly maintained oil wells in snowy areas with lots of vegetation. Low light, high latitudes, mountains and offshore areas also present challenges.",
      "Mr Duren says that the high-resolution Tanager-1 can respond to some of these challenges, for instance by essentially sneaking peeks through gaps in cloud cover or forest cover.",
      "\"In an oil and gas field, high resolution could be the difference between isolating the methane emissions from an oil well head from an adjacent pipeline,\" he says. This could help determine exactly who is responsible.",
      "Carbon Mapper began releasing emissions data, drawing on Tanager-1 observations, in November.",
      "It will take several years to build out the full constellation of satellites, which will depend on funding.",
      "Tanager-1 isn't the only new satellite with a focus on delivering methane data. MethaneSAT, a project of the Environmental Defense Fund and private and public partners, also launched in 2024.",
      "With the increasing sophistication of all these satellite technologies, \"What was previously unseeable is now visible,\" Mr Duren says. \"As a society we're still learning about our true methane footprint.\"",
      "It's clear that better information is needed about methane emissions. Some energy companies have sought to evade methane detection by using \"enclosed combustors\" to obscure gas flaring.",
      "Translating knowledge into action isn't always straightforward. Methane levels continue to rise, even as the information available does as well.",
      "For instance, the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) uses satellite data to detect methane emissions notify companies and governments. The MARS team gathered a large quantity of methane plume images, verified by humans, to train a machine learning model to recognise such plumes.",
      "In all the locations that MARS constantly monitors, based on their history of emissions, the model checks for a methane plume every day. Analysts then scrutinise any alerts.",
      "Because there are so many locations to be monitored, \"this saves us a lot of time,\" says Itziar Irakulis Loitxate, the remote sensing lead for the International Methane Emissions Observatory, which is responsible for MARS.",
      "In the two years since its launch, MARS has sent out over 1,200 alerts for major methane leaks. Only 1% of those have led to responses.",

    "story": [
      "The business of the North American Toy Fair, an annual showcase of the latest in silly putty, monster trucks and board games, is fun. But this year at the convention center in New York City, tariffs were killing the vibe.",
      "In February, US President Donald Trump raised tariffs on products made in China by 10%. Then last week, with little warning, he announced an additional 10% border tax, which has now come into force on Tuesday, along with tariffs on Mexico and Canada.",
      "In the toy industry, which estimates that about 80% of toys sold in the US are made in China, the rapid-fire announcements have stunned businesses, leaving them scrambling to figure out how to swallow a sudden 20% rise in cost.",
      "The moves are the first of what Trump has threatened will be far wider action, making it a preview of the upheaval that could be coming for companies around the world.",
      "\"It's the first thing we talk about and the last thing we talk about,\" toymaker Jay Foreman said this weekend from his booth at the trade show, where classic hits such as Lincoln Logs, Tonka Trucks and K'Nex were on display.",
      "His business, Basic Fun!, makes 90% of its products in China and had been planning to counter the cost of the initial 10% tariff with a mix of higher prices for customers and lower profits, both for his firm and for his manufacturing partners.",
      "He presented the strategy to his board on Wednesday, ahead of the toy show, only to have to rip it up the next day, after Trump's later announcement.",
      "He will have to shoulder the tariff costs for products headed to stores this spring, he said, but is now expecting to raise prices for many items by at least 10% later in the year.",
      "\"The reality is that tariffs will raise the cost of toys for consumers,\" he said. \"If a customer says, 'Then I can't buy it', then I can't sell it, because I can't produce to lose money.\"",
      "LIVE: China and Canada retaliate as Trump tariffs take effect",
      "Markets sink as Trump confirms tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China",
      "Trump says US will impose additional 10% tariff on China",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Tariffs are a tax on imports collected by the government at the border and paid for by the companies bringing in the goods.",
      "During Trump's first term, China was the main target of the measures, with more than $360bn worth of products sent to the US getting hit by the measures.",
      "At the time, toys and many other consumer products were spared.",
      "But Trump has now applied the duties across the board, hitting almost 15% of the imports into the US each year.",
      "His actions have been overshadowed by tariffs on products made in Mexico and Canada - America's top two trade partners, which have long operated under a free trade agreement with the US.",
      "And they fall short of the \"up to 60%\" tariff that Trump called for on the campaign trail last year.",
      "But with the latest move, businesses say the costs are getting too big to ignore.",
      "The average effective tariff rate on imports from China now stands at roughly 34%, with recent actions amounting to a rise roughly twice as large as the increase during Trump's first four-year term as president, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs.",
      "\"10% - it's something we can somehow live with. 20% is a different ball game,\" said Yaron Barlev, chief operating officer of Clixo, a Brooklyn-based maker of magnetic building toys which started about five years ago and signed a deal last year to start selling its toys at Target later in 2025.",
      "With manufacturing in China now under way to satisfy that order, his firm, which employs 18 people in the US, is expecting to have to shoulder the costs of the border duties, scrambling its plans for profits.",
      "He said he hoped Trump would offer some kind of reprieve for toys but was not feeling especially optimistic.",
      "\"It's much less predictable now than he used to be so I really don't know.\"",
      "Trump has said his actions will help boost manufacturing in the US, by making it less cost-effective to make products overseas.",
      "But toymakers like Clixo, which had hoped to do its manufacturing in the US, say high costs and limited manufacturing capacity in the US make that idea unrealistic.",
      "Meanwhile, a string of weaker economic data has raised concerns that the uncertainty due to the tariff talk is starting to cause wider economic paralysis.",
      "Basic Fun!, which employs about 165 people and does roughly $200m in sales each year, had been looking to grow. But with the threat of tariffs bearing down, Mr Foreman recently put plans for acquisitions on hold, unsure how to calculate what a business would be worth in such a changeable environment.",
      "\"[A tariff] sounds good - 'Let's stick it to them!' But the ripple effect is unbelievable,\" Mr Forman said.",
      "The Toy Association, a business lobby group, says it is trying to make the case to the White House and Congress that toys should be exempt from tariffs, as they were before, warning that higher prices won't go unnoticed by a public already upset by the jump in prices in recent years.",
      "President Greg Ahearn said his members are largely small businesses with profit margins barely as large as the tariffs that are getting under way.",
      "\"We think we have a very strong point to make and we're hoping they're going to be open to listening,\" he said.",
      "The Toy Fair is his organisation's marquee event, drawing businesses from around the world who line New York's convention center with cheerful displays of blocks, high-contrast baby books and spiky coloured balls. But worry about tariffs pulsed through the gathering this year.",
      "\"It's killing our mojo,\" said Mr Ahearn, noting that it was his members' top concern.",
      "From their booths, toymakers greeted questions about Trump's moves with head shakes, grimaces and disbelief.",
      "\"20% is a lot,\" said Ada Luo, sales director for Wonderful Party, a manufacturer in Shenzhen, China, which makes Christmas light necklaces, leis and New Year's hats. \"10% maybe... between the supplier and the buyer we can share, but 20%? We don't have a clue.\""

      "Concerns over a rush of last-minute enquiries mean anyone who requests a call back from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) on the issue will not be regarded as having missed the 5 April deadline.",
      "People can currently make voluntary extra contributions to plug National Insurance gaps back to 2006.",
      "But, after April's deadline, this will be limited to the previous six years only.",
      "Some people may have spaces in their National Insurance record if, for example, they have lived abroad or taken time off for caring responsibilities.",
      "In general, people need 35 years of qualifying contributions to get the full state pension.",
      "Top-ups have been permitted, as part of the transition to the flat-rate state pension, which was introduced in 2016.",
      "Currently, these can go back for nearly 20 years, but are due to return to the normal six years after April.",
      "Complications",
      "Pensions experts say that extra contributions may not suit every individual in these circumstances, so it is important to check whether it is worthwhile for their finances.",
      "There is complexity about when and whether to top-up, which has meant many people have called the DWP's Future Pension Centre or Pension Service to discuss their options.",
      "Worries about the clogged phonelines mean two earlier deadlines were extended.",
      "Although this April's deadline still stands, there will now be some leeway for anyone who struggles to get through on the phone.",
      "Anyone who is unable to make contact with the DWP ahead of the deadline can use an online call-back request form.",
      "People who submit a call-back request by the 5 April deadline will still be able to pay voluntary National Insurance Contributions back to April 2006, after the deadline has passed.",
      "Anyone in this position should save a screenshot of their call-back confirmation message. A return call should come within eight weeks.",
      "Checking service",
      "A spokesman for the DWP said an online tool would mean that people would be able to make top-up payments after the 5 April deadline, provided they complete the call-back request form ahead of that date.",
      "\"This will enable us to ensure no one misses out, and to suitably manage demand as the deadline approaches,\" he said.",
      "Steve Webb, partner at consultants LCP and a former pensions minister, said: \"After the chaos in the run-up to previous deadlines, it is good that the government has planned ahead to make sure that people do not miss out simply because they cannot get through on official phonelines to discuss state pension top-ups.\"",
      "Anyone can look at their National Insurance record and obtain a state pension forecast without charge to decide if making a voluntary contribution is a good decision for them.",
      "People should also be alert to scams, from unsolicited messages relating to the issue, in the run-up to the deadline.",

      "In January 2025, Business and Trade Committee had argued the Post Office should not decide on what was owed to victims of its own scandal.",
      "It is another step in the long-running Post Office scandal. Under the previous Conservative government, a new law was passed to overturn the convictions of more than 900 people.",
      "More than 4,000 people in total have been told they are eligible for compensation. But the schemes they need to access in order to receive remuneration for their suffering can be long-winded and complicated.",

      "The four main schemes are aimed at groups of victims who had different experiences of the scandal. They are explained in more detail in the following sections.",
      "Which scheme is available to Alan Bates and others depicted in the ITV drama?",
      "Alan Bates led a group of 555 sub-postmasters in a landmark court case against the Post Office, which came to wider public attention after it was depicted in an ITV drama.",
      "While the cohort secured a \u00a342.5m settlement in 2019, the huge costs of going to the High Court meant each claimant received a relatively low compensation pay-out at the end of it.",
      "The Group Litigation Order (GLO) scheme was set up to ensure they received extra money to reflect the gravity of their situations. The scheme is funded and managed by the government.",
      "As of January 2024, people eligible for this scheme \"will receive at least \u00a375,000 in compensation upfront\".",
      "The government estimates around two thirds will turn that offer down and push for more. In those cases, the government will award postmasters 80% of the initial offer made to them.",
      "On 9 September, Labour said it will set a target of making an offer to 90% of sub-postmasters who have submitted a full claim within 40 days.",
      "As of 31 January, \u00a3128m has been paid under the scheme, including interim payments.",
      "Of the 555 members of the GLO group, 63 had criminal convictions and therefore are not eligible for this scheme but they are eligible for other compensation - depending on how their convictions are overturned.",
      "If they are quashed by the court, they can apply to the Overturned Convictions Scheme. If they are overturned under legislation - the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 which became law in May - they can go to the newer Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme.",
      "ITV's drama Alan Bates vs The Post Office has introduced millions to the long-running scandal",
      "What compensation is there for people with overturned convictions?",
      "There have been 983 convictions - 700 of which were privately initiated by the Post Office - linked to the faulty Horizon IT programme.",
      "People whose convictions are quashed can apply to the Overturned Convictions Scheme, whether or not they are in the GLO group. It is this scheme that the government has taken over responsibility for from the Post Office.",
      "A total of 111 people have had their convictions overturned as of 31 January. But when the government's promised law to overturn all convictions linked to the scandal becomes a reality, hundreds more people will be eligible.",
      "Those whose convictions are overturned can choose to take a fast-tracked \u00a3600,000 settlement. Or they can enter into negotiations if they feel they are entitled to more.",
      "All eligible people are entitled to an \"interim\" payment while their final settlements are processed. The government has provided funding to the Post Office for these payments.",
      "For those people whose conviction is overturned through the new law, they can register for the Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme.",
      "This will entitle them to an initial \u00a3200,000 interim payment. They can then decide to accept \u00a3600,000 or have their case fully reviewed.",
      "As of 31 January, external, \u00a365m has been paid out under this scheme including further interim payments.",

      "It is administered by the Post Office but the independent appeals process will be overseen by the Department for Business. Post Office Minister Gareth Thomas said he was still considering whether to transfer this scheme to the government as well.",

      "The market prices of the five coins he named - Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano - all swiftly jumped after the announcement.",

      "Kasia said she would like more control over her service charges but the government's commonhold proposals were for new builds, so would not help her in her current situation.",
      "Jean Hopkin, another leaseholder who got in touch with the BBC, said the service charge for her three-bedroom flat in Sheffield had increased 356% - from \u00a3106 a month to \u00a3483 in four years - and was unsellable because of the high charges.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly44dknrj8o",
    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 22:25:43 GMT",
    "summary": "Protests, politicking and planning could stall the runway, despite the government being 'minded to approve' it",
    "story": [
      "Expansion at Gatwick Airport has moved a step closer after the government gave the plan its tentative backing.",
      "On the surface Gatwick's plans look relatively straightforward.",
      "In contrast to Heathrow, which wants to bulldoze houses and reroute the M25, Gatwick is proposing to shift an already existing runway just 12 metres north, and bring it into regular use.",
      "Yet it still may not happen for years, or may not happen at all.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "Gatwick officially opened as an airport in 1958. It had one runway and an additional taxi-way, that was expanded so it could be used as a back-up in case the main runway was out of action.",
      "It was never supposed to be for daily use.",
      "In fact, in 1979 Gatwick's owners signed a legally binding agreement with the local council not to build another operational runway for at least 40 years.",
      "Now, though, Gatwick is keen to increase flights in and out, especially for short-haul destinations, by putting the back-up runway into regular use.",
      "In the summer of 2023, it put in a planning application, including for additional buildings, flyovers to local roads and expanding rail links.",
      "However, the centre line of a runway that's in full operation, must be at least 210 metres from the centre line of any other runway.",
      "The back-up runway needs to shift 12 metres northwards to meet that safety rule.",
      "How long would expansion take?",
      "Just because the government has given backing in principle for the privately-funded \u00a32.2bn scheme, doesn't mean it is ready for take-off.",
      "There is strong opposition to the expansion of Gatwick among some local residents objecting to increases in traffic, noise and pollution.",
      "Climate campaigners oppose any airport expansion, pointing out that the extra flights will make it harder for the UK to meet its obligations to reduce emissions that are altering the climate.",
      "And in January MPs called on the government to delay the decision on expanding Gatwick until current noise levels were monitored adequately at the site.",
      "Gatwick has until 24 April to submit more information to support its planning application, and respond with measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport.",
      "Then there will be a fresh consultation on the plans, before the government makes a final decision on 27 October.",
      "Even if Gatwick is given the go-ahead then, it could still face further hurdles.",
      "\"There remains the possibility that the final decision could be subject to legal challenge which would lead to further delay,\" Paul Maile, head of planning and infrastructure consenting at Eversheds Sutherland, told the BBC.",
      "\"It is probable that it will still be several years before work is likely to start, at the earliest,\" he said.",
      "Will it actually happen?",
      "Gatwick has previously said it believed the new runway could be ready by the end of the decade.",
      "But there is still a reasonable chance it might not happen at all.",
      "By 2030 there will have been another general election, and a different government could overturn any previous decisions. Planning permissions and regulations may change, and climate targets could be ramped up - all of which would put the project at risk.",
      "It will also depend on what the public want, says Prof Tony Travers of the London School of Economics.",
      "Politicians are \"susceptible to public pressure\" so sometimes choose to slow or cancel infrastructure projects like this.",
      "While there are wider benefits of airport expansion, to the regional and national economy as well as the travelling public, those advantages don't usually prompt people to make placards and write to their MPs. Living under a flight path, on the other hand, does.",
      "Richard Threlfall, global head of infrastructure, government and healthcare at KPMG International, says other countries, which don't have such strong democracies as the UK, can \"just get on and do it\", when they want infrastructure built.",
      "In the UK road bypasses, rail infrastructure, housing and other projects can be slowed or completely blocked, if enough people oppose them.",
      "But this government has staked its reputation on overcoming opposition to projects that it believes will boost growth, indicating it wants to see airport expansion despite the objections.",

      "\"I had to take a month off work with stress. There's not been a day when I've not thought about cladding,\" he told the BBC.",
      "It is estimated there are 1.3 million leasehold flats in low-rise blocks, under 11m high in England, according to the End Our Cladding Scandal campaign.",
      "Tom bought his flat in Luton in 2018 with money he had saved from serving in the army. He said when he came home to a bill for \u00a365,000 he was \"absolutely shocked\".",
      "The invoice from his landlord was his legal share of the costs to make the building fireproof. \"I thought it was a typo to be honest,\" said Tom.",

      "\"The government says for buildings under 11m, the risk can be mitigated by other means, like using fire alarms and sprinkler systems but in my case, that's not true,\" explained Tom.",
      "\"I've had two fire assessments both saying the cladding is dangerous and needs to be removed, and the price, which they also said would be lower for smaller buildings, is extortionate. I can't pay,\" he added.",
      "After complaining to the building's owners, Tom expects the bill to be reduced but is yet to find out by how much.",
      "Tom had planned to sell the flat to buy a family home but can't. \"It's ruining my life and I'm facing bankruptcy,\" he said.",
      "The Department for Housing told the BBC that owners of buildings under 11m should not pass on the costs of fixing historical safety defects to leaseholders.",
      "But the law does not prevent people like Tom being billed for unlimited amounts of money when the developers are no longer around or landlords cannot afford the remediation costs.",
      "'Falling through the gaps'",
      "Liz Ramsden is an expert in leasehold property at Knights and told the BBC she believes the Building Safety Act was drafted too quickly.",
      "\"The intention was that no leaseholder would have to pay but in reality we are finding a lot of leaseholders are having to pay huge sums of money.",
      "\"There was very little consultation and because of that we have these gaps in the legislation and people are falling through,\" she said.",
      "Even in buildings above 11m the rules fail to protect many leaseholders.",
      "Homeowners with Islamic mortgages or three or more properties also do not benefit  from the full protections.",
      "This is something Martin Batty, who has an Islamic mortgage, only discovered when he put his one-bedroom flat up for sale.",
      "He said his lawyer explained the way Islamic home purchase plans are structured - to comply with Sharia law which does not allow paying interest - means he falls outside the scope of the act.",
      "\"It feels really unfair. I feel like I'm being discriminated against,\" he said.",
      "\"To find out that I'm a non-qualifying leaseholder just because I've got an Islamic home purchase plan is a huge kick in the teeth. It's really upsetting and is a huge let down.\"",
      "The government told the BBC Islamic interest free loans secured against properties were very rare.",
      "But Martin said he can't sell his flat because mortgage providers will not lend against it and solicitors won't advise on non-qualifying leases.",

      "These two flats are in a building where lots of the cladding has been found to be unsafe.",

    "summary": "A deal to avoid further trade barriers appears very much on the cards, but challenges remain.",
    "story": [
      "The US-UK trade deal warmly suggested by President Donald Trump should help insulate the UK from the direct impact of global trade tensions.",
      "It signals that the White House has accepted the statistical logic that the US and UK have a balanced trade position.",
      "Essentially each country roughly exports the same amount of goods to one another. Indeed, rather helpfully, according to the US numbers it exports more.",
      "There is no general case that the UK is, in the words and logic of the president,  \"ripping off\" or \"screwing\" the US, as he has suggested of many other countries and the EU.",
      "So a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards.",
      "But this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era.",
      "It is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trump's own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU.",
      "It is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table.",
      "In addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its \"Brexit reset\" - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.",
      "UK-US trade deal could mean tariffs 'not necessary', says Trump",
      "Key takeaways from Starmer's talks with Trump",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "The narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\".",
      "Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here.",
      "This strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes.",
      "The UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces.",
      "While the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit.",
      "The White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago.",
      "Likewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues.",
      "This appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here.",
      "The prize will be integration into the massive investments from the best capitalised tech companies in the world.",
      "Could the UK start to attract back some of the investments lost to Dublin, for example? Would the EU stand back and allow the UK to develop as an offshore hub for US tech companies to service the whole of Europe?",
      "There are two other significant issues. It is not unknown for warm words in the Oval Office to be somewhat contradicted by actions soon after. While sat next to the PM, President Trump described the EU's levying of VAT as a trade restriction, seemingly unaware that the UK does exactly the same thing.",
      "And even if it avoids direct new tariffs from President Trump, the open UK economy would be affected by any wide-ranging trade war involving most of the G7 and other countries.",
      "That is still on the cards. Not only would that collapse world growth and potentially spike up inflation again, but could upend entirely the workings of the World Trade Organization.",
      "The PM says the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and other allies, but it may appear like that to them.",
      "The strategy appears to be to become the Switzerland of global economics. Neutrality in a world of trade turmoil, not so much sat on a fence, but tiptoeing along a rather wobbly one."

      "At the time, Rachel Kaser, a reporter at The Next Web, said: \"People are annoyed by this update to the Skype app because it's fixing something that was never broken to begin with.\"",
      "In June 2021, speculation persisted that it was the beginning of the end for Skype.",
      "When Microsoft announced Windows 11, its new operating system, it stated that Microsoft Teams would be integrated by default, while Skype, for the first time in years, was not.",
      "Teams had seen a boost in popularity during the Covid pandemic as people moved their work and personal meetings online.",

      "Referring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US  would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence.",

      "\"Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,\" he said.",
      "Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union.",
      "He also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK.",
      "Asked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: \"He tried.\"",
      "\"He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" he said.",
      "\"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\"",
      "In a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \"fair, balanced and reciprocal\".",
      "Since leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US.",

      "The head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce - a former Labour MP and minister - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday that businesses will be encouraged by what he called an \"important first step\".",
      "\"In trade negotiations, relationships matter,\" says William Bain, adding that seeing the two leaders find common ground on their respective economies and trade is \"helpful\".",
      "He added that a deal to keep tariffs low would most benefit automotive and pharmaceutical industries in the UK."

      "The airport wants to move its northern runway, which is currently only used for taxiing or as a back up, and make it operational by the end of the decade.",
      "The transport secretary's support does not guarantee the expansion will go ahead as it would still need planning permission.",

      "The Transport Secretary's support for expansion comes as the government is looking at ways to boost economic growth in a bid to boost living standards, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves backing a third runway at Heathrow last month.",

      "On Tuesday, Alexander told industry leaders aviation was good for economic growth and said she was \"not some sort of flight-shaming eco warrior\".",
      "The growth arguments for expanding Heathrow and Gatwick, the UK's two largest airports, differ with the former catering for more freight traffic relating to international goods trade.",
      "An extra runway at Gatwick would see capacity increased for holidaymakers and business travellers, particularly for short-haul destinations, as opposed to Heathrow's longer-haul flights.",
      "Gatwick managers have said that with 55 take-offs and landings in a busy hour, the airport is \"full\".",

      "Donald Trump said he planned to hit goods from China with a new 10% tariff, the latest salvo in the US president's steadily escalating trade fights.",
      "Imports from China already face taxes at the border of at least 10%, after a Trump tariff order that went into effect earlier this month.",
      "China's ministry of foreign affairs said it \"strongly\" expressed its \"dissatisfaction and resolute opposition\" to the plans.",
      "Trump also said on Thursday he intended to move forward with threatened 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, which are set to come into effect on 4 March.",
      "Trump's comments came as officials from Mexico and Canada were in Washington for discussions aimed at heading off that plan.",
      "Trump had announced the plans for 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada for 4 February unless the two nations increased border security.",
      "He paused the measures for a month at the last minute after the two countries agreed to increase border funding and talk more about how to combat drug trafficking.",
      "On social media on Thursday, Trump wrote that he did not think enough action had been taken to address the flow of fentanyl to the US.",
      "\"Drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels,\" he wrote, adding that \"a large percentage\" of the drugs were made in China.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, at a press conference from the country's National Palace, said in response: \"As we know, [Trump] has his way of communicating.\"",
      "She added: \"I hope we can reach an agreement and on 4 March we can announce something else.\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also said his country was working hard to reach a deal, warning tariffs from the US would prompt an \"immediate and extremely strong response\".",
      "Trump's threats against Mexico and Canada have raised widespread alarm, as the North American economy is closely connected after decades of operating under a free trade agreement.",
      "Leaders of the two countries have previously said they would impose retaliatory tariffs on the United States if the White House went ahead with its plans.",
      "Tariffs are a tax collected by the government and paid for by the business bringing the goods into the country.",
      "China, Mexico and Canada are America's top three trade partners, together accounting for more than 40% of imports into the US last year.",
      "Economists have warned tariffs on goods from the three countries could lead to higher prices in the US on everything from iPhones to avocados.",
      "Trump's call for an additional 10% levy on goods from China - which he said would also go into effect on Tuesday - had not been previously announced, though during his presidential campaign he backed border taxes on Chinese products of as much as 60%.",
      "A spokesperson for China's ministry of foreign affairs, Lin Jian, said that Trump was using the issue of the drug fentanyl entering the US from China as an \"excuse\" to threaten tariffs, adding it had one of the \"strictest\" drug control policies in the world.",
      "\"Pressure, coercion, and threats are not the correct way to deal with China,\" he said.",
      "Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy, had earlier said that his country was already working with the US to address the concerns about fentanyl, and had made \"visual progress\" in areas such as information exchange, case cooperation and online advertisement cleanup.",
      "\"Reducing domestic drug demand and strengthening law enforcement cooperation are the fundamental solutions,\" he said in a statement, which warned that Trump's tariff moves were \"bound to affect and undermine future counternarcotics cooperation between the two sides\".",
      "\"The unilateral tariffs imposed by the US will not solve its own problems, nor will it benefit the two sides or the world.\"",
      "Trump's comments, which called for drug flow to stop or be \"severely limited\", seemed to set the stage for Mexico and Canada to negotiate, said trade expert Christine McDaniel, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.",
      "On Thursday, as tariff talks intensified, two imprisoned alleged leaders of the violent Zetas cartel long sought by the US - Miguel Angel Trevino Morales and his brother Oscar - were extradited.",
      "Mexican media said they were part of a larger group of drug lords sent from Mexico to the US - a major step in terms of US-Mexico security relations.",
      "Ms McDaniel said Trump's demands of China were less clear, raising the likelihood that those measures will come into effect.",
      "Trump's initial round of tariffs on China was eclipsed by his threats against Canada and Mexico. But the potential for further duties raises questions about how businesses will respond.",
      "Ms McDaniel said she expected the hit to be felt more in China.",
      "\"It's not costless for the US, but so far it seems more costly for China,\" she said.",
      "The impact of tariffs, if they go into effect, is expected to be felt more in the Canadian and Mexican economies, which count on the US as a key export market.",
      "But analysts have warned that the threat of the levies, even if they are never imposed, is still likely to have a chilling effect on investment, including in the US.",
      "China has already responded to the first round of tariffs from the US with its own tariffs on US products, including coal and agricultural machinery.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 00:03:49 GMT",
    "summary": "Switzerland's already upmarket tourism sector is trying to attract more high rollers.",
    "story": [
      "The world is a very insecure place right now - conflict, climate change, and fears of recession dominate the headlines. But for some people, things are going rather well - the wealthy.",
      "Despite the global turmoil, the number of billionaires in the world is growing and the personal wealth of each of them is increasing too.",
      "So what to do with all that money? The growing trend for the ultimate luxury experience is a clue as to what the very rich are doing with their cash. For the tourist industry in particular, it's an opportunity.",
      "In Switzerland, which has long cultivated a reputation for understated luxury, the number of five-star hotels is increasing faster than any other category. Many of them were built in the early 20th century - grand belle epoque palaces serving a then emerging class of privileged, primarily English tourists.",
      "Today, renovated to the highest standards, those hotels leave no guest's wish unmet. There are luxury spas, gourmet restaurants, and designer suites with panoramic views of the alps. Some offer \"ski butlers\" to ferry guests to and from the slopes, carry the skis, and even help put on their boots.",
      "Key markets are the US, the Gulf states, China and South East Asia. American guests in particular, Swiss hoteliers say, expect the full five-star treatment, including 24-hour room service, so that they can order food in the middle of the night.",
      "Meanwhile, China and India are emerging markets, where the first groups to travel from those two countries are among the wealthiest. Switzerland is very keen to get in at the start of that trend.",
      "But the five-star offer comes with a hefty price tag, so where does that leave those who are not billionaires? Markus Berger of Switzerland Tourism says the strategy is not to focus solely on high-end guests, but to take a hard-headed look at the figures.",
      "Stays at Swiss five-star hotels make up around 8% of all overnights, but the guests in them contribute at least 25% of Switzerland's total revenue from tourism.",
      "\"The numbers speak for themselves,\" says Mr Berger. \"The high economic significance justifies a commitment to luxury guests.\"",
      "What's more, he adds, Switzerland, with its high-wage, high-price economy, cannot compete with less expensive neighbours, particularly now that the Swiss franc is so strong.",
      "\"Switzerland has never tried to compete over prices,\" Mr Berger explains. \"There is always somewhere cheaper.\"",
      "Instead, the focus is on quality, service, and added value, like those ski butlers. In exchange, guests who come to five-star hotels also contribute a good deal to the rest of the economy, spending lavishly in the Michelin-starred restaurants and boutique shops that are also becoming a feature in a number of Swiss alpine resorts.",
      "But it's not an entirely win-win situation. In some of Switzerland's most famous up-market resorts, like St Moritz or Zermatt, there are long-standing concerns that the focus on luxury is pricing locals out of the market.",
      "A common challenge is finding accommodation for the hundreds of hotel and restaurant staff needed to provide the five-star service.",
      "They sometimes find themselves commuting, late at night when the cocktail bars and restaurants have finally closed, long journeys to other villages where the accommodation is affordable on a waiter's salary.",
      "Monika Bandi, who leads the Tourism Research Unit at Bern University's Centre for Regional Development, sees Switzerland's pitch to high-end guests as a fine balancing act. It's about \"quantity versus quality\", she says.",
      "More tourists aren't necessarily better, she believes. Instead, higher spending by existing numbers can be positive.",
      "And, she adds, Switzerland needs to watch out for the \"tipping point, where the destinations really lose their character\".",
      "Questions about a tipping point are currently being asked in the resort of Wengen, world famous for its Lauberhorn ski race, and its decades long connection with British skiers \u2013 the much-loved \"Down Hill Only\" ski club celebrated its 100th anniversary this year.",
      "And also this year, Wengen is opening its first ever five-star hotel, and there are plans too for a five-star complex of serviced \"hotel apartments\". They will be sold to wealthy tourists who want a luxury holiday home in the Alps, and they can also be rented out when the owners are absent.",
      "By calling the project a hotel, it exploits a loophole in Switzerland's strict laws against the \"cold beds\" of holiday homes. In theory, the law limits them to no more than 20% of a resort's accommodation.",
      "The Swiss Heritage Society has formally objected to the Wengen plans, because, claims spokesman Simon Weiss, the project is not really a hotel. \"It looks like a typical holiday home complex\u2026 there is no integration into the community.\"",
      "The required public spaces that a hotel would have \u2013 a restaurant and a spa \u2013 are planned, but they will all be underground. The design priority, Mr Weiss fears, is for private luxury apartments that may be occupied for only a few weeks a year. \"The design is unacceptable,\" he adds.",
      "Some Wengen locals also have their doubts. \"It's not St Moritz here,\" one told Swiss media, adding \"Wengen is not posh\".",
      "Wengen's tourism director Rolf Wegm\u00fcller agrees with that assessment, but says the trend towards luxury accommodation won't change the resort's character. \"We're not going to have guests walking around in fur coats all of a sudden,\" he says.",
      "Wengen, he points out, is only accessible by train, so, unlike St Moritz, there will be no Bentleys or Rolls-Royces taking up parking spaces. Even if they could ostentatiously display their wealth, Mr Wegm\u00fcller believes \"our guests won't want to show off what they have\".",
      "The resort also has visitors who come back year after year, contributing to the integration Mr Weiss worries about losing. \"Some families have been coming for generations,' says Mr Wegm\u00fcller. 'The locals know them, and that's good.\"",
      "Among them are Brian Bollen, keen member of the Down Hill Only Club, who has been coming to Wengen for more than 50 years. He loves it, but does worry that some of \"the charm has gone from the place\u2026 it's over built\".",
      "But most in Wengen, like Switzerland Tourism, see the investment in the alpine resorts as positive. These villages were, not much more than a century ago, very poor. A 19th English guide to the Swiss alps wrote that \"most of the children are beggars\".",
      "In more recent years, the global trade rules limiting agricultural subsidies have forced many small alpine dairy farms to close. Tourism, winter and summer, is enormously important for the Swiss economy, especially for the mountain communities.",
      "And, as Mr Berger of Switzerland Tourism points out, while the five-star sector is growing, three-star hotels are still the biggest category. \"We have one to five-star [in Wengen],\" adds Mr Wegm\u00fcller. \"That's a good thing in a resort.\"",
      "And while the people with unlimited money to spend on luxury travel may still be in a tiny minority, their numbers, and their wealth, are growing. Switzerland's approach \u2013 not cheaper, but better, not more people, just richer \u2013 seems to be paying off.",

    "summary": "Ireland is investing billions of euros to revamp its healthcare service - will AI help?",
    "story": [
      "For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology.",
      "They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics.",
      "In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E.",
      "Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online.",
      "But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare.",
      "That includes a programme called Sl\u00e1intecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its \u20ac22.9bn (\u00a320bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.",
      "To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved.",
      "It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department.",
      "That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen.",
      "\"In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,\" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.",
      "Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.",
      "To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: \"We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures.\"",
      "The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.",
      "\"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,\" he says.",
      "Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges.",
      "Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends.",
      "Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.",
      "But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a \"synthetic MRI\" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.",
      "That was done by feeding a \"generative AI\" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.",
      "Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.",
      "And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.",
      "Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.",
      "But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.",
      "That will \"severely delay\" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.",
      "Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.",
      "\"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,\" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.",
      "\"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,\" he says.",
      "Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.",
      "An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.",
      "But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.",
      "To prevent such AI from hallucinating, \"you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,\" says Prof MacMahon.",
      "AIs can have biases, but \"humans have biases too\", he points out.",
      "A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.",
      "\"For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error\", than in new health technology where \"the acceptable risk is zero\", says Prof Se\u00e1n Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "This means we \"continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans\", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.",
      "Healthcare regulators, who already have a \"weak enough\" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.",
      "For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.",
      "But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. \"For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,\" he points out.",
      "AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.",
      "That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.",
      "When AI influences their decisions, doctors need to \"be able to articulate the reasoning behind those decisions in a manner that is accessible and understandable to those affected,\" he says.",

      "For instance, the country's sizeable lithium deposits are still largely untapped. Likewise, rare earth deposits are known to exist, but none of them have yet been mined, because of a lack of investment.",

      "Children from poor households should be enrolled for free school meals automatically to prevent thousands going hungry, a report by MPs has found.",
      "The education select committee called for the change \"without delay\", warning that pupils who should be fed free of cost are missing out because their parents have not signed up to the scheme.",
      "As of June 2024, around 2.1 million children were known to be eligible for free school meals in England - nearly a quarter of pupils.",
      "A Department for Education (DfE) spokesperson said the government \"welcomed\" the proposals and would carefully consider the recommendations.",
      "In England, families are eligible to apply for free school meals if they are on universal credit and have a household income below \u00a37,400 per year, after tax, alongside other benefits.",
      "However, the committee heard evidence from an expert who estimated that one in 10 children in poverty are not receiving the meals.",
      "Earlier this month, Kate Antsey, of the Child Poverty Action Group, told MPs that it was often because of language barriers or difficulty with the administrative process experienced by their parents.",
      "Another estimate published in April 2024 by the think tank Policy in Practice put the number of children needlessly missing out on free school meals at 471,000.",
      "The cross-party education committee said the government should change the current rules using the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill - which is currently making its way through Parliament - to remove the need for manual enrolment.",
      "Failing to address the issue would be a \"missed opportunity\" to feed hungry children at school, the report concluded.",
      "It added that low uptake of free school meals contributes to hunger at school for children living with deprivation.",
      "The MPs also accused the government of rushing the bill through the House of Commons \"at the expense of time for proper scrutiny\".",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has called it a \"landmark\" bill to \"seek to keep children safe\".",
      "It includes plans for all children to have a unique identifier number, a bit like a National Insurance number, for safeguarding purposes.",
      "It also includes other wide-ranging proposals, such as universal free breakfast clubs in all primary schools, and changes to academy schools' powers.",
      "Some of its proposals - particularly around academies - have been criticised, including by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who called it educational \"vandalism\".",
      "Paul Whiteman, general secretary at school leaders' union NAHT, agreed with the committee's calls for auto-enrolment for free school meals, adding: \"Too often social stigma means parents do not register.",
      "\"Crucially, enrolment for free school meals also unlocks pupil premium money for pupils, so without registration they also miss out on this vital additional support.\"",
      "Campaigners say automatic enrolment would also bring in millions in extra funding for schools via pupil premium grants.",
      "The government pays schools \u00a31,455 per primary pupil on free school meals or \u00a31,035 per secondary pupil, per year, for at least six years.",
      "Other recommendations in the report include ensuring that children with special educational needs and disabilities can access universal free breakfast clubs, strengthening the access of children in care to mental health support, and developing a national care offer.",
      "Education committee chairwoman Helen Hayes said: \"The committee has made recommendations designed to strengthen support for the most vulnerable children in society, based on compelling evidence from experts and from young people who shared with us their deeply moving experiences of life in care.\"",
      "The committee called on the government to develop a consistent national offer for care leavers across the country, to support vulnerable young people with things like transport costs and access to apprenticeships.",
      "The DfE said the \"landmark\" schools bill would break the \"unfair link between background and opportunity\".",
      "\"Despite the challenging inherited fiscal context, we are introducing landmark measures to support family finances, including rolling out free breakfast clubs in every primary school and capping the number of branded uniform items parents have to pay for, as well as prioritising reform across children's social care.\"",

      "The boy, described in court as shy, articulate, a keen cook and footballer, said his parents had tricked him into going to Africa, saying it was to visit a sick relative.",
      "He said had he known he was being sent to boarding school \"there would have been no way I would have agreed to it\".",

      "In his judgment, High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden said he recognised that \"this is, in many ways, both a sobering and rather depressing conclusion.\"",
      "He said that he was satisfied that the parents' wish for their son to move to Ghana was \"driven by their deep, obvious and unconditional love\".",
      "The boy was at risk of suffering greater harm returning to the UK, he said.",
      "He said that the boy's parents believe \"and in my judgement with reason\" that their son has \"at very least peripheral involvement with gang culture and has exhibited an unhealthy interest in knives\".",
      "The boy's father told the judge the couple did not want their son to be \"yet another black teenager stabbed to death in the streets of London.\"",
      "The boy, who had lived in the UK since birth, said he was \"mocked\" and \"never settled in\" at the school in Ghana.",
      "He said he \"could also barely understand what was going on and I would get into fights\".",

      "\"I am from London, England, and I want to go back home,\" he wrote.",
      "He said he had been \"mistreated\" at the school, adding: \"I'm begging to go back to my old school.\"",

      "She said it was not only the parents who were worried.",
      "His school claimed it had \"suspicions about him engaging in criminal activities\" and had observed him in expensive clothes and with mobile phones.",

      "He acknowledged in his statements that \"my behaviour wasn't the best\" and said he thought that was the reason his parents sent him to Africa.",
      "The case centred on the question of parental responsibility, and whether the parents acted unlawfully by sending their son to boarding school without his consent.",

      "They added: \"Our priority has always been protecting our son and our focus now is on moving forward as a family.\"",

      "'I want to have an education'",
      "The boy's barrister, Deirdre Fottrell KC, pointed out the school was not simply far from home - but a completely different jurisdiction.",

      "He wrote: \"I want to have an education again and grow up like a normal person. I feel like my brain is hurt here. I feel like now I am dumber than people I used to be smarter than.\"",
      "The boy's father has recently visited him in Africa, and he told the court that he and his son had got on well.",
      "He said he would like his son to remain in Ghana, and said they visited a different boarding school where the boy could be considered for a place.",
      "The father said they were both very impressed.",

      "\"I did save one of 50 for my mom of course, felt like the right thing to do,\" she says.",
      "For those watching with an understandable sense of nosiness, this isn't actually filmed in Meghan's own home in Montecito. \"I'm gonna prep everything here as I would at home and then bring it back to my house,\" she says.",

      "And does this also mark a final departure from any prospect of a return to palace life. The whole breezy, commercial charm of the show is a world away from the royals. This feels like looking forwards to a new future, without any more haggling over the past.",
      "Everything that Meghan does gets intense attention. That's partly because of how she polarises opinion. People who think she's wonderful and people who can't stand her are all interested in watching more.",
      "This series will inevitably get attention because of Meghan's involvement. But will there be enough for either her fans or her detractors to get their teeth into? How strongly can you feel about a cake with a few raspberries on top? Opinions will be divided. As Ever.",

    "summary": "The artist, best known for The Singing Butler, was found dead at his apartment in the south of France.",
    "story": [
      "Scottish painter Jack Vettriano, best known for his painting The Singing Butler, has died at the age of 73.",
      "His publicist said the artist was found dead at his apartment in Nice, in the south of France, on Saturday.",
      "It is understood there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death.",
      "Vettriano was a self-taught artist whose most famous work became the UK's best-selling art print and set a Scottish record when it was auctioned in 2004.",
      "He was born Jack Hoggan on 17 November 1951 in Methil, Fife, and left school at 15 to become a mining engineer. He later moved into personnel management.",
      "For his 21st birthday, he was given a set of watercolour paints and then spent much of his spare time teaching himself to paint.",
      "He drew inspiration from works at Kirkcaldy Galleries, studying paintings from artists such as Samuel Peploe and William McTaggart so intently that he feared arousing the suspicions of gallery staff.",
      "His breakthrough came in 1989 when he submitted two paintings to the Royal Scottish Academy's annual show and both sold on the first day, inspiring him to become a full-time artist.",
      "His works garnered international acclaim, leading to exhibitions in cities including London, Hong Kong, Johannesburg and New York.",
      "Vettriano was often dismissed by critics, who variously described his work as \"brainless erotica\", \"mere wallpaper\" and \"crass male fantasy\".",
      "But in an interview with the Radio Times, he responded: \"They don't like an artist who is as popular as me because it takes away part of their authority. If they want to ignore me, let them.",
      "\"I have what I want and that is the support of the public.",
      "\"That means far more to me than the approval of a bunch of well-educated art buffs.\"",
      "He was appointed an OBE for services to visual arts in 2003.",
      "His best-known work, The Singing Butler, depicts an elegant couple dancing on a storm-swept beach accompanied by their butler and maid.",
      "It sold at auction in 2004 for \u00a3744,800 - a Scottish record at the time - and reproductions of the painting were the best-selling art print in the UK.",
      "It was reimagined by Banksy for Crude Oil (Vettriano) - a painting now owned by Blink-182 star Mark Hoppus and expected to fetch between \u00a33m and \u00a35m at auction in London on Tuesday.",
      "Despite being shunned by galleries earlier in his career, Vettriano's self-portrait The Weight went on long-term display in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery when it reopened after a renovation in 2011.",
      "The first major retrospective of his work was held in the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow in 2013.",
      "It attracted more than 136,000 visitors during its five-month run and was said at the time to be the most successful commercial exhibition ever staged in Glasgow.",
      "A further retrospective was held at Kirkcaldy Galleries in 2022, focusing on his formative years and early career.",
      "Vettriano created a portrait for one of three giant murals of Billy Connolly installed in Glasgow in 2017 as part of a BBC programme marking the comedian's 75th birthday.",
      "Among those who acquired Vettriano paintings were Jack Nicholson, Sir Alex Ferguson, Sir Tim Rice and Robbie Coltrane.",
      "He has spoken publicly about his struggles with his mental health and his dependence on alcohol and drugs.",
      "Vettriano's publicist said that his passing \"marks the end of an era for contemporary Scottish art.",
      "\"His evocative and timeless works will continue to captivate and inspire future generations.\"",
      "First Minister John Swinney paid tribute to the artist and offered his condolences to his family.",
      "\"I am very sorry to hear the news that Jack Vettriano has died,\" he wrote in a post on X.",
      "\"He made a unique and evocative contribution to artistic life in Scotland in such compelling style.\"",
      "There are few artists who have such instant recognition outside the world of art or who are loved and loathed in equal measures.",
      "From the moment Jack Hoggan invented Jack Vettriano, submitted two paintings to the Royal Scottish Academy and sold both in a day, he set in motion the commercial pull and establishment disdain which would follow him throughout his career.",
      "The commercial success and record prices only further antagonised the critics who dismissed his work as \"colouring in\".",
      "The first major retrospective of his work in Kelvingrove Art Gallery in 2013 had not just a separate room with a warning for his more explicit paintings but a gift shop which did a roaring trade in spin-off merchandise.",
      "Would he have traded some of that success for a fairer review of his work?",
      "I think he would.",
      "When I first met him 25 years ago, he was keen to dismiss any criticism as art establishment snobbery. What ordinary people thought of his work was all that mattered.",
      "Each time I met him, more and more people had made that clear by attending his exhibitions in their thousands or buying prints and postcards.",
      "The last time \u2013 on home turf at Kirkcaldy Art Galleries where he'd once studied the colourists \u2013 was especially emotional.",
      "\"I'm not just happy, I'm proud,\" he told me, \"to have done that without any tuition and be back here where it all started.\"",
      "Self-made, self-starting, Jack Vettriano gave a large section of the public what they wanted and the world is a little less colourful for his passing.",

      "Nudity, swearing, petulance, club anthems, more nudity and a woman dressed as a horse - the 2025 Brit Awards had it all.",
      "Charli XCX was the big winner, taking home five prizes in all - including best artist, best album and song of the year.",
      "US star - and the BBC's Sound of 2025 - Chappell Roan picked up two awards; while Ezra Collective, The Last Dinner Party, Fontaines DC and Stormzy got one apiece.",
      "But no-one's only interested in all that. Here's what really went down at the 2025 ceremony at London's O2 Arena.",
      "Most predictable winner: Charli XCX",
      "Listen, this was never going to be anything other than Charli's night.",
      "The pop star's seventh album, Brat, captured the cultural zeitgeist in a way that few artists ever manage.",
      "Released in June, the record combined abrasive dance-floor beats, soaring hooks and meme-friendly artwork; as the 32-year-old assessed her place in the music industry, the real and imaginary rivals she's accumulated along the way, and whether or not to leave it all behind to have a baby.",
      "In the star's own words, the album was \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\".",
      "Just as everyone was absorbing that, she hired a bunch of guest stars - Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Lorde, Addison Rae, Bon Iver - and re-recorded an entirely new, sometimes superior, version of the album.",
      "Critics called it \"pop music for the future\" and praised the way its \"painfully relatable\" lyrics captured Charli's coming of age.",
      "Knowingly trashy, yet surprisingly deep, it was easily the best British album of the last 12 months - and one that proved Charli's detractors wrong.",
      "\"I feel like dance music, electronic music, gets a really bad rep because everyone is like, 'It's not that deep, is it? And I kind of feel it is,\" she said after collecting her second award.",

      "Teddy Swims, swimming in teddy bears. We see what he did there.",
      "Least practical dress: Jade Thirlwall",
      "Jade Thirlwall was the last of the Little Mix crew to launch a solo career, but she's been giving it her all.",
      "As well as winning best pop artist at Saturday's ceremony, she put on one of the night's highest-concept performances - a five-act melodrama about the cruelty of the music industry and her creative rebirth.",
      "Over the course of the night, she wore six different outfits. But she chose the wrong one for climbing the stairs to pick up her trophy. Thank goodness the Sugababes were there to help.",
      "Sneakiest host: Jack Whitehall",
      "Jack Whitehall made a welcome return as the ceremony's host, after four years away.",
      "As ever, his jokes were close to the bone... including a passing reference to allegations surrounding some presenters on Brits broadcaster ITV.",
      "\"ITV had so many of its presenters cancelled this year that they had to come crawling back to an ex, and what an honour it is to be hosting again the biggest night in British music,\" he joked.",
      "Later, he described Youtuber-turned-musician KSI as \"an inspiration\".",
      "\"Because you listen to Kendrick Lamar and you're like, 'I couldn't do that in a million years'. Then I listen to your song and I'm like, 'Oh, I could do this'.\"",
      "Speaking before the show, Whitehall revealed a sneaky secret: He uses a fake script during rehearsals.",
      "\"Previously I used to do the actual script in rehearsal, and then you'd have an hour of people from record labels and publishers coming and knocking on the dressing room door going, 'You can't say this, you can't say that',\" he told Heart radio.",
      "\"So now I just do this fake script, which if you heard it, you'd be like, 'This is the lamest script ever', because it's all me just complimenting everyone and going, 'Oh, our next award is the best musician I've ever heard. They're great.'\"",

      "Most criticised industry: The music industry",
      "The Brits were set up in 1977 to celebrate the British Music Industry, and they are run by the BPI - an organisation funded by, and representing, the biggest record labels in the country.",
      "But lots of the winners on Saturday used their speeches to criticise the way they are being treated.",

      "Asked about the moment he realised it had taken on a life of its own, he told us: \"I got new wi-fi the other day, and they put me on hold... and it was Stargazing.",

      "But was the decision to hand her the \"global success\" award a thinly-veiled ploy to tempt her back on to the stage?",
      "The prize was originally created in 2013 to recognise British acts who had sold millions of records and concert tickets abroad. The previous recipients were One Direction (2013-14), Sam Smith (2015), Adele (2016-17) and Ed Sheeran (2018-19).",
      "Six years ago it was abandoned altogether... until they needed something to honour Sabrina.",

      "What we know about the death of Gene Hackman",
      "Hackman, a two-time Oscar winner, died alongside his wife Betsy Arakawa, 65, and their dog at his home in New Mexico. No cause of death was given, but police said the situation was \"suspicious enough\" to merit investigation.",
      "Officials said on Friday that evidence points to Hackman having been dead since 17 February, 10 days before the couples' bodies were found.",
      "'He put the fear of God into me'",
      "In LA, Hackman's face is everywhere on television bulletins and on newspapers.",
      "His death was all anyone was talking about as stars gathered for pre-Oscars parties.",
      "I was at one of those events on Thursday night, where the American actor John C Reilly told me that he expected the Academy to commemorate Hackman on Sunday. \"I don't see how you could have the Oscars without mentioning a great like him who's passed.\"",
      "For Sonnenfeld and for the Irish director John Moore \u2013 who directed Hackman in 2001's Behind Enemy Lines \u2013 it was Hackman's way of dealing with scripts that demonstrated his brilliance. He would remove all of the scriptwriter's notes about how his character should deliver his lines.",
      "\"Because he didn't want any screenwriter to tell him how he was supposed to feel at that moment,\" Sonnenfeld said.",
      "\"So he had unique cut and pasted scripts that had no information from the writer about anything, because he wanted to make those choices, not the writer.\"",
      "Moore recalls a similar incident from the very first time he filmed with Hackman.",
      "\"He was just quietly sitting there, taking script pages out, cutting them up, removing extraneous stuff like scene descriptions, and then sticking them back onto blank pages,\" he said.",
      "He said Hackman told him: \"Acting is my job, you do the rest.\"",
      "\"It put the fear of God into me,\" Moore said, laughing.",
      "\"It was essentially him saying: 'I don't need anything, as I'm that good. You better bring your A-game, as I'm bringing mine.'\"",
      "It wasn't just superfluous studio notes that bothered Hackman.",
      "\"He had this conflict in that he was this brilliant actor but he hated the tropes of what it took to act in movies,\" said Sonnenfeld.",
      "\"[He] hated putting on makeup. The putting on of wardrobe. The wardrobe person after takes, taking their lip brush and rubbing down their wardrobe. The makeup person recombing his hair while he's talking to me,\" he said.",
      "\"All that sort of fussy hair and makeup and all that stuff, I think that drove him crazy.\"",
      "Nor did he often want to socialise after filming, said Moore.",
      "\"I'd try and have a drink with him after we'd shoot, and go up to the minibar,\" he said.",
      "\"He'd have one, that was it. [Betsy] would give him that look, and off it would be to bed. And he was in great shape in the morning as a result.\"",
      "\"For Gene, it was all about the acting,\" added Sonnenfeld. \"End of story. Get me out of here as fast as possible.\"",
      "Showdown with John Travolta",
      "Hackman could be \"a hard actor\" to work with, said Sonnenfeld. \"He suffered no fools.\"",
      "In Get Shorty, Hackman starred alongside Travolta, who plays a Miami mobster sent to collect a debt.",
      "\"Gene was a consummate actor, both technically and artistically. So he came to set every day knowing his lines,\" Sonnenfeld said.",
      "\"John came to set not knowing his lines, probably not having read the script the night before.\"",

      "That resulted in a showdown on the first day of filming.",
      "Sonnenfeld recalls Travolta \u2013 who he describes as \"charming but not self aware\" \u2013 asking Hackman what he had done on the weekend.",
      "Hackman responded: \"Nothing except learn the lines,\" to which Travolta replied, \"Well that's a waste of a weekend,\" according to Sonnenfeld.",
      "As filming went on, Hackman grew \"angrier and angrier\" at his co-star not knowing his lines.",
      "Sonnenfeld said he let Hackman take out his rage on him.",
      "\"For the next 12 weeks, he would yell at me whenever John didn't know his lines,\" he said.",
      "\"But he's great in a movie. And I knew he was never really mad at me.\"",
      "Travolta reportedly wasn't the only one to rub Hackman the wrong way.",
      "He reportedly clashed with others, including The Royal Tenenbaums' director Wes Anderson.",
      "Later, and possibly coincidentally, Hackman named one of his novels Escape from Andersonville.",
      "\"Gene was really rough on Wes,\" recalled Bill Murray, who co-starred with Hackman in the hit 2001 film, in an interview with the Associated Press.",
      "\"He was a tough nut, Gene Hackman. But he was really good.\"",
      "Moore, for his part, said he didn't ever feel Hackman was difficult to work with.",
      "\"He was patient and relentlessly, flawlessly professional,\" he said.",
      "\"My memories are of him laughing and smiling, and telling very funny jokes.\"",
      "Moore admitted Hackman might have become irritated with anyone on set who made their role bigger than it was.",
      "\"So I could see how he might be funny about actors who were peacocking themselves,\" he said.",
      "\"But again it goes back to the point - he just really wanted to make the films exceptional.\"",
      "Hackman retired from acting in 2004 and from then on lived a quiet life in New Mexico with his wife.",
      "\"I suspect that one of the reasons he moved to Santa Fe, again, great outdoors and as far away from Hollywood as you can get,\" said Sonnenfeld.",
      "In 2008, Hackman gave a rare interview with Reuters, in which he was asked if he missed acting.",
      "He responded by saying the business was, for him, \"very stressful\".",
      "\"The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast, and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it anymore.\"",
      "But, he added: \"I miss the actual acting part of it, as it's what I did for almost 60 years.",
      "\"And I really loved that.\"",

      "Madison, 25, relied on real-life strippers to help her perfect the part.",
      "When she won a Bafta film award last month, she dedicated it to the sex worker community.",
      "\"I have been able to meet some of that community through my research of the film, and that's been one of the most incredible parts of making the film,\" she told us backstage.",
      "They \"deserve respect and don't often get it. And so I had to say something,\" she added.",
      "We've been speaking to the actresses, strippers and dancers in the film about their experiences of working on it - and their thoughts on the finished product.",
      "Some praised the film as realistic, particularly in its portrayal of the rejection and exhaustion that sex workers often feel. But others said the film was \"limited\".",
      "'I debated not showing up'",
      "Edie Turquet was initially unsure whether to take part in the film.",
      "Turquet, who is British and appeared in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts as a child, now lives in New York where she's a student and a stripper.",
      "She got cast as a background dancer in Anora after a casting agent spotted her in the club where she was working. But Turquet says the night before filming, she debated not showing up.",
      "\"I didn't want to be part of a bad stripper film, or anything doing a disservice to our industry, so I was apprehensive,\" she told me.",
      "\"Most films about strippers are super over-aestheticised, or bad and exploitative.\"",
      "Turquet points to 2020 film Zola, about a waitress who goes to Florida for a weekend of stripping for quick cash. \"I found it hyperbolic, totally overglamourising the work, and it felt like it was talking down to women,\" she said.",
      "\"And don't get me started on Pretty Woman, which is infuriating, especially the idea of a street worker played by Julia Roberts. Come on.\"",
      "But when Turquet realised Anora was a Sean Baker film, she changed her mind.",
      "\"His films are based on realism, he has a fly-on-the-wall style of filmmaking, which I love,\" she said. \"So I was down.\"",
      "Baker's filmmaking skills were also what attracted Lindsey Normington to the film. The actress and stripper stars as Diamond, Anora's workplace enemy.",
      "She says she saw him at afterparty for a film premiere, and went up to him to tell him she was a fan.",
      "They connected on Instagram, and months later, he contacted her to tell her he might have a role for her in a new film. \"I fell to my knees in my house,\" Normington said.",
      "'I taught Mikey stripper slang'",
      "In the film, Anora is offered a chance at a fairytale escape when she meets and falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.",
      "Miranda, an actress and stripper who plays Lulu, Anora's best friend, says she was tasked with helping Madison sound like a real sex worker from New York.",
      "\"I shared a PDF of language and slang terms that only strippers from New York will understand,\" she said.",
      "One of those words was \"whale\", which, Miranda explains, \"is a customer who is like a bottomless pit of money. He will make your night. And he won't make you work very hard for it at all.\"",
      "Rejection, heartbreak, and Tupperware boxes",
      "This section contains spoilers for Anora",
      "Miranda said a lot of the film's themes, on heartbreak and rejection, were relatable for her.",
      "\"Sometimes I feel like this shiny toy, that people want to play with. They go, 'wow like you're a stripper. You're so cool.' And then they just cast you aside and abandon you,\" she said.",
      "\"I think about the ending a lot because I feel like Anora a lot.\"",
      "Turquet agrees, calling the ending \"very relatable and poignant\", adding that it accurately depicts the \"exhaustion and fatigue\" strippers often feel.",
      "\"The sex industry has trauma built into it. It felt so real. It's an incredible vulnerable industry,\" she said.",
      "\"You're putting yourself in danger every time you go to work. It's a complex and exhausting job.\"",
      "But overall, she said has mixed feelings about the film.",
      "\"What a lot of stripper films miss - and what Anora starts but doesn't go far enough on - is the moral question around men who buy sex,\" she said.",
      "\"It's the question of consent. Most of these films shy away from answering it, or looking into it.\"",
      "She said it also frustrates her that these characters \"never exist outside their profession\".",
      "\"[Anora] is a pretty limited character,\" she said. \"We never learn anything about her. The film takes the perspective of [male leads] Igor and Vanya, in defining who she is.\"",
      "\"It's better than any film I've seen about it, but ultimately it's limited as it's not told by a sex worker,\" she added. \"I can't wait till we're telling our own stories and hopefully this opens the door to that.\"",
      "For Normington, the film reflected \"the insecurity and competition and jealousy\" that she has personally experienced in clubs.",
      "\"I appreciate that it's not attempting to be a quintessential stripper movie.\"",
      "For Kennady Schneider, a Los Angeles-based stripper and choreographer who trained Madison to dance, it was the film's portrayal of the mundane nature of the job that struck a chord.",
      "In the film's early scenes, we see Anora at work, talking to clients in the club.",
      "We also see her and the other strippers on a lunch break, eating from Tupperware boxes in a back room.",
      "\"It felt really accurate,\" Schneider said.",
      "\"A lot of the time in [stripper] films, you have glamorisation, with money falling from the ceiling. Those moments do happen but they're few and far between,\" she said. \"It's much more of a quiet hustle.\"",
      "Oscar hopes",
      "When Anora came out, special screenings were held for sex workers in New York and LA.",
      "Footage circulated on social media shows the strippers banging their high-heeled platform pleaser shoes together over their heads, to show their appreciation at the end of the screenings.",
      "\"That is the most beautiful applause I've ever received, I don't know if that will ever happen again,\" Madison told us.",
      "Now, all eyes are on the Oscars.",
      "Miranda and Normington will both be attending. \"It's kind of silly to think that I'm going to the Oscars, but [at the same time] I'm at the club arguing with a stupid man over $20,\" said Miranda.",
      "\"I feel like I'm living two lives.\"",
      "She said that Madison is \"spot on\" to say the sex worker community doesn't get the respect it deserves, and said she hopes that Anora's success will change that.",
      "\"My hope is that if this film wins an Oscar, it marks the beginning of a shift in Hollywood, where sex workers are respected, as workers in their own fields, but also as entertainers,\" she said.",
      "\"If this film wins an Oscar, I want to see that.\"",

      "17 facts you need to know before the Oscars",
      "The class photo, a highlight of the film calendar, is usually taken much earlier in awards season, at the nominees luncheon, but that event was cancelled this year due to the LA wildfires.",
      "Here are 12 things we spotted in this year's class photo:",
      "1. Ariana and Cynthia held space at the front",
      "Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande have spent the last few months crying, holding space and stroking each other's fingers as they promoted the screen adaptation of Wicked.",
      "The two actresses have redefined the film press tour in recent weeks thanks to their absolute adoration for each other - an energy they will have to recreate later this year when they do it all again for the release of part two.",
      "Before the photo was taken, instead of saying cheese, Erivo shouted: \"Everyone say 'Oscar nominee!'\"",
      "Last week, it was confirmed the pair will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony which will last a reported 10 minutes long.",
      "Wicked is the closest thing the Oscars have this year to a box office smash in the shape of last year's Barbie, and they'll be hoping the medley will recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year.",
      "2. We absolutely need this woman's jumper",
      "We're aware the weather is getting warmer and the sun is rising earlier as we hurtle towards Spring, but we are nevertheless always on the lookout for a colourful cosy jumper and we need to investigate the origin of this one as an urgent priority.",
      "The woman with the impeccable sweater selection in the class photo is Maya Gnyp - a producer of I Am Ready, Warden - which is nominated for best documentary short.",
      "The film follows Texas death row inmate John Henry Ramire in his final days.",
      "3. A-listers packed out the front row",
      "Joining Ariana and Cynthia on the front row were fellow acting nominees Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Mikey Madison and Monica Barbaro.",
      "Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.",
      "As a result, her fellow category nominees such as Barbaro, who plays Joan Baez in Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, have had to practise their best \"I'm just happy to be nominated\" faces this year.",
      "Madison, however, is a co-frontrunner in a tight race for leading actress. The Anora star is up against Demi Moore for The Substance in a category seen as a dead heat.",
      "4. James Mangold turned up just in time",
      "James Mangold, nominated this year for A Complete Unknown, is one of Hollywood's most respected and loved directors.",
      "So why is he sitting on an aisle seat in the second-back row, away from all his pals, looking sheepish?",
      "It's probably because he only just made the class photo by the skin of his teeth, arriving late to the event to an affectionate collective groan followed by cheers from his fellow nominees.",
      "Despite a distinguished Hollywood career, Mangold is a first-time nominee in the best director category, as are his fellow nominees Coralie Fargeat, Sean Baker, Brady Corbet and Jacques Audiard.",
      "5. We'd like to be the fifth member of this gang",
      "In a year where disappointingly few of the stars pulled funny faces or made eye-catching hand gestures while the photo was being taken, we applaud the team from Black Box Diaries for joining hands and celebrating.",
      "They are the film's director Shiori Ito (second left), editor Ema Ryan Yamazaki (far right) and producers Hanna Aqvilin and Eric Nyari.",
      "The movie, nominated in the documentary feature category, examines a sexual assault investigation in Japan.",
      "6. The biggest stars were in the back row",
      "Sitting in the back row, so far from the photographer that their faces are somewhat blurry and out of focus, are three of the biggest stars in this year's awards race.",
      "In the centre is The Substance star Demi Moore, nominated for playing an ageing aerobics instructor who takes a black-market drug to create a younger, more beautiful version of herself.",
      "She is joined on either side by supporting actor nominees Guy Pearce (left), who is recognised for his role in The Brutalist, and Edward Norton, who is nominated for playing Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown.",
      "7. Bernie and Brandi appeared without Elton",
      "Also hanging out in the front row were songwriter Bernie Taupin and singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile.",
      "The pair are nominated in the best original song category for writing Never Too Late, the title track from Sir Elton John's recent documentary.",
      "Sir Elton himself wasn't there, however, despite co-writing the song with the pair.",
      "It's likely he will attend the Oscars on Sunday, but he won't be singing his song as the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony this year.",
      "Instead, Doja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony alongside the Wicked medley.",
      "8. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet looked a little lonely",
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet joined his fellow nominees just days after springing a surprise win at the SAG Awards for A Complete Unknown.",
      "In his speech, the actor talked about his desire to be \"one of the greats\" of Hollywood.",
      "However, the actor has not been campaigning as aggressively as frontrunner Adrien Brody, and for the class photo, Chalamet took an aisle seat, leaned out and put his fist to his chest.",
      "Seated just in front of him are Anora's director Sean Baker and his producer wife Samantha Quan.",
      "9. The leading actors led from behind",
      "Adding further star power to the blurry back row were best actor contenders Adrien Brody, Colman Domingo and Sebastian Stan.",
      "Brody is the frontrunner to win, for his role in the Brutalist as a Hungarian architect who moves to the US after World War Two and is taken under the wing of a wealthy businessman.",
      "Sing Sing star Domingo plays a prison inmate who joins a performing arts programme, while Stan is nominated for portraying a young Donald Trump.",
      "10. Ralph represented for the Brits",
      "The Brits nominated in the acting categories this year are The Brutalist's Felicity Jones, Wicked's Cynthia Erivo, and Conclave's Ralph Fiennes.",
      "The actor was on Fiennes form, sitting in the back row alongside Sing Sing's John \"Divine G\" Whitfield.",
      "Fiennes is unlikely to win best actor, but if Conclave wins the top Oscar, he'll become the first actor ever to have appeared in four best picture winners.",
      "11. Some nominees were conspicuous by their absence",
      "Understandably, not every nominee was available to attend the dinner - best supporting actor frontrunner Kieran Culkin was among the stars missing from the class photo.",
      "But others were conspicuous by their absence, most notably Emilia P\u00e9rez star Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n.",
      "The actress is persona non grata in Hollywood at the moment, after some historic tweets she posted resurfaced in recent weeks, severely damaging the film's awards chances in many categories.",
      "However, it's been confirmed she will attend the Oscars ceremony itself on Sunday - although it remains to be seen if she will walk the red carpet and sit with her co-stars.",
      "12. Clarence Maclin knows what time it is",
      "Sing Sing star Clarence Maclin was widely considered the most notable absence in the best supporting actor category this year.",
      "But he is still nominated at the Oscars thanks to his story credit on the film, which means he is recognised in the best adapted screenplay category.",
      "Maclin was one of the real-life inmates at the Sing Sing jail, after being sentenced to 17 years in jail for robbery, aged 29, and was a member of the prison's Rehabilitation Through the Arts (RTA) programme.",

    "story": [
      "The latest release in one of Japan's most popular video game series has had one of the most successful debuts of all time.",
      "More than one million players have logged on to the PC version of Monster Hunter Wilds within hours of its launch, according to figures from online store Steam.",
      "There have been complaints from the first wave of players on Steam about the game's performance on computers, but its critical response has been positive.",
      "BBC Newsbeat spoke to director Yuya Tokuda and producer Ryozo Tsujimoto prior to the release of Wilds about turning the game into a global hit.",
      "Monster Hunter first launched on the PlayStation 2 in 2004.",
      "As the title suggests, players spend the game navigating an area known as The Forbidden Lands capturing and battling a cast of increasingly fearsome beasts.",
      "Long-time fans of the series are drawn in by its challenging, complex systems and option to play co-operatively, teaming up with friends to take down massive foes.",
      "Breakout 2018 hit Monster Hunter World has has sold 21.3 million copies, according to publisher Capcom, rising to 28.1 million when sales of an upgraded 2019 edition are included.",
      "Producer Mr Tsujimoto told BBC Newsbeat the game was a culmination of all the work and lessons learned from previous titles on the series.",
      "\"Anything that we hadn't been doing we really tried to do with Monster Hunter World to get everything ready so that the game was ready to break through,\" he said.",
      "Games industry layoffs and studio closures in the West and Europe have led to fears of \"brain drain\" - a loss of knowledge as people leave companies or even look for work in different fields.",
      "Japan, where employment protections for workers are much stronger, has not been as badly affected and developers often stay with the same company for a long time.",
      "Monster Hunter director Mr Tokuda says he's worked on the series for 20 years and it's fed into his work on Wilds.",
      "\"It's the groundwork that you create with your previous titles that you hope can inform the success of later ones,\" he says.",
      "\"We have the ability to take data from past titles like Monster Hunter World and analyse that data in order to understand what players were enjoying and what we could improve.\"",
      "Other Japanese studios are known for taking this iterative approach and building on what has come before.",
      "Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the makers of the popular Yakuza series and its Like a Dragon spin-offs, have put out a new game more or less every year since 2020.",
      "The company's boss Masayoshi Yokoyama has spoken openly about how the team is happy to revisit previous locations and reuse elements from earlier games rather doing a \"fresh reboot\" each time.",
      "This can help to lower development costs and reduce the time it takes to make new titles.",
      "'We're working in our own lanes'",
      "The Japanese games industry was a dominant force from the 1980s until the early 2000s, but a power shift saw Western developers begin to lead the way.",
      "More recently, the country has been behind some of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful titles released.",
      "At last year's Game Awards - described by some as the industry's answer to The Oscars - Japanese-made games occupied four of the six Game of the Year nominations.",
      "Mr Tsujimoto says he can't pinpoint a specific reason for this, but says the Monster Hunter team has learned there are certain things needed to make a \"triple-A success in today's market\".",
      "That includes translating games into various languages so they can be released simultaneously in different countries, and being mindful of growing your audience.",
      "\"We're always careful to design the experience so new players can get into the game,\" he adds.",

      "Japan does face some of the same challenges as other developers worldwide.",

      "Mr Tsujimoto says generational leaps \"push the industry forward\", bringing \"new opportunities and new complexities\".",
      "\"I don't think it's necessarily the most difficult it's ever been but there are always new challenges whenever technology leaps forward.\"",
      "The games industry is also more competitive than ever - more video games are being released, and players are tending to stick with the same ones for longer periods.",
      "It leaves publishers of new releases fighting over a much smaller share of players' free time and 2025 has already been packed with big new releases.",
      "Mr Tsujimoto insists they haven't paid too much attention to that while working on Monster Hunter Wilds.",
      "\"It looks like a big year for everyone but we're really all just working in our own lanes,\" he says.",
      "\"We happened to have this launch window that's on the verge of some other big releases but we don't have access to that information before the general public.\"",
      "For an established series that suddenly explodes in popularity, Mr Tokuda says a big challenge is pleasing old and new fans.",
      "\"You always have in your mind that there's people waiting for your next creation and they're the players you want to satisfy,\" he says.",
      "\"But you also have your own creative idea and want to follow that through.\"",

    "summary": "\u201cKasibba\u201d, who is non-verbal and had no family to speak for her, was one of hundreds wrongly detained.",
    "story": [
      "An autistic woman with a learning disability was wrongly locked up in a mental health hospital for 45 years, starting when she was just seven years old, the BBC has learned.",
      "The woman, who is believed to be originally from Sierra Leone, and who was given the name Kasibba by the local authority to protect her identity, was also held on her own in long-term segregation for 25 years.",
      "Kasibba is non-verbal and had no family to speak up for her. A clinical psychologist told File on 4 Investigates how she had begun a nine-year battle to release her.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC it was unacceptable that so many disabled people were still being held in mental health hospitals and said it hoped reforms to the Mental Health Act would prevent inappropriate detention.",
      "More than 2,000 autistic people and people with learning disabilities are still detained in mental health hospitals in England - including about 200 children. For years, the government has pledged to move many of them into community care, because they do not have any mental illness.",
      "The government promised to take action after a BBC undercover investigation in 2011 exposed the criminal abuse of people with learning disabilities at Winterbourne View private hospital near Bristol.",
      "But all key targets in England have been missed. In the past few weeks, in its plan for 2025-26, NHS England said it aimed to reduce the reliance on mental health inpatient care for people with a learning disability and autistic people, delivering a minimum 10% reduction.",
      "However, Dan Scorer, head of policy and public affairs at the charity Mencap, is not impressed. \"Hundreds of people are still languishing, detained, who should have been freed and should be supported in the community, because we haven't seen the progress that was promised,\" he told us.",
      "Dr Patsie Staite learned of Kasibba's incarceration in 2013 when she was a rookie clinical psychologist carrying out a routine review of her care. But it would take nine years to free her.",
      "\"I hadn't ever seen anyone living in the situation that she was living in. And I think what was really shocking was it was all legitimised,\" Dr Staite told the BBC. She said the apparently legitimate hospital setting masked the reality that Kasibba \"was locked up for sometimes more than 23 hours a day\".",
      "Returning to the site of the hospital - which cannot be named to help protect Kasibba's identity - Dr Staite pointed out a hole in the fence. It had been cut out, she said, so Kasibba could watch people walking by from the outside space of the locked annex where she was held.",
      "It is thought Kasibba, who is now in her 50s, was trafficked from Sierra Leone before the age of five. She lived in a children's home for a while, but that placement broke down and, by the age of seven, she was moved into the long-stay hospital.",
      "Dr Staite said that staff had described Kasibba as \"dangerous\" and an \"eye-gouger\".",
      "She discovered a single incident in the records which appeared to have led to these accusations of violence. Decades earlier, when Kasibba was 19 and before she was placed in long-term segregation, a fire alarm had gone off and the locked ward was being evacuated.",
      "Kasibba was distressed and, in the confusion, she was approached by another patient. She scratched her, causing a cut to the other patient's eye.",
      "\"That was how the incident was talked about ever since, 'she's an eye gouger and she caused so much harm to this other person',\" said Dr Staite. But \"it just didn't ring true\", she said, that a middle-aged woman with a learning disability who had lived in the hospital for decades could be that dangerous.",
      "After months of work, Dr Staite submitted a 50-page report to Camden Council - the local authority in north London which had originally placed Kasibba in the hospital. Dr Staite said it had already been accepted that Kasibba did not have a mental illness and her report concluded she was not dangerous and was safe to live in the community.",
      "A team of health and social care professionals was then set up in 2016, calling themselves \"the escape committee\". Their mission was to free Kasibba.",
      "Lucy Dunstan, from disability rights organisation Changing Our Lives, was appointed to be Kasibba's independent advocate and to build a compelling case for why it was safe for her to leave the hospital.",
      "But Kasibba's release could only be signed off by the Court of Protection, which makes decisions for people who do not have the mental capacity to make their own.",
      "Ms Dunstan said when she first met Kasibba, hospital staff simply introduced her as \"the eye-gouger\".",
      "She said she recalls looking at Kasibba through a small window in the door that kept her locked in. \"She was just lying on the the settee. It was a very empty room. Her life was completely impoverished,\" she said.",
      "It would be six years from first having met Kasibba before Ms Dunstan got a call to tell her that the Court of Protection had ruled she could leave hospital. \"I cried. Joy. Relief. Admiration for her. Pride,\" she said. \"It's not about me and what we did, but that she did it and she showed them.\"",
      "Now Kasibba lives in the community with the help of support workers, who engage with her and communicate with gentle touches, gestures and clear language. Her care manager said she loved fashion, was proud of her home and enjoyed social interaction.",
      "\"She has the most amazing sense of humour. She's a beautiful human being,\" the manager said. \"After about two weeks of working here she actually came up and gave me a hug. This is not an eye-gouger, you know.\"",
      "The Mental Health Bill going through parliament will mean autistic people and those with learning disabilities in England and Wales, who do not have a mental health condition, will no longer be able to be detained for treatment.",
      "But the government has said it will not bring in any changes until it is satisfied there is sufficient alternative support in the community. And it will still allow people to be detained in hospital legally for up to 28 days for assessment.",
      "Jess McGregor, executive director of adults and health at Camden Council, said it was a \"tragedy\" that Kasibba had spent most of her life held in hospital. \"I'm personally sorry,\" she said. \"She shouldn't have experienced what she did.\"",
      "The NHS mental health trust, which cannot be named to protect Kasibba's identity, said at no point had the care it delivered been brought into question and the service was rated as outstanding by the Care Quality Commission.",
      "The trust told File on 4 Investigates that anyone assessed as needing long-term segregation had a self-contained property with their own bedroom, bathroom, living room and garden.",
      "The trust said from 2010 it had been working with local authorities to put plans in place to support the discharge of all long-term residents to more appropriate care, where possible within the community, but said they were prevented from doing so by a legal case brought by the families of other patients.",
      "It said its staff had then worked tirelessly for years supporting local authorities to put the necessary support in place in the community and they were able to successfully close the service in 2023."

      "The proportion of both men and women living with these conditions has doubled since 1990.",
      "If trends continue, global rates of overweight and obese adults would rise to about 57.4% for men and 60.3% for women by 2050.",

      "The research was led by Prof Emmanuela Gakidou, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), at the University of Washington in the US.",
      "She said: \"[Governments] can use our country specific estimates on the stage, timing, and speed of current and forecasted transitions in weight to identify priority populations experiencing the greatest burdens of obesity who require immediate intervention and treatment, and those that remain predominantly overweight and should be primarily targeted with prevention strategies.",

      "The Covid inquiry has now opened four weeks of public hearings into the supply and distribution of \u00a315bn of PPE and other medical equipment in the pandemic.",
      "On February 27, Baroness Mone, Mr Barrowman and PPE Medpro wrote to the inquiry saying they had a significant role in proceedings and they \"may be subject to explicit and significant criticism\".",
      "They also argued they had concerns about the conduct of the NCA, which has been investigating PPE Medpro since May 2021.",

      "PPE Medpro was one of dozens of companies which won government contracts after being referred through the \"VIP lane\" - officially known as the high-priority lane.",
      "Introduced in April 2020, the idea was to fast-track offers to supply PPE if they came with a recommendation from ministers, MPs, members of the House of Lords or other senior officials.",
      "At the time the government said there was a \"desperate need\" to protect health and social care staff, and it was argued swift action was required to secure PPE.",
      "New research for the Covid inquiry found almost a third of government contracts to buy masks, gowns and other equipment had gone through the VIP lane.",
      "Data showed that, of the 430 offers made in that way, 115 were successful. Those firms were 17 times more likely to win a contract than those outside the VIP lane system.",
      "Peter Munro, policy manager at the UK Anti-Corruption Coalition, a group made up of procurement, transparency and contract specialists, said the latest data \"confirmed some of our worst fears\".",
      "\"PPE procured through the high priority lane was 80% more expensive than PPE procured through other channels, and half if it was unfit for purpose,\" he said."

    "story": [
      "The UK death rate reached a record low last year, according to exclusive analysis carried out for BBC News.",
      "Mortality experts looked at death certificates registered in 2024 and found that deaths per head of the population had returned to pre-pandemic levels and were slightly below the previous record in 2019.",
      "However, the new figure puts the UK back on its long-term trend of only gradual improvement.",
      "The research was carried out by analysts from the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) at the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.",
      "What's been happening to death rates?",
      "\"This is five years of basically flat mortality improvement, it's pretty poor by historical standards,\" said Stuart McDonald from the CMI.",
      "There was also a \"concerning\" rise in the death rate at young working ages, he said.",
      "A Department of Health spokesperson said the government was \"shifting focus from sickness to prevention\".",
      "The registered death rate in the UK steadily halved from 1974 to 2011 largely driven by improvements in tackling heart disease, including smoking prevention and medical advances.",
      "From 2011 to 2019 the improvements drastically slowed, then changed direction during Covid as thousands more people died than normal. The first post-pandemic year of 2022 also saw high numbers of extra deaths.",
      "To calculate the record low 2024 UK figure of 989 deaths per 100,000 people, analysts at the CMI used provisional weekly death registration figures for the four nations of the UK.",
      "\"Clearly, it's very good news that our mortality rate is lower in 2024 than it was,\" says Dr Veena Raleigh, epidemiologist at health think tank The King's Fund. \"But if you look at the broader canvas then it's not so good.\"",
      "Although similar countries also experienced a slowdown since 2011, the UK's has been more severe and our life expectancy is at the \"bottom of the pack of comparable countries,\" she says, adding that nations such as Spain returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023.",
      "Causes and risk factors",
      "Researchers point to a variety of reasons behind the slowdown since 2011. Some of the \"low hanging fruit\" of improvements in heart disease and cancer, such as the cut in smoking rates, had already happened, making further gains harder.",
      "At the same time, the UK saw rising risk factors, including obesity, poor diet and low levels of exercise, against a backdrop of widening social inequality and pressure on the NHS.",
      "Some academics argue that austerity cuts to public services after the 2008 financial crash had a strong impact on life expectancy, while others say it's not possible to prove this directly.",
      "Dementia and Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of death in England and Wales, according to the latest official figures. Heart disease, lung disease, strokes, lung cancer also feature highly, along with flu in some years.",
      "\"Cardiovascular disease remains a leading killer in the UK,\" said Prof Bryan Williams OBE, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation.",
      "\"The plateau we have seen in reducing the number of deaths... is a serious cause for concern, made worse by the impact of the pandemic on an already overstretched health service.\"",
      "He added that early deaths from cardiovascular disease had grown in the most deprived areas of England and called for \"urgent government action\" in its prevention, detection and treatment.",
      "Deaths at younger ages",
      "Overall death rates are largely a reflection of older people's health as more than three-quarters of UK deaths happen over the age of 70.",
      "So the main trend is driven by what is happening to people in this age group.",
      "But the CMI found \"really significant differences\" at younger ages says Stuart McDonald, with a \"concerning\" upward trend in mortality among 20-44-year-olds.",
      "\"For this age group, death rates have actually been going up slightly, even before the pandemic. If we go back to 2011 we can see a slight increase in death rates year-on-year.\"",
      "UK men and women can expect to live longer, data show",
      "Life expectancy is down but what does this mean?",
      "UK life expectancy progress 'has stopped'",
      "Death numbers among this age group are much lower than at older ages and the causes tend to be different. Fewer than 20,000 people aged 20-44 die in the UK each year, about 3% of all deaths.",
      "\"External and substance-related causes are most important because often that's what people die of in this age group,\" says Antonino Polizzi, researcher at the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"Things like drug overdoses, alcohol-related deaths, accidents, homicides and suicides.\"",
      "The UK, particularly Scotland, has seen a rise in drug-related death rates, he says.",
      "\"These causes are usually improving for other Western European countries so we are seeing a divergent effect.\"",
      "Commenting on the overall trends at all age groups, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We inherited an NHS that was broken and we are determined to fix it.",
      "\"Through our Plan for Change we are shifting focus from sickness to prevention and targeting the drivers of ill health and catching the biggest killers earlier.",
      "\"We are creating the first smoke free generation, stopping junk food ads being targeted at children and improving detection of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.\"",
      "About the data",
      "The CMI took weekly provisional death registration data from the Office for National Statistics, for England and Wales, National Records of Scotland and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and calculated the 2024 rate.",
      "The rate is age-standardised, which means that you can make comparisons with other years even though the UK population as a whole is getting older.",
      "Changes to the death registration process may mean that more 2024 deaths are registered in 2025 than was the case for the previous year, but the CMI says this is not the main explanation for the return to the pre-pandemic trend.",

    "story": [
      "Amanda Pritchard, head of NHS England, would have regular Monday meetings with Health Secretary Wes Streeting to review performance and address challenges. But last Monday was different. After discussing the state of the health service, she announced she was stepping down - with just one month's notice.",
      "It came as a shock to many in the organisation, under which there are 1.4 million staff who deal with 1.7 million patients every day. But those in the know had suspected something was happening - though not the timing.",
      "That meeting between Pritchard and Streeting was the natural conclusion of changes which had been rumbling on in the corridors of power for some time.",
      "NHS England was given autonomy by the then-Conservative Health Secretary Andrew Lansley in 2013. The aim was to free the organisation from interference by politicians.",
      "Under Sir Simon Stevens - now Lord Stevens - NHS England developed into what looked like a rival power base and led by an alternative health secretary. He was at the heart of work drawing up long-term NHS plans under David Cameron and Theresa May. Lord Stevens knew his way around Whitehall and knew how to win backroom battles with ministers.",
      "Amanda Pritchard had been deputy to Lord Stevens since 2019 and played a vital role in the NHS response to the pandemic, including the vaccine roll-out. It had seemed inevitable she would take over the top job in 2021. Understandably, she expected to continue in the same vein as her predecessor. But with the arrival of a Labour government last year that certainty began to weaken.",
      "The first clue that things would be going back to a more traditional management regime, with more direct government control, came when two health experts were appointed from previous Labour governments: Alan Milburn, Blair's health secretary, and Paul Corrigan, an adviser. It became clear that they would be involved in shaping policy with Wes Streeting.",
      "One well-placed health source said those two \"remembered the old days\", before the NHS's shift to autonomy, which they felt made the system \"too bureaucratic\".",
      "Another clue came when work began on a new NHS 10-year plan for England. With previous plans Lord Stevens had \"held the pen\", but this time the government brought in Sally Warren from the King's Fund think tank - outside NHS England management - to head up the work.",
      "At the same time, noises were being made about slimming down NHS England management - and instead devolving money to local health boards and patient services. Government sources deny that NHS England is being subsumed into the health department but say it will have a \"leaner\" role, cutting out duplication.",
      "Amanda Pritchard was well aware of the direction of travel. She could see that her job was going to change and had considered stepping down later this year. There has been no suggestion of any row or confrontation with Wes Streeting.",
      "NHS officials say that the decision to leave at the end of March was because it will be the end of a financial year - and there was no need to stay for the launch of the 10-year plan in the early summer.",
      "In January Ms Pritchard had a bruising experience at the hands of two parliamentary select committees. One suggested she and colleagues were \"complacent\" and another said they were disappointed with \"lengthy and diffuse answers\". In a BBC interview she admitted that \"we're not all brilliant performers at committee hearings\" but it was right to be scrutinised. Privately, according to sources, she found the process \"frustrating given how much time she had given to the role\" under some of the most difficult years in the history of the NHS.",
      "She will be replaced by Sir Jim Mackey, an experienced NHS trust boss, who is being titled the \"transition\" chief executive. Policy will be run by Wes Streeting's department with Sir Jim, we are told, focusing on delivery including cutting the hospital waiting list of nearly 7.5 million. He had recently helped draft a recovery plan for planned treatment and appointments.",

      "So where does all this leave the NHS?",
      "On one hand, Amanda Pritchard has provided consistent leadership in various roles under six different health secretaries. The autonomy of NHS England enabled its chief executive to bang the drum for the health service and pressure the government.",
      "But on the other hand, serious problems remain with patient outcomes and those closer to Streeting argue more direct government control means less bureaucracy, and the ability to free up resources to deploy where needed.",
      "One health source argued that the upcoming changes would end confusion over policy and strategy and encourage collaboration between ministers and NHS England - without being a formal takeover. But another suggested it was \"a bit of a mess\" and there could now be instability and distractions for NHS administrators when they need to focus on wider health challenges.",
      "Much will depend on how much money is allocated in the Treasury spending review.",

      "Mick had a major operation to treat pancreatic cancer in 2023. Diana wrote to BBC News explaining that it is impossible for Mick to digest food without creon. She says he was prescribed a high dose to enable him to regain weight after losing four stone in hospital, but it became increasingly difficult to get hold of the medicine.",

Her cancer is now in remission, but she is still reliant on the drug for her digestive system to work correctly.  She says there was no availability to get the medication within her county, and she had to get her mother-in-law to make a two-hour journey to a pharmacy in Crewe.",

    "summary": "King Charles has been a key part of efforts to maintain relationships with Trump and Zelensky.",
    "story": [
      "Before he came to the throne, the then Prince Charles had been challenged over whether he could avoid meddling and stay out of politics when he became King.",
      "Now King Charles seems to be in demand as never before to help out the politicians and to get involved, playing an unexpectedly pivotal role in dramatic times for international diplomacy.",
      "He met Canada's PM on Monday in the latest phase of this mixture of bridge building and fire-fighting.",
      "Last week an invitation from the King for a second state visit was offered to President Trump, with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer presenting it, with no shortage of flattery, as an \"unprecedented\" sign of friendship and respect.",
      "Then in the fallout of the disastrous Trump meeting with Zelensky in the White House, it was the King, as well as Sir Keir, who embraced the Ukrainian leader and offered a visible image of support for his embattled country.",
      "It was a vital element in the diplomatic balancing act taking place, as the UK government tries to shore up Western support for Ukraine, without alienating and aggravating the Trump administration in the US.",
      "It's placed the double act of King Charles and Sir Keir Starmer at the centre of some huge shifts in international relations.",
      "The King greeting President Zelensky so warmly and publicly, on a visit to Sandringham, was an important message of solidarity that he had not been abandoned and that there was still support for Ukraine, three years after it was invaded by Russia.",
      "With Trump's enthusiasm for the royals, and his evident keenness for a state visit, it provides a diplomatic bridge, with the King keeping open friendly channels with both Trump and Zelensky.",
      "Trump described the King as a \"beautiful man\", as he looked forward to the opulence of a state visit, with its carriage ride up the Mall and glittering banquet. Invitations for such visits are sent by the monarch, but the decisions on who gets invited are made in government.",
      "The King has decades of experience of getting along with people from remarkably different backgrounds and viewpoints. He seems to enjoy chatting to people, asking them about themselves, while saying little about his own views. He's also known generations of previous US leaders, all the way back to visiting Nixon in the White House and meeting Eisenhower at Balmoral.",
      "For King Charles, there has also been a very personal sense of support for Ukraine, he's been outspoken in a way that is unusual. He has attacked the \"indescribable aggression\" against Ukraine, in what he called an \"unprovoked attack on their land\".",
      "Soon after the invasion he went to see refugees arriving in Romania. On visits to France and Germany he singled out the importance of Western allies standing firm with Ukraine to protect democratic values.",
      "He's made repeated visits to meet the Ukrainian community in the UK and last month went to see a project providing medical assistance for injured Ukrainian military personnel.",
      "But these are complicated times for the monarch, not least because as well as being the UK's head of state, King Charles is also the head of state of Canada - and on Monday he faced a different set of agendas when he met Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
      "The words exchanged in those meetings are not revealed - but as well as discussing Ukraine, there would be no need to guess the other topic of conversation.",
      "\"Nothing seems more important to Canadians right now than standing up for our sovereignty and our independence as a nation,\" said Trudeau ahead of the meeting.",
      "Canada is facing President Trump's calls for his northern neighbour, and longstanding Nato ally, to become the 51st state of the US. This unsurprisingly has deeply angered and offended many Canadians.",
      "They might look to King Charles as their head of state, and head of the Commonwealth too, to strongly speak up for them and to rebuff such expansionist claims from the US president.",
      "Except that from a UK perspective, the King is being deployed to keep President Trump on board and to keep alive the \"special relationship\" between the US and UK. So there will be no appetite for a royal denunciation over Canada.",
      "Warm reception for Zelensky as he meets King at Sandringham",
      "Zelensky bruised but determined after diplomatic whirlwind",
      "Blue and yellow flowers as Queen meets Trudeau",
      "The BBC's Royal Watch newsletter has already had plenty of feedback from Canadians who are angry that the King has not spoken up for them against Trump.",
      "\"I am a 73-year-old proud Canadian and loyal royal supporter. Should the King choose a relationship with Trump over support of Canada, I will be changing my support to withdrawing from the Commonwealth,\" emailed Peggy.",
      "\"I realise the Royal Family don't usually get involved in politics, but this is different and at the moment many here are wondering why we have a King as head of state at all,\" Ann said in an email to the newsletter.",
      "\u200cIt won't be an easy balancing act, when so much of the King's diplomacy has to be in symbols as much as words. He has to speak on the advice of ministers, in Canada and the UK.",
      "It seems like a long time since one of the famous moments of unspoken royal commentary, when the late Queen Elizabeth II stood in front of a big bunch of flowers in the Ukrainian colours of blue and yellow, in the weeks after the Russian invasion.",
      "And who was she meeting? A popular young Canadian prime minister called Justin Trudeau. It was seen as a sign of Western solidarity to support Ukraine.",
      "Would anyone have believed three years later that he'd be seeking support against the United States?"

      "Sir Keir and his still new-ish government has had a bumpy start in many ways, but he has seized this crisis and is shaping events, alongside others, and seems possessed of a determination and clarity of mind about what he hopes to pull off.",
      "It is worth remembering two things right now: if a peace deal can be done, there are big implications for many families around the UK, including the deployment of soldiers and airmen and women to Ukraine -  a volatile, contested place that Russia has had designs on for decades.",
      "Their role would be peacekeepers, yes, but many would see them as being on the frontline of freedom.",
      "There may right now be widespread political support for this, but that does not diminish the magnitude of what would be asked of those sent there.",

    "story": [
      "International Development Minister Anneliese Dodds has resigned over the prime minister's cuts to the aid budget.",
      "In a letter to Sir Keir Starmer, Dodds said the cuts to international aid, announced earlier this week to fund an increase in defence spending, would \"remove food and healthcare from desperate people - deeply harming the UK's reputation\".",
      "She told the PM she had delayed her resignation until after his meeting with President Trump, saying it was \"imperative that you had a united cabinet behind you as you set off for Washington\".",
      "The Oxford East MP, who attended cabinet despite not being a cabinet minister, said it was with \"sadness\" that she was resigning.",
      "She said that while Sir Keir had been clear he was not \"ideologically opposed\" to international development, the cuts were \"being portrayed as following in President Trump's slipstream of cuts to USAID\".",
      "Ahead of his trip to meet the US president, Sir Keir announced aid funding would be reduced from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3% in 2027 in order to fund an increase in defence spending.",
      "In his reply to Dodds's resignation letter, the prime minister thanked the departing minister for her \"hard work, deep commitment and friendship\".",
      "He said cutting aid was a \"difficult and painful decision and not one I take lightly\" adding: \"We will do everything we can...to rebuild a capability on development.\"",
      "Baroness Chapman of Darlington, formerly a Labour MP, has been appointed to replace Dodds as international development minister.",

      "Starmer upends Labour manifesto to confront Europe's new reality",
      "Starmer cuts aid to fund increase in defence spending",
      "In her resignation letter, Dodds said she welcomed an increase to defence spending at a time when the post-war global order had \"come crashing down\".",
      "She added that she understood some of the increase might have to be paid for by cuts to ODA [overseas development assistance].",
      "However, she expressed disappointment that instead of discussing \"our fiscal rules and approach to taxation\", the prime minister had opted to allow the ODA to \"absorb the entire burden\".",
      "She said the cuts would \"likely lead to a UK pull-out from numerous African, Caribbean and Western Balkan nations - at a time when Russia has been aggressively increasing its global presence\".",
      "\"It will likely lead to withdrawal from regional banks and a reduced commitment to the World Bank; the UK being shut out of numerous multilateral bodies; and a reduced voice for the UK in the G7, G20 and in climate negotiations.\"",
      "The spending cuts mean \u00a36bn less will be spent on foreign aid each year. The aid budget is already used to pay for hotels for asylum seekers in the UK, meaning the actual amount spend on aid overseas will be around 0.15% of gross national income.",
      "The prime minister's decision to increase defence spending came ahead of his meeting in Washington - the US president has been critical of European countries for not spending enough on defence and instead relying on American military support.",
      "He welcomed the UK's commitment to spend more, but Sir Keir has been attacked by international development charities and some of his own MPs for the move.",
      "Dodds held off her announcement until the prime minister's return from Washington, in order not to overshadow the crucial visit, and it was clear she did not want to make things difficult for the prime minister.",
      "But other MPs have been uneasy about the decision, including Labour MP Sarah Champion, who chairs the international development committee, who said that cutting the aid budget to fund defence spending is a false economy that would \"only make the world less safe\".",
      "Labour MP Diane Abbott, who had been critical of the cuts earlier in the week, said it was \"shameful\" that other ministers had not resigned along with Dodds.",
      "Dodds's resignation also highlights that decisions the prime minister feels he has to take will be at odds with some of the views of Labour MPs, and those will add to tensions between the leadership and backbenchers.",

      "In a post on X, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: \"I disagree with the PM on many things but on reducing the foreign aid budget to fund UK defence? He's absolutely right.",
      "\"He may not be able to convince the ministers in his own cabinet, but on this subject, I will back him.\"",
      "However one of her backbenchers - and a former international development minister - Andrew Mitchell backed Dodds, accusing Labour of trying \"disgraceful and cynical actions\". \"Shame on them and kudos to a politician of decency and principle,\" he added.",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Dodds had done \"the right thing\" and urged the government to find alternative ways to pay for increases to defence spending.",
      "He suggested raising money through increases to the digital services tax or setting up a European rearmament bank, which would lend money to governments to buy military equipment or the private sector to expand their manufacturing capacity.",
      "Sir Ed argued that if the UK cut back on overseas aid, China and Russia would \"fill the vacuum\".",
      "Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said she was \"sorry to hear\" of Dodds's resignation.",
      "\"It is a really difficult decision that was made but it was absolutely right the PM and cabinet endorse the PM's actions to spend more money on defence,\" she said.",
      "Dodds first became a Labour MP in 2017 when she was elected to represent the Oxford East constituency.",
      "Under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party she served as a shadow Treasury minister and was promoted to shadow chancellor when Sir Keir took over.",
      "Following Labour's poor performance in the 2021 local elections, she was demoted to the women and equalities brief.",
      "Since July 2024, she has served as international development minister.",
      "Dodds becomes the fourth minister to leave Starmer's government, following Louise Haigh, Tulip Siddiq and Andrew Gwynne."

    "story": [
      "Keir Starmer has lost four senior ministers since coming to power last July.",
      "Although she was not a high profile minister, the departure of Anneliese Dodds is the most significant so far.",
      "She is the first to resign over policy.",
      "Although she says she will support the PM from the backbenches, her letter of resignation delivered a coruscating critique.",
      "She - along with most Labour MPs \u2013 recognises defence spending needs to rise, but she disagrees with how it is being funded.",
      "She suggests that Britain's reputation will be damaged - but she is also denting her leader's.",
      "In effect, she is saying he is being misleading over the effect of the cuts, which will \"remove food and healthcare from desperate people\".",
      "And that while he has made a tactical decision \u2013 essentially, using a defence spending hike to grease the wheels of his meeting with President Trump - she maintains that the PM has made a strategic error which could bolster Russia and China's global influence.",
      "Minister Anneliese Dodds quits over aid cuts",
      "Starmer cuts aid to fund increase in defence spending",
      "This is significant because Dodds is not a usual suspect when it comes to rebelling.",
      "She was initially appointed as Keir Starmer's shadow chancellor when he won the Labour leadership in 2020.",
      "At the time, she would have been something of a political soulmate, backing the policy positions he professed in the leadership contest.",
      "But she remained on the party's so-called 'soft Left' while Sir Keir moved away and strongly backed the approach of his next shadow chancellor \u2013 Rachel Reeves \u2013 and her \"iron clad\" fiscal rules.",
      "Tax and spending",
      "One of the least dramatically-phrased - but potentially most significant - lines in Dodds's resignation letter is when she suggests how more defence spending could be paid for.",
      "She called for a discussion on \"our fiscal rules and approach to taxation\" \u2013 in other words, a debate on tax and borrowing.",
      "Labour MPs have been remarkably disciplined in not publicly opposing policies which privately make them queasy, but there are fears of over forthcoming welfare cuts and there has been discontent over the winter fuel allowance, the two child benefit cap, and lack of compensation for Waspi women.",
      "So will Anneliese Dodds's resignation loosen the tongues of other discontented MPs?",
      "While it was widely expected that Keir Starmer would move robustly away from the politics and poses of the Corbyn years, some of the current contingent of MPs are concerned that he is moving away from commitments made by his predecessors  Tony Blair and Gordon Brown too.",
      "It was Blair who announced the move to the aid target of 0.7% of GDP \u2013 a commitment subsequently delivered by David Cameron despite an era of austerity.",
      "It was Brown who introduced a universal winter fuel payment for pensioners.",
      "For those Labour MPs who have the phrase \"I didn't come into politics to do this\" nagging sotto voce at their conscience, then Tory leader Kemi Badenoch's strong praise for their leader's aid cuts won't have made life any easier.",
      "But the prime minister has inherited a less benign economy than the last Labour government  \u2013 and arguably a more malign world, with 'peace dividends' firmly thrown into  the dustbin of history.",
      "In Keir Starmer's letter responding to Anneliese Dodds's resignation, the PM states that he made \"a difficult and painful decision\" and not one he took lightly.",
      "But it worth noting that it is a decision which is far from universally unpopular in Labour's ranks.",
      "Polling suggests that there is strong support amongst the wider electorate both for a rise in defence spending AND a cut in overseas aid.",
      "Many of the MPs in the so-called Red Wall - those seats lost to the Conservatives in the Midlands and Northern England in 2019 and regained in 2024 \u2013 have seen an increasing challenge from Nigel Farage's Reform UK.",
      "They want to see a greater emphasis on patriotism and a tougher line on immigration.",
      "So apparently putting Britain first \u2013 more spent on defence here, less spending overseas \u2013 will be seen by some as a way of inoculating themselves against the growing threat of Reform.",
      "But with more tough decisions ahead, the remarkable coalition assembled by Labour at the last general election will come under increasing pressure.",
      "Anneliese Dodds was the first to walk away from the top table over policy.",
      "Keir Starmer knows it's possible she won't be the last."

      "For select committees, political parties control the process and allocate seats in proportion to the size of each party's parliamentary intake.",
      "This means that the Labour Party gets the largest share of select committee seats, then the Conservatives, followed by the Liberal Democrats and so on.",
      "However, parties are able to voluntarily give up a seat for an independent MP or an MP from a different party, such as when the Green party's Caroline Lucas was given a spot on the Environmental Audit Committee from 2015 to 2024.",
      "All MPs can ask questions in the Commons chamber and participate in debates there and in Westminster Hall, as well as submitting written questions to ministers.",

      "Five of the independents - including Adam, Mohamed and former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - wrote to the Speaker in September announcing they were forming an \"independent alliance\" in Parliament.",
      "This is known as a technical grouping, differing from a political party as members are bound by shared interests and ideology rather than under an official organisation.",
      "This prompted the Procedure Committee to begin holding inquiries into the status of parliamentary groupings and independent MPs as a whole.",
      "A spokesperson for the Procedure Committee said: \"The Procedure Committee has undertaken an inquiry into the status of independent MPs in House procedures.",
      "\"The inquiry is still ongoing and the committee will report back with its proposals in due course.\""

    "story": [
      "Patients will be able to book more appointments online and request to see their usual doctor under a new contract agreed with England's GPs, the government has said.",
      "The deal gives an extra \u00a3889m a year to general practices, as well as a reduction in red tape and targets that ministers hope will mean doctors are freed up to see more patients.",
      "The Labour government made manifesto promises to bring back \"family\" doctors and end the early morning phone \"scramble\" for appointments.",
      "The doctors' union, the British Medical Association (BMA), says the deal is an important first step in restoring general practices.",
      "However, doctors also want the government to commit to talks about a completely new national contract for GPs within this parliament.",
      "GP surgeries are seen as the front door to the NHS but for years now, doctors have been warning about the pressure their service is under.",
      "Patients have felt it too, with some people facing long waits for appointments.",
      "Long waiting times for routine GP appointments have led to the now familiar \"8am scramble\" for a same-day appointment.",
      "Many GP surgeries open their telephone lines at 8am, meaning that if you want an on-the-day appointment, you have to phone on the dot at 8am.",
      "It is a frequent source of complaints from patients who often find themselves held in long queues, only to be told all the appointments have been booked up.",
      "Not all surgeries work like this though, with others operating telephone call-back services or online triage so that patients can be prioritised.",
      "The new contract\u00a0says patients should be able to arrange appointments online throughout working hours, freeing up the phones for those who need them most, and making it easier for practices to triage patients based on medical need.",
      "More money to cover rising costs",
      "The new agreement for the next 2025-26 financial year will see the total value of the contract grow by 7.2%.",
      "The total figure includes almost \u00a3800m to cover rising costs, such as staff wages, repairs and maintenance of buildings and more patients.",
      "Other measures include a greater flexibility for surgeries when it comes to employing different healthcare staff.",
      "GPs will get paid more to carry out routine childhood vaccinations.",
      "Through cutting what the government describes as \"box-ticking targets\", ministers say GPs will be freed up to take the first steps towards ending the \"8am scramble\" for an appointment.",
      "Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting says that these are the first steps in fixing what he describes as \"a broken NHS\".",
      "\"Over the past decade, funding for GPs has been cut relative to the rest of the NHS, while the number of targets for GPs has soared,\" he said.",
      "\"That's why patients are struggling to get an appointment.",
      "\"This government is cutting the red tape that ties up GPs' time and backing them with an extra \u00a3889m next year.",
      "\"In return, more patients will be able to request appointments online and see their regular doctor for each appointment.\"",
      "Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, who chairs the BMA GPs' committee, says this contract is a good start, but more work is needed.",
      "\"We have shown that we want to work in good faith with this government and build on this new beginning \u2013 what we now need is certainty about our collective future.",
      "\"We know the Treasury will be announcing its funding plans for this Parliament this spring, and we need to see a new substantive GP practice contract for England in the upcoming comprehensive spending review.\"",
      "Dr Bramall-Stainer told BBC Breakfast general practice had been pushed to \"desperation point\" over the last 15 years - with \"thousands\" of GPs leaving.",
      "She explained the \"first signs of green shoots\" patients might see following the new agreed measures would include being able to get to know their doctor and local staff and surgeries advertising for more staff.",
      "She indicated patients would \"potentially\" begin to notice a difference in six to 12 months but insisted that, although a step in the right direction, these new measures are \"nowhere near a solution\".",
      "Dr Steve Taylor, a locum GP in Manchester and spokesperson from the lobbying group Doctors' Association UK, said he fears much of the extra money will have to go towards national insurance contributions, staff and running costs.",
      "Dr Taylor said: \"The new GP contract goes a small way to fix some of the significant issues for GP practices, in that it prevents further declines in funding with a small percentage increase.\"",
      "But  a much larger investment will be needed to build for the future, he added.",
      "Dr Dean Eggitt, a GP in Doncaster and ex-executive member of the doctors' union, the BMA, said he was disappointed with the new contract.",
      "\"There is little in this contract that is going to help patients access care quicker than they do already because it hasn't managed to address the underlying issue of national insurance contributions and the vast sums of money that will need to go towards that,\" he added.",

      "\"It is good that an agreement has been reached. But a lot of work still needs to be done to improve the lives of patients, GPs and other primary care staff.",
      "\"The priority should be recruiting more nurses and GPs to help increase appointments,\" he said.",

      "The UK and France have already said they would be willing to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help deter Russian aggression.",
      "The European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said the purpose was to turn Ukraine into a \"steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders\".",

      "So a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards.",
      "But this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era.",
      "It is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trump's own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU.",
      "It is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table.",
      "In addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its \"Brexit reset\" - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.",

      "The narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\".",
      "Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here.",
      "This strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes.",
      "The UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces.",
      "While the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit.",
      "The White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago.",
      "Likewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues.",
      "This appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act.

      "The prize will be integration into the massive investments from the best capitalised tech companies in the world.",
      "Could the UK start to attract back some of the investments lost to Dublin, for example? Would the EU stand back and allow the UK to develop as an offshore hub for US tech companies to service the whole of Europe?",
      "There are two other significant issues. It is not unknown for warm words in the Oval Office to be somewhat contradicted by actions soon after. While sat next to the PM, President Trump described the EU's levying of VAT as a trade restriction, seemingly unaware that the UK does exactly the same thing.",
      "And even if it avoids direct new tariffs from President Trump, the open UK economy would be affected by any wide-ranging trade war involving most of the G7 and other countries.",
      "That is still on the cards. Not only would that collapse world growth and potentially spike up inflation again, but could upend entirely the workings of the World Trade Organization.",
      "The PM says the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and other allies, but it may appear like that to them.",
      "The strategy appears to be to become the Switzerland of global economics. Neutrality in a world of trade turmoil, not so much sat on a fence, but tiptoeing along a rather wobbly one."

      "UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has met US President Donald Trump during his first visit to the White House.",
      "Here are some of the key moments as the pair took questions from reporters before and after the talks.",
      "1. A surprise letter to Trump from King Charles",
      "Sir Keir did not turn up to the meeting empty-handed.",
      "Part-way through their opening remarks, the prime minister reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out an official letter from King Charles III - an invitation for a second state visit.",
      "Trump appeared to be genuinely taken back for a few seconds, asking: \"Am I supposed to read it right now?\"",
      "After taking a minute to read the letter, Trump said he accepted the invitation and that it would be an \"honour\" to visit the \"fantastic\" country.",
      "He added that King Charles was a \"beautiful man, a wonderful man\".",
      "Follow updates on the Starmer-Trump meeting",
      "Trump's letter from the King: What does it say and what does it mean?",
      "During Trump's first term as president, he met King Charles's mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, during a three-day state visit in 2019.",
      "Sir Keir said Thursday's invitation to host Trump once more for a second full state visit was \"unprecedented\".",
      "2. Trump wanted to take charge",
      "While cordial, the initial meeting in the Oval Office between Sir Keir and Trump left no doubt that the US president hoped to be firmly in charge.",
      "The meeting was a pattern we've now seen six times with foreign leaders at the Trump White House, including with French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this week: Trump taking control of the room and using the opportunity to get his own messages, both domestic and international, across to the reporters there.",
      "Analysis: Starmer charms Trump, but any deals will have to wait",
      "Analysis: Starmer charms Trump, but any deals will have to wait",
      "During their half-hour session, Trump leaned forward and slightly towards Sir Keir - wearing a nearly identical, but slightly different coloured tie to Trump's -  dominating the conversation and taking charge of calling on reporters.",
      "A joint afternoon news conference later began with a slightly more diplomatic and matter-of-fact tone, with both Trump and Sir Keir standing at their respective lecterns and going to considerable lengths to lavish praise on the other.",
      "Trump joked he would have been president 20 years ago with Sir Keir's \"beautiful\" accent.",
      "At one point, Sir Keir was asked about Trump's controversial call to make Canada \u2013 a member of the Commonwealth \u2013 the 51st state of the US.",
      "\"I think you're trying to find a divide that doesn't exist,\" Sir Keir replied.",
      "Trump interjected quickly with the words \"that's enough\" before moving on \u2013 again taking control of the room as he stood next to a visibly surprised Sir Keir.",
      "3. The similarities between Starmer and Trump",
      "To put it gently, Sir Keir and Trump are from different schools of politics - both in their style and substance.",
      "But asked to name their similarities Trump said: \"He loves his country, and so do I.\"",
      "What else do they share? Trump said: \"We like each other, frankly, and we like each other's country.\"",
      "But the \"common thread\" between the two men was that \"we love our country\", Trump said.",
      "4. Starmer a 'tough negotiator'",
      "Sir Keir had a number of tricky topics to raise with Trump - from trade to US security guarantees for Ukraine - and at the beginning of their news conference the president called his counterpart \"a very tough negotiator\".",
      "Asked if the prime minister had convinced him not to impose trade tariffs on the UK, Trump said \"he tried\", adding: \"He was working hard, I'll tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there.\"",
      "But he has said there was \"a very good chance\" of a trade deal \"where tariffs wouldn't be necessary\".",
      "Such a deal, Trump said, could be made \"pretty quickly\".",
      "Sir Keir spoke of a \"new economic deal with advanced technology at its core\".",
      "5. Trump 'minded' to accept UK's Chagos deal",
      "Trump said he was \"inclined to go along with\" the UK's Chagos Islands deal.",
      "The UK is in talks with Mauritius about handing over the territory but continuing to lease one of the islands, Diego Garcia, which contains a UK-US military airbase.",
      "The agreement has been mired in uncertainty after Trump's re-election as US president, given several US Republicans have argued it could deliver a potential security boost to China.",
      "But during the meeting, Trump said he had a \"feeling\" the deal was going to \"work out very well\".",
      "6. 'Did I say that?' Trump walks back comments on Zelensky",
      "Last week, Trump made headlines by calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a \"dictator\" in a social media post, echoing Russian claims about Kyiv's cancelled elections.",
      "An election was scheduled for May 2024, but it was suspended because Ukraine has been under martial law since Russia began its full-scale invasion.",
      "Asked by the BBC's Chris Mason about his use of the word \"dictator\", Trump replied: \"Did I say that? I can't believe I would say that.\"",
      "In the news conference later, Trump also appeared to have softened his attitude to Zelensky, praising him as \"very brave\" and saying the pair got on \"really well\".",
      "Talking about the potential for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, Trump said \"progress towards peace\" would continue when Zelensky visits the White House on Friday. The two are expected to sign a major minerals deal.",
      "7. Starmer hits back at free speech criticism",
      "At the Munich Security Conference last week, US Vice President JD Vance attacked the UK and other European democracies, warning that \"free speech is in retreat.\"",
      "Asked about the comments, Trump called on his deputy to defend himself. Vance argued \"there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British\" but also \"American technology companies and by extension, American citizens\".",
      "That led to Sir Keir cutting in, saying \"we've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom - and it will last for a very, very long time\".",
      "He rejected Vance's claim, saying \"in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there\".",

      "It's unclear what, if any, role Donald Trump's administration may have played in their release, but one of Trump's top envoys is said to have raised the case with Romania's Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu at a security conference in Munich earlier this month.",
      "Andrew Tate rose to fame after appearing on the UK reality show Big Brother, and later making a series of extreme and controversial statements about women and politics on social media.",
      "The pair ran a webcam business and were charged with human trafficking and rape along with two Romanian female suspects in June 2023.",
      "They also face separate, unrelated allegations of rape and human trafficking in the UK, and civil suits in the US and UK. They deny all the allegations, which their US lawyer calls \"defamatory and unequivocally false\".",
      "On Thursday the brothers arrived in Florida after previously being banned from leaving Romania while the case against them is pending.",
      "Lawyers for the pair say they will return to Bucharest for court hearings.",
      "What is the White House saying?",
      "When asked about the Tates at the White House on Thursday, President Trump said: \"I know nothing about that.\"",
      "But the brothers have been the subject of recent high-level discussions between the US and Romania.",
      "Romanian officials say US counterparts brought up the brothers' case with the Romanian government earlier this month, a story first reported by the Financial Times.",
      "And Trump special envoy Richard Grenell raised the issue again at a security conference in Munich.",

      "Ingrassia also acted as Tate's publicist and says he got the influencer onto a show hosted by Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host.",
      "He has praised Tate in online posts. In one dating from July 2023, he called Tate \"an extraordinary human being\" who was offering \"a dying West some hope for renewal\".",
      "Ingrassia did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.",
      "The Tates have also been talked about by several people in Trump's orbit, including Donald Trump Jr and Elon Musk.",
      "Trump Jr once called Tate's detention in Romania \"absolute insanity\".",
      "Musk reinstated Andrew Tate's account, which had been banned on X, and suggested, perhaps in jest, that Tate would make a good UK prime minister.",
      "Joseph McBride, a lawyer representing the Tates in a defamation case they have filed against several of their accusers in Florida, said in a statement: \"They feel secure in America for several reasons, the primary one being that Donald Trump is the president.\"",
      "The statement alleged that the Tates and others are victims of \"weaponised legal systems\" and \"politically motivated prosecutions\".",
      "McBride did not respond to questions on whether White House officials played any role in the removal of travel restrictions against the Tate brothers.",
      "The 'manosphere'",
      "Trump and his advisers know the political power of the manosphere \u2013 a popular and very online subculture that attracts fans of mixed martial arts fighting, video games, cryptocurrencies and other stereotypically male pursuits.",
      "It's a sprawling scene that includes men who reject the company of women entirely, a \"pick-up artist\" scene filled with tips on how to find casual hookups, and plenty of mainstream podcasts and YouTube channels filled with bro-type humour.",
      "The president's advisers targeted the same audiences during last year's election campaign, when Trump, JD Vance and others in his orbit went on podcasts and did interviews with new media outlets.",
      "The views of the Tate brothers lie at one of the manosphere's extreme edges. Andrew Tate himself has made no secret of his self-described misogynist \u2013 women-hating \u2013 and sexist views.",
      "On podcasts and online clips he talks about how women are property, how men shouldn't allow girlfriends to go out without them or talk to other men.",
      "In extremely graphic language, he's described violence against women and talked about how sexual assault victims bear responsibility for rape.",
      "Tate and his brother at the same time sell a glamorous lifestyle of expensive properties, cigars and luxury cars that includes self-improvement messages directed at young men - an image that garnered him a large audience before he was booted off most mainstream social media platforms.",
      "He told the BBC in a 2023 interview: \"I preach hard work, discipline. I'm an athlete, I preach anti-drugs, I preach religion, I preach no alcohol, I preach no knife crime. Every single problem with modern society I'm against.\"",

      "Trump supporters split",
      "The pair's supporters were thrilled with his release and eager to proclaim their innocence, despite the outstanding charges against them.",
      "Four British women who have filed a civil lawsuit against Andrew Tate meanwhile issued a statement calling on UK authorities to \"take action\", saying they were \"in disbelief and feel re-traumatised by the news\".",
      "And support for the Tates is far from universal among Trump supporters and American conservatives, many of whom moved to immediately distance themselves from the brothers.",
      "Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, where Tates landed on Thursday, said of their activities: \"Florida is not a place where you're welcome with that type of conduct.\"",
      "The state's attorney general later said he would open a preliminary inquiry into the Tates and said Florida has \"zero tolerance for human trafficking and violence against women\".",
      "In the conservative Washington Examiner, podcaster Brady Leonard wrote: \"Tate's obnoxious, misogynistic brand is toxic to everyone besides electorally insignificant corners of social media.\"",
      "Matt Lewis, a US conservative political commentator who has been critical of Trump in the past, said advocating on behalf of Tate \"fits in with the ethos of the Maga world right now, which is: 'let's be tough guys'\".",
      "\"But I also think it speaks to a legitimate problem, which we have seen in the last couple decades, a problem with men...where there's an epidemic of loneliness, a sense the world is passing them by, a sense that modernity has made it harder to be successful as a husband and a father.

      "\"England.\"",
      "\"Hope you enjoy Estelle,\" he says.",
      "\"Do you?\" I ask.",

      "Welcome to the Estelle Supermax Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas.",
      "Concrete watchtowers punctuate the perimeter of this vast space - equivalent in size to almost 3,000 football pitches - and a sign with an image of a red-maned lion and the words Stay Hungry - Feast on Success greets staff and visitors as they enter.",
      "The UK government is looking to Estelle prison for ideas - for ways to reduce reoffending and to bring down prisoner numbers in our already overcrowded jails. There's a scheme here they'd like to emulate, which gives inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by having a job while they're inside.",
      "Looking to this prison for inspiration might seem a curious choice to many, given Texas executes more people than any other US state. But ministers say by implementing schemes similar to ones used here, UK prisoners will be incentivised to gain qualifications - giving them more chance of employment once released.",
      "Just one in five offenders in England and Wales has a job six weeks after being released from custody, the latest stats show. According to the Ministry of Justice, people who are still unemployed six weeks after being released are twice as likely to reoffend as those in employment.",
      "No prison in the UK has as many inmates as they do at Estelle. More than 3,000 men in white jail-suits are currently locked up here - from murderers and rapists, to those doing time for lesser crimes like shoplifting and fraud. Two inmates are on death row.",
      "Jimmy Delgado is 52 and serving three life sentences for first-degree murder. He's already been inside for 25 years - 13 spent in solitary confinement. He's a large man with muscular shoulders and smiles broadly when we meet in the prison chapel, softly shaking my hand. He tells me he first ended up in prison aged just 16, after carrying out a robbery.",
      "He's remorseful for his crimes and says this prison - together with his faith in Jesus - has helped turn his life around by giving him purpose. He now works as a counsellor, supporting offenders who are struggling to cope with life in prison.",
      "\"I'm here for taking a life - and I'm here to save multiple lives,\" he says. \"If I can change the dynamic of family life for all these guys that are here then I've done my job - even if I never get out of prison.\"",
      "Delgado may never be released, but inmates having jobs in prison is one of the reasons why Estelle Supermax Penitentiary is appealing to the UK government.",
      "The \"good time credit\" scheme used here gives inmates the opportunity to reduce their time behind bars by participating in courses and studying for qualifications, taking up jobs, and behaving well.",
      "Credits earned are then added to the number of days the prisoner has already spent in jail, allowing them to reach their parole eligibility date sooner - when a panel decides if they're suitable for early release. This process depends on the classification of their crime and an assessment by the parole board on their overall rehabilitation.",
      "Off the long corridor that runs through the main prison building, inmates are quietly working in a small barbers. Kevin Smith is inside for minor offences. He is meticulously cutting a member of staff's hair with a pair of clippers, and says the good time credit scheme has made him feel positive about his time in prison.",
      "\"They helped me see that if I do the right thing and make the right decisions, I can do better in life,\" he says. \"I receive good time by working here, and I can get out earlier with the good time that I received - it works.\"",
      "The rates of those returning to prison within three years of release have fallen to 20.3% in Texas - a fraction of those in the rest of the United States (68%).",
      "The BBC came to Estelle to see their credit scheme in action with UK justice secretary Shabana Mahmood.",
      "\"The Texans had a system similar to ours - on the point of collapse, running out of prison places in 2007,\" Ms Mahmood says. \"They've now got a sustainable prison population - but most importantly, they've been able to massively cut the rates of reoffending here. They've got a rate of crime now that they haven't seen since the 1960s.\"",
      "She believes the Texan credit system is effective - helping prisoners get out of prison early - and stay out. \"It does help prisoners turn their backs on a life of crime.\"",
      "The Texas prison population is the highest of any state in the US, with 134,668 people in custody in the autumn of 2024 - although over the last couple of decades, since reforms were implemented, that number has reduced by nearly 20%. However, some experts say the good time credit programme is not a magic bullet.",
      "\"The incentivisation scheme has little to do with the reforms that helped bring Texas's prison population down in 2007,\" says Michele Deitch, a criminal justice policy lecturer at the University of Texas. \"And by itself it will do little to address the UK's very serious overcrowding problem.\"",
      "What would make a real difference, she says, would be diverting more people from incarceration in the first place: \"To shorten sentences, to reduce the use of recalls to prison, and to invest more heavily in rehabilitative programs in prison and in programs and services in the community.\"",
      "As well as incentivisation, the UK government is also considering the use of \"diversion programmes\" - where offenders are sent on rehabilitation courses rather than to jail. This can apply to people with addiction issues or mental health problems. It's what they do here in Texas to reduce the burden on the courts and attempt to sort the root cause of the offence.",
      "Violence, overcrowding, self-harm: BBC goes inside one of Britain\u2019s most dangerous prisons",

      "More people have been put to death in Texas than anywhere else in the US. Since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, 593 prisoners have been executed. There are 176 people currently on death row - so it might seem strange the UK government could take a leaf out of their book.",
      "Even so, the justice secretary believes there is still much the UK can learn from what happens at Estelle.",
      "\"I don't think that the fact that they have the death penalty here means that we shouldn't be learning lessons from strategies that they've introduced that really work,\" Ms Mahmood says.",
      "It's a plan with \"huge potential in the UK\" according to Nick Hardwick, a former chief inspector of prisons, who believes it will make prisons safer and more productive.",
      "\"It will help ensure prisoners are doing what is necessary to reduce the risk they will reoffend and create more victims,\" he says.",

      "\"Prison is a punishment - you should do your time,\" she says. \"It needs to be a deterrent - you're there because you did something wrong.\"",
      "It's clear the UK needs to find solutions to cut prison overcrowding \u2013 and find them fast. Even the recent prisoner early release scheme will barely keep pace with more offenders being jailed. New prison buildings will take years to come on stream. But does this Texan prison have the answers?",

    "summary": "Sir Keir Starmer's meeting with the US president comes at a pivotal moment for Europe, our political editor writes.",
    "story": [
      "A big moment and a big decision, ahead of a big meeting.",
      "The government's announcement that it will crank up defence spending and shrivel the international aid budget amounts to a big shift in strategy, posture and political positioning.",
      "Take a look at the Labour Party's election manifesto, written less than a year ago, if you would like proof of that.",
      "On page 125, it says: \"Labour is committed to restoring development spending at the level of 0.7 per cent of gross national income as soon as fiscal circumstances allow.\"",
      "The party is now committing to doing the precise opposite \u2013 cutting development spending by the same amount by which it had promised to raise it.",
      "There is nothing like an outspoken American president and an imminent visit to the White House to sharpen the mind \u2013 and hey presto, along came this announcement just as the prime minister packs his shirts for his trip across the Atlantic.",
      "Along came the thumbs-up from the Trump administration not long later.",
      "But it is also true that there has been a growing recognition for some time and across several parties that more money had to be spent on defence.",
      "The prime minister has taken to recalling how the Berlin Wall coming down made him feel. \"It felt as if we were casting off the shackles of history, a continent united by freedom and democracy,\" as he puts it - contrasting that with the reality of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "A wider critique along these lines has been crystallising for some time: the sense that the 1990s were a holiday from history, as Jonathan Freedland called it, and that the end of the Cold War had created a peace dividend where defence budgets could atrophy and the money could be spent on hospitals and schools, for instance.",
      "Instead, not only is there war in Europe, there is an occupant of the White House with seemingly little regard for the American security umbrella this continent has relied upon since World War Two.",
      "Little wonder, then, that we have seen a blitz of the jitters in European capitals as presidents and prime ministers try to work out what it may or may not mean.",
      "The task facing Starmer - the second strand of the European tag team of leaders to visit Washington, after President Emmanuel Macron on Monday - is to attempt to mould President Donald Trump's position.",
      "Over the coming weeks and months, can a deal be done where the war stops, Ukraine does not feel defeated, Europe does not feel imperilled and transatlantic relations are as near to conventional as possible?",
      "It is not going to be easy.",
      "The prime minister's trip to the White House is but one building block in developing answers to these questions.",
      "And then, over the following weekend, Starmer will host a gathering of European leaders to reflect on where the conversations so far have taken us.",
      "President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected in Washington soon too.",

    "summary": "The iceberg appears to be stuck and may start breaking up near the island of South Georgia.",
    "story": [
      "The world's largest iceberg has run aground in shallow waters off the remote British island of South Georgia, home to millions of penguins and seals.",
      "The iceberg, which is about twice the size of Greater London, appears to be stuck and should start breaking up on the island's south-west shores.",
      "Fisherman fear they will be forced to battle with vast chunks of ice, and it could affect some macaroni penguins feeding in the area.",
      "But scientists in Antarctica say that huge amounts of nutrients are locked inside the ice, and that as it melts, it could create an explosion of life in the ocean.",
      "\"It's like dropping a nutrient bomb into the middle of an empty desert,\" says Prof Nadine Johnston from British Antarctic Survey.",
      "Ecologist Mark Belchier who advises the South Georgia government said: \"If it breaks up, the resulting icebergs are likely to present a hazard to vessels as they move in the local currents and could restrict vessels' access to local fishing grounds.\"",
      "The stranding is the latest twist in an almost 40-year story that began when the mega chunk of ice broke off the Filchner\u2013Ronne Ice Shelf in 1986.",
      "We have tracked its route on satellite pictures since December when it finally broke free after being trapped in an ocean vortex.",
      "As it moved north through warmer waters nicknamed iceberg alley, it remained remarkably intact. For a few days, it even appeared to spin on the spot, before speeding up in mid-February travelling at about 20 miles (30km) a day.",
      "\"The future of all icebergs is that they will die. It's very surprising to see that A23a has lasted this long and only lost about a quarter of its area,\" said Prof Huw Griffiths, speaking to BBC News from the Sir David Attenborough polar research ship currently in Antarctica.",
      "On Saturday the 300m tall ice colossus struck the shallow continental shelf about 50 miles (80km) from land and now appears to be firmly lodged.",
      "\"It's probably going to stay more or less where it is, until chunks break off,\" says Prof Andrew Meijers from British Antarctic Survey.",
      "It is showing advancing signs of decay. Once 3,900 sq km (1,500 sq miles) in size, it has been steadily shrinking, shedding huge amounts of water as it moves into warmer seas. It is now an estimated 3,234 sq km.",
      "\"Instead of a big, sheer pristine box of ice, you can see caverns under the edges,\" Prof Meijers says.",
      "Tides will now be lifting it up and down, and where it is touching the continental shelf, it will grind backwards and forwards, eroding the rock and ice.",
      "\"If the ice underneath is rotten - eroded by salt - it'll crumble away under stress and maybe drift somewhere more shallow,\" says Prof Meijers.",
      "But where the ice is touching the shelf, there are thousands of tiny creatures like coral, sea slugs and sponge.",
      "\"Their entire universe is being bulldozed by a massive slab of ice scraping along the sea floor,\" says Prof Griffiths.",
      "That is catastrophic in the short-term for these species, but he says that it is a natural part of the life cycle in the region.",
      "\"Where it is destroying something in one place, it's providing nutrients and food in other places,\" he adds.",
      "There had been fears for the islands' larger creatures. In 2004 an iceberg in a different area called the Ross Sea affected the breeding success of penguins, leading to a spike in deaths.",
      "But experts now think that most of South Georgia's birds and animals will escape that fate.",
      "Some Macaroni penguins that forage on the shelf where the iceberg is stuck could be affected, says Peter Fretwell at the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "The iceberg melts freshwater into salt water, reducing the amount of food including krill (a small crustacean) that penguins eat.",
      "The birds could move to other feeding grounds, he explains, but that would put them in competition with other creatures.",
      "The ice could block harbours or disrupt sailing when the fishing season starts in April.",
      "\"We will have to do battle with A23a for sure,\" says Andrew Newman from Argos Froyanes.",
      "But scientists working in Antarctica currently are also discovering the incredible contributions that icebergs make to ocean life.",
      "Prof Griffiths and Prof Johnston are working on the Sir David Attenborough ship collecting evidence of what their team believe is a huge flow of nutrients from ice in Antarctica across Earth.",
      "Particles and nutrients from around the world get trapped into the ice, which is then slowly released into the ocean, the scientists explain.",

      "How mega icebergs change the ocean",
      "\"Without ice, we wouldn't have these ecosystems. They are some of the most productive in the world, and support huge numbers of species and individual animals, and feed the biggest animals in the world like the blue whale,\" says Prof Griffiths.",
      "A sign that this nutrient release has started around A23a will be when vast phytoplankton blooms blossom around the iceberg. It would look like a vast green halo around the ice, visible from satellite pictures over the next weeks and months.",
      "The life cycle of icebergs is a natural process, but climate change is expected to create more icebergs as Antarctica warms and becomes more unstable.",

      "More than 150 members of the UK's Royal Society have urged the elite scientific academy to \"step up its efforts to advocate for science and scientists\" amid a row over one of is fellows - Elon Musk.",
      "Over the last nine months, many scientists have raised concerns about the controversial billionaire's behaviour, which has been called a \"threat to science\".",
      "The meeting on Monday evening did not result in his expulsion, but it has drawn the world's oldest scientific academy into a divisive, political row.",
      "The campaign to revoke Mr Musk's membership centres on suggestions, from a growing number of fellows, that the billionaire's actions are \"incompatible\" with the society's own code of conduct.",
      "Mr Musk has overseen unprecedented funding cuts to scientific research in the US, in his senior role in President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (or Doge), Mr Musk.",
      "He has also been accused of sharing misinformation on his social media platform, X.",
      "In a statement after the meeting, the Royal Society addressed those issues, saying  that members who attended were particularly concerned about the fate of scientists in the US, \"amid threats of radical cutbacks in research funding\".",
      "The Society agreed to \"look at potential further actions\" to \"counter the misinformation and ideologically motivated attacks on both science and scientists\".",

      "It is 250 years since a member of the Royal Society was ejected: German scientist and writer Rudolf Erich Raspe, who was accused of theft and fraud.",
      "So the rift among the membership, caused by Mr Musk and his public pronouncements, could be a historic turning point for this most elite of scientific academies.",
      "Two eminent scientists have resigned their fellowships in protest - Dr Dorothy Bishop of Oxford University and Prof Andrew Millar from University of Edinburgh.",
      "More than than 3,300 scientists also put their names to a letter, written by Prof Stephen Curry, emeritus professor of structural biology at Imperial College London, who is not a fellow, that expressed \"deep concern\" about the billionaire's fellowship and the society's \"continued silence and apparent inaction\" with regard to the controversy.",
      "\"As a private individual, he is free to say what he likes, but as a member of this club, he has a responsibility to promote excellence and promote the pursuit of truth,\" Prof Curry told the BBC.",
      "Prof Curry has not called for Mr Musk's removal explicitly but has said that a more open debate needs to be held.",
      "Dr Dorothy Bishop, emeritus professor of development neuropsychology at Oxford University and the first fellow to resign over the issue, told BBC News she had complained to the Royal Society twice last year.",
      "\"On both occasions they consulted lawyers, and it may well be the case that the lawyers are concerned about the prospect of legal action,\" she said.",
      "There are more than 1,700 fellows of the Royal Society and more than 60 of them have signed Prof Curry's letter. Many more have expressed their concern about Mr Musk's behaviour.",
      "But there are many academics, researchers and Royal Society fellows who do not wish to see the divisive billionaire have his membership revoked.",
      "Nobel prize-winner Prof Sir Andre Geim from Manchester University said: \"Musk is certainly an eccentric, but his achievements beat those of any of his critics in the Royal Society. Very few can say that they achieved similar in their lives.\"",
      "Other scientists who spoke to the BBC pointed out that an attempt to remove Mr Musk's fellowship could be seen as political interference and a curtailment of freedom of expression.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:01:51 GMT",
    "summary": "From handheld to space-based, new methane detectors are making it easier to track the greenhouse gas.",
    "story": [
      "In and around Washington DC, volunteers and activists have been walking through streets and homes to see how healthy the air is.",
      "They're armed with industry-grade monitors that detect the presence of several gases. The devices look a bit like walkie-talkies.",
      "But they are equipped with sensors that reveal the extent of methane, turning this invisible gas into concrete numbers on a screen.",
      "Those numbers can be worrying. In a 25-hour period, neighbourhood researchers found 13 outdoor methane leaks at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit. They have also found methane leaks within homes.",
      "A key concern has been health. Methane and other gases, notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves, are linked to higher risks of asthma.",
      "Djamila Bah, a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organisation Action in Montgomery, reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organisation.",
      "\"It's very heartbreaking and alarming when you're doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they can't change for now,\" Ms Bah says.",
      "Methane might be a hazard to human health, but it is also powerful greenhouse gas.",
      "While it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one-quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialisation.",
      "Methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors. Chief among these are fossil fuels, waste and agriculture.",
      "But methane is not always easy to notice.",
      "It can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers. It can also be visualised using infrared cameras, as methane absorbs infrared light.",
      "Monitoring can be ground-based, including vehicle-mounted devices, or aerial, including drone-based measurement. Combining technologies is especially helpful.",
      "\"There is no perfect solution,\" says Andreea Calcan, a programme management officer at the International Methane Emissions Observatory, a UN initiative.",
      "There are trade-offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis, which could extend to thousands of facilities.",
      "Thankfully, she has seen an expansion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade. So there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane, at any scale. And the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high-emitting events, she says.",
      "At a larger scale, satellites are often good at pinpointing super-emitters: less frequent but massively emitting events, such as huge oil and gas leaks. Or they can detect the smaller and more spread-out emitters that are much more common, such as cattle farms.",
      "Current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter, says Riley Duren, the CEO of the Carbon Mapper, a not-for-profit organisation that tracks emissions.",
      "He likens this to film cameras. A telephoto lens offers higher resolution, while a wide-angle lens allows a larger field of view.",
      "With a new satellite, Carbon Mapper is focusing on high resolution, high sensitivity and rapid detection, to more precisely detect emissions from super-emitters. In August 2024 Carbon Mapper launched the Tanager-1 satellite, together with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Earth imaging company Planet Labs.",
      "Satellites have struggled to spot methane emissions in certain environments, such as poorly maintained oil wells in snowy areas with lots of vegetation. Low light, high latitudes, mountains and offshore areas also present challenges.",
      "Mr Duren says that the high-resolution Tanager-1 can respond to some of these challenges, for instance by essentially sneaking peeks through gaps in cloud cover or forest cover.",
      "\"In an oil and gas field, high resolution could be the difference between isolating the methane emissions from an oil well head from an adjacent pipeline,\" he says. This could help determine exactly who is responsible.",
      "Carbon Mapper began releasing emissions data, drawing on Tanager-1 observations, in November.",
      "It will take several years to build out the full constellation of satellites, which will depend on funding.",
      "Tanager-1 isn't the only new satellite with a focus on delivering methane data. MethaneSAT, a project of the Environmental Defense Fund and private and public partners, also launched in 2024.",
      "With the increasing sophistication of all these satellite technologies, \"What was previously unseeable is now visible,\" Mr Duren says. \"As a society we're still learning about our true methane footprint.\"",
      "It's clear that better information is needed about methane emissions. Some energy companies have sought to evade methane detection by using \"enclosed combustors\" to obscure gas flaring.",
      "Translating knowledge into action isn't always straightforward. Methane levels continue to rise, even as the information available does as well.",
      "For instance, the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) uses satellite data to detect methane emissions notify companies and governments. The MARS team gathered a large quantity of methane plume images, verified by humans, to train a machine learning model to recognise such plumes.",
      "In all the locations that MARS constantly monitors, based on their history of emissions, the model checks for a methane plume every day. Analysts then scrutinise any alerts.",
      "Because there are so many locations to be monitored, \"this saves us a lot of time,\" says Itziar Irakulis Loitxate, the remote sensing lead for the International Methane Emissions Observatory, which is responsible for MARS.",
      "In the two years since its launch, MARS has sent out over 1,200 alerts for major methane leaks. Only 1% of those have led to responses.",
      "However, Ms Irakulis remains optimistic. Some of those alerts led to direct action such as repairs, including cases where emissions ceased even though the oil and gas operator didn't officially provide feedback.",
      "And communications are improving all the time, Ms Irakulis says. \"I have hope that this 1%, we will see it grow a lot in the next year.\"",
      "At the community level, it's been powerful for residents, such as those in the Washington DC area, to take the air pollution readings themselves and use these to counter misinformation. \"Now that we know better, we can do better,\" says Joelle Novey of Interfaith Power and Light.",

    "story": [
      "From dazzling costumes to exuberant parties, Trinidad's carnival is often dubbed \"the greatest show on Earth\".",
      "But some of its elements are not exactly eco-friendly and the festivities are estimated to produce 3.4 tonnes of waste every year according to Carnicycle, a local initiative aiming to make festivities more sustainable.",
      "Danii McLetchie, who co-founded Carnicycle in 2018, says that while carnival \"is a big part of our culture\" it also has a very negative environmental impact \"from the events, to the textiles, to costumes\" used by the masqueraders, spectators and vendors taking part in the annual parade on the two days preceding Ash Wednesday.",
      "Producing and transporting just a single carnival costume bra can generate approximately 37.68kg (83lb) of CO2 emissions, Carnicycle estimates based on calculations made using an online tool provided by Swedish tech company Doconomy.",
      "Danii and her team are working to have that estimate verified by a third party, but with tens of thousands of masqueraders parading every year, she says the amount of emissions is cause for concern.",
      "To reduce those emissions, Carnicycle has started a recycling programme, collecting unused costumes that would have been dumped or burned by masquerade bands, which use new costume designs every year.",
      "Carnicycle also puts up collection bins at hotels and other venues so discarded costumes can be reused.",
      "\"Up until last year we collected around 10,000 pieces of costume materials,\" Danii told the BBC, describing the arduous task of completely stripping down truckloads of costumes to preserve feathers, beads and other materials for future use.",
      "The salvaged materials are sold to costume designers, ravers, and people in the burlesque industry, who save by buying second hand.",
      "Carnicycle also rents out the large backpack pieces which are a popular part of the costumes worn at Trinidad's carnival. Their price can run up to $700 (\u00a3550), depending on size.",
      "Danii explains that they came up with the idea after hearing revellers complain not just about the expense but also about the weight of the backpack pieces. \"'I'm paying this much money but then it's heavy and by the time it's lunch I just want to throw it away',\" Danni recalls people saying.",
      "Carnicycle rents the backpacks to masqueraders long enough so that they can pose for photos, but are freed from carrying their load during the parade.",
      "Danii and Carnicycle's co-founder Luke Harris \u2013 who both hold down full-time jobs in addition to their environmental initiative - are not the only ones dedicating their spare time to making Trinidad's carnival both fun and eco-friendly",
      "Lawyer Aliyah Clarke and fashion designer Kaleen Sanois started a side business called 2nd Closet - a pop-up thrift shop where people can buy and sell pre-owned clothing.",
      "The two have also been making video tutorials with tips on how to transform costumes into beachwear and outfits for other occasions.",
      "Aliya told the BBC it was something she first did for herself: \"After I was finished with my costume I would rip it apart, literally down to the wire, and figure out how to make this into something else to wear outside of carnival.\"",
      "Now she is sharing her ideas in a video segment the two millennials have dubbed \"Tipsy Tuesday\".",
      "They also offer a closet-sorting service, which involves coming to a person's home and sorting through unwanted clothing, to rescue items fit for sale at their pop-up thrift shop.",
      "In what Kaleen believes is a testament to the work they have been doing, they were asked to sort the sprawling closet of Machel Montano, a musician known as the \"King of Soca\" and a superstar in the carnival world.",
      "\"Clothes are personal things, especially for somebody like Machel who has so many big moments tied to his pieces,\" Kaleen explains.",
      "After sorting through Machel's shoes and clothes, 2nd Closet organised a two-day pop-up shop, giving people a chance to buy items worn by Machel on stage and in his music videos.",
      "\"People came with pictures, and were like 'I'm looking for this piece',\" Aliyah recalls of fans' enthusiasm for the second-hand items.",
      "But costumes and outfits are not the only items being recycled to make Trinidad's festivities more environmentally friendly.",
      "At Fete with the Saints, a party many regard as one of the best of Trinidad's carnival, food is eaten with biodegradable wooden cutlery and the drinks are poured into reusable cups.",
      "The organisers of the fete -  a fundraiser for one of Trinidad and Tobago's top secondary schools \u2013 also hire \"bin detectives\" to ensure patrons properly sort and dispose their rubbish for recycling.",
      "It is estimated that this year the bin detectives helped to more than double the amount of recyclables captured, compared with the two previous years combined.",
      "\"Over the past three years we've actually prevented over one million single-use plastics from entering the landfill, I think maybe over five tonnes of glass,\" says Vandana Mangroo, co-founder of Close the Loop Caribbean, a company which started working with the organisers of Fete with the Saints in 2023 to make the event more sustainable.",
      "Joseph Hadad, co-chairman of the party's organising committee, says that those behind the event knew that their efforts to make it greener would \"add some layer of costs and more labour\". But he is adamant \"it worked\" and insists that the party spirit has not been dampened.",

    "summary": "How a new atomic clock might be the way to tackle attacks on plane GPS systems",
    "story": [
      "As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion.",
      "The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by \"GPS signal interference\".",
      "This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank \u2013 though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory.",
      "The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill.",
      "To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are.",
      "Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks.",
      "The potential cost of losing GPS has been put at \u00a31.4bn each day \u2013 no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats.",
      "With this in mind, a group of British scientists \u2013 dubbed the \"Time Lords\" \u2013 has been asked to come up with a solution.",
      "The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself \u2013 all within a few years.",
      "In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking \u2013 and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent.",
      "A new way of measuring time",
      "The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration.",
      "Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem \u2013 and the impact could be at least as transformative.",
      "\"History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,\" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London.",
      "In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation.",
      "The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation.",
      "The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison.",
      "But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices.",
      "\"We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,\" he says. \"So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced.\"",
      "The 'Time Lords'",
      "Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the \"Time Lords\" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium.",
      "GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab.",
      "The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves.",
      "When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis.",
      "\"The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,\" she tells BBC News.",
      "The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time.",
      "Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over \u2013 though that would take longer. \"To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,\" says Prof Paul.",
      "Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. \"The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,\" he says. \"There is no guarantee GPS \u2026 will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it.\"",
      "While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on board carried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as \"further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum\". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and \"the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged\".",
      "By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming.",
      "But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes.",
      "Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, \"where there's a bit more space\".",
      "Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around \u00a3100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems.",
      "GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons.",
      "\"We are harnessing atoms,\" she points out.",
      "\"You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed\".",
      "Atomic clocks in our pockets",
      "The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones.",
      "This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going.",
      "QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone.",
      "That process isn't going to happen soon, though. \"This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,\" says Prof Paul.",
      "Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship \u2013 his greatest difficulty was to make it small.",

      "Three years on, Ukraine's extinction nightmare has returned",
      "Race policies or Israel - what's really driving Trump's fury with South Africa?",
      "But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea.",
      "\"Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,\" says another DSTL scientist.",
      "\"As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity.\"",
      "Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong.",
      "Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough?",
      "One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy \u2013 transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.",

      "Wikie, 23, and her 11-year-old son Keijo are still being kept at Marineland Antibes, located in southern France, after it closed in January due to a forthcoming law banning the use of orcas in shows.",
      "For months managers at Marineland have tried to send the killer whales to other marine zoos but this has angered animal rights campaigners who want them housed in a sanctuary, where the orcas won't have to perform or be used for breeding.",
      "The orcas were expected to go to another marine zoo in Spain when the French government rejected a move to a proposed sanctuary in Canada a few weeks ago.",
      "But now Agne\u0300s Pannier-Runacher, the French ecology minister, said she would speak to colleagues in Spain, Italy and Greece about creating a different sanctuary together. However, her proposal has few other details and has been criticised.",
      "'Humans are all they know' - Fate of whales uncertain as marine zoo shuts",
      "France bans captive breeding of dolphins",
      "The ecology ministry, when asked by the BBC, had no further information on where a sanctuary might be located or who would fund its construction and running costs.",
      "Loro Parque, a marine zoo in Spain that wants to receive the killer whales from Marineland, told the BBC this week the current proposal was \"wholly unsuitable\" and that they were best positioned to care for them.",
      "Christoph Kiessling, vice-president of the facility in Tenerife, said whale sanctuaries were \"currently unable to meet the complex physiological, social and environmental needs\" of killer whales.",
      "Most designs involve cordoning off a bay and employing staff to ensure Wikie and Keijo - who were born in captivity and cannot be released into the wild - are properly fed and looked after.",
      "Kiessling did say such a solution might be possible if there was more extensive research and planning but \"such a process could take years, leaving the two Marineland [orcas] in a facility that is being wound down\".",
      "Campaigners point out that several orcas have died at Loro Parque in the last few years, including three between March 2021 and September 2022.",
      "Managers at the marine zoo said scientific examination of those orcas by the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria showed the deaths were unavoidable.",
      "They also fear Wikie might be used for breeding. Loro Parque announced in January that Morgan, the only female of the three orcas currently kept there, is pregnant.",
      "Katheryn Wise, from the charity World Animal Protection, said Loro Parque was ultimately an entertainment business that used orcas to make money.",
      "She added: \"Morgan's pregnancy underlines the fact that Loro Parque could never be a suitable option for Wikie and Keijo and should be removed as an option.\"",
      "Marineland, who are still paying to look after the orcas, said a move to Loro Parque as soon as possible was in the best interests of the animals' welfare. They have asked the ecology ministry to approve the transfer.",
      "'The water is too warm for orcas'",
      "The whale sanctuary in Canada applied to the French government to take in the orcas last year but their bid was rejected in January.",
      "They were told the site they had selected in Nova Scotia was too far away and that the water there was too cold for Wikie and Keijo, who have spent their whole lives in southern France.",
      "Following Pannier-Runacher's proposal for a sanctuary in Europe, which she announced a fortnight ago in a video on Instagram, the directors of the rejected Canadian project criticised the idea of one being built in the Mediterranean.",
      "They wrote a letter to her in which they cited Dr David Perpi\u00f1\u00e1n, a diplomate at the European College of Zoological Medicine, who said: \"Wikie and Keijo's origin is Iceland. These two orcas do not belong to the ecotypes seen in the Mediterranean.\"",
      "He added: \"The possibility of building a sanctuary for them in the Mediterranean is probably the worst of the possible options.\"",
      "The directors also said, unlike the European proposal, their sanctuary was ready to begin construction as the design had already been finalised.",
      "Other animal rights groups have been more welcoming of Pannier-Runacher's announcement, saying a European sanctuary would still be better for the orcas' welfare than life in another marine zoo.",
      "Sea Shepherd, a marine conservation society, replied to the minister on Instagram saying this was a chance to achieve what the zoo industry calls \"impossible\" - the building of an ocean sanctuary where captive orcas can enjoy the rest of their lives.",
      "Pannier-Runacher said in her video she was keenly aware of the strong feelings people had about where Wikie and Keijo should be rehomed.",
      "She did not rule out sending them to Loro Parque or other marine zoos, only that she would \"oppose any transfer to a site that is not suitable for accommodating\" orcas.",
      "Last November she blocked an application by Marineland to send the killer whales to a marine zoo in Japan, citing lower animal welfare regulations in the country.",
      "The 'Year of the Sea' is currently underway in France, a government initiative to raise awareness about the importance of the ocean, and Pannier-Runacher believes the creation of a European whale sanctuary would be a fitting testament to it.",

      "Beavers will be released into the wild in England after the government approved their reintroduction.",
      "The decision follows years of trials and will see beavers make an officially approved return to waterways.",
      "Hunted to extinction in Britain four hundred years ago, beavers have in the last two decades been making a comeback.",
      "But some farmers are concerned that without proper management the large rodents could have negative impacts on food production.",
      "It's thought that about five hundred beavers already live in England, some in the wild and others in enclosures. Many more are in Scotland, where wild releases are already permitted.",
      "Conservationists call beavers \"ecosystem engineers\" because of how they redesign where they live. The dams they build slow the flow of rivers and streams and create habitats where other creatures can thrive. They've also been credited with reducing flooding further downstream.",
      "\"This is an incredibly exciting moment, a real landmark for nature recovery in England,\" Tony Juniper, the head of Natural England, told me next to a beaver dam in Devon.",
      "\"We're bringing back a missing animal that's been absent for centuries, and an animal that we know will bring huge benefits for the rest of the wildlife that is already depleted across much of England,\" he says.",
      "The beavers will be released under a licensing system overseen by Natural England.",
      "It says long term plans will need to be in place to avoid impacts on farming, food production and infrastructure.",
      "That's something the National Farmers Union say is vital. It wants culling beavers  to be an option if they prove disruptive.",
      "NFU Deputy President David Exwood said that while beavers could provide certain benefits, \"we are concerned about the negative impacts beavers can have on productive farmland, as well as the management requirements, costs and risks involved\".",
      "\"Beavers can flood and waterlog fields, feed on agricultural crops like maize, as well as damage and fell trees such as cricket bat willow.\"",
      "We met up with Tony Juniper of Natural England at the site of the pilot project for wild beaver release in England, the River Otter catchment in Devon. Beavers first appeared here more than a decade ago - it's not clear where they came from. They may have escaped from enclosures or have been illegally released, so called \"beaver bombing\".",
      "Since then the wild beavers have been allowed to stay, with their impact on the landscape and the way they interact with local farmland closely monitored.",
      "\"All of this open water is down to the beavers,\" Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust tells me as we splash our way through the boggy land.",
      "\"They want this water because it makes them feel safe and secure. It means that they can transport their food as well.\"",
      "Along the River Otter Mr Burgess tells me the beavers have created wetlands that now host species such as great white egrets and kingfishers. Dragonfly numbers have soared as have frogs and toads. Water voles now roam the network of channels, streams, and ponds the beavers use to navigate the flood plain.",
      "Not everyone in the area is delighted by the thought of beaver dams popping up everywhere.",
      "Clinton Devon Estates manage several farms in the Devon catchment area where the trial wild beaver project has been running. Though broadly supportive of the beavers' return there are concerns about whether enough thought has been given to managing their impacts.",
      "\"We've also seen farmland flooded, we've seen properties flooded. We've seen people's trees in their gardens felled,\" says John Varley, the chief executive of Clinton Devon Estates.",
      "\"There are positives with the beaver, huge positives, but there's also some quite significant negatives, particularly for small farmers.\"",
      "Scotland is several years ahead of England and has already approved the release of beavers and it's thought there are now more than 1,500 living wild. In some areas the beavers have been so successful at breeding that they have had to be relocated or as a last resort culled.",
      "The first wild release of beavers in England is now expected to take place in the next few days. Dr Roisin Campbell-Palmer from the Beaver Trust, which is managing the release, told the BBC the male and female had been taken from \"conflict sites\" in Scotland and were now undergoing medical checks ahead of being moved south.",

    "story": [
      "Nearly 2,000 years after a young man died in the Vesuvius volcanic eruption, scientists have discovered that his brain was preserved when it turned to glass in an extremely hot cloud of ash.",
      "Researchers found the glass in 2020 and speculated that it was a fossilised brain but did not know how it had formed.",
      "The pea-sized chunks of black glass were found inside the skull of the victim, aged about 20, who died when the volcano erupted in 79 AD near modern-day Naples.",
      "Scientists now believe a cloud of ash as hot as 510C enveloped the brain then very quickly cooled down, transforming the organ into glass.",
      "It is the only known case of human tissue - or any organic material - turning to glass naturally.",
      "\"We believe that the very specific conditions that we have reconstructed for the vitrification [the process of something turning into glass] of the brain make it very difficult for there to be other similar remains, although it is not impossible,\" Prof Guido Giordano from Universit\u00e0 Roma Tre told BBC News.",
      "\"This is a unique finding,\" he said.",
      "The brain belonged to a man killed in his bed inside a building called the Collegium on the main street of the Roman city Herculaneum.",
      "The fragments of glass found by the scientists range from 1-2 cm to just few millimetres in size.",
      "The massive eruption of Vesuvius engulfed Herculaneum and nearby Pompeii where up to 20,000 people lived. The remains of about 1,500 people have been found.",
      "Scientists now think the hot ash cloud descended from Vesuvius first, probably causing most of the deaths.",
      "A fast-moving current of hot gas and volcanic matter, also called a pyroclastic flow, followed, burying the area.",
      "Experts believe the ash cloud turned the man's brain into glass because the pyroclastic flow would not have reached high enough temperatures or cooled quickly enough.",
      "The process of glass formation requires very specific temperature conditions and rarely occurs naturally.",
      "For a substance to turn to glass, there must be a huge temperature difference between the substance and its surrounding.",
      "Its liquid form has to cool fast enough not to crystallise when it becomes solid, and it must be at a much higher temperature than its surroundings.",
      "The team used imaging with x-rays and electron microscopy to conclude that the brain must have been heated to at least 510C before cooling rapidly.",
      "No other parts of the man's body are believed to have turned to glass.",
      "Only material containing some liquid can turn to glass, meaning that the bones could not have vitrified.",
      "Other soft tissues, like organs, were likely destroyed by the heat before they could cool down enough to turn to glass.",
      "The scientists believe the skull gave some protection to the brain.",

    "story": [
      "Four in five cars should be electric and half of homes should have heat pumps within 15 years, say the government's independent climate advisers.",
      "By law the UK must reach \"net zero\" - no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - by 2050.",
      "UK greenhouse gas emissions have more than halved since 1990, largely thanks to less electricity coming from fossil fuels and more from renewables. But the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says that to reach the 2050 target we will also need to change how we drive and heat our homes.",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the government would consider the advice and respond in due course.",
      "\"We owe it to current generations to seize the opportunities for energy security and lower bills, and we owe it to future generations to tackle the existential climate crisis,\" he said.",
      "Under UK law, the CCC provides independent advice on how much the UK should emit over five-year periods, known as \"carbon budgets\", and how it might get there.",
      "Each carbon budget is a stepping stone to net zero by 2050. The latest advice is that by 2040, emissions should be 13% of their 1990 levels, for the UK to stay on track.",
      "The CCC advice is not policy, but the government has historically accepted it. If it does, the target will become legally binding, but government will still decide how to achieve it.",
      "Meeting these long-term goals will mean significant changes in the years ahead. One-third of emissions cuts between now and 2040 need to come from households making low-carbon choices, the CCC says.",
      "This will mainly be through switching from petrol and diesel cars to electric vehicles and from fossil fuel boilers to heat pumps, making use of growing supplies of clean electricity. Smaller contributions will come from other choices, such as eating less meat and dairy.",
      "As the graph below shows, these changes are ambitious. But they are deliverable, argues the CCC, without people having to scrap their existing boiler or car early.",
      "Other emerging technologies, like mobile phones and internet connections, have achieved similar rates of increases previously.",
      "\"For electric vehicles, the market is already pretty much at parity with internal combustion engine vehicles, so we think just naturally that will start to be a choice people make,\" Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of the CCC, told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"For heat pumps, we're saying it's different, the costs are still higher than a fossil fuel boiler and the government will need to act to help people get those technologies.",
      "\"But the rollout rate that we've looked at is similar to what happened to our neighbours in Ireland but also to much colder countries in Europe.\"",
      "Emissions cuts will be needed in other areas too, such as farming and flying, two of the hardest sectors to decarbonise.",
      "The CCC no longer directly advises against net airport expansion, which it has previously. But it warns the costs of decarbonising aviation will need to be picked up by airlines, which will probably drive up ticket prices.",
      "It says we will need to eat less meat and dairy too. In the CCC's pathway, sheep and cattle numbers fall by 27% by 2040, and the area covered by woodland rises from 13% to 16%.",
      "Cost of net zero",
      "The costs of tackling climate change have become highly politicised in recent years.",
      "The CCC estimates most of the expense will be borne by the private sector and calculates the savings from moving to more efficient technologies should outweigh costs by the early 2040s.",
      "\"We are crystal clear in this analysis, in this carbon budget, for the first time we start to see the economy making savings from this investment, and they make savings over and above what we would do if we stay dependent on fossil fuels,\" Ms Pinchbeck told BBC News.",
      "This should improve energy security and filter down to lower bills in the long term, the CCC argues, provided the government acts to make electricity cheaper.",
      "It advises removing policy costs \u2013 funding for social and environmental schemes \u2013 from electricity bills. That would cut them by about 19% based on expected 2025 prices, the CCC says, making it more cost-effective for people to switch to electric vehicles or heat pumps.",
      "These costs could instead sit on gas bills or general taxation.",
      "\"Regardless of what you think about climate change, what we are laying out today is a massive industrial revolution,\" said Ms Pinchbeck.",

      "The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.",

      "The four candidates were debating with each other but they often presented a united front against their shared opponent, Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party is favoured in the polls as the most likely to form Canada's next government.",
      "Liberal leadership hopefuls threw several jabs at Poilievre throughout the debate. Gould called him \"our little version of Trump here at home\" while Freeland said Poilievre was looking to \"imitate\" Trump.",
      "Carney criticised Poilievre as \"irresponsible\" and added that Canada could \"not afford\" to have him as prime minister.",
      "Poilievre, who has enjoyed a sizable lead in the polls ahead of an unpopular Trudeau, has had to pivot his pitch to Canadians since Trudeau's resignation.",
      "His message changed from criticising the sitting prime minister for leading a \"broken\" Canada to putting \"Canada First\" in the face of threats from the US. He has also shifted his focus to attacking Carney, who is favoured to win the Liberal leadership race.",
      "Poilievre is still polling ahead nationally, but some polls suggest that the lead between him and the Liberals has shrunk since Trudeau's exit.",
      "Supporting Ukraine and Nato",
      "Responding to shifting US policy on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, all four candidates affirmed their commitment to continuing Canada's support for Ukraine.",
      "All of them also backed the need for Canada to hit its 2% military spending target as set out in its commitments to the Nato alliance, though they disagreed on the timeline and how to get there.",
      "Freeland said Canada should hit the target by 2027, and should do so by investing in the \"next generation of warfare\". Baylis and Carney have said their plan would be for Canada to reach that target by 2030.",
      "Both Freeland and Carney said Canada needed to invest that money into Canadian military ventures instead of into the US.",
      "Freeland noted that Canada should reduce its reliance on the US, and should look to work with the EU and other Nato partners on security assurances.",

      "A tax on carbon for consumers and businesses has been the cornerstone of the Trudeau government's policy on climate change.",
      "But that tax has proven to be unpopular with Canadians, forcing Carney and Freeland to promise that they would ditch the policy.",
      "Carney, a former UN special envoy on climate action and finance, has long been a proponent of the carbon tax. In the debates, however, he acknowledged the tax on consumers had become divisive, and said he would instead focus on taxing big polluters and growing clean energy projects in Canada.",
      "Freeland, who resigned from Trudeau's government because of disagreements with the prime minister on spending, said that history would judge his climate action favourably despite his policies' unpopularity. But she, too, vowed to scrap the carbon tax.",
      "\"Democracy is about listening to people, and Canadians were very clear with us that they did not think that policy worked for them,\" she said.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2025 13:29:51 GMT",
    "summary": "The prototype chip it dubs Ocelot follows similar announcements by Microsoft and Google",
    "story": [
      "Amazon has become the third tech giant in as many months to announce a breakthrough in quantum computing - a technology that promises vast processing power but is beset by technical difficulties.",
      "The firm has unveiled Ocelot a prototype chip built on \"cat qubit\" technology - an approach that derives its name from the famous \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\" thought experiment.",
      "The chip seeks to address one of the biggest stumbling blocks to the development of quantum computers - making them error free.",
      "Amazon says, taken alongside other recent breakthroughs in the industry, its work means useful quantum computers are likely to be with us sooner than previously thought.",
      "But how quickly these machines will be powerful enough to be practically useful for a range of commercial applications is a matter of debate among experts.",
      "Oskar Painter of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Center for Quantum Computing at the California Institute of Technology, where the work was carried out, told the BBC that recent progress meant an \"aggressive date\" of a decade was now \"looking more and more realistic\".",
      "\"Five years ago I would have said maybe 20 or 30 years\", he said but added \"this timeline's come in quite a bit.\"",
      "Ultimately AWS, which provides cloud computing services, would like to offer quantum computing services to its customers, but Mr Painter also said he believed the advanced machines could eventually help optimise the vast global logistics of Amazon's retail business.",
      "\"You know, a company like Amazon, you make a one percent improvement in that and you're talking large dollars right? Quantum computers could enable you to do that more effectively, more real time - and that's the real value there,\" he explained.",
      "What is a cat qubit?",
      "Quantum computers solve problems by exploiting the strange properties of matter and energy at very small scales, as described by the science of quantum physics.",
      "Quantum computers won't replace so-called \"classical\" computers, but promise to be able to solve problems even the most powerful modern computers cannot - yielding new discoveries such as better batteries and new medicines.",
      "But that potential is being held up by the problem of errors.",
      "Quantum computers are extremely sensitive to noise in their environment - vibrations, heat, electromagnetic interference from mobile phones and WIFI networks, or even cosmic rays and radiation from outer space can all cause them to make errors, which then need to be corrected.",
      "Cat qubits are one attempt at solving this problem by engineering error resistance into the design of the qubits it uses.",
      "Qubits are the fundamental elements of quantum computers, the equivalent of bits in the computers most of us use today.",
      "Cat qubits are named in honour of Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, whose cat-in-a-box question in 1935 helped illuminate some of the thinking behind quantum theory.",
      "Amazon believes the new chip, which has just five cat qubits out of a total of 14 key components, could reduce the costs of correcting quantum errors by up to 90%, compared to current approaches.",
      "The technology of cat qubits isn't exclusive to Amazon, a French company named Alice & Bob carried out pioneering work on the tech and continues to evolve the technology.",
      "Mazyar Mirrahimi director of research at the French national technology research institute, Inria said Ocelot was \"an important step forward towards hardware-efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation\".",
      "Amazon believes the new chip offers a path to scaling up to more powerful machines with this type of error proofing built in, but researchers admit there are many challenges ahead.",
      "Michael Cuthbert director of the UK's National Quantum Computing Centre welcomed the progress Amazon had made but told the BBC it remained to be seen the effect it would have on the speed with which the industry is able to develop really useful quantum computers:",
      "\"Error correction is a vital step necessary in the long-term development of quantum computing. It is the crucial step that turns quantum computing into a practical and commercial tool we can use to solve complex problems in chemistry, materials science, medicine, logistics and energy.\"",
      "\"Part of the challenge is how to scale the revolutionary technology efficiently \u2013 mechanisms that enable error correction without huge overheads in chip size, energy consumption and systems complexity are really welcome.\"",
      "Amazon researchers have published their findings in a research paper in the scientific journal Nature",
      "Pivot point",
      "Amazon joins Microsoft and Google in announcing a new experimental chip. But is this flurry of announcements the result of clever research or clever PR? Or is it  coincidence, the tech equivalent of the saying buses always come in threes?",
      "Heather West follows the quantum computing industry as a research manager for the International Data Corporation and was briefed on the new chip by Amazon in advance of publication.",
      "She describes Amazon's results as an \"advancement\" rather than a breakthrough.",
      "All three recent announcements have focused on reducing errors, and she tells me the industry is \"pivoting\" from a focus on the number of qubits to a focus the \"ability to use these these systems at scale to solve real world life problems. And by doing so we need to be able to solve the error correction within the quantum systems\".",
      "However Mr Painter agreed \"100%\" that it wouldn't be easy to scale up today's experimental systems.",

      "In the US, it will be available from March, with other countries getting it later in 2025.",
      "It will be available on devices as far back as the second generation Echo Dot, which launched in 2017.",
      "For its devices with screens, it will be available as far back as the first generation Echo Show 8, which launched in 2019.",
      "It is clear that Amazon expects Alexa+ to do more than its predecessor - and know much more about its users' lives.",
      "Mara Segal, director of Alexa, said people will now be able to share \"just about anything\" with the virtual assistant - the idea being that by sharing emails and photographs, it will be able to search through them for things you request.",
      "Other demonstrations included using it to book a taxi and a dinner reservation at a restaurant.",
      "Thomas Husson, principal analyst at Forrester, said the relaunch was a tacit admission by Amazon that its original vision for smart speakers had failed.",
      "\"By subsidising hundreds of millions of Echo connected speakers, Alexa managed to enter households in the hope of generating incremental e-commerce sales,\" he said.",
      "\"This strategy failed and the company invested $25 billion (\u00a320bn) in its Alexa division, without truly revolutionizing smart homes.\"",
      "He said it was \"about time\" Amazon created a \"truly smart and useful assistant\".",
      "But he warned that to \"truly differentiate\" itself, Alexa would need to distinguish between personal and household data, which \"equals a big privacy and trust hurdle\".",
      "And Dr Stuart Millar, lead AI engineer at Rapid7, said the move \"makes sense\" as Alexa has \"lagged behind\" competitors such as ChatGPT - but warned the real test will be when regular people get their hands on it.",
      "\"We've seen big tech companies launch ambitious AI features before, only to backtrack when unexpected issues arise, or it hasn't behaved as expected,\" he said."

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 00:06:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Ireland is investing billions of euros to revamp its healthcare service - will AI help?",
    "story": [
      "For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology.",
      "They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics.",
      "In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E.",
      "Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online.",
      "But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare.",
      "That includes a programme called Sl\u00e1intecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its \u20ac22.9bn (\u00a320bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.",
      "To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved.",
      "It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department.",
      "That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen.",
      "\"In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,\" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.",
      "Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.",
      "To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: \"We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures.\"",
      "The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.",
      "\"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,\" he says.",
      "Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges.",
      "Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends.",
      "Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.",
      "But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a \"synthetic MRI\" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.",
      "That was done by feeding a \"generative AI\" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.",
      "Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.",
      "And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.",
      "Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.",
      "But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.",
      "That will \"severely delay\" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.",
      "Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.",
      "\"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,\" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.",
      "\"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,\" he says.",
      "Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.",
      "An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.",
      "But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.",
      "To prevent such AI from hallucinating, \"you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,\" says Prof MacMahon.",
      "AIs can have biases, but \"humans have biases too\", he points out.",
      "A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.",
      "\"For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error\", than in new health technology where \"the acceptable risk is zero\", says Prof Se\u00e1n Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "This means we \"continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans\", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.",
      "Healthcare regulators, who already have a \"weak enough\" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.",
      "For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.",
      "But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. \"For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,\" he points out.",
      "AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.",
      "That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.",
      "When AI influences their decisions, doctors need to \"be able to articulate the reasoning behind those decisions in a manner that is accessible and understandable to those affected,\" he says.",

    "story": [
      "Stock markets around the world fell following the introduction of tariffs by President Donald Trump on goods entering the US from China, Canada and Mexico.",
      "Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, and 20% tariffs against China.",
      "Canada and China announced their own import taxes on US goods, while Mexico said it had \"contingency plans\", sparking fears of full-blown trade war.",
      "The three major stock market indexes in the US sank following the news, while the FTSE\u00a0100\u00a0index of the UK's biggest publicly-listed companies opened sharply lower on\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0and stock markets in Asia were also down.",
      "Analysts have warned tariffs could push up prices for US households and could also have a knock on effect on consumers across the world, including the UK.",
      "'We'll fight to the bitter end': China hits back at Trump tariffs",
      "Trump threatened to impose the tariffs, which are a tax added to a product when it enters a country - on Canada, Mexico and China in response to what claims is the unacceptable flow of illegal drugs and illegal immigrants into the US.",
      "But Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country was responsible for less than 1% of fentanyl entering the US and would retaliate with 25% tariffs on $150bn worth of US goods.",
      "\"There is no justification for [the US's] actions...Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,\" Trudeau said in a statement on Monday.",
      "He said Canada would first target $30bn worth of products, and target the remaining $125bn over 21 days.",
      "Any fresh duties Canada imposes will be in place \"until the US trade action is withdrawn\", he said, adding that his country would pursue \"non-tariff measures\" should US tariffs not cease - without specifying what those measures were.",
      "'Trade war'",
      "China swiftly announced its own counter measures, which include 10-15% tariffs on some US agricultural goods, including wheat, corn, beef and soybeans. China is the US's biggest buyer of these goods.",
      "\"If the United States... persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end,\" foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.",
      "Before the US tariffs on Mexican imports came into force, President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country had contingency plans.",
      "\"In this situation, we need composure, serenity, and patience. We have Plan A, Plan B, Plan C, and even Plan D,\" she said.",
      "Sheinbaum said she would speak more about Mexico's response on Tuesday.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Six things that could get more expensive for Americans under Trump tariffs",
      "In the US, the Dow Jones closed 1.5% lower and the S&P 500 ended the day down 1.8% on Monday, while in Asia on Tuesday, the Nikkei 225 dropped 1.2% and China's Hang Seng Index was down 0.3%.",
      "London's FTSE 100 was lower in early trading while the main stock exchanges in Germany and France also dipped.",
      "Trump has argued tariffs will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs, as well as raising tax revenues and grow the economy.",
      "However, such measures can have detrimental effects on both consumers and businesses - including the ones they set out to protect.",
      "Shoppers can be the ones who bear the bulk of tariffs in the form of higher prices, if they're passed on, as well as less choice.",
      "Meanwhile, tariffs tend to trigger retaliation from targeted countries, disadvantaging domestic businesses looking to export goods, meaning the measures can ultimately hold back trade, jobs being created and economic growth.",
      "'Global economic risks'",
      "Goods worth some $2bn cross the borders of the US, Canada and Mexico each day and their economies are deeply integrated.",
      "With the introduction of tariffs on that cross-border trade, companies importing goods might decide to pass on some or all of the extra costs onto consumers by putting prices up.",
      "They could also reduce imports, which would mean fewer products and therefore higher demand, which could also push up prices.",
      "Andrew Wilson, from the International Chamber of Commerce, said: \"What we're seeing is the biggest effective increase in US tariffs since the 1940s - with severe economic risks attached to that.\"",
      "\"The initial market moves are entirely reflective that we're now entering into a very risky scenario for global trade and for the global economy,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme",
      "He said Yale University had predicted these measures could cost US households in the region of $2,000 in this year alone.",
      "Price rises",
      "Analysis from TD Economics has suggested cars could go up in price by about $3,000.",
      "That is because parts cross the US, Canadian and Mexican borders multiple times before a vehicle is assembled.",
      "American consumers could also see the price of avocados go up as Mexican avocados make up nearly 90% of the US avocado market each year.",
      "Canada's billion-dollar maple syrup industry accounts for 75% of the world's entire maple syrup production so US households could see prices for the sweet treat rise too.",
      "Ella Hoxha, head of fixed income at Newton Investment Management, told the BBC: \"In terms of consumers, you're more likely looking at, certainly over the short term, increases in prices as companies pass some of those prices onto the consumer.\"",
      "Chris Torrens, vice president of the British Chamber of Commerce in China, added: \"It's a huge challenge for British business because of the historical links that the UK and the US have. [We are] Seeing what looks like the dismantling of a transatlantic alliance between the US and Europe.",
      "\"But, there is a real sense of hope for a stronger UK-China relationship.\""

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's decision to pause all US aid to Ukraine is a bitter blow \u2013 not just for Kyiv but also European allies who have been lobbying the US administration to continue its support.",
      "This is not the first time that the US has withheld military aid. Republicans in Congress blocked then-President Joe Biden's largest tranche of military assistance for Ukraine in the summer of 2023.",
      "Then, Ukraine just about managed to eke out its existing stocks of ammunition with the help of Europe.",
      "Congress finally approved the \u00a360bn aid package in the spring of 2024. It was just in time - Ukraine was struggling to fend off a renewed Russian offensive in Kharkiv. The arrival of the delayed US weapons helped turn the tide.",
      "As in 2024, it may be months before the effects of cutting off US aid are felt  \u2013 at least in terms of ammunition and hardware. European nations have slowly ramped up their production of artillery shells. Overall Europe now provides Ukraine with 60 percent of its aid \u2013 more than the US.",
      "However, US military support is still vital to Ukraine. One Western official recently described it as  \"the cream\" in terms of weapons.",
      "Ukraine's ability to protect its people and cities has heavily relied on sophisticated US air defence systems \u2013 such as Patriot batteries and NASAMS \u2013 jointly developed with Norway.",
      "The US has given Ukraine the ability to carry out long range strikes \u2013 with HIMARS and ATACM missiles. The US has limited their use inside Russia, but they have still been vital to hit high value targets inside occupied territories.",
      "It is not just quality, but quantity too. As the world's most powerful military, it has been able to send hundreds of surplus Humvees and armoured vehicles - numbers that smaller European armies could never match.",
      "The absence of some of this aid may take time to filter down to the frontline. But there could be a more worrying immediate impact, not least in terms of intelligence sharing.",
      "No nation can match the US in terms of space-based surveillance, intelligence gathering and communications. And it is not just provided by the US military, but commercial companies too.",
      "Take Elon Musk's Starlink satellite communication network. Every Ukrainian position I have visited on the frontline has a Starlink dish.",
      "They are used to relay the latest information on the battlefield. They have been essential to co-ordinate artillery and drone strikes.",
      "In the past, the Pentagon has admitted that it has been funding this lifeline. Given that Elon Musk is a key figure in the US administration, it seems highly unlikely that he will now be willing to foot the bill. He too is a harsh critic of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.",
      "Will the US prevent European countries from sending their US-made equipment to Ukraine? When Europe wanted to provide US-manufactured F-16 jets to Ukraine, it first had to receive the approval of Washington.",
      "And then what about the maintenance of US-supplied equipment? The US has also been training Ukrainian forces  and then helping them maintain US-supplied equipment.",
      "Biden lifted restrictions on US contractors working in Ukraine towards the end of his term. F-16 jets in particular need engineers and spares to keep on running.",
      "Trump's decision to pause aid may, to many in Ukraine and beyond, seem petulant. But there is also clearly a political aim to force them to the negotiating table sooner.",

      "The Unicef report provides an appalling window into the abuse of children in the country's civil war.",

      "Unicef does not say who is responsible, but other UN investigations have blamed the majority of rapes on the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), saying RSF fighters had a pattern of using sexual violence to terrorise civilians and suppress opposition to their advances.",
      "The RSF, which is fighting this war against its former allies, the Sudanese Armed Forces, has denied any wrongdoing.",

      "Recent US aid cuts may be endangering even the limited services available to protect children.",
      "Unicef has been providing safe spaces for children through a network of local activists who have set up what are known as Emergency Response Rooms to deal with the crises in their communities.",

      "Concern is mounting that war will return to this ravaged territory, deepening the profound suffering of Palestinians and threatening the lives of the remaining hostages held by Hamas.",
      "Israel, backed by the United States, says there is a new deal now, after the agreement's first phase ended on Saturday. And it has halted all humanitarian aid to Gaza until Hamas accepts this new version too.",
      "\"A flagrant violation,\" was Cairo's strongly worded response. Egypt as well as Qatar, the two Arab mediators in this process along with the US, have also accused Israel of violating international humanitarian law by \"using  food as a weapon of war\".",
      "Under the terms of the agreement, 600 trucks carrying vital humanitarian aid are meant to enter Gaza daily - and huge numbers crossed through the 42 days of the first phase.",
      "There has also been a loud chorus of criticism from other Arab states, as well as humanitarian leaders.",
      "UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who has arrived in Cairo for Tuesday's emergency Arab summit on rebuilding Gaza, called for the \"immediate\" resumption of assistance. He urged \"all parties to make every effort to prevent a return to hostilities\".",

      "Witkoff has not yet announced his proposal, but Netanyahu said the first stage of the ceasefire would be extended for another 50 days, to cover the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish holiday of Passover, and to continue negotiations.",
      "Hamas, in exchange, would immediately release half of the remaining hostages, according to Netanyahu. Israel says 59 are still being held captive and \"up to 24\" are believed to be alive.",
      "On Monday Hamas denounced this sudden shift as a \"a blatant attempt [by Israel] to evade the agreement and avoid entering into negotiations for the second phase\".",

      "Prime Minister Netanyahu's primary aim has always been to \"destroy\" Hamas's military strength and political grip.",
      "Their highly choreographed ceremonies and show of force during the hostage releases has angered Israelis and underlined that, while it has been significantly weakened, Hamas is still very much in charge in Gaza.",
      "Arab diplomatic sources say that while Hamas has accepted it will not be involved in running Gaza once this war ends, it will not dismantle what is left of its sway.",
      "That is unacceptable to Israel, and to its most important ally, the US.",
      "On Sunday, the US National Security Council gave its full support for Israel's \"next step\". It put the blame firmly on Hamas, saying the group had \"indicated it's no longer interested in a negotiated ceasefire\".",
      "In a video address, Prime Minister Netanyahu described President Donald Trump as \"the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House\".",

      "The prime minister's spokesman said: \"There are clearly a number of options on the table. I'm just not getting into a running commentary on the options.\"",

      "There are clearly difficulties with the idea. How would one measure a violation by an anonymous drone attack on a Ukrainian power plant? Why would Ukraine want to give Russian forces a free month to regroup and rearm?",
      "But for all that, Western diplomats said the idea of a partial truce was not entirely \"blue-skies thinking\" by President Macron - a man known for floating ideas at international summits.",
      "They said it could be part of the European ceasefire plans that are being worked on before being put to the Americans.",
      "Clearly some fresh thinking may be needed to try to unlock the current impasse with the US and Ukraine still at odds and the Europeans struggling to find ways of repairing the diplomatic breach.",
      "Everything of course depends on what Ukraine and Russia think. On Sunday night Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked if he was aware of the French truce plan and said simply: \"I'm aware of everything.\"",

      "Former Fifa president Sepp Blatter and French football legend Michel Platini are back in court in Switzerland to face accusations of fraud.",
      "In 2022, the pair were acquitted in a trial over a payment of 2m Swiss francs (\u00a31.6m) made to Platini and authorised by Blatter in 2011.",
      "Both men denied wrongdoing and said the transfer was belated payment for Fifa advisory work by Platini, who formerly led European football's governing body Uefa.",
      "But the Swiss federal prosecutor appealed against the decision. The new trial is expected to last until Thursday, with a verdict due on 25 March.",
      "The pair appeared before an appeals court in Muttenz, near Basel, on Monday.  Blatter, 88, reaffirmed that he was innocent.",
      "\"When you talk about falsehoods, lies and deception, that's not me. That didn't exist in my whole life,\" he told the court.",
      "A lawyer for Platini, 69, said the lower court that acquitted the pair in 2022 had been \"right to find that the disputed payment of 2m francs was lawful\".",
      "Platini had an illustrious playing career and is a three-time winner of the Ballon d'Or - Europe's highest individual football award.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:01:51 GMT",
    "summary": "From handheld to space-based, new methane detectors are making it easier to track the greenhouse gas.",
    "story": [
      "In and around Washington DC, volunteers and activists have been walking through streets and homes to see how healthy the air is.",
      "They're armed with industry-grade monitors that detect the presence of several gases. The devices look a bit like walkie-talkies.",
      "But they are equipped with sensors that reveal the extent of methane, turning this invisible gas into concrete numbers on a screen.",
      "Those numbers can be worrying. In a 25-hour period, neighbourhood researchers found 13 outdoor methane leaks at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit. They have also found methane leaks within homes.",
      "A key concern has been health. Methane and other gases, notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves, are linked to higher risks of asthma.",
      "Djamila Bah, a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organisation Action in Montgomery, reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organisation.",
      "\"It's very heartbreaking and alarming when you're doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they can't change for now,\" Ms Bah says.",
      "Methane might be a hazard to human health, but it is also powerful greenhouse gas.",
      "While it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one-quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialisation.",
      "Methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors. Chief among these are fossil fuels, waste and agriculture.",
      "But methane is not always easy to notice.",
      "It can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers. It can also be visualised using infrared cameras, as methane absorbs infrared light.",
      "Monitoring can be ground-based, including vehicle-mounted devices, or aerial, including drone-based measurement. Combining technologies is especially helpful.",
      "\"There is no perfect solution,\" says Andreea Calcan, a programme management officer at the International Methane Emissions Observatory, a UN initiative.",
      "There are trade-offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis, which could extend to thousands of facilities.",
      "Thankfully, she has seen an expansion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade. So there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane, at any scale. And the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high-emitting events, she says.",
      "At a larger scale, satellites are often good at pinpointing super-emitters: less frequent but massively emitting events, such as huge oil and gas leaks. Or they can detect the smaller and more spread-out emitters that are much more common, such as cattle farms.",
      "Current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter, says Riley Duren, the CEO of the Carbon Mapper, a not-for-profit organisation that tracks emissions.",
      "He likens this to film cameras. A telephoto lens offers higher resolution, while a wide-angle lens allows a larger field of view.",
      "With a new satellite, Carbon Mapper is focusing on high resolution, high sensitivity and rapid detection, to more precisely detect emissions from super-emitters. In August 2024 Carbon Mapper launched the Tanager-1 satellite, together with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Earth imaging company Planet Labs.",
      "Satellites have struggled to spot methane emissions in certain environments, such as poorly maintained oil wells in snowy areas with lots of vegetation. Low light, high latitudes, mountains and offshore areas also present challenges.",
      "Mr Duren says that the high-resolution Tanager-1 can respond to some of these challenges, for instance by essentially sneaking peeks through gaps in cloud cover or forest cover.",
      "\"In an oil and gas field, high resolution could be the difference between isolating the methane emissions from an oil well head from an adjacent pipeline,\" he says. This could help determine exactly who is responsible.",
      "Carbon Mapper began releasing emissions data, drawing on Tanager-1 observations, in November.",
      "It will take several years to build out the full constellation of satellites, which will depend on funding.",
      "Tanager-1 isn't the only new satellite with a focus on delivering methane data. MethaneSAT, a project of the Environmental Defense Fund and private and public partners, also launched in 2024.",
      "With the increasing sophistication of all these satellite technologies, \"What was previously unseeable is now visible,\" Mr Duren says. \"As a society we're still learning about our true methane footprint.\"",
      "It's clear that better information is needed about methane emissions. Some energy companies have sought to evade methane detection by using \"enclosed combustors\" to obscure gas flaring.",
      "Translating knowledge into action isn't always straightforward. Methane levels continue to rise, even as the information available does as well.",
      "For instance, the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) uses satellite data to detect methane emissions notify companies and governments. The MARS team gathered a large quantity of methane plume images, verified by humans, to train a machine learning model to recognise such plumes.",
      "In all the locations that MARS constantly monitors, based on their history of emissions, the model checks for a methane plume every day. Analysts then scrutinise any alerts.",
      "Because there are so many locations to be monitored, \"this saves us a lot of time,\" says Itziar Irakulis Loitxate, the remote sensing lead for the International Methane Emissions Observatory, which is responsible for MARS.",
      "In the two years since its launch, MARS has sent out over 1,200 alerts for major methane leaks. Only 1% of those have led to responses.",
      "However, Ms Irakulis remains optimistic. Some of those alerts led to direct action such as repairs, including cases where emissions ceased even though the oil and gas operator didn't officially provide feedback.",
      "And communications are improving all the time, Ms Irakulis says. \"I have hope that this 1%, we will see it grow a lot in the next year.\"",
      "At the community level, it's been powerful for residents, such as those in the Washington DC area, to take the air pollution readings themselves and use these to counter misinformation. \"Now that we know better, we can do better,\" says Joelle Novey of Interfaith Power and Light.",

      "From dazzling costumes to exuberant parties, Trinidad's carnival is often dubbed \"the greatest show on Earth\".",
      "But some of its elements are not exactly eco-friendly and the festivities are estimated to produce 3.4 tonnes of waste every year according to Carnicycle, a local initiative aiming to make festivities more sustainable.",
      "Danii McLetchie, who co-founded Carnicycle in 2018, says that while carnival \"is a big part of our culture\" it also has a very negative environmental impact \"from the events, to the textiles, to costumes\" used by the masqueraders, spectators and vendors taking part in the annual parade on the two days preceding Ash Wednesday.",
      "Producing and transporting just a single carnival costume bra can generate approximately 37.68kg (83lb) of CO2 emissions, Carnicycle estimates based on calculations made using an online tool provided by Swedish tech company Doconomy.",
      "Danii and her team are working to have that estimate verified by a third party, but with tens of thousands of masqueraders parading every year, she says the amount of emissions is cause for concern.",
      "To reduce those emissions, Carnicycle has started a recycling programme, collecting unused costumes that would have been dumped or burned by masquerade bands, which use new costume designs every year.",
      "Carnicycle also puts up collection bins at hotels and other venues so discarded costumes can be reused.",
      "\"Up until last year we collected around 10,000 pieces of costume materials,\" Danii told the BBC, describing the arduous task of completely stripping down truckloads of costumes to preserve feathers, beads and other materials for future use.",
      "The salvaged materials are sold to costume designers, ravers, and people in the burlesque industry, who save by buying second hand.",
      "Carnicycle also rents out the large backpack pieces which are a popular part of the costumes worn at Trinidad's carnival. Their price can run up to $700 (\u00a3550), depending on size.",
      "Danii explains that they came up with the idea after hearing revellers complain not just about the expense but also about the weight of the backpack pieces. \"'I'm paying this much money but then it's heavy and by the time it's lunch I just want to throw it away',\" Danni recalls people saying.",
      "Carnicycle rents the backpacks to masqueraders long enough so that they can pose for photos, but are freed from carrying their load during the parade.",
      "Danii and Carnicycle's co-founder Luke Harris \u2013 who both hold down full-time jobs in addition to their environmental initiative - are not the only ones dedicating their spare time to making Trinidad's carnival both fun and eco-friendly",
      "Lawyer Aliyah Clarke and fashion designer Kaleen Sanois started a side business called 2nd Closet - a pop-up thrift shop where people can buy and sell pre-owned clothing.",
      "The two have also been making video tutorials with tips on how to transform costumes into beachwear and outfits for other occasions.",
      "Aliya told the BBC it was something she first did for herself: \"After I was finished with my costume I would rip it apart, literally down to the wire, and figure out how to make this into something else to wear outside of carnival.\"",
      "Now she is sharing her ideas in a video segment the two millennials have dubbed \"Tipsy Tuesday\".",
      "They also offer a closet-sorting service, which involves coming to a person's home and sorting through unwanted clothing, to rescue items fit for sale at their pop-up thrift shop.",
      "In what Kaleen believes is a testament to the work they have been doing, they were asked to sort the sprawling closet of Machel Montano, a musician known as the \"King of Soca\" and a superstar in the carnival world.",
      "\"Clothes are personal things, especially for somebody like Machel who has so many big moments tied to his pieces,\" Kaleen explains.",
      "After sorting through Machel's shoes and clothes, 2nd Closet organised a two-day pop-up shop, giving people a chance to buy items worn by Machel on stage and in his music videos.",
      "\"People came with pictures, and were like 'I'm looking for this piece',\" Aliyah recalls of fans' enthusiasm for the second-hand items.",
      "But costumes and outfits are not the only items being recycled to make Trinidad's festivities more environmentally friendly.",
      "At Fete with the Saints, a party many regard as one of the best of Trinidad's carnival, food is eaten with biodegradable wooden cutlery and the drinks are poured into reusable cups.",
      "The organisers of the fete -  a fundraiser for one of Trinidad and Tobago's top secondary schools \u2013 also hire \"bin detectives\" to ensure patrons properly sort and dispose their rubbish for recycling.",
      "It is estimated that this year the bin detectives helped to more than double the amount of recyclables captured, compared with the two previous years combined.",
      "\"Over the past three years we've actually prevented over one million single-use plastics from entering the landfill, I think maybe over five tonnes of glass,\" says Vandana Mangroo, co-founder of Close the Loop Caribbean, a company which started working with the organisers of Fete with the Saints in 2023 to make the event more sustainable.",
      "Joseph Hadad, co-chairman of the party's organising committee, says that those behind the event knew that their efforts to make it greener would \"add some layer of costs and more labour\". But he is adamant \"it worked\" and insists that the party spirit has not been dampened.",

    "summary": "India faces a crucial choice in modernising its air force. But is a cutting-edge US fighter jet the answer?",
    "story": [
      "India faces a crucial choice in modernising its air force - but is a cutting-edge American fighter jet the answer?",
      "During his Washington visit last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met US President Donald Trump, who announced they were \"paving the way\" for India to acquire F-35s, a jet primarily sold to close allies and partners.",
      "The F-35 is a \"fifth-generation\" multi-role fighter jet with advanced sensors, AI-driven combat systems and seamless data-sharing capabilities. Built to evade radar, it's the most sophisticated jet in the skies - but at $80m a pop, also one of the most expensive. (Stealth is a key characteristic of a \"fifth-generation\" fighter.)",
      "Many believe that with its fighter squadrons dwindling and China's military growing, India faces a high-stakes choice: splurge on the state-of-the-art but costly F-35 from the US or strengthen defence ties with Russia through local production of its most advanced stealth fighter jet Sukhoi Su-57.",
      "Experts believe the reality is more nuanced, with the US-Russia \"dogfight\" largely a media hype \u2013 fuelled more recently by the appearance of both jets at Asia's biggest air show, Aero India, in the southern city of Bengaluru last month.",
      "Trump's F-35 offer seems more \"symbolic\" than practical, driven by his push to sell US weapons, according to Ashley J Tellis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "Integrating a \"fifth generation\" aircraft into the India air force (IAF) plans - centred on the homegrown Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) and more Rafales - would be challenging, especially without co-production rights. Being developed by India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), the AMCA is India's own stealth fighter.",
      "\"It is unlikely that the F-35 will be offered for co-production to India - any acquisition will likely be a straightforward sale. This is unlikely, among other things, to sit well with Modi's emphasis on making in India and the significant end-user monitoring in the event of an F-35 sale will likely not be welcomed by India either,\" Mr Tellis told me.",
      "India's challenges with the F-35 are its steep cost, heavy maintenance and operational issues - the jet's availability is around 51% for the US Air Force, according to  security expert Stephen Bryen, author of a Substack column, Weapons and Strategy. \"The question is whether India is willing to invest billions of rupees in the F-35, knowing it could do better buying the Russian jet.\"",
      "But many dismiss the Su-57 as a real contender, noting that India exited the decade-long programme to co-produce the jet with Russia in 2018 over disputes on technology transfer, cost-sharing and specifications.",
      "To be sure, India's air force is ageing and short on fighter jets.",
      "It operates 31 fighter and combat squadrons - mostly Russian and Soviet-era aircraft - far below the sanctioned 42. A key challenge is finding a long-term replacement for the Sukhoi-30, the IAF's versatile workhorse from Russia.",
      "Christopher Clary, a political scientist at the University of Albany, recently pointed to unsettling data from the ISS Military Balance for India: between 2014 and 2024, China added 435 fighter and ground attack aircraft, Pakistan gained 31, while India's fleet shrank by 151.",
      "India's planned fighter jet expansion is largely homegrown, with plans to acquire over 500 jets, mostly light combat aircraft.",
      "Orders for 83 Tejas Mark 1A - an agile multirole homegrown fighter - are confirmed, with another 97 expected to be ordered shortly. Meanwhile, the heavier, more advanced Mark 2 is in development. The homegrown stealth jet remains at least a decade away.",
      "India also has plans to buy 114 multirole fighter jets under the IAF's $20bn Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA) programme requiring foreign jets to be built in India under a transfer of technology deal - its biggest hurdle.",
      "Stalled since 2019, the Indian government is looking at a transparent and non-controversial procurement process after it faced criticism over the acquisition of 36 Rafales in a government-to-government deal. Five jets are in contention, with Rafale leading as it is already in service with the IAF.",
      "Experts say India's air force modernisation faces three key hurdles: funding, delays and dependence on foreign jets.",
      "Defence spending has shrunk in real terms. The foreign fighter jets programme risks a drawn-out fate. While India prioritises home-made, DRDO's delays force stopgap foreign purchases, creating a repeating cycle. Breaking it requires delivering a capable homegrown jet on time. Deliveries are also delayed due to a holdup in supplies of General Electric's F-404 engines for the jets.",
      "A key challenge is the mismatch between the defence ministry's vision and the IAF's needs, says Rahul Bhatia, an analyst at Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consulting firm.",
      "The Tejas Mark 1 faced early scepticism from the air force, leading to upgrades like the Mark 1A and Mark 2. \"But the decades-long development cycles frustrate the armed forces, especially as their requirements keep evolving as newer technologies become available, which in turn contributes to further delays,\" Mr Bhatia told me.",
      "Even the Indian Air Force chief AP Singh has made no secret of his frustration over delays.",
      "\"I can take a vow that I will not buy anything from outside or I will wait for whatever is developed in India, but it may not be possible if it does not come at that pace [on time],\" Air Marshall Singh told a seminar recently.",
      "\"At the moment, we all know that we are very badly off when it comes to numbers [of fighters]. And the numbers which were promised are also coming a little slow. So, there will be a requirement to go and look for something which can quickly fill up these voids,\" he said, referring to the delayed Tejas Mark 1A deliveries, which were supposed to begin last February but have yet to start.",
      "India's clear priority is a homegrown stealth fighter, with more than $1bn already committed to its development. \"A foreign stealth jet would only be considered if India's immediate threat perception shifts,\" says Mr Bhatia. China has two so-called stealth fighters - the J-20 and J-35 - but they likely fall short of US standards.",
      "Most experts believe India will choose neither the American nor Russian fighters. \"In the short term, as seen in past conflicts, emergency buys may fill gaps. The medium-term focus is co-production, but the long game is clear - building its own,\" says Mr Bhatia.",
      "For India, the future of airpower isn't just about buying jets - it's about building them, ideally with a strong Western partner. But for that vision to succeed, India must deliver its homegrown fighters on time."

    "story": [
      "Whatever words are used to frame the plans emerging from Sunday's summit of 19 mainly European leaders in London - ceasefire, truce or peace plan - the challenges ahead are enormous.",
      "The UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, along with French President Emmanuel Macron, hope this will be the plan to eventually bring lasting peace to Ukraine.",
      "At its heart lies what Sir Keir is calling the \"coalition of the willing\", those who would help to guarantee peace in the event of a deal being reached.",
      "But what are the hurdles \u2013 and how easily can they be overcome?",
      "Can Europe put together a sufficient deterrent force?",
      "First, can Europe's depleted armies and half-empty arsenals muster anything approaching a substantial deterrent force to deploy to Ukraine? What nations, other than the UK and France, will be willing to send forces into such an uncertain scenario given the doubts over US support?",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said it would need an international force of up to 200,000 troops to sustain a ceasefire along the 600 mile (960km) line of contact between the two opposing armies, Russia and Ukraine.",
      "Although that figure is wildly optimistic, the Ukrainian leader is correct in assessing just how many would be needed to act as a sufficient deterrent to any future Russian incursions.",
      "In reality, Europe will struggle to come up with even a third of that number, such is the effect of decades of running down its militaries, years after the post-Cold War peace dividend should have ended.",
      "Air power would be crucial. This is both for what is known as ISR [Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance] and for repelling any future Russian incursions.",
      "There is no point having a brigade of UK troops sitting on part of the notional ceasefire line if thousands of Russian troops and armoured vehicles are pouring through a gap 100 miles away and there is no adequate means to repel them.",
      "The US has a huge capability in Signals Intelligence, Sigint, as well as air-to-air refuelling, without which a purely European force would struggle. A recent report by the London-based think tank the International Institute for International Affairs (IISS) stated:",
      "\"Europe's reliance on Washington's military capabilities, especially critical enablers such as ISR and air-to-air refuelling, will make pursuing 'independence' a major challenge without major investment in those areas.\"",
      "It goes on to say that: \"The US also contributes over half of all Nato's fighter and fighter ground attack aircraft.\"",
      "In short, putting together a credible deterrent force to protect Ukraine would be extremely challenging, if not impossible, without US military backup.",
      "Can Trump be persuaded to provide a US backstop?",
      "Donald Trump likes to say that he doesn't start wars, he stops them.",
      "The last thing he wants to do right now is to commit US combat troops and air power to a notional unstable ceasefire line which has the potential to erupt into a shooting war that drags in Nato forces.",
      "Instead, he has telegraphed his preferred way to end this war, which is to cut a deal direct with Russian President Vladimir Putin, one-on-one.",
      "Sir Keir's aim is for Europe to come up with a credible ceasefire proposal which can then be presented to President Trump in the hope - and I would emphasise that word \"hope\" - that he then agrees to provide a US military backstop.",
      "So far, that looks unlikely.",
      "Will Russia accept it?",
      "Why on earth would it? - some would argue.",
      "Its ground forces are winning on the battlefield, albeit at a horrendous cost in human lives and Ukraine has all but lost its greatest ally in this war: the US.",
      "Without America's military support, Ukraine will be hard-pushed to hold back advancing Russian troops in the east and south-east. Without US Patriot missiles, its cities will be even more vulnerable to mass missile attacks by Russia.",
      "President Putin has always made it clear he will not accept the presence of Nato member troops in Ukraine. Now that he effectively has an ally in the White House, he is even less likely to give way on this point unless President Trump can offer him a major inducement in return.",
      "The bottom line in all this is that the Kremlin has not given up on its maximalist aims for Ukraine which is to eventually bring the whole country back into Moscow's orbit, replacing Zelensky with a pliant, pro-Russian puppet.",
      "At the bare minimum, it is unlikely to budge on its core demand that Ukraine permanently cede not only those territories Russia already occupies - in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions - but also gives up the adjacent cities of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, forcing hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian residents to either flee or become Russian.",

    "story": [
      "\"I'm scared,\" sobs Nabila.",
      "The 10-year-old's life is limited to her one-bedroom home in Islamabad and the dirt road outside it. Since December she hasn't been to her local school, when it decided it would no longer accept Afghans without a valid Pakistani birth certificate. But even if she could go to classes, Nabila says she wouldn't.",
      "\"I was off sick one day, and I heard police came looking for Afghan children,\" she cries, as she tells us her friend's family were sent back to Afghanistan.",
      "Nabila's not her real name - all the names of Afghans quoted in this article have been changed for their safety.",
      "Pakistan's capital and the neighbouring city of Rawalpindi are witnessing a surge in deportations, arrests and detentions of Afghans, the UN says. It estimates that more than half of the three million Afghans in the country are undocumented.",
      "Afghans describe a life of constant fear and near daily police raids on their homes.",
      "Some told the BBC they feared being killed if they went back to Afghanistan. These include families on a US resettlement programme, that has been suspended by the Trump administration.",
      "Pakistan is frustrated at how long relocation programmes are taking, says Philippa Candler, the UN Refugee Agency's representative in Islamabad. The UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) says 930 people were sent back to Afghanistan in the first half of February, double the figure two weeks earlier. At least 20% of those deported from Islamabad and Rawalpindi had documentation from the UN Refugee Agency, meaning they were recognised as people in need of international protection.",
      "But Pakistan is not a party to the Refugee Convention and has previously said it does not recognise Afghans living in the country as refugees. The government has said its policies are aimed at all illegal foreign nationals and a deadline for them to leave is looming. That date has fluctuated but is now set to 31 March for those without valid visas, and 30 June for those with resettlement letters.",
      "Many Afghans are terrified amid the confusion. They also say the visa process can be difficult to navigate. Nabila's family believes they have only one option: to hide. Her father Hamid served in the Afghan military, before the Taliban takeover in 2021. He broke down in tears describing his sleepless nights.",
      "\"I have served my country and now I'm useless. That job has doomed me,\" he said.",
      "His family are without visas, and are not on a resettlement list. They tell us their phone calls to the UN's refugee agency go unanswered.",
      "The BBC has reached out to the agency for comment.",
      "The Taliban government has previously told the BBC all Afghans should return because they could \"live in the country without any fear\". It claims these refugees are \"economic migrants\".",
      "But a UN report in 2023 cast doubt on assurances from the Taliban government. It found hundreds of former government officials and armed forces members were allegedly killed despite a general amnesty.",
      "The Taliban government's guarantees are of little reassurance to Nabila's family so they choose to run when authorities are nearby. Neighbours offer each other shelter, as they all try to avoid retuning to Afghanistan.",
      "The UN counted 1,245 Afghans being arrested or detained in January across Pakistan, more than double the same period last year.",
      "Nabila says Afghans shouldn't be forced out. \"Don't kick Afghans out of their homes - we're not here by choice, we are forced to be here.\"",
      "There is a feeling of sadness and loneliness in their home. \"I had a friend who was here and then was deported to Afghanistan,\" Nabila's mother Maryam says.",
      "\"She was like a sister, a mother. The day we were separated was a difficult day.\"",
      "I ask Nabila what she wants to do when she's older. \"Modelling,\" she says, giving me a serious look. Everyone in the room smiles. The tension thaws.",
      "Her mother whispers to her there are plenty of other things she could be, an engineer or a lawyer. Nabila's dream of modelling is one she could never pursue under the Taliban government. With their restrictions on girls' education, her mother's suggestions would also prove impossible.",
      "A new phase",
      "Pakistan has a long record of taking in Afghan refugees. But cross-border attacks have surged and stoked tension between the two neighbours. Pakistan blames them on militants based in Afghanistan, which the Taliban government denies. Since September 2023, the year Pakistan launched its \"Illegal Foreigners' Repatriation Plan,\" 836,238 individuals have now been returned to Afghanistan.",
      "Amidst this current phase of deportations, some Afghans are being held in the Haji camp in Islamabad. Ahmad was in the final stages of the United States' resettlement programme. He tells us when President Donald Trump suspended it for review, he extinguished Ahmad's \"last hope\". The BBC has seen what appears to be his employment letter by a Western, Christian non-profit group in Afghanistan.",
      "A few weeks ago, when he was out shopping, he received a call. His three-year-old daughter was on the line. \"My baby called, come baba police is here, police come to our door,\" he says. His wife's visa extension was still pending, and she was busy pleading with the police.",
      "Ahmad ran home. \"I couldn't leave them behind.\" He says he sat in a van and waited hours as police continued their raids. The wives and children of his neighbours continued trickling into the vehicle. Ahmad began receiving calls from their husbands, begging him to take care of them. They had already escaped into the woods.",
      "His family was held for three days in \"unimaginable conditions\", says Ahmad, who claims they were only given one blanket per family, and one piece of bread per day, and that their phones were confiscated.  The Pakistani government says it ensures \"no one is mistreated or harassed during the repatriation process\".",
      "We attempt to visit inside Haji camp to verify Ahmad's account but are denied entry by authorities. The BBC approached the Pakistani government and the police for an interview or statement, but no one was made available.",
      "Scared of being detained or deported, some families have chosen to leave Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Others tell us they simply can't afford to.",
      "One woman claims she was in the final stages of the US resettlement scheme and decided to move with her two daughters to Attock, 80km (50 miles) west of Islamabad. \"I can barely afford bread,\" she says.",
      "The BBC has seen a document confirming she had an interview with the IOM in early January. She claims her family is still witnessing almost daily raids in her neighbourhood.",
      "A spokesman for the US embassy in Islamabad has said it is in \"close communication\" with Pakistan's government \"on the status of Afghan nationals in the US resettlement pathways\".",
      "Outside Haji camp's gates, a woman is waiting. She tells us she has a valid visa but her sister's has expired. Her sister is now being held inside the camp, along with her children. The officers would not let her visit her family, and she is terrified they will be deported. She begins weeping, \"If my country was safe, why would I come here to Pakistan? And even here we cannot live peacefully.\"",
      "She points to her own daughter who is sitting in their car. She was a singer in Afghanistan, where a law states women cannot be heard speaking outside their home, let alone singing. I turn to her daughter and ask if she still sings. She stares. \"No.\""

    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 00:39:34 GMT",
    "summary": "How a new atomic clock might be the way to tackle attacks on plane GPS systems",
    "story": [
      "As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion.",
      "The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by \"GPS signal interference\".",
      "This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank \u2013 though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory.",
      "The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill.",
      "To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are.",
      "Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks.",
      "The potential cost of losing GPS has been put at \u00a31.4bn each day \u2013 no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats.",
      "With this in mind, a group of British scientists \u2013 dubbed the \"Time Lords\" \u2013 has been asked to come up with a solution.",
      "The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself \u2013 all within a few years.",
      "In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking \u2013 and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent.",
      "A new way of measuring time",
      "The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration.",
      "Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem \u2013 and the impact could be at least as transformative.",
      "\"History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,\" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London.",
      "In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation.",
      "The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation.",
      "The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison.",
      "But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices.",
      "\"We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,\" he says. \"So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced.\"",
      "The 'Time Lords'",
      "Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the \"Time Lords\" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium.",
      "GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab.",
      "The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves.",
      "When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis.",
      "\"The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,\" she tells BBC News.",
      "The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time.",
      "Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over \u2013 though that would take longer. \"To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,\" says Prof Paul.",
      "Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. \"The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,\" he says. \"There is no guarantee GPS \u2026 will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it.\"",
      "While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on board carried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as \"further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum\". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and \"the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged\".",
      "By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming.",
      "But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes.",
      "Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, \"where there's a bit more space\".",
      "Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around \u00a3100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems.",
      "GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons.",
      "\"We are harnessing atoms,\" she points out.",
      "\"You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed\".",
      "Atomic clocks in our pockets",
      "The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones.",
      "This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going.",
      "QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone.",
      "That process isn't going to happen soon, though. \"This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,\" says Prof Paul.",
      "Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship \u2013 his greatest difficulty was to make it small.",
      "Generation K: The disturbing rise of ketamine abuse among young people",
      "Three years on, Ukraine's extinction nightmare has returned",
      "Race policies or Israel - what's really driving Trump's fury with South Africa?",
      "But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea.",
      "\"Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,\" says another DSTL scientist.",
      "\"As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity.\"",
      "Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong.",
      "Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough?",
      "One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy \u2013 transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8yy09we1eo",
    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 00:03:49 GMT",
    "summary": "Switzerland's already upmarket tourism sector is trying to attract more high rollers.",
    "story": [
      "The world is a very insecure place right now - conflict, climate change, and fears of recession dominate the headlines. But for some people, things are going rather well - the wealthy.",
      "Despite the global turmoil, the number of billionaires in the world is growing and the personal wealth of each of them is increasing too.",
      "So what to do with all that money? The growing trend for the ultimate luxury experience is a clue as to what the very rich are doing with their cash. For the tourist industry in particular, it's an opportunity.",
      "In Switzerland, which has long cultivated a reputation for understated luxury, the number of five-star hotels is increasing faster than any other category. Many of them were built in the early 20th century - grand belle epoque palaces serving a then emerging class of privileged, primarily English tourists.",
      "Today, renovated to the highest standards, those hotels leave no guest's wish unmet. There are luxury spas, gourmet restaurants, and designer suites with panoramic views of the alps. Some offer \"ski butlers\" to ferry guests to and from the slopes, carry the skis, and even help put on their boots.",
      "Key markets are the US, the Gulf states, China and South East Asia. American guests in particular, Swiss hoteliers say, expect the full five-star treatment, including 24-hour room service, so that they can order food in the middle of the night.",
      "Meanwhile, China and India are emerging markets, where the first groups to travel from those two countries are among the wealthiest. Switzerland is very keen to get in at the start of that trend.",
      "But the five-star offer comes with a hefty price tag, so where does that leave those who are not billionaires? Markus Berger of Switzerland Tourism says the strategy is not to focus solely on high-end guests, but to take a hard-headed look at the figures.",
      "Stays at Swiss five-star hotels make up around 8% of all overnights, but the guests in them contribute at least 25% of Switzerland's total revenue from tourism.",
      "\"The numbers speak for themselves,\" says Mr Berger. \"The high economic significance justifies a commitment to luxury guests.\"",
      "What's more, he adds, Switzerland, with its high-wage, high-price economy, cannot compete with less expensive neighbours, particularly now that the Swiss franc is so strong.",
      "\"Switzerland has never tried to compete over prices,\" Mr Berger explains. \"There is always somewhere cheaper.\"",
      "Instead, the focus is on quality, service, and added value, like those ski butlers. In exchange, guests who come to five-star hotels also contribute a good deal to the rest of the economy, spending lavishly in the Michelin-starred restaurants and boutique shops that are also becoming a feature in a number of Swiss alpine resorts.",
      "But it's not an entirely win-win situation. In some of Switzerland's most famous up-market resorts, like St Moritz or Zermatt, there are long-standing concerns that the focus on luxury is pricing locals out of the market.",
      "A common challenge is finding accommodation for the hundreds of hotel and restaurant staff needed to provide the five-star service.",
      "They sometimes find themselves commuting, late at night when the cocktail bars and restaurants have finally closed, long journeys to other villages where the accommodation is affordable on a waiter's salary.",
      "Monika Bandi, who leads the Tourism Research Unit at Bern University's Centre for Regional Development, sees Switzerland's pitch to high-end guests as a fine balancing act. It's about \"quantity versus quality\", she says.",
      "More tourists aren't necessarily better, she believes. Instead, higher spending by existing numbers can be positive.",
      "And, she adds, Switzerland needs to watch out for the \"tipping point, where the destinations really lose their character\".",
      "Questions about a tipping point are currently being asked in the resort of Wengen, world famous for its Lauberhorn ski race, and its decades long connection with British skiers \u2013 the much-loved \"Down Hill Only\" ski club celebrated its 100th anniversary this year.",
      "And also this year, Wengen is opening its first ever five-star hotel, and there are plans too for a five-star complex of serviced \"hotel apartments\". They will be sold to wealthy tourists who want a luxury holiday home in the Alps, and they can also be rented out when the owners are absent.",
      "By calling the project a hotel, it exploits a loophole in Switzerland's strict laws against the \"cold beds\" of holiday homes. In theory, the law limits them to no more than 20% of a resort's accommodation.",
      "The Swiss Heritage Society has formally objected to the Wengen plans, because, claims spokesman Simon Weiss, the project is not really a hotel. \"It looks like a typical holiday home complex\u2026 there is no integration into the community.\"",
      "The required public spaces that a hotel would have \u2013 a restaurant and a spa \u2013 are planned, but they will all be underground. The design priority, Mr Weiss fears, is for private luxury apartments that may be occupied for only a few weeks a year. \"The design is unacceptable,\" he adds.",
      "Some Wengen locals also have their doubts. \"It's not St Moritz here,\" one told Swiss media, adding \"Wengen is not posh\".",
      "Wengen's tourism director Rolf Wegm\u00fcller agrees with that assessment, but says the trend towards luxury accommodation won't change the resort's character. \"We're not going to have guests walking around in fur coats all of a sudden,\" he says.",
      "Wengen, he points out, is only accessible by train, so, unlike St Moritz, there will be no Bentleys or Rolls-Royces taking up parking spaces. Even if they could ostentatiously display their wealth, Mr Wegm\u00fcller believes \"our guests won't want to show off what they have\".",
      "The resort also has visitors who come back year after year, contributing to the integration Mr Weiss worries about losing. \"Some families have been coming for generations,' says Mr Wegm\u00fcller. 'The locals know them, and that's good.\"",
      "Among them are Brian Bollen, keen member of the Down Hill Only Club, who has been coming to Wengen for more than 50 years. He loves it, but does worry that some of \"the charm has gone from the place\u2026 it's over built\".",
      "But most in Wengen, like Switzerland Tourism, see the investment in the alpine resorts as positive. These villages were, not much more than a century ago, very poor. A 19th English guide to the Swiss alps wrote that \"most of the children are beggars\".",
      "In more recent years, the global trade rules limiting agricultural subsidies have forced many small alpine dairy farms to close. Tourism, winter and summer, is enormously important for the Swiss economy, especially for the mountain communities.",
      "And, as Mr Berger of Switzerland Tourism points out, while the five-star sector is growing, three-star hotels are still the biggest category. \"We have one to five-star [in Wengen],\" adds Mr Wegm\u00fcller. \"That's a good thing in a resort.\"",
      "And while the people with unlimited money to spend on luxury travel may still be in a tiny minority, their numbers, and their wealth, are growing. Switzerland's approach \u2013 not cheaper, but better, not more people, just richer \u2013 seems to be paying off.",

      "Dean was a businessman who ran an asphalt-laying company in Nashville until he retired.\u00a0 He remained largely out of the spotlight throughout the years as Parton rose to fame, and they were rarely pictured together in public.

And I don't regret it. I never regretted it. I mean, it was a choice. So, you make your choices, you make your sacrifices, and I never looked back. I knew early on that I was gonna walk that road 'til God told me to stop. And I'm still walking it, and He ain't said nothing to me about quittin' yet!\"",

      "At the\u00a097th annual Academy Awards, presented on March 2, \"Anora\" won five Oscars, including for best picture. Watch scenes from \"Anora\" and the other nominated movies below, along with interviews with the filmmakers.",
      "\"Anora\"",
      "Sean Baker's Cinderella story \"Anora\" was a surprise winner of the top prize at last year's Cannes Film Festival \u2014 a sly and at times uproarious comic-drama of a Brooklyn sex worker who marries the young, na\u00efve son of Russian oligarchs who decide the marriage must be broken up at all costs.",
      "The film brings a humanity to the strivings of Anora (who favors the name Ani), a young woman who realizes too late that virtually no one around her has her best interests at heart \u2014 not even her newly-hitched husband.",
      "In this scene, Ani takes a stand about the working conditions at her club \u2014 she will not countenance rudeness from the DJ! (Note: Graphic language):",
      "A former NYU film student, Sean Baker had not slipped into the Hollywood industry like some of his classmates, including Todd Phillips (\"Joker\"), instead making small independent features (\"The Florida Project,\" \"Tangerine,\" \"Red Rocket\") that focused on people living on the margins of mainstream society, cast with both professional actors and non-actors.",
      "After contemplating \"a bro movie with Russian gangsters,\" he switched to a story of a sex worker in Brooklyn's Brighton Beach. He and his wife, producer Samantha Quan, moved there to absorb the atmosphere. \"We don't like to go to a place and say we're just going to get a surface view,\" Baker told the Associated Press. \"We really embed ourselves in that place. We talk to people. We get to know everyone. The research is us being there and soaking things up.\"",
      "Baker, who won the Directors Guild of America Award for \"Anora,\" based the film on research he did into the lives of sex workers. \"I don't want to say in any way that I ever faced the hardships of an undocumented immigrant or a marginalized sex worker,\" he said. \"But being an independent filmmaker for 30 years, there was a hustle. Up until fairly recently, I was struggling to pay rent.\"",
      "Madison told \"CBS Mornings\" that she \"absolutely fell in love\" with Ani when she read the character. \"She's such a complicated woman. There's so much nuance to who she is. She's so vulnerable on the inside, but she presents herself as this very fierce, tough person. And she has such a fighting spirit, and I was excited to explore all the different parts of what that would be.\"",
      "Heavily influenced by 1970s New York films like \"The French Connection\" and \"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,\" Baker shot \"Anora\" on 35mm. \"We're living in a day and age where the technology, analog meeting digital right now, actually opens up so many doors to the artists,\" Baker told Forbes. \"I mean, you can shoot on film and capture your images on this gorgeous medium, but then you have the digital tools to help clean up and perfect. We're living in a great time. I wish more filmmakers would appreciate the fact that using tools from both sides of years of technology is a wonderful thing.\"",
      "\"Anora,\" a Neon release, won best film at the Producers Guild of America Awards and at the Spirit Awards. It is now playing in theaters and is available via VOD.",
      "UPDATE: \"Anora\" won five Academy Awards on Sunday, four of which went to Baker, for best original screenplay, best editing, best director and best picture. He was the first person to ever win four Oscars for the same film.\u00a0 Mikey Madison also won for best actress.",
      "In one of his many acceptance speeches, Baker called out for preserving the theater-going movie experience, as cinemas are struggling to survive: \"In a time in which the world can feel very divided, this is more important than ever,\" he said. \"It's a communal experience you simply don't get at home. If we don't reverse this trend, we'll be losing a vital part of our culture. This is my battle cry.\"",

      "\"The Brutalist\"",
      "In director Brady Corbet's period drama \"The Brutalist,\" Hungarian architect L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th (best actor nominee Adrien Brody) emigrates from post-war Europe to the United States to revive his career, and finds both opportunity and friction as he tries to pursue his artistic inclinations.",
      "In the film's stirring opening scene, T\u00f3th arrives in New York Harbor, with a skewed view of the Statue of Liberty that portends an unequal assimilation into the promise of America. (Cinematography by Lol Crawley. Music by Daniel Blumberg.)",
      "Brody, who won an Oscar for his portrayal of a musician struggling to survive during the Nazi occupation of Poland in Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist,\" is nominated for his performance as T\u00f3th, who is hired by a wealthy Pennsylvania industrialist to build a massive community center in his \"brutalist\" style \u2014 a form of architecture that's light on decoration and heavy on concrete. But Toth's ambitions clash with his patron, who seeks in T\u00f3th a talent he wishes to dominate.",
      "In this extended interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Brody described his performance as T\u00f3th and the influence of his mother, the acclaimed photographer Sylvia Plachy: \"I've had a lifetime of influences and preparation so to speak to portray L\u00e1szl\u00f3 in this movie. It's a character that I relate to many things, and I see a lot of parallels in my own yearnings as an artist and in the yearnings of the people that I collaborate with. I can relate to how the struggles my mother has had to overcome in fleeing Hungary with her parents, my grandparents, in 1956 during the revolution and her journey coming to America and the sense of loss as a young girl and starting again. It's really shaped \u2014 I think she's an empathetic person by nature, but she has certain sensitivity and eye for others and those who are vulnerable, or outsiders, and captures that quite beautifully.\"",
      "Brody believes that empathy helped shape his own choices as an actor, \"trying to find films that have social relevance, or to represent people who don't have a voice and to give them that through me in some respect.\"",
      "Corbet's monumental post-war drama (which he co-wrote with his wife Mona Fastvold) is a challenging and invigorating epic, a three-and-a-half hour tale of an artist striving to create in the face of terrible external pressures \u2014 commercial, societal, marital. Though set for the most part in Pennsylvania, much of the picture was shot in Hungary, on a tiny budget (approximately $10 million), employing the rarely-used VistaVision process to blow up to 70mm. \"We cut every corner we could to make sure that every single cent was on screen,\" Corbet told Variety. \"It was a Herculean effort, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, because it was just years and years of essentially working for free.\"",
      "\"It helped that the film was set in an earlier period, because there were places in Hungary that looked sort of lost in the past,\" Oscar-nominated\u00a0production designer Judy Becker told Variety. \"For example, the industrial area in Budapest looked very similar to the industrial area of Philadelphia in the 1950s.\"",
      "But despite the tight budget, Corbet was not sorry he didn't have more money: \"I never thought, 'I wish I had $30 million more,'\" he told Variety. \"There's a lot of strings that come with that kind of money. It invites lots of opinions. You have all these executives who don't trust the director and bury them in notes. What you get is something antiseptic that lacks a signature. It's the difference between a bowl from Crate & Barrel and a wabi-sabi ceramic.\"",
      "At a press conference at the Venice Film Festival, where the film was hailed as a \"masterpiece,\" Corbet remarked on questions about its length: \"This film does everything that we are told we are not allowed to do. I think it's quite silly, actually, to have a conversation about run time, because that's like criticizing a book for being 700 pages versus 100 pages.\"",
      "At the end of \"The Brutalist,\" T\u00f3th is quoted as saying, \"No matter what the others try and sell you, it is the destination, not the journey.\" \"I don't think that that sentiment applies to my journey at all,\" Brody told \"Sunday Morning,\" \"but I do find it very beautiful and telling to the storytelling of the film. You have to be very present and embrace the journey, because that is all you've got while you're here. I mean, a part of me would love to be proud of the body of work that I leave behind, but I won't be around to look back at it, so hopefully I bring more good than bad and negativity into this world, and that's what I strive for.\"",
      "Brody won the New York Film Critics Circle Award, Golden Globe, and BAFTA awards for his performance, while \"The Brutalist\" won the Golden Globe for best motion picture drama and best director. The film received 10 Academy Award nominations, including best picture and best director.",

      "\"A Complete Unknown\"",
      "James Mangold's biopic expertly dramatizes the rise of Bob Dylan as a mythic figure in the folk music scene, and his transformation into a singer-songwriter who blurred genres and confounded commercial expectations. The film, nominated for 8 Academy Awards, is grounded by best actor nominee Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who won the Screen Actors Guild Award for his acutely-attuned performance as Dylan.",
      "In this scene, Dylan visits an infirm Woody Guthrie (Scoot McNairy) in a New Jersey hospital, being tended to by friend Pete Seeger (best supporting actor nominee Edward Norton):",
      "That meeting leads to Dylan's first appearance at New York's Folk City, where he is introduced by Seeger. The club's audience, including Joan Baez (played by best supporting actress nominee Monica Barbaro), is enraptured by Dylan's \"I Was Young When I Left Home\":",
      "Jay Cocks, the screenwriter of \"The Age of Innocence\" and \"Gangs of New York,\" had penned a screenplay based on the 2015 Elijah Wald book \"Dylan Goes Electric.\" Mangold (whose films include \"Walk the Line,\" \"3:10 to Yuma\" and \"Logan\") worked on revising the script, which expanded the characters of Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, and Sylvie Russo (a fictionalization of Dylan's then-girlfriend, Suze Rotolo).",
      "Mangold described to the Hollywood Reporter his initial meeting with Dylan to discuss the film: \"He said: 'So what's this movie about?' And I thought very carefully, because I knew he didn't want a 20-minute answer. I said: 'It's about a young guy in Minnesota who's suffocating and feeling desperate and who leaves everything \u2014 friends, family \u2014 behind and, with just a few dollars in his pocket, makes his way across the country and creates a new identity and makes new friends, finds a new family and blossoms, becomes successful, then starts to suffocate again and runs away.' And he smiled and that was all. Like, he didn't have anything more to say, but I knew that meant, to me, that he didn't take issue.\"",
      "The film gets a lot right in terms of the period, the feel of Greenwich Village at its height in the folk music world, and the sense of shifting sands in commercial music. Production designer Fran\u00e7ois Audouy transformed downtown Jersey City into early 1960s MacDougal Street in Greenwich Village. He also recreated Dylan's apartment based on hundreds of previously-unpublished photographs \u2014 from the exact chair Dylan had, to his Decca record player, his 1954 Olivetti Lettera 22 typewriter, art on the walls, books and records. \"It was like stepping into a time machine,\" Audouy told Indiewire of the apartment set.",
      "Arianne Phillips, nominated for best costume design (she'd previously been nominated for \"Walk the Line,\" \"W.E.,\" and \"Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood\"), told The Art of Costume, \"Unlike typical biopics that span decades, this film focuses on just four years. That precision was both a challenge and an opportunity for the costumes. \u2026 The film moves through a variety of locations and scenarios, but the time period remains consistent. There's no dramatic shift in technology, architecture, or cars. Instead, the focus is on Bob's evolution \u2014 his character arc.\"",
      "The film's wardrobe was broken down into three styles: his arrival in New York in 1961, the time around the release of his 1963 album \"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan,\" and the more mod figure he cut in 1965. \"Chalamet had about 67 costume changes,\" Phillips said, \"and we had over 120 speaking roles with principal characters averaging anywhere from 8 to 30 changes each.\"",
      "Though much dramatized in the film did happen \u2014 including a fistfight that broke out when Dylan plugged in an electric guitar at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival \u2014 there were some liberties taken. \"Dylan Goes Electric\" author Elijah Wald told the Guardian, \"The movie is full of things that didn't happen, but the way they happen in those scenes feels right to me. If Pete Seeger had been at Woody Guthrie's bedside when Dylan arrived and sung him a song, then said he didn't have a place to sleep, Pete would have brought him home for the night. None of that happened, but it's all true to the characters.\"",
      "Because of COVID, Hollywood strikes, and other commitments, Chalamet ended up waiting five years before \"A Complete Unknown\" could go before the cameras. He used that time to further study Dylan (whom he had never met) and his music. In addition to learning how to play the guitar and the harmonica, Chalamet mastered about 40 Bob Dylan songs \u2014 far more than were originally called for in the script \u2014 determined, like the young Dylan, to make it great.",
      "\"I give 170% in everything I'm doing,\" the actor told \"60 Minutes.\" \"I'm giving it my all. Something like the Dylan project, these aren't watered-down experiences. I'm going Daniel Day-Lewis on all of them. I'm not saying in process, but I'm saying a level of commitment.\"",
      "He says he wasn't merely trying to imitate Dylan: \"No, totally that was the tension, for me, in doing a biopic on somebody so beloved and so well-known was \u2026 where does my heart and where does my soul fit into this? Can it fit into this, particularly with someone who was so masked?\"",

      "\"I like characters that have contradictions inside them,\" Fiennes told \"Sunday Morning.\" His reaction to reading the part of Lawrence was, \"Oh, I love this. This is a human. He's not a saint. He's a good man trying to find his way.",
      "\"I was brought up a Catholic and then rebelled when I was 13,\" Fiennes said. \"My mother was a committed Catholic. So, 'God questions' have been in my family since I was a child.\"",
      "And did he come away with any answers to his own questions? \"No, I came away with more questions,\" he said.",
      "Berger talked with the Hollywood Reporter about the film's themes: \"It is a wonderful topic for a political thriller, not [just] for a religious thriller,\" he said. \"This could take place anywhere. It could take place in Washington, D.C., or Downing Street, or a big corporation where the CEO job is vacant. So, I think that's interesting on the surface, but on a much deeper level, I really connected with what [Lawrence] is going through. He says, 'I have difficulty with prayer.' \u2026 To overcome that and go through this crisis and refine the belief in what you do, [to believe] it has some purpose, I think a lot of us go through it at some point or another in our life. To refine the purity of your job, and refine the purity of your purpose, is a constant struggle. It's an interesting path to keep recalibrating. And it's actually a very healthy path to keep recalibrating. \u2026",
      "\"What the film really deals with is doubt and certainty \u2026 It doesn't mean that every cardinal, every character in the movie, acts to the best of their conscience. But they are certain in their beliefs, or they believe that what they think is right. Bellini has a certainty that this guy is wrong and that is a certainty as well. And I always think that, in a way, certainty creates antagonism and that's just going to make the other side stronger.\"",

      "Part One of \"Dune,\" released in 2021, was a masterful evocation of Frank Herbert's classic sci-fi novels, in which the desert world of Arrakis becomes the focal point of a galactic war over a unique, invaluable commodity: spice, a psychoactive chemical necessary for interplanetary travel (and domination). Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the movie was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, and won six.",
      "The sequel follows the ascension of Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) as a leader of the Indigenous Fremen tribes in combatting the forces of the ruling House Harkonnen.",
      "In this scene, Paul and Chani (Zendaya) engage in a Fremen attack on a Harkonnen spice harvester. The fast-moving action showcases how Villeneuve's staging, photography and pacing expertly define cinematic geography, as well as the limitations of technology \u2014 and the power of daredevil heroics:",
      "In this technical featurette from Variety, Academy Award-nominated cinematographer Greig Fraser (who won the Oscar for \"Part One\") discusses how camera movement, lenses, and shooting in natural light (as well as the combination of digital and film emulsions) mirror the emotions and journey of the characters, such as when Paul Atreides rides the giant sandworm.",
      "Fraser noted, \"The biggest challenge is, worms don't exist.\" Well, yeah, that is a problem! Thankfully, the film's visual effects team (also nominated) provided the solution. You can watch the sandworm sequence below \u2014 a scene of remarkable anticipation, drama, and visual and sonic splendor for which Imax was created, as Paul's feat appears to satisfy a Fremen prophecy of a messianic figure. It's not for nothing that director Steven Spielberg, in a Directors Guild of America podcast, told Villeneuve that this sequence was \"one of the greatest things I have ever seen. Ever!\"",

      "What Juan \"Manitas\" Del Monte leaves behind when he transitions is a wife and children, who are relocated to Europe for their protection. Jessi (Selena Gomez) mourns the death of her husband, but after moving back to Mexico she meets up with a former lover \u2014 and is also introduced to a distant cousin, Emilia P\u00e9rez (best actress nominee Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n), not knowing Emilia is Jessi's former husband.",

And I really appreciated that.\"",
      "In this profile for \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Gomez said shooting \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" left her \"a little sore from the dance numbers.\" So, why did she want to do it? \"I found it incredibly compelling,\" she said. \"To be honest, I've never really seen a movie like this before. I don't think I've ever been this proud of something in the acting field.\"",
      "In her extended interview, Gomez described the experience of shooting the film as transformative: \"The people I was around, I couldn't have been luckier with their support and their wisdom. It just felt so right,\" she said. \"The story is original, but it's also a story that a lot of people walk through. So, the way it was told was artistic and audacious and beautiful, but it is a true element where people crave and have a desire to live their life authentically, and whatever that looks like to them should never be judged. I thought that we did a good job encompassing that.\"",
      "\"Also, when I read the script, my character came across quite harsh in the beginning. Jacques was really wonderful with collaborating with me because I felt like adding a bit of softness to her would help.

Her tragic but inspiring story was recounted in her son Marcelo Rubens Palva's 2015 book, \"I'm Still Here.\"",
      "Brazilian filmmaker Walter Salles' previous films include 1998's \"Central Station\" (an Oscar-winner for best foreign language film), and \"The Motorcycle Diaries.\" At last year's New York Film Festival, Salles said that the story of \"I'm Still Here\" was very personal to him because of his own history. The son of a diplomat, Salles returned to Brazil in 1969 after living abroad for five years: \"The country I came back to was very different from the country I had left, because it was now under military dictatorship, and I was personally pretty much at loss, really at loss, until I met this family of five kids, and it was Marcelo's family. Became really good friends with his sister Nalu, and I got embraced by this family.",
      "\"I've been in that house, you know, for almost two years on a constant level,\" Salles said. \"We drifted to that house because in it you could hear the political discussions that didn't exist anymore in the exterior of that place. You could hear the music that was forbidden. \u2026 And there were no barriers between, you know, adults, adolescents, kids. This was completely different from my house. So, I was very informed by that. The moment where this was broken up was for all of us who were in that house at some moment kind of severed a line. It stipulated a before and an after, which obviously has to do with the moment when an authoritarian state invades the heart of a family. And that stayed with me for years and years and years.\"",
      "\"I'm Still Here\" has tapped into the public conscience in Brazil, where the collective memory about the nation's suffering under military rule across two decades is being revived through the story of Eunice and her family. It became the fifth highest-grossing film in Brazil last year (behind Hollywood fare like \"Inside Out 2,\" \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" \"Moana 2\" and \"Despicable Me 4\"). The film won three awards at the Venice Film Festival, including for its director.",

Following an investigation, the school was closed in 2011; subsequent diggings unearthed unmarked graves, which revealed even greater evidence of the staff's cruelties.",
      "In this extended interview from 2019, Whitehead told \"Sunday Morning\" that his book's main characters, Elwood and Turner, represented different sides of himself: \"I have an optimistic part of me that thinks that things are getting better. We are making progress as a country, in terms of race and other things,\" Whitehead said. \"And then there's a pessimistic, or realistic, part of me that says, no, things never change, and we make some progress and then we slide back. And so, Elwood and Turner in their initial incarnation represented different sides of me.",
      "\"Elwood is 16, he's a straight-A student, he's been inspired by Martin Luther King, the civil rights marches. Every week, he reads Life magazine and sees the picture of his heroes. \u2026 And he sees himself as part of the new generation that can change the old order. And then there's Turner, who is an orphan. And he's been sent to [Nickel] 'cause there's nowhere else for him to go. And he lives by his wits. He's a survivor. And he sees the system as it actually is, unchanging, casually cruel, callous. And he doesn't believe in the same sort of enlightened goals of Elwood. [He believes in] making his way through the obstacle course, getting through a day without getting beaten, and then getting out of school where he can find some other survival tactic that works in the outside world. And so, they meet, and they have to survive but also consider each other's philosophies \u2014 what works, what doesn't, and how do you maybe perhaps integrate them.\"",
      "What makes the film adaptation of \"Nickel Boys\" unique is that director and co-writer RaMell Ross, a visual arts professor at Brown University who earned an Oscar nomination for the 2018 documentary \"Hale County This Morning, This Evening,\" employs a first-person perspective for most of the film; the camera serves as the eyes of Elwood, or Turner, throughout the story, so the audience directly experiences the sensations of the characters, which can be especially disturbing when they become victims of abuse.",
      "In this trailer for the film, we experience life from the perspective of the protagonists:",
      "In this scene, Hattie (Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor), unable to see her grandson Elwood, approaches Turner (voice of Brandon Wilson) for help:",
      "In a New York Film Festival panel discussion, Ross, who had always wanted to make a POV film, said reading Whitehead's book was profound for him: \"And in the process of reading, it was the process of being allowed to imagine in a way that I think a lot of American writers aren't focused on.",
      "\"The way that Coulson wrote was, like, concise and spare, [he] didn't over-describe, so it allowed me to imagine myself as Elwood and truly be visual in the world,\" Ross said. \"And so, that process led to the POV notion, and ideas around at what point in time did Elwood realize that he was raced, that he realized he was Black? Which is something that I would argue all people of color go through. It's a visual thing, it's a perceptual thing, and what a devastating thing in his life as you can see in the film juxtaposed against being a sentient-innocent child and being in awe of what it means to be embodied, and then to go out into the world and to be forced to adhere by this manufactured law. It's devastating.\"",
      "Shot with Sony's Venice (a full-frame digital camera not much larger than a DSLR still camera), to allow movement through tight spaces, the camera was worn on various rigs (chest mounts, helmets, SnorriCams), as well as handhelds. In many instances, the actors wore the cameras themselves.",
      "Cinematographer Jomo Fray, who won the American Society of Cinematographers' Spotlight Award, told the New York Film Festival audience that he did not think \"POV\" was adequate as shorthand to describe its effect: \"I don't think it was about being in the point of view, but it was actually creating an image that is at one point immersive \u2014 it brings us in as an audience into the world. At a second point, it is implicative \u2014 it implicates us in the world that the image itself is seeing. And as a third point, it's an image that has a physical danger to it, that the image itself is navigating, trying to go through spaces that are naturally hostile to it. So, we wanted to shoot these scenes not from outside but be inside of the scene. \u2026 It was fundamentally, totally different than anything I've ever shot before, conceptually and otherwise.\"",
      "Brandon Wilson, who plays Turner, told CBS station KCAL in Los Angeles, \"I think this movie offers a beautiful invitation for people to let go of their own subjective points of view and step into the shoes of another person, and step into their eyes. I just hope they accept that invitation and allow themselves to be pulled into this world and release their own conditional point of view for a moment.\"",

      "\"The Substance\"",
      "Coralie Fargeat's body horror film \"The Substance\" stars best actress nominee Demi Moore as Elisabeth Sparkle, an aging TV star who discovers a sinister-looking potion that can give her a younger, more perfect version of herself, but at a terrible price.",
      "In this early scene, following a devastating career downturn and a car accident, Elisabeth breaks down under the watch of an ER doctor (Tom Morton), but then finds herself the focus of a sinister male nurse (Robin Greer). Why does he refer to her as \"a good candidate\"? And what is that strange birthmark on his forearm?",
      "The upshot? Elisabeth is offered access to a radical potion, a.k.a. The Substance, that promises \"a better version of yourself.\" What that entails, once a yellow liquid is injected into one's veins, is the creation of a new, younger duplicate of the person, ready to take their place. [Warning: There is a regimented schedule for injections; don't deviate!]",
      "Fargeat, a French filmmaker whose credits include \"Revenge\" and the TV series \"The Sandman,\" told Vogue magazine that the stylized horror was purposefully made to look unreal: \"From the start I knew I wasn't interested in depicting the real Hollywood but rather what it's about. It's about beauty. It's about success. Taking it out of reality was a way to make it timeless and thus universal, like the story could happen today, yesterday, or tomorrow \u2014 as well as anywhere.\"",
      "In a Hollywood Reporter roundtable, Gargeat said that she would not call \"The Substance\" a horror film. \"I would call it more of a genre film, which is to me very wide \u2026 going from sci-fi to action to everything that is not grounded into reality. Basically that's how I grew up loving films, everything that [would] allow me to escape real life, which I hated, which I felt totally unadapted to, and very bored [with].",
      "\"So, especially for that film and the previous one, that's really where I found my freedom and where I felt powerful and where I felt fully capable to express myself in a way that there are no boundaries. Also, where I love to go very much into the excess and kind of touch my part of, yeah, craziness \u2026 it felt totally relevant for it to be as excessive as what I wanted to say, and make the audience feel that excess and feel that craziness.",
      "\"So, that's it's even not a question where that I choose; it's just what I do,\" she said.",
      "The film has been recognized as an indictment of sexism and ageism, in a popular culture that denigrates women who have the temerity to get older. In an extended interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Moore referred to a line by Dennis Quaid's character making reference to a woman's fertility being tied to their value, and to their desirability. \"There's an aspect that [and I would say up until now] kind of put women at a certain age or time in their life as, 'Well, you're now relegated to this corral because you can't be that.' And I just don't think it's the truth. I don't think that is the truth of who we are as women as we get older. And I think again, like the film, there's a part of that that we as women have bought into, and so if we want to change this, then we have to change how we're looking at it, how we're holding it, and how we see ourselves. We can't wait for it to change on the outside; we have to be that change.\"",
      "Fargeat told the Associated Press that her film was a response to the limits of female representation. \"Our society, you know, has been built on 2,000 years of being kind of one way. And to make a real sense, it's still too tiny to me. That's why I also wanted my movie to be so excessive, you know, because I think this is what we need. We can't be shy with those issue because the weight of everything is huge. The weight of all that still creates so much inequality and so much violence. So, that's why also I wanted to make the movie that way.\"",
      "Moore won both the Golden Globe and the Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance, and was nominated for a BAFTA. The film is up for a total of five Academy Awards, including best picture. Coralie Fargeat received two nominations for best director and best original screenplay, and a third as producer.",

      "In the song \"Defying Gravity,\" from \"Wicked,\" there is a lyric: \"It's time to trust my instincts, close my eyes and leap.\" That resonated with the director, Jon M. Chu. \"It was the whole reason I did the movie,\" Chu told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"It's all about striving for that dream and being able to fight through the uncomfortable things to get there.\"",

Joe: Retaliation,\" \"Now You See Me 2\"), Chu said his view of \"The Wizard of Oz\" \u2014 which, when he was a child, represented a dream of another, better place \u2014 has changed since he was a kid. \"I think that that Yellow Brick Road is no longer the path that you just keep following, because there is no wizard there that's gonna give you your heart's desire,\" he said. \"Life is a series of walking adventures. And as you're walking, smell the flowers and feel the air. And maybe you'll realize you're actually flying.\"",
      "The show \"Wicked,\" with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, and based on Gregory Maguire's novel about the backstory of the Wicked Witch of the West, opened on Broadway in 2003. It won three Tony Awards. For the film adaptation, the show has been split in half (Part Two opens this November). Far from the candy-colored vaudevillian Oz that the 1939 classic projected, \"Wicked\" has a darker subtext about tyranny and civil rights. A rebellion builds against the Wizard and the increasingly autocratic rule coming from the Emerald City, which draws Elphaba (best actress nominee Cynthia Erivo) to become a resistance figure; her empathy leads to her becoming an outcast.",
      "At the center of the narrative is the connection between Elphaba and Glinda (best supporting actress nominee Ariana Grande). Their frenemy relationship begins at Shiz University, but evolves as they compete for the attention of the dean of sorcery (Michelle Yeoh), and of a hunk (Jonathan Bailey), and then join as friends to meet the Wizard.",
      "In this scene, the hunk, Fiyero, a transfer student at Shiz University, makes his case for living less studiously, especially as it affords more chances to engage in a rapturous dance number in the school's library:",
      "This behind-the-scenes featurette shows how Erivo performed her flying stunts while singing \"Defying Gravity.\" \u00a0And yes, the \"Wicked\" cast were not performing to pre-recorded vocal tracks; for most of the film, Grande, Erivo, et al, were recorded singing on set by live sound mixer Simon Hayes (an Oscar-winner for \"Les Miserables\"). While it's as impressive as Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet singing live on set for \"A Complete Unknown,\" Bob Dylan wasn't dangling in the air from a broomstick.",
      "Hayes told Playbill.com, \"There's something within the breath and the cadence of the way that the lips are moving, the breath that you're hearing as someone's walking and singing live, that just sounds real \u2014 because it is real. There's also something within the acoustic of the voice that matches the set we see, because it's a real acoustic. It's not synthetic rebuilt digital acoustic.\" Hayes is part of the sound recording and mixing team nominated for an Oscar.",
      "Watch this featurette giving a more detailed look at how the sound of \"Wicked\" was captured:",
      "Speaking of the film adaptation, Maguire told CBS Boston, \"The fact that the story of 'Wicked' continues to be pertinent 30 years after it was first published shocks me, saddens me a little bit, because it's about social ills and political stress, but also encourages me because it means we're still looking for guidance and for comfort.\"",

Baker distinguished himself by winning all four awards for the same movie, while Disney won for four different projects at the 1954 ceremony.

      "Zoe Salda\u00f1a \u2014 who became the first American of Dominican descent to win an Oscar \u2014 won best supporting actress, one of just two wins for \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" on Sunday night.",

      "O'Brien kept things moving in the broadcast and delivered some few comedic interludes, including a musical number in which he sang about not wasting the audience's time.",
      "The Oscars ceremony was broadcast on ABC on Sunday night from the Dolby Theatre at Ovation Hollywood, in Los Angeles. \"Anora\" went home with five awards, including best picture. See the full list of winners here.",
      "Who is Conan O'Brien?",
      "Conan O'Brien is best known for hosting the late-night talk shows \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien,\" \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\" and \"Conan.\"",
      "O'Brien, now 61, spent nearly three decades as a late-night host. In 2015, he became the \"longest-working current late night talk show host\" in the U.S., following David Letterman's retirement, according to TBS.",
      "This was his first time as the Oscar host, but he has done the honors for other high-profile awards shows, including hosting the Emmys in 2002 and 2006.",
      "Before he became a well-known TV personality, O'Brien was a writer for \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Simpsons.\"",
      "Who hosted the Oscars in the past?",

      "\"He joins an iconic roster of comedy greats who have served in this role, and we are so lucky to have him center stage for the Oscars,\" said Craig Erwich, president of the Disney Television Group, when O'Brien was named.",

      "That year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences decided against having a host for the first time in 30 years and didn't have an official host again until 2022, when Regina Hall, Amy Schumer and Wanda Sykes co-hosted the ceremony.

    "published": "Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:58:46 -0500",
    "summary": "Has the rise of streaming services, and the ability to watch movies on mobile phones, changed what we expect, or want, movies to be? A leading filmmaker, critic, and movie executives discuss the evolution of Hollywood's \"Dream Factory.\"",
    "story": [
      "Hollywood has been re-inventing itself for more 100 years. Change is part of the culture. But a pocket-sized \"Sunset Boulevard\"? That's not a close-up!",
      "We visited the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. Built in 1922, it was home of the very first Hollywood premiere, when Douglas Fairbanks debuted \"Robin Hood\" there. It was a big, spectacular night in Tinsel Town. Today, the Egyptian is owned by the world's largest streaming service, Netflix, which spent $70 million to renovate the movie palace.",
      "Why? According to Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, seeing movies in a theater is inspiring. \"I could think back to my first time being in a movie theater watching 'Jaws' at 11 years old. And I remember like it was yesterday \u2013 popcorn went this way, and the soda went this way, and the audience screamed. And that's a very unique and different experience.\"",
      "And an increasingly distant one. Today, screens are smaller, and ticket prices higher. It all leads to a common refrain: \"They don't make 'em like they used to.\"",
      "\"It's probably like everything else; the thing we grew up on is what we want,\" said Sarandos. \"It's oftentimes the art forms move on, and advances in ways that we kind of miss the old version of it. But they do make movies like they used to. And I think they're better than ever.\"",
      "That, of course, is debatable. What's not in doubt is that the big movies are far more predictable than ever. In 2024, the top 15 films at the box office were all franchises, sequels, or reboots.",
      "Sarandos said, \"The business has become very stratified. Either movies are gigantic spectaculars built to make billions of dollars, or they're very small, independent films. And there's not much in the middle anymore.\"",
      "Tom Rothman, who runs Sony's motion picture group, said, \"Movies still do really well, and big movies are still really big, right? But what's missing at the moment, I believe, is a range and a breadth of originality.\"",
      "Rothman, like Sarandos, is among the most powerful people in this business. His films do stream on Netflix, but only after they play in theaters. \"You can have quality or you can have quantity; it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have both quality and quantity together,\" said Rothman. \"What does streaming have? It has quantity. Okay, so that's a very broad, wide net. And \u2026 it's a very low bar.\"",
      "Nancy Meyers has made films that have earned more than $1.5 billion. She's the writer and director of hit romantic comedies like \"The Holiday,\" \"Something's Gotta Give,\" and \"It's Complicated.\" She believes the shift to, let's call it \"the super-hero formula\" has killed off the types of movies many of us have loved for generations.",
      "\"There is an enormous difference,\" Meyers said. \"I felt in the '90s a freedom to have ideas that people would want to make \u2013 I wasn't worried that they wouldn't be open to the kind of movies that I make.\"",
      "\"Creativity and originality, you saw as an asset?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, I did!\" she laughed. \"Character, wit, comedy, heart, big screen. I had no crystal ball. I couldn't see into the future of how movies were gonna change.\"",
      "The change, says Meyers, means films like \"Chinatown,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" even \"Dirty Dancing\" might not get made today. \"Movies, it's always been a business to make money, always,\" she said. \"But they were less afraid, I think. They were less afraid. They took more chances.\"",
      "Michael Schulman, who writes about movies and culture for The New Yorker, and is author of the book \"Sscar Wars,\" said, \"I would love for the movies to be a little bit less like they used to. Every two seconds there's a new 'Superman,' 'Beetlejuice,' 'Lion King,' 'Alien,' 'Mission: Impossible,' 'Bridget Jones,' 'Indiana Jones.' The goal is to not come up with the next great idea, but to excite the shareholders about a sure bet for the next quarter.\"",
      "Schulman says the movies we grew up on are still out there, produced by the independent studios behind \"Anora\" (Neon), \"The Brutalist\" (A24), and other best picture nominees. Schulman said, \"I often hear people say when the list comes out for the Academy Awards, 'Well, I haven't heard of half of those movies.' \u00a0If you go to the movie theater and they have ten screens showing 'Captain America: Brave New World' and no 'Brutalist,' then there's your problem.\"",
      "Netflix's Sarandos said, \"Even now, the average American goes to the movie theaters twice a year. The average Netflix member watches seven movies a month. So, I feel like that's gotta be good for the business, and it's gotta be good for the art of storytelling to have a platform, and an audience of 700 million people who still watch movies, when they could watch TikTok videos, they could watch YouTube clips, they could be listening to podcasts. But they still watch movies.\"",
      "What Sarandos knows (and what many of us may be trying to avoid admitting) is this:\u00a0 If they don't make movies like they used to, it might be because we don't watch 'em like we used to. \"There's all this opportunity, I think, to get the history of this art form, the history of storytelling, the history of humans, on the screen,\" he said. \"If the screen is gigantic here, or a good-sized at home, or even small on your phone, I don't think it's sacrilege for someone to watch a great movie on their phone. I'd much rather them do that than not watch movies at all.\"",
      "Tom Rothman and Nancy Meyers concede there's value in streaming movies at home. But what they want \u2013 and what they believe the audience wants \u2013 is something cinematic.",
      "\"The movie experience is not on your phone,\" Rothman said. \"A movie experience is a collective, big-screen experience. You're there, you're in the dark.\"",
      "Hollywood, said Meyers, \"used to be called a dream factory, right? And somebody's dream is up on the screen \u2013 somebody's version of a world that you get pulled into and you get sucked into. The lights come up at the end and, you know, you've been somewhere. You've had an experience when we're in a movie theater. That's what a movie is.\"",
      "Watch an extended interview with Nancy Meyers:",
      "I said, \"There are movies being made that meet the standard of bold originality. But there aren't many. And it feels \u2013 and maybe it always felt this at all moments where there was a sea change in Hollywood \u2013 but it feels like the hill is too steep to climb.\"",
      "\"I love that question,\" said Rothman. \"The hill is steep, and the climb is hard. But it is not too steep, and it is not too hard, if you're tough and bold enough, right? And if it were easy, anybody could do it. And it's not easy. And you have to be willing to risk, and you have to be willing to fail.\"",
      "His advice? \"Tighten up your boots and climb.\"",

    "summary": "As host of \"The Tonight Show\" for 30 years, Johnny Carson was the king of late-night TV. But the public rarely saw his private side. A new biography, \"Carson the Magnificent,\" examines the late-night host's enduring impact, and his difficulties off-camera.",
    "story": [
      "It may not look like much now, but once upon a time, Stage 1 at the Burbank Studios was where the king of comedy held court, addressing his subjects at the end of each day. Johnny Carson presided over not just late night, but American popular culture.",
      "\"Johnny Carson was the biggest star in America,\" said writer Mike Thomas. \"Movie stars, rock stars, I don't think anybody was bigger than Johnny, because he was on night after night after night.\"",
      "Thomas' new book is \"Carson the Magnificent,\" a biography of Carson his late friend Bill Zehme started.",
      "Everybody who was anybody appeared on \"The Tonight Show,\" and 17 million Americans tuned in \u2013 many from their beds. It was Johnny Carson vs. sleep, and sleep usually lost. \"It did!\" said Thomas. \"I think Johnny brought a lot of people peace at the end of the day. People love to laugh, but I think he gave them hope that the world would go on the next day no matter what was happening.\"",
      "His audience \u2013 more than triple the size of all three current network late-night shows combined \u2013 made him the national agenda setter of the 1960s, '70s, and '80s.\u00a0 \"Johnny would say things and do things that became water cooler conversation the next morning,\" said Thomas.",
      "It also made Johnny the pre-eminent Hollywood talent broker for several generations. Fifty-seven years after comedian Robert Klein made the first of his 97 appearances on \"The Tonight Show,\" he's still grateful for the rocket fuel career boost that Carson's imprimatur provided. \"He's one of the most important people in my life, and we were not personal friends,\" Klein said.",
      "For his career, Klein said Carson was the most important: \"Appearances on that show were everything. I am a creature of 'The Tonight Show.' That was the vertebra of my career.\"",
      "Comedian George Wallace knew what was on the line when he did Carson: an invitation to \"The Tonight Show\" was a necessary bullet point on his resume \u2013 and each appearance was a climb up comedy's Everest. And then, when the routine would end, comedians would look nervously at the desk, waiting to see if Carson gave then the OK. \"Always got that,\" said Wallace.",
      "I asked, \"Were you looking for it?\"",
      "\"Hell, yeah. I was looking for it!\" he said.",
      "But what he was also looking for was a gesture from Carson to come over to the couch. \"I didn't get that,\" he said.",
      "Forty years later, this big-time comedy headliner still feels he didn't make the \"Tonight Show\" summit. I asked, \"What did that mean to get called over?\"",
      "\"That meant that you're in,\" said Wallace. \"You got called over, you're in the club.\" He said the fact that he did get that \"kinda hurts today.\"",
      "All that power, rested in the hands of a complicated man: master connector at work, cold and aloof at home. \"I think there were two Johnnys to a certain degree,\" said Thomas. \"On screen, impossibly cool guy. But there was also the side of Johnny that was introverted off-screen. I think some of the aloofness may have been introversion.\"",
      "In Mike Wallace's classic \"60 minutes\" profile in 1979, Carson acknowledged the dichotomy. He said, \"If I pulled out my old high school annual book and read some of the things, people might say, 'Oh he's conceited, he's aloof.' Actually that was more shy. See, when I'm in front of an audience, it's a different thing.\"",
      "Life with no audience was challenging for Carson. He was married four times. \"Johnny needed to be married for some reason; he needed to be with someone,\" said Thomas. \"He didn't need to stay married. They would fall out. Johnny's behavior would pry them apart. They just never lasted.\"",
      "But actress Dyan Cannon has a different story to tell. \"Aloof and cold? Never.\" She described him as \"Warm, open, willing. I've never known anyone like him. I've never known anyone like Johnny.\"",
      "And this from a woman who was married to Cary Grant. \"Cary was more of an enigma,\" said Cannon. \"Much more of a, 'Can I approach him or can't I?'\u00a0 But people would approach Johnny as if he were family.\"",
      "\"So, it was a different kind of star?\" I asked.",
      "\"There was nobody as big a star as Johnny.\"",
      "In a \"Tonight Show\" episode from October 1985, where Cannon and Carson are chatting, she flustered the normally unflappable Carson as she held his hand. \"Hi, sweetheart,\" she said.",
      "\"We've gone out a couple of times, right?\" he said.",
      "Cannon erupted in laughter \u2013 as did Cannon today, re-watching the video. \"He still makes me laugh,\" she said.",
      "Asked what exactly was going on there, Cannon laughed again: \"Well, you will never know! You will never, never know!\"",
      "\"You gotta give me a little somethin' here.\"",
      "\"Oh, no, I don't!\" she laughed.",
      "To hear her tell it, this was not a man who had trouble understanding women. \"How do I describe a relationship where you're so intimate with somebody, and yet, you haven't been intimate physically? We were closer than that.\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you describe it as a love affair?\"",
      "\"Yes, absolutely, a love affair,\" Cannon said. \"Absolutely. Real love. Physically, we were never together. But spiritually, we were.\"",
      "\"In some ways, it sounds like you're describing the love of your life?\"",
      "\"Isn't that interesting?\" said Cannon. \"Wow. Hope you're hearing this, Johnny!\"",
      "Maybe Carson was just like so many of us, full of contradictions \u2026 only ours aren't examined by millions under the brightest lights our culture has to offer. Whoever Johnny Carson was, safe to say, in our deeply fragmented culture, there will never be another.",
      "As Mike Thomas put it, \"We're all siloed. We're all watching things that either confirm our own biases or that are attuned to our own specific sense of humor. There will never be that communal experience again where people watch the show at the same time and then talk about the show the next day. It was a communal experience. That was part of the magic of Carson: community.\"",

      "What set Hackman apart? \"He was definitely part of a crop of interesting young Hollywood actors that kind of reinvented the mold,\" Rooney said. \"They were getting away from the traditional movie star, into something more approaching real people. He wasn't sort of a matinee idol-look, but it was at the point when people were looking beyond that to try and find some other kind of realism in movies.\"",
      "In \"Mississippi Burning,\" Brad Dourif's racist deputy received a close shave from Hackman's FBI agent. \"I made sure that the razor was actually not sharp!\" Dourif said.",

    "summary": "Many actors have launched their careers in horror movies. But two of our most acclaimed stars are now headlining a low-budget horror film: \"The Rule of Jenny Pen,\" about a psychopath terrorizing his fellow nursing home residents with a sinister doll puppet.",
    "story": [
      "It might be known as winter elsewhere, but in Hollywood, they call it \"awards season\" \u2026 and just about everyone's in town for tonight's grand finale. One of the stars of \"Conclave,\" John Lithgow, is looking forward to it. \"Yes, I haven't been to the Oscars in years.\"",
      "Lithgow says he really likes playing the bad guy.",
      "\"Everything you do seems like it's a lot of fun for you,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, I try to find things that are fun,\" Lithgow said. \"I don't go looking for them. They come to me. By now, I'm on a short list of actors, who is well known for being ready, willing, and able to do just about anything. So, wild roles come my way. Nothing normal!\"",
      "Also in town: esteemed actor Geoffrey Rush. He might live Down Under, but he's picked up a few awards up here, including a Tony, an Oscar, and an Emmy, or as he puts it, \"a TOE.\"",
      "We got both Rush and Lithgow in the same room to talk about something they've done together. In \"The Rule of Jenny Pen,\" Rush plays a wheelchair-bound stroke patient recovering in a nursing home, and Lithgow is the merciless bully who terrorizes his fellow residents, often with a sinister doll puppet, named Jenny Pen.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Rule of Jenny Pen,\" click on the video player below:",
      "If it looks like a low-budget horror film, that's because it is!",
      "\"Lot of times, this is how people get their start in the business \u2013 they do a low-budget horror movie,\" I said.",
      "\"This is where we ended up!\" said Rush.",
      "\"Geoffrey's just one of the great actors,\" said Lithgow. \"And you just read the script and said, 'This is a hell of a double act.'\"",
      "\"I thought I was reading for the doll!\" said Rush.",
      "Lithgow's character starts out as merely sinister, and quickly graduates to terrifying. It's the classic horror film villain, and for Lithgow, a role with teeth.",
      "Rush said, \"Typical John, he said, 'I've had some teeth made.' And I thought, 'You're my kind of actor,' because really, the first time I saw the face, I just went, 'This guy is creepy.'\"",
      "\"Look, we're in the impact business,\" Lithgow said. \"You're after making people laugh, cry, or scream out in terror. And this was scream-out-in-terror time, with deep feeling sort of invested in it.\"",
      "Lithgow's been evoking deep feelings for more than half a century. But before he was the acclaimed movie star. He was the acclaimed stage actor, the guy in David Storey's play \"The Changing Room\" who made winning a Tony look easy, picking up the award just two weeks after making his first appearance on a Broadway stage. \"I think I must have the record for the quickest win sprint from Broadway debut to a Tony Award,\" he said.",
      "Rush has a similar story: He also won a Tony for his Broadway debut, 2009's \"Exit the King.\" And the movie \"Shine,\" about real-life pianist David Helfgott, was only his second feature film. He still can't believe he took home the Oscar for best actor. \"It still doesn't make sense,\" he said.",
      "But it was hardly beginner's luck. Both Rush and Lithgow have had once-in-a-lifetime roles \u2026. again and again.",
      "I asked, \"Has there ever been a role that the guy sitting next to you had that you looked at and said either, 'Wow. That was perfect,' or, 'Ooh, I wish I could have played that'?\"",
      "Lithgow said, \"I don't know. I defer to an actor who does a much better job than I could possibly do in that role. I was the second choice for Hannibal Lecter. If Tony Hopkins had turned it down, it was coming to me. And there's no way I could have played that part as well as he did.\"",
      "\"Wow, that's a bold statement,\" said Rush.",
      "\"It's true! And I feel that way about Geoffrey in 'Shine.' That was his role. It belonged to him. And there's no point being \u2026\"",
      "\"What John doesn't know is that I got offered most of the roles that he's got first!\" Rush laughed.",
      "Truth is, just about any role they play is iconic. And with director James Ashcroft's \"Jenny Pen,\" they get to do something extra-special: act their age.",
      "Rush recalled, \"I said to James Ashcroft, 'How old is this judge in the film?' He said, 'How old are you now?' I said, 'I'm 73.' He said, 'Let's make him 73.' And that's the first time I've played my own age.\"",
      "Lithgow said, \"Geoffrey and I have the great advantage of having grown to a certain age where we are each other's only competition. You get the great old man roles dealing with big issues like mortality and facing the loss of your own viability and the loss of your own cognition. It's been a blessing. I mean, my career has sort of aged along with me. And who would have believed I would still be going strong at this point?\"",

      "A survey conducted by University of North Carolina Charlotte and other institutions found that more than 90% of employees occasionally experience these \"meeting hangovers,\" with over half reporting that these negative effects hurt their overall workflow and productivity.",
      "\"A meeting hangover is the idea that when we have a bad meeting, we just don't leave it at the door. It sticks with us and it negatively affects our productivity,\" said Steven Rogelberg, a professor at UNC Charlotte and author of \"The Surprising Science of Meetings.\"",
      "The study found that employees often ruminate about bad meetings and feel compelled to share their frustrations with colleagues, creating what Rogelberg terms \"co-rumination\" that can spread negative impacts throughout an organization.",

      "\"Keep the attendee list as small as possible,\" Rogelberg said. \"Remember that the more the leader talks, the lower the rating of effectiveness. Thus, the meeting leader needs to talk less and facilitate more.\"",
      "Rather than organizing agendas as topics to be discussed, Rogelberg suggests structuring them as questions to be answered.",

      "This question-based approach creates an engaging challenge that draws people in, he said, adding that \"if you just can't think of any questions, it likely means you don't need to create a meeting.\"",
      "For employees already suffering from meeting hangovers, Rogelberg suggests venting but centering on problem-focused conversations with colleagues.",
      "\"Chatting with your colleague about how to deal with the situation for the future, getting their thoughts, engaging in sense-making where you're trying to understand, taking different perspectives on what just happened \u2014 those types of conversations increase your skills and your resilience when you do have a bad meeting,\" Rogelberg said.",

      "The panel often largely adopts the WHO's recommendations without changes. However, the committee's input has also spurred major changes in recent years, like a push to abandon use of a now-extinct flu strain in the shots.",
      "The companies that manufacture influenza vaccines rely on the FDA each year to pick out the strains to use in shots made for the American market. The specific strains are chosen each year based on predictions of what flu variants will be circulating in the coming winter.",
      "That selection is usually done by the committee in early March, drawing in large part on recommendations from a meeting of the World Health Organization's advisers reviewing data on influenza from across the Northern Hemisphere.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-a-crypto-strategic-reserve-trump-bitcoin/",
    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:57:59 -0500",
    "summary": "A spike in cryptocurrency prices Monday morning after President Donald Trump's surprise Sunday announcement quickly fizzled by Monday afternoon.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said on social media Sunday that his administration is working toward creating a \"crypto strategic reserve\" that will include bitcoin and ethereum, along with lesser-known cryptocurrencies XRP, solana, and cardano. He later followed up with another post saying his planned reserve would also include bitcoin and ether, the two most popular cryptocurrencies.",
      "The announcement helped crypto prices rebound after recent sell-offs, but only for a few hours. After rising to $90,000 Monday morning, bitcoin fell to roughly $87,000, or 7.3%, by Monday afternoon. Ethereum tumbled 14.6% to $2,153. Massive price spikes in XRP, solana and cardano also fizzled, dropping 12.1%, 13% and 12.3%, respectively.",
      "Nic Puckrin, financial analyst, investor and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, said in a note that the cause of the temporary price boost was most likely a \"combination of 'hopium' with a classic short squeeze,\" adding that more concrete information on the crypto reserve plan is needed to reassure investors of its worth.",
      "\"While the crypto reserve announcement was a bullish catalyst for crypto prices in the short term, its long-term impact remains questionable. For one thing, no actual details have been disclosed yet,\" Puckrin said.",
      "That said, the creation of digital currency reserve is a milestone moment for bitcoin and blockchain technology.",
      "\"The launch of a U.S. crypto strategic reserve marks a pivotal moment for digital assets, reflecting a major step in the government's engagement with the crypto industry,\" said Federico Brokate, head of the U.S. business at 21Shares, in an analyst note. \"This initiative not only reinforces Bitcoin's role as a maturing store of value but also highlights the importance of blockchain networks like ethereum, solana, XRP and cardano in financial infrastructure, payments and decentralized finance.\"",
      "What is a crypto strategic reserve?",
      "As described in the president's executive order\u00a0from January 23, the crypto strategic reserve would be a national stockpile of digital assets created under a federal regulatory framework developed by the newly established Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets.",
      "The working group will be chaired by high ranking officials, including the White House AI & crypto czar, the secretary of the Treasury and chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, among others.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump pledged support for a \"strategic national bitcoin\" stockpile, which would include bitcoin the U.S. government has previously seized in law enforcement actions. Sunday's announcement was the first time he advocated for the government to hold other types of cryptocurrencies.",
      "How the crypto strategic reserve would be structured and maintained is not yet clear, as the White House did not immediately provide additional details, including how much of each type of cryptocurrency Trump wants the U.S. to hold, and how the government would acquire them.",
      "But more information could be revealed this week, as Trump has also recently announced he will speak at and host industry leaders on Friday at a White House \"Crypto Summit.\"",
      "\"The first White House Crypto Summit on Friday will be crucial to watch,\" said Puckrin. \"We will be waiting to see who will be there, what will be discussed, and whether any actual steps toward implementation are outlined. The key question is, how will they fund and legislate this reserve? Until we have some answers, there's little substance to support this rally, and it could fizzle out as quickly as it started.\"",
      "What's the point of a strategic crypto reserve?",
      "Similar to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which protects the U.S. economy from disruptions in oil supplies, a national crypto reserve would help diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risks, according advocates of the plan.",
      "Critics, however, say the volatility of cryptocurrencies makes them a poor choice as a reserve asset.",
      "Potential hurdles",
      "Creating a crypto strategic reserve is likely to require an act from Congress, just as with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was created in December 1975 when then President Gerald Ford signed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.",
      "Also, the inclusion of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin is likely to face sustained pushback among some corners of the heavily divided cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin is the oldest and by far most popular cryptocurrency, and accounts for more than half of the world's global crypto market cap.",
      "The president has cast himself as hero to the crypto industry, which he said in his announcement had been the target of \"years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration.\" The crypto industry felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win election.",
      "The first several weeks of his administration have seen several moves to boost crypto, including ending or pausing high-profile enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Crypto prices soared after Trump's victory last year, and when the price of bitcoin first crossed $100,000 in early December, Trump took credit and posted \"YOU'RE WELCOME!!!\" on social media.",
      "But prices have fallen since Trump's inauguration and Trump has faced criticism, including from allies within the crypto industry, for helping launch a personal meme coin just before he took office that has since collapsed in value.",
      "The crash of meme coins linked to First Lady Melania Trump and Argentine President Javier Milei, along with a massive hack of a major cryptocurrency exchange that the FBI has said was undertaken by North Korea, have also dimmed enthusiasm for crypto.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's tariffs on three key U.S. trade partners, which are set to go into effect\u00a0Tuesday, could drive up automobile costs for U.S. consumers by thousands of dollars and put a dent in U.S. car sales, industry analysts and U.S.-based automakers say.",
      "The 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers.",
      "The price hikes from Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to be substantial enough that some car buyers might balk at the higher costs, according to AEG CEO Patrick Anderson.",
      "\"Our analysis shows the proposed tariffs would have a very big effect on North American assembled cars by multiple automakers,\" Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them.\"",
      "Some product lines and equipment combination could become uneconomical for automakers to continue producing, he noted. \"It would be a huge disruption to the industry,\" Anderson said.",
      "Which vehicles could see the greatest price increases?",
      "The range of added costs on vehicles could run from $4,000 to $10,000, with the cost of producing some electric vehicles that rely heavily on components from China rising by as much as $12,200, according to AEG's analysis.",
      "Here are the projected impacts of the tariffs on some types of popular vehicles, according to the study:",
      "Battery-powered electric crossover vehicles: +$12,200Full-size SUV: $9,000Pickup truck: $8,000Small car: $6,200",

      "Full-size SUV: $9,000",
      "Pickup truck: $8,000",
      "Small car: $6,200",
      "Tariff-driven cost increases may lead to a \"potential loss of sales\" for domestic automakers, given that consumers might turn to the used car market, or seek out automobiles assembled in Japan, for example, for cheaper alternatives, Anderson added.",
      "\"Or, they could decide simply not to buy one at all,\" he said.",
      "Automobile supply chains are complex because they involve numerous parts, some of which can cross borders more than once over the course of the assembly process. With tariffs added to the equation, costs could quickly escalate for automakers.",
      "\"The automobile sector, in particular, is likely to see considerable negative consequences, not only because of the disruption of the supply chains that crisscross the three countries in the manufacturing process, but also because of the expected increase in the price of vehicles, which can dampen demand,\" Cornell University professor of government and public policy Gustavo Flores-Macias said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Dan Hearsch, Americas leader of the automotive & industrial practice at AlixPartners, a global consulting firm, said the tariffs will present at least a momentary advantage for manufacturers that assemble vehicles in Japan, Korea or Europe, for example.",
      "\"For automakers that don't import from Canada or Mexico, they'll end up with a little bit of an advantage, because they won't be hit with this brand-new tariff,\" he said. \"So for some period of time, vehicles coming in that aren't subject to additional tariffs will have a big advantage over domestic companies, or those that are producing in Canada, Mexico or the U.S.\"",
      "He added, \"It's basically penalizing companies relative to those that are importing vehicles from other places, for now.\"",
      "Ford CEO says tariffs would have \"huge impact\"",
      "In an earnings call with analysts on last month, Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley said a prolonged period of higher tariffs would wipe out the company's profits, drive up vehicle prices and slow economic growth.",
      "\"There is no question that tariffs at 25% level from Canada and Mexico, if they're protracted, would have a huge impact on our industry with billions of dollars of industry profits wiped out and adverse effect on the U.S. jobs as well as the entire value system in our industry,\" Farley said. \"Tariffs would also mean higher prices for customers.\"",

    "story": [
      "Stocks fell sharply on Monday after President Trump said he has decided to move forward\u00a0with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, with Wall Street concerned that the import duties could threaten U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "The broad-based S&P 500 index tumbled 105 points, or 1.8%, to 5,850, marking its biggest one-day decline so far this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index shed 2.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5%.",
      "Additionally, new data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is forecasting an economic contraction in the first quarter, with gross domestic product projected to\u00a0decline an annualized 2.8% in the current quarter \u2014 a reversal from growth of almost 3% that was forecast as recently as early February.",
      "Economists are sounding alarms about growing economic uncertainty caused by Mr. Trump's tariffs, which could push up prices in the U.S. and undermine the president's pledge to eliminate the inflation that ate into consumers' purchasing power during the Biden administration. At the same time, recent economic data is showing some cracks in the financial health of U.S. households, with consumer confidence dropping in February to its lowest in four years.",
      "\"We expect that inflation in the U.S. will be stoked by between 1.1% and 1.4% from tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with another 0.7% coming from those slapped on China,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, in an email. \"The economic implications are vast: the price of everyday goods will rise, corporate profits will feel the squeeze and consumers will ultimately foot the bill.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Americans say their outlook for the next year is mixed, with more people likely to say the economy is getting worse than better, according to CBS News polling. Consumers say they believe the economy and inflation should be Mr. Trump's top issues, but most say they see the president prioritizing other issues, such as downsizing the federal workforce, another CBS News poll found.",
      "The push behind Mr. Trump's tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump views tariffs \u2014 taxes on imports \u2014 as an economic elixir that can restore factories to the American heartland, raise money for the government and pressure foreign countries to do what he wants.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump put tariffs on most Chinese goods and on imported solar panels, washing machines, steel and aluminum. The tax increases might have raised prices on those items, but they had little or no impact on overall inflation, which remained modest. Nor did they do much to restore factory jobs.",
      "Economists agree that a second Trump trade war could be far costlier than the first.",
      "\"That was then. This is now,'' said trade analyst William Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, his trade team carefully focused its tariff hit list to avoid or at least delay the impact on consumers. They targeted industrial products and not those \"that would show up on Walmart's shelves,\" said Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official. \"That tamped down the impact.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's latest round of tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession, said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco.",
      "Because U.S. businesses must bear the added costs from tariffs, they largely pass on the costs to American consumers. That, in turn, could weigh on consumer spending at a time when households are still grappling with the fallout from post-pandemic inflation.",
      "The Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through widespread job cuts, could have a ripple effect, curtailing spending by U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

      "The president called TSMC the \"most powerful company in the world,\" and said the economic development announcement is a \"matter of economic security\" and a \"matter of national security for us.\"",
      "The Wall Street Journal was first to report the investment pledge. TSMC was promised $6.6 billion in funding under the Biden-era CHIPS and SCIENCE Act of 2022, and announced plans for its first U.S. plant in Arizona.",
      "The anticipated announcement comes amid Mr. Trump's threats to impose tariffs on semiconductor chip imports, which TSMC could avoid by manufacturing the chips in the U.S. The president has also floated expedited permits for companies that invest at least $1 billion in the U.S. Mr. Trump noted Monday that if Wei's company made the chips in Taiwan and exported them to the U.S., they'd face 25% tariffs.",
      "Speaking at the White House, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick credited the tariffs with the TSMC announcement.",
      "\"Under the Biden administration, TSMC received a $6 billion grant, and that encouraged them to build $65 billion. So America gave TSMC 10% of the money to build here. And now you're seeing the power of Donald Trump's presidency,\" Lutnick said. \"TSMC, the greatest manufacturer of chips in the world, is coming to America with a hundred-billion-dollar investment, and of course that is backed by the fact that they can come here because they can avoid paying tariffs.\"",
      "Semiconductor chips are small but critical components for today's technology, with small pieces of silicone that contain electronic circuits. Semiconductor chips are found in everything from iPhones to cars, and demand has boomed in recent years thanks to the explosion in artificial intelligence, which requires an enormous amount of computing power.",
      "\"Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"And really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy, powering everything from AI to automobiles to advanced manufacturing.\"",
      "The vast majority of semiconductor chips are manufactured in Asian countries, with Taiwan at the top, and the Trump administration is hoping to draw more manufacturing to the U.S. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have viewed increasing U.S. chip manufacturing a matter of national security.",
      "\"We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in American factories with American skill and American labor,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And that's exactly what we're doing. As you know, Taiwan pretty much has a monopoly on that market.\"",

    "story": [
      "A recent Harvard Business Review\u00a0article identified a phenomenon called \"meeting hangovers\" which new research shows can derail productivity well beyond the meeting itself.",
      "A survey conducted by University of North Carolina Charlotte and other institutions found that more than 90% of employees occasionally experience these \"meeting hangovers,\" with over half reporting that these negative effects hurt their overall workflow and productivity.",
      "\"A meeting hangover is the idea that when we have a bad meeting, we just don't leave it at the door. It sticks with us and it negatively affects our productivity,\" said Steven Rogelberg, a professor at UNC Charlotte and author of \"The Surprising Science of Meetings.\"",
      "The study found that employees often ruminate about bad meetings and feel compelled to share their frustrations with colleagues, creating what Rogelberg terms \"co-rumination\" that can spread negative impacts throughout an organization.",
      "Common factors contributing to negative meeting experiences include unnecessary meetings that could have been emails, irrelevant agenda topics, poor facilitation, too many attendees, excessive length, domination by a few participants, and unclear decisions.",
      "Rogelberg recommends several strategies to prevent meeting hangovers:",
      "\"Keep the attendee list as small as possible,\" Rogelberg said. \"Remember that the more the leader talks, the lower the rating of effectiveness. Thus, the meeting leader needs to talk less and facilitate more.\"",
      "Rather than organizing agendas as topics to be discussed, Rogelberg suggests structuring them as questions to be answered.",
      "\"By framing agenda items as questions, you have a better sense of who really has to be invited to the meeting,\" he said. \"You know when to end the meeting and if the meeting has been successful \u2014 the questions have been answered.\"",
      "This question-based approach creates an engaging challenge that draws people in, he said, adding that \"if you just can't think of any questions, it likely means you don't need to create a meeting.\"",
      "For employees already suffering from meeting hangovers, Rogelberg suggests venting but centering on problem-focused conversations with colleagues.",
      "\"Chatting with your colleague about how to deal with the situation for the future, getting their thoughts, engaging in sense-making where you're trying to understand, taking different perspectives on what just happened \u2014 those types of conversations increase your skills and your resilience when you do have a bad meeting,\" Rogelberg said.",

    "summary": "Has the rise of streaming services, and the ability to watch movies on mobile phones, changed what we expect, or want, movies to be? A leading filmmaker, critic, and movie executives discuss the evolution of Hollywood's \"Dream Factory.\"",
    "story": [
      "Hollywood has been re-inventing itself for more 100 years. Change is part of the culture. But a pocket-sized \"Sunset Boulevard\"? That's not a close-up!",
      "We visited the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. Built in 1922, it was home of the very first Hollywood premiere, when Douglas Fairbanks debuted \"Robin Hood\" there. It was a big, spectacular night in Tinsel Town. Today, the Egyptian is owned by the world's largest streaming service, Netflix, which spent $70 million to renovate the movie palace.",
      "Why? According to Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, seeing movies in a theater is inspiring. \"I could think back to my first time being in a movie theater watching 'Jaws' at 11 years old. And I remember like it was yesterday \u2013 popcorn went this way, and the soda went this way, and the audience screamed. And that's a very unique and different experience.\"",
      "And an increasingly distant one. Today, screens are smaller, and ticket prices higher. It all leads to a common refrain: \"They don't make 'em like they used to.\"",
      "\"It's probably like everything else; the thing we grew up on is what we want,\" said Sarandos. \"It's oftentimes the art forms move on, and advances in ways that we kind of miss the old version of it. But they do make movies like they used to. And I think they're better than ever.\"",
      "That, of course, is debatable. What's not in doubt is that the big movies are far more predictable than ever. In 2024, the top 15 films at the box office were all franchises, sequels, or reboots.",
      "Sarandos said, \"The business has become very stratified. Either movies are gigantic spectaculars built to make billions of dollars, or they're very small, independent films. And there's not much in the middle anymore.\"",
      "Tom Rothman, who runs Sony's motion picture group, said, \"Movies still do really well, and big movies are still really big, right? But what's missing at the moment, I believe, is a range and a breadth of originality.\"",
      "Rothman, like Sarandos, is among the most powerful people in this business. His films do stream on Netflix, but only after they play in theaters. \"You can have quality or you can have quantity; it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have both quality and quantity together,\" said Rothman. \"What does streaming have? It has quantity. Okay, so that's a very broad, wide net. And \u2026 it's a very low bar.\"",
      "Nancy Meyers has made films that have earned more than $1.5 billion. She's the writer and director of hit romantic comedies like \"The Holiday,\" \"Something's Gotta Give,\" and \"It's Complicated.\" She believes the shift to, let's call it \"the super-hero formula\" has killed off the types of movies many of us have loved for generations.",
      "\"There is an enormous difference,\" Meyers said. \"I felt in the '90s a freedom to have ideas that people would want to make \u2013 I wasn't worried that they wouldn't be open to the kind of movies that I make.\"",
      "\"Creativity and originality, you saw as an asset?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, I did!\" she laughed. \"Character, wit, comedy, heart, big screen. I had no crystal ball. I couldn't see into the future of how movies were gonna change.\"",
      "The change, says Meyers, means films like \"Chinatown,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" even \"Dirty Dancing\" might not get made today. \"Movies, it's always been a business to make money, always,\" she said. \"But they were less afraid, I think. They were less afraid. They took more chances.\"",
      "Michael Schulman, who writes about movies and culture for The New Yorker, and is author of the book \"Sscar Wars,\" said, \"I would love for the movies to be a little bit less like they used to. Every two seconds there's a new 'Superman,' 'Beetlejuice,' 'Lion King,' 'Alien,' 'Mission: Impossible,' 'Bridget Jones,' 'Indiana Jones.' The goal is to not come up with the next great idea, but to excite the shareholders about a sure bet for the next quarter.\"",
      "Schulman says the movies we grew up on are still out there, produced by the independent studios behind \"Anora\" (Neon), \"The Brutalist\" (A24), and other best picture nominees. Schulman said, \"I often hear people say when the list comes out for the Academy Awards, 'Well, I haven't heard of half of those movies.' \u00a0If you go to the movie theater and they have ten screens showing 'Captain America: Brave New World' and no 'Brutalist,' then there's your problem.\"",
      "Netflix's Sarandos said, \"Even now, the average American goes to the movie theaters twice a year. The average Netflix member watches seven movies a month. So, I feel like that's gotta be good for the business, and it's gotta be good for the art of storytelling to have a platform, and an audience of 700 million people who still watch movies, when they could watch TikTok videos, they could watch YouTube clips, they could be listening to podcasts. But they still watch movies.\"",
      "What Sarandos knows (and what many of us may be trying to avoid admitting) is this:\u00a0 If they don't make movies like they used to, it might be because we don't watch 'em like we used to. \"There's all this opportunity, I think, to get the history of this art form, the history of storytelling, the history of humans, on the screen,\" he said. \"If the screen is gigantic here, or a good-sized at home, or even small on your phone, I don't think it's sacrilege for someone to watch a great movie on their phone. I'd much rather them do that than not watch movies at all.\"",
      "Tom Rothman and Nancy Meyers concede there's value in streaming movies at home. But what they want \u2013 and what they believe the audience wants \u2013 is something cinematic.",
      "\"The movie experience is not on your phone,\" Rothman said. \"A movie experience is a collective, big-screen experience. You're there, you're in the dark.\"",
      "Hollywood, said Meyers, \"used to be called a dream factory, right? And somebody's dream is up on the screen \u2013 somebody's version of a world that you get pulled into and you get sucked into. The lights come up at the end and, you know, you've been somewhere. You've had an experience when we're in a movie theater. That's what a movie is.\"",
      "Watch an extended interview with Nancy Meyers:",
      "I said, \"There are movies being made that meet the standard of bold originality. But there aren't many. And it feels \u2013 and maybe it always felt this at all moments where there was a sea change in Hollywood \u2013 but it feels like the hill is too steep to climb.\"",
      "\"I love that question,\" said Rothman. \"The hill is steep, and the climb is hard. But it is not too steep, and it is not too hard, if you're tough and bold enough, right? And if it were easy, anybody could do it. And it's not easy. And you have to be willing to risk, and you have to be willing to fail.\"",

      "Experts are expressing concern that steep new U.S. tariffs primed to take effect on March 4, along with planned levies on other trading partners, could fan inflation and slow the nation's growth \u2014 an economic malaise known as \"stagflation.\"",
      "President Trump on Thursday said on social media that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which had been delayed for a month while the sides negotiated, will now roll out\u00a0next week as scheduled. He also this week announced an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, on top of those already in place, set to kick in next week, while\u00a025% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are lined up for March 12. Sweeping reciprocal tariffs and levies on\u00a0automobile imports\u00a0may be deployed as soon as early April, while Mr. Trump has threatened to hit imports from the European Union with 25% duties.",
      "Mounting uncertainty about the scale and potential impact of such tariffs, including the \"somewhat abrupt and arbitrary way\" in which they've been announced, risks throttling spending by consumers and businesses, said Marcus Noland, director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan research firm.",
      "\"Normally I'd say tariffs alone would damage the economy, but won't send the U.S. into recession,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"What gives me pause about that now is the unsettling way that that the administration is going about its business and general confusion about tariffs. It's not so much the actual tariffs but confusion about them that's causing an increase in uncertainty and is really pushing down investment.\"",
      "EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said the Trump tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession. U.S. businesses would bear the added costs from taxes on imports and mostly pass them along to American consumers, which would weigh on spending.",
      "A recent survey from EY-Parthenon found that 50% of business executives said they would pass on two-thirds or more of any increased costs they incur from tariffs to consumers.",
      "\"In a world where your imports cost 25% more, or even 10% more, there is going to be a notable impact on prices and inflation,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That will lead to demand destruction, so if the administration presses too hard on the tariff front there is a negative effect on our import prices and on inflation.\"",
      "Fears of a trade war are raising concerns among businesses and consumers, he added. U.S. consumer confidence plunged in February in what was the biggest monthly decline in more than four years, a sign that growing uncertainty over Mr. Trump's policies is taking a toll, the Conference Board said this week.",
      "\"They are fearful of incoming inflation so if anything, the policies put in place have the tendency to be inflationary, and there is not only a risk of a recession, but stagnation,\" Daco said, referring to the periods intense economic distress in the 1970s marked by stagnant economic growth and high inflation.",
      "U.S. consumer spending fell in January compared to the previous month, dropping for the first time in nearly two years, according to data from the Commerce Department. The 0.5% slump was partly attributed to weather, but was also \"another illustration that President Trump's tariff threats are not sitting well with households,\" analysts with Capital Economics said in a report.",
      "Another potential drag on the economy, according to economists: the Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through mass job cuts. That will have a spillover effect and could limit spending at U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

    "summary": "\"We are already short-staffed as it is,\"one Social Security Administration employee said of the agency's plans to slash its workforce.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security Administration workers are warning that the Trump administration's plan to significantly shrink the agency could cause chaos and hinder their ability to provide service to the millions of retirees, disabled people and other Americans who rely on the program.",
      "The SSA's restructuring comes after President Trump vowed on the campaign trail not to touch the old-age and disability insurance program, which provides monthly financial payments to almost 70 million people, or about 1 in 5 Americans. At the same time, Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla who is serving as a close adviser to the president, are vowing to cut what they say is fraud and abuse across federal agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "But current Social Security employees caution that cutting the already strained Social Security workforce could impact beneficiaries in numerous ways, such as longer waits to qualify for disability benefits and for assistance on customer service issues.",
      "\"We are already short-staffed as it is,\" said one current Social Security Administration employee, an attorney who works on disability applications and who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern that speaking publicly could jeopardize his job at the agency.",
      "\"Right now we are working on applications generally from 2023-ish,\" he noted. But, he added, a significant workforce reduction could mean that \"easily the wait times will be extended by one year.\"",
      "Each year, thousands of people awaiting disability decisions die before they receive their benefits, with former Social Security Administration Commissioner Martin O'Malley telling Nextgov/FCW in 2024 that about 30,000 people died while awaiting their determinations during fiscal 2023.",
      "Most workers qualify for Social Security disability coverage through their payroll taxes, which provides a backstop in case you get injured and aren't able to continue working, the Social Security worker noted. But cutting agency staff likely means it could become even more difficult for many disabled workers to get their benefits approved, he added.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Cuts come amid boomers turning \"peak 65\"",
      "The SSA on Thursday sent an email to all employees stating that the agency would soon undergo a restructuring, including \"significant workforce reductions.\" On Friday, the agency said it plans to trim staffing to 50,000 workers, down from its current level of about 57,000 workers.",
      "The agency is also offering financial incentives ranging as high as $25,000 to some employees who choose to voluntarily resign.",
      "The agency's workforce cuts come as the ranks of Americans receiving Social Security benefits have swelled to an all-time high, largely due to the aging baby boomer population. An average of about 11,000 boomers are set to turn 65 each day this year through 2027, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from the Alliance for Lifetime Income.",
      "That demographic change, called \"peak 65,\" is causing major economic and societal changes, with Social Security on the receiving end. Since 2014, the number of retired workers and their dependents receiving Social Security payments has surged by almost 30%, reaching 54 million people as of last year, according to agency data.",
      "At the same time, the number of full-time workers at the Social Security Administration has declined almost 10% from about 63,000 employees in 2014 to about 57,000 workers in 2022, agency data\u00a0shows.",
      "Even before these pending cuts, some recipients were struggling with service issues at the Social Security Administration, Nancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've got wait times, you have phone calls that get dropped, you get put on hold for hours \u2014 and this will make it so much worse,\" she said.",
      "Long wait times for callers seeking help from the Social Security Administration's workforce was identified as a trouble spot in the agency's most recent\u00a0annual performance report. Its goal: To shave an average 34-minute on-hold wait time to 12 minutes, although the agency said it was evaluating that \"aspirational goal\" as it was unable to hire additional workers last year.",
      "Workers taking buyouts",
      "Some Social Security employees are already opting for the buyouts, which could lead to a brain drain at the administration, another agency employee told CBS MoneyWatch. The employee, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns for his job safety, noted that several people in his group told him they planned to accept buyout offers.",
      "Because Social Security workers with 25 years of experience are eligible for the buyouts, the agency will lose some of its most experienced workers, he added.",
      "\"You are going to see a slowdown in everything,\" he said.",
      "Morale at the agency is at \"an all-time low,\" a third Social Security employee said, who spoke on condition of anonymity as she is still employed at the agency.",
      "Employees were also distressed by Acting Social Security Commissioner Lee Dudek's response to Elon Musk's demand that workers detail five recent work accomplishments. In an email sent to staff, Dudek singled out firing probationary workers as one of his personal achievements. \"It left a very bad taste in our mouths,\" the employee said.",
      "Many agency workers receive modest salaries, the third Social Security worker added. All the Social Security employees who spoke with CBS MoneyWatch said they were drawn to the agency because they wanted to help people.",
      "About 80% of Social Security workers earn somewhere between Grades 5 to 12 on the federal general schedule pay scale, which includes a starting pay range between about $33,000 to $74,000 a year, agency data shows.",
      "Americans fund the Social Security Administration's services through their payroll taxes, or FICA contributions, noted Rich Couture, the spokesman for the Social Security General Committee of the American Federation of Government Employees.",
      "\"The public paid for access to services with their FICA contributions,\" Couture said. \"We're at a 50-year staffing low in the midst of a customer service crisis \u2014 now is the time for us to invest in Social Security with proper staffing to make further improvements.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 15:45:27 -0500",
    "summary": "The man who launched the Economic Blackout said he is \"trying to cause economic resistance, against the corporations and politicians,  to stand for the people.\"",
    "story": [
      "After years of railing against corporate greed on social media, John Schwarz had an idea that suddenly caught fire: an \"economic blackout\" aimed at resisting what he maintains is an alliance between corporations and politicians to rig the system against ordinary Americans.",
      "The 57-year-old Chicago resident, founder of the People's Union USA, the fledgling advocacy group leading the campaign, expresses surprise at suddenly finding himself and his movement in the spotlight. Yet while he initially found the attention overwhelming, Schwarz said that in other ways it's a moment he's been preparing for all of his life.",
      "\"I've been online for 10 years trying to do this in kind of a nice way, not really speaking as bluntly on specific topics,\" Schwarz told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And then after that, I said, no, this is great because this is exactly what I wanted to do. And I just dove in head first and we're not stopping.\"",
      "Schwartz, a father of three and meditation teacher, said the idea for a blackout came to him while recording the latest in a series of videos posted on social media in which he presents himself as a common man who is also president of the United States.",
      "\"When I was into about the third or fourth one of those, I said even a president should be calling for an economic blackout and to unionize citizens. And when I kind of said that, it sparked that idea in me. And I said, you know what, as a matter of fact let's do this. Let's do an economic blackout \u2014 get a bunch of people together for one day, if they want to take part and start something, and try to work on unionizing the people.\"",
      "Over the past month, word has spread quickly of the Feb. 28 Economic Blackout, which urges Americans to refrain from spending any money at any major retailer for 24 hours. The People's Union says it is apolitical and that its call for a boycott \u2014 communicated by punchy posts on Instagram and TikTok set to music, as well by text an email \u2014 is meant to fire a shot across the bow of corporate giants from Amazon to McDonald's.",
      "\"Mega corporations have driven up prices, underpaid their workers and outsourced jobs while raking in record profits,\" the group said on its website. \"Banks and financial institutions have trapped generations in debt, inflating interest rates and making homeownership nearly impossible. Politicians 'both left and right' have accepted corporate bribes, passed laws that serve billionaires and ignored the needs of the people they claim to represent.\"",
      "Schwarz said he grew up in the 1970s and '80s \"in the projects,\" referring to the subsidized housing where he was raised in Queens, New York. He describes that neighborhood as a melting pot of Jewish, Black, Polish, Russian and other families.",
      "\"We didn't walk around going, 'Oh, you're white, you're black, you're Russian.' It was just, we were all from the neighborhood,\" he said. \"I think there's a way to kind of get to that feeling with everyone in this country, because we're so divided today. We're more divided today on more subjects than any other time in history.\"",
      "Schwarz underlines that the goal of reunifying Americans is fundamental to him and the People's Union. His idols include Muhammad Ali, Martin Luther King Jr., social activist Abbie Hoffman, and politician and civil rights leader Harvey Milk, individuals he said he admires for dedicating their lives to speaking out 'for the people.' \"",
      "What does the People's Union USA stand for?",
      "Schwarz founded the People's Union USA only in February, and as a grassroots organization the group is still in the process of setting up its structure and registering as a legal entity. To cover the costs, Schwarz has set up a GoFundMe page with the goal of raising $100,000, and as of Friday has raised more than $90,000.",
      "Schwarz sees the blackout as a way for Americans to use their economic might in the form of their purchasing power to fight corporate greed and corrupt politicians.",
      "\"What we're doing here is trying to cause economic resistance, against the corporations and politicians, to stand for the people. I think people may be able to at some point begin to kind of realize those things they're letting divide us don't really exist,\" he said.",
      "Another goal for The People's Union is abolishing federal income\u00a0taxes for average Americans, which Schwarz said can be achieved by requiring large businesses to pay \"their fair share.\"",
      "Added Schwarz, \"And even, you know, the administration is just putting their foot in their mouth with wanting to do, you know, gold card visas for $5 million. So they're talking about bringing in more money, all the more reason we shouldn't have to pay federal taxes.\"",
      "Schwarz also favors imposing a government cap on corporate profits. \"Companies need to prove what their expenses are in comparison to their profits. And there has to be a reasonable cap.\"",
      "More broadly, Schwarz underlines the importance of Americans gaining a measure of freedom from an economic system that he believes normalizes financial struggle and traps people in a perpetual cycle of debt.",
      "What's the point of the boycotts?",
      "Schwarz doesn't expect the Economic Blackout to change things for the better overnight but he does think it will send corporations a message.",
      "\"We want companies to bend the knee \u2014 we've been kissing the ring our entire lives. It's time to turn that around,\" he said, adding \"We're the consumers. We are the economy. Without us, they're nothing.\"",
      "Schwarz said messages of support for the Economic Blackout have also been pouring in from people outside of the U.S. \"It's gone international, from Australia to Spain. Every country has messaged me, people from all over the world commenting on the videos. 'How can we stand in solidarity?'\"",
      "\"I just started telling them, you too, in your country, don't buy anything that day,\" he added.",
      "The Feb. 28 blackout began at 12 a.m. EST Friday and is scheduled to go on until 11:59 p.m. the same day. For the boycott, the People's Union is asking participants to refrain from making purchases, which includes avoiding fast food or filling their gas tanks. It adds that shoppers with emergencies or in need of essentials should support local small businesses and try not to use a credit or debit card.",
      "The group plans to hold a second broad-based economic blackout on March 28, but it's also organizing targeted boycotts against specific retailers \u2014 Walmart and Amazon \u2014 as well as global food giants Nestle and General Mills. For the boycott against Amazon, the organization is encouraging people to refrain from buying anything from Whole Foods, which the e-commerce company owns.",

      "Microsoft is pulling the plug on Skype, the pioneering Internet telecommunications and video call platform it bought\u00a0nearly 14 years ago for $8.5 billion.",
      "\"We will be retiring Skype in May 2025 to focus on Microsoft Teams (free), our modern communications and collaboration hub,\" already used by hundreds of millions of people at work, school and home,\" Jeff Teper, president of collaborative apps and platforms at the Redmond, Washington-based software company,\u00a0said on Friday in a statement.",
      "Microsoft in late 2012\u00a0scrapped its own instant-messaging\u00a0tool, Messenger, after buying Skype the prior year. But in the more than decade since, services including FaceTime, Messenger and WhatsApp have let people connect in ways that made it difficult for Skype to compete.",
      "The difficulties were illustrated in particular during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic that saw people\u00a0stuck at home flocking to Zoom. Microsoft launched Teams for consumers in 2020, while saying at the time it remained committed to Skype.",
      "Skype was launched in 2003 by entrepreneurs Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, with the company's name combining \"Sky\" with a reference to peer-to-peer networks, the technology that during the dotcom boom became an important new way for sharing online files and data.",
      "The company's founders first sold Skype to eBay in 2005 for $2.6 billion. Microsoft's acquisition in May of 2011, at the time the biggest ever purchase for the software maker, gave it access to a user base of about 170 million people who logged in to Skype each month. That count morphed to more than 300 million monthly users by 2016, but had shriveled to 36 million in 2023, Microsoft said.",
      "Those now using Skype will have time to log in to the Microsoft Teams app and have their message history, group chats and contacts available without having to create an additional account, according to Microsoft. Users can also opt to export their data to another app.",

    "story": [
      "It's not only the surging cost of eggs that is making breakfast pricier these days \u2014 the price of coffee is also spiking because of a confluence of factors.",
      "The cost of wholesale arabica beans \u2014 the most popular on the planet \u2014 surpassed $4 a pound for the first time this month and have doubled over the past year, running up from less than two bucks a pound in January 2024 to a record $4.30 a pound on February 13, 2025, according\u00a0to\u00a0futures contracts traded in New York.",
      "For consumers still grappling with high food costs, that means soaring prices in the grocery aisle. The retail price of ground coffee hit an all-time high of $7 a pound in January, up 75% from $4 in January 2020, government data\u00a0shows.",
      "Coffee drinkers are likely to see even steeper prices over the next three or four months, with Andrea Illy, chairman of Italian roaster and global retailer Illycaff\u00e8, recently\u00a0predicting\u00a0that bean prices could climb 25% this year.",
      "Unlike some products, coffee is viewed as essential by many consumers, making them more willing to pay up for their java fixes. Without a direct substitute for coffee, retailers and suppliers generally have greater room to raise their prices.",
      "\"Coffee, as we all know, it's a pass-through category,\" J.M. Smucker CEO Mark Smucker said in an earnings\u00a0call in November. \"We've been very pleased with our performance in the quarter, despite the fact that we continue to see significant inflation,\" said the executive, whose company's brands include Folgers and Cafe Bustelo.",
      "Cost of climate change",
      "As with the cost of other global commodities, supply and demand are a large part of the equation. Getting caffeinated is likely to become an ever-costlier proposition because of rising temperatures, droughts and excessive rains striking Brazil and Vietnam, the world's two biggest producers.",
      "The 2024 coffee growing season saw a drought followed by August frost in Brazil, and flooding in October came in the wake of a drought in Vietnam. Brazil's coffee exports during the month were down 7.4% year-over-year and Vietnam's December export fell nearly 40%, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from the International Coffee Organization.",
      "\"When the crop in Brazil does not produce as much coffee as expected in the year, that causes the prices to shoot up,\" Gregory Zomfotis, founder and CEO of Gregorys Coffee, told CBS News.",
      "\"Some of the major producers have really not seen the production levels that were expected and quite far from it, so that's caused a severe spike in the price of coffee,\" added Zomfotis, whose company operates more than 50 stores nationwide and expect to purchase up to 700,000 pounds of coffee this year.",
      "Amid those supply constraints, global demand for coffee in growing. For example, consumption is up 150% over 10 years in China \u2014 the world's most populous country, according\u00a0to\u00a0the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Other factors also are contributing to the pricing pressures, including politics. President Trump on Tuesday vowed to proceed next week with his previous threats of 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. A levy on Mexico, whose largest coffee export market is the U.S., would likely push prices up further.",
      "Separately, a new European Union law that is now set to take effect in December prohibits the sale of products, including coffee, if companies can't show they are not linked to deforestation\u00a0 \u2014 a bid to lessen greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss. That effort to address the climate crisis could further tighten supplies of coffee beans.",
      "Geopolitical conflicts are also a factor in rising coffee costs. Fighting between Israel and Hamas has caused havoc in the Red Sea, which carries 30% of the world's container traffic, including coffee from Vietnam. Slowdowns in the Red Sea and the Suez Canal meant as many as 5 billion bags of coffee had not yet arrived in Europe, the International Coffee Organization reported in December.",

      "The FAA announced an air traffic controller hiring window between Feb. 27 and Mar. 17. It said the hiring process will be more efficient by becoming a five-step, rather than an eight-step process. Starting salaries for candidates are also being by 30%; the average certified professional controller makes over $160,000 per year, the FAA noted.",
      "There are approximately 10,800 air traffic controllers working across U.S. airports, which the NATCA says is about 3,600 fewer than \"what is needed to fully staff the National Airspace System.\"",
      "While several hundred probationary workers at the FAA were\u00a0recently fired by the Trump administration through late night emails sent on Feb. 14, \"Zero air traffic controllers and critical safety personnel\" were among those let go according to Duffy in a Feb. 17\u00a0post on X.",
      "Duffy has said he wants to extend a waiver to the current controllers who are near retirement age to help expand the workfroce.",
      "Earlier this month, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), the union representing air traffic controllers, told CBS the proposal is not \"an effective solution to addressing the chronic air traffic controller staffing crisis. \"In the next 12 months, we anticipate 49 ATCs across 35 facilities will reach age 56.\u00a0This is not enough to address the nationwide staffing shortage,\" the union added.",
      "\"The solution to the ATC staffing crisis is a long-term commitment to hiring and training and the retention of the experience of all the highly skilled, highly trained air traffic controllers,\" it added.",
      "Shortage goes back to pandemic",
      "In its Air Traffic Controller Workforce Plan, the FAA blames its struggle to staff air traffic control facilities in part to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"The COVID-19 pandemic has had substantial impact on the aviation industry and the FAA,\" the agency said in its report. \"At the onset of the pandemic, in order to protect employees and help ensure continuity of operations, certain activities were eliminated or significantly reduced at FAA's air traffic control (ATC) facilities.",
      "There are currently a number of open air traffic control jobs on the FAA's website, including for air traffic control and traffic management specialists and at various stages of their careers. Robust training is required to become an air traffic controller, including the completion of training courses at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City. According to the FAA, air traffic control specialists earn a median annual wage of $127,805, plus benefits.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-gold-card-eb5-visa-5-million-immigration-oligarch-cbs-news-explains/",
    "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2025 19:54:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump is floating the idea of a new \"gold card\" visa that would be sold to wealthy foreigners for $5 million.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday unveiled a new pathway to residency: a \"gold card\" aimed at wealthy foreigners willing to pay millions for the right to live in the U.S.",
      "That term is a play on the green card, more officially known as a permanent residency card, which allows non-citizens to live and work permanently in the U.S. Green cards are most frequently awarded to foreigners who marry U.S. citizens or to those who receive one through their employer, with the latter process taking an average of three years to complete, according to the Cato Institute.",
      "The new program comes as the Trump administration moves to change the country's rules for who can legally live, work and gain citizenship in the U.S. That includes tightening restrictions on many types of immigration in the U.S. and pushing to\u00a0end birthright citizenship, the constitutionally protected right to citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil.",
      "The U.S. already opens the door to wealthy non-U.S. citizens who want residency through what is known as an EB-5 visa. But that program, launched in 1990, has long been cited for potential\u00a0abuses, including one prominent case from almost a decade ago that involved owners of a Vermont ski resort embezzling millions from foreign investors who hoped to score visas through the program.",
      "Yet both the new gold card and the EB-5 program have a common goal: Attracting foreign capital by allowing rich non-citizens to ante up in exchange for a U.S. residency visa.",
      "\"It's going to be a route to citizenship, and wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card, they'll be wealthy, and they'll be successful and they'll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday.",
      "Here's what to know about the gold card plan.",
      "What is Trump's gold card?",
      "The gold card will offer a new route for rich non-U.S. citizens to gain a valid visa to live and work in the U.S., according to Mr. Trump, who spoke Tuesday about the new visa with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick from the Oval Office.",
      "The cost of each new visa will be $5 million, Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"We're going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million, and that's going to give you green card privileges, plus,\" the president added.",
      "Green cards allow recipients to live permanently in the U.S. and work for whomever they choose. By comparison, some immigrants, such as those on H-1B visas, are locked into working for the employer that sponsored their visa.",
      "Green card holders can also travel in and out of the U.S. without restriction, and are able to start the process to become a U.S. citizen.",
      "When will the gold card be available?",
      "Lutnick said the gold cards would be available starting in about two weeks.",
      "Will the gold card replace the EB-5 visa?",
      "Yes, with Lutnick on Tuesday describing the EB-5 program as \"full of nonsense, make believe and fraud.\"",
      "\"So the President said, rather than having this sort of ridiculous EB-5 program, we're going to end the EB-5 program,\" Lutnick said in joining Mr. Trump to outline the gold card program from the Oval Office. \"We're going to replace it with the Trump Gold Card, which is really a Green Card Gold.\"",
      "One major difference between the gold card and the EB-5 visa \u2014 the cost, with the latter requiring applicants to invest about $1 million in the U.S., typically by putting the money into a business. But the EB-5 visa also comes with a host of other requirements, such as documenting that the investment will create or preserve 10 permanent full-time jobs for U.S. workers.",
      "How much money could the gold card raise for the U.S.?",
      "Mr. Trump suggested that the the U.S. could \"sell maybe a million of these cards, maybe more than that.\"",
      "At $5 million each, selling 1 million gold cards could raise $5 trillion, he said.",
      "\"And if you sell 10 million of the cards, that's a total of $50 trillion,\" Mr. Trump added. \"We have $35 trillion in debt. That'll be nice, so we'll see.\"",
      "Typically, the number of annual applicants for EB-5 visas is far lower than what Mr. Trump projects for the gold card. About 8,000 people obtained investor visas in the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2022, according to the Homeland Security Department's most recent Yearbook of Immigration Statistics.",
      "If roughly 8,000 people received gold cards each year, the U.S. would raise about $40 billion annually through the program.",
      "The U.S. is a top immigration destination for rich investors, according to Henley & Partners, a company that provides immigration advisory services. The group estimated\u00a0that the U.S. had the second-biggest net influx of millionaires in 2024, following the United Arab Emirates, at about 3,800 foreign millionaires moving stateside last year.",
      "Who could qualify for a gold card?",
      "Aside from having $5 million to pay the U.S. government, gold card applicants would also have to meet other criteria, Lutnick said.",
      "\"They'll have to go through vetting, of course, we're going to make sure they're wonderful world class global citizens,\" he said, without providing details.",
      "Asked by reporters if Russian oligarchs could qualify for the visa, Mr. Trump responded, \"Possibly.\"",
      "He added, \"Hey, I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people. It's possible. They're not as wealthy as they used to be. I think they could afford \u2014 I think they could afford $5 million.\"",
      "Do other nations offer gold cards?",
      "Yes, investor visas are common around the world. More than 100 countries offer \"golden visas\" to wealthy individuals, including the U.S., United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, Malta, Australia, Canada and Italy, according to Henley & Partners.",
      "Does the gold card need congressional approval?",
      "Congress determines qualifications for citizenship, but Mr. Trump said gold cards would not require congressional approval.",
      "\"We have it all worked out from the legal standpoint. It's totally legal to do,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's somewhat like a green card, but at a higher level of sophistication \u2014 it's a road to citizenship for people, and essentially people of wealth or people of great talent, where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in, meaning companies will pay for people to get in and to have long, long term status in the country.\"",

      "As has been the case for years, prices drive so much of Americans' larger views: they say this factors the most into their assessment of the overall economy \u2014 which most continue to say is bad. And then among those who say their own finances aren't good, prices are the top reason why.",
      "This comes amid other economic indicators out lately, including that unemployment claims recently rose, the consumer confidence index dropped; and the S&P slid in recent days toward the end of February.",
      "Americans say their outlook for the next year is also mixed. Right now, people are more likely to say the economy is getting worse than better. Current circumstances play into this too: those most concerned about affording food today are also more apt to think things are getting worse.",
      "Evaluations, as is typical, show splits by financial circumstances though, and may speak to broader divides in the U.S. economy and in the impact of inflation.",
      "Americans who report higher incomes are far more likely to say their financial situation is good and are much more confident about their ability to save \u2013 though the majority of them, too, say income isn't keeping up with inflation.",
      "The outlook going forward remains mixed at best and is also tied to current circumstances:",
      "Just over half expect things to at least hold steady, though only a third expect growth or a boom coming. The rest expect either a slowing or a recession.",
      "At least half the country reports concern about paying for food and groceries, and housing.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tax-refund-status-2025-irs/",
    "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2025 17:40:40 -0500",
    "summary": "IRS data shows that the average refund check so far is about $2,200, or $1,000 less than a year earlier. Here's what experts say.",
    "story": [
      "With tax season well underway, early data on the average tax refund shows that Americans are receiving about one-third less than they did a year earlier.",
      "The average refund check in 2025 stood at $2,169 as of Feb. 14, about 32% below the average $3,207 refund issued at the same time last year, the IRS said in its most recent tax update. The agency began accepting tax returns on Jan. 27 and will continue to do so until April 15 except for taxpayers who request an extension.",
      "Those numbers don't necessarily mean that individual taxpayers will get a smaller refund, experts note. Refunds are typically smaller at the start of the tax season because low- and middle-income workers with simpler tax returns are often the first to file, while higher-income Americans or people with more complicated taxes tend to wait until closer to the April 15 deadline to file their returns.",
      "\"Many employees, all they have is a W2 \u2014 they have smaller refunds or smaller amounts to pay because they have withholding through their jobs,\" Keith Hall, CEO of the National Association for the Self-Employed (NASE) and a certified CPA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "At the same time, Hall said some small business owners are reporting receiving financial tax forms, such as dividend or brokerage account statements, later than in past years. That often leads businesses to hold off on filing with the IRS until they've gathered all their tax documents.",
      "So far, fewer Americans have filed their taxes in the season's opening weeks when compared with 2024, the IRS data shows. About 33 million returns had been submitted through through Feb. 14, a 5% decline from the same period a year ago.",
      "The IRS also noted that tax data tends to \"even out as more tax returns come in.\" In its most recent data release, the agency said it expects tax return filings to \"level out in future weeks as the April filing deadline approaches.\"",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "Taxpayers should file as soon as possible because that will enable them to get their refund faster, Hall said. Other tax experts are also urging consumers to file quickly because of concerns that IRS job cuts ordered by the Trump administration could add to challenges in getting tax returns processed this year.",
      "Most refunds are issued in fewer than 21 calendar days if you file your taxes electronically, according to the IRS. Taxes filed on paper require more time because human IRS agents must process those returns, which can add weeks to getting a refund.",
      "Taxpayers can monitor the status of their 2025 refund using the IRS'\u00a0Where's My Refund?\u00a0tool, with e-filers able to check on their return 24 hours after filing. People who file on paper won't be able to see their refund status for four weeks after they mail their return to the IRS, the agency says.",
      "About half of Americans intend to file their taxes by the end of February, with the other half planning to finish their returns in March and April, according to the National Retail Federation's annual tax return survey. About half of taxpayers say they expect a refund this year, it found.",

      "Asked by CBS News whether Musk's involvement could pose a conflict of interest given that the FAA regulates SpaceX and his companies are a major user of the airspace, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said earlier this month that the entrepreneur isn't involved in setting agency policy.",
      "\"I was very conscious of anyone who comes in \u2014 I don't want to see conflicts of interest,\" Duffy said on Feb. 19 from the FAA's ATC Command Center in Warrenton, Virginia. \"So [Musk] was talking to air traffic controllers, didn't plug into the system, but looked at the terminals that they use... They had a back and forth about what works well for you, what doesn't work well.\"",
      "\"[T]hey spoke freely about these are the problems that we have. And so it was nothing about the way that SpaceX uses the airspace. It was about how do controllers do their job,\" Duffy added.",
      "Jessica Tillipman, associate dean for government procurement law studies at The George Washington University Law School, noted that federal regulations prohibit government contractors from having conflicts of interest, and warn even against the mere appearance of such conflicts.",
      "Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan watchdog focused on reducing government corruption, told CBS MoneyWatch that Musk's close relationship with President Trump could amount to a conflict of interest.",

      "Some analysts say they expect layoffs ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency to show up in the report in the coming weeks or months.",
      "\"While still far below recession level, this is the highest number of weekly claims yet this year, and that's a yellow caution light for the economy,\" Andrew Stettner, unemployment insurance (UI) expert at The Century Foundation and former Biden administration UI modernization director, said in a report. \"What's more, these worrying indicators don't include hundreds of thousands of layoffs announced by the federal government.\"",
      "On Wednesday, senior U.S. officials set the government downsizing in motion via a memo dramatically expanding President Donald Trump's efforts to scale back a workforce. Thousands of probationary employees have already been fired, and now the Republican administration is turning its attention to career officials with civil service protection.",

      "Even so, some economists in their review of the latest jobless data see signs of a potential downturn.",
      "\"Today's figure is a big departure from the previous downtrend. It brings the level of claims back to where they were at the end of last summer, but going the other way this time,\" analysts with High Frequency Economics said in a report.",
      "\"HFE is already forecasting a sharp slowdown in GDP in the first quarter from the fourth to under 1%. We will mark that down further if [President Trump] goes ahead with 25% tariff barriers on the Northern and Southern borders,\" they added.",
      "Continuing claims also rise",
      "Continuing claims in the week ending Feb. 15 were also up, noted Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note on the latest jobless claims data.",
      "\"Our final chart shows that continuing claims are closely correlated with the number of people unemployed for less than 26 weeks, said Tombs, adding that \"the number of people who are unemployed but who have exhausted their 26-week entitlement to jobless benefits likely has continued to rise.\"",
      "Late in January, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark lending rate alone after issuing three cuts late in 2024.

      "The most recent government consumer prices report that showed that inflation accelerated last month, creating some doubt about whether the Fed will be moved to cut rates at all this year.",
      "The new jobless benefits claims data shows that inflation has remained stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target for roughly the past six months after it fell steadily for about a year and a half.",
      "The consumer price index increased 3% in January from a year ago, up from a 3 1/2 year low of 2.4% in September. According to the CPI report, egg prices, which\u00a0continue to soar, jumped more than 15% in January from a year ago, to approximately $4.95 a dozen.

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0President Trump will address a joint session of Congress tonight, marking the first time he will speak before both chambers since he returned to office six weeks ago.",
      "Presidents typically address a joint session of Congress early in their tenure to outline a vision or agenda. The first speech before lawmakers is not technically a State of the Union, but rather an Address to a Joint Session of Congress.",
      "As is customary, House Speaker Mike Johnson in January invited Mr. Trump to address Congress and \"share his America First vision for our future.\" In a letter to the president, the speaker wrote that the Trump administration and the Republican majorities in Congress will \"have the chance to make these next four years some of the most consequential in our nation's history.\"",
      "\"America's Golden Age has begun,\" Johnson said in the letter, echoing a line from Mr. Trump's inaugural address, while touting a \"resurgence of patriotism, unity, and hope for the future.\"",
      "What time will Trump's speech start and end?",
      "The president's address is set to begin at 9 p.m. ET. Its running time remains to be seen. During his first term, Mr. Trump's 2017\u00a0joint address to Congress ran about one hour.

      "Mr. Trump's address to Congress comes six weeks after he returned to office for a second term. So far, Americans agree that he is making major changes to how the government works, though there's a divide on whether they view the changes as better or worse, according to CBS News polling released Sunday.",
      "The president has pursued a dramatic overhaul of the federal bureaucracy and a cost-cutting effort alongside Elon Musk, who he's tapped to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. DOGE has been working with Cabinet department and agency heads to shrink the government workforce, while halting swaths of government spending. A number of Democrats are bringing former government employees fired as a result of the DOGE cuts as their guests to Tuesday's address to highlight the individuals personally impacted.",
      "The Trump administration in its first six weeks has also worked to bolster border security with a government-wide immigration crackdown, and illegal border crossings were significantly down during Mr. Trump's first month in office. Still, the administration has faced obstacles in its efforts to conduct what it's billed as the largest deportation operation in American history in the U.S. interior. Top Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have been reassigned in recent weeks amid frustrations that the agency has not carried out sufficient arrests and deportations. ICE's detention capacity has also been stretched thin, with detention centers recently filled at levels above 110%.",
      "While Mr. Trump's approach to immigration has received support in recent\u00a0polling, Americans overwhelmingly say he should prioritize inflation and the economy. At the same time, the president has pursued tariffs that have prompted fears of a trade war among businesses and consumers. On Tuesday, 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico are set to take effect following a month-long delay.",
      "Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress have been pursuing legislation to support Mr. Trump's agenda, facing headwinds with a narrow majority in the House and differing views on the path forward. Last week, the House adopted a budget resolution that paves the way for implementing the president's agenda on border security, defense and energy priorities, while extending the 2017 tax cuts. But it's not yet clear how the budget blueprint will fare in the Senate, where lawmakers have pursued a different approach.",
      "Mr. Trump's return to the White House has also had serious implications on the world stage even in the first six weeks. Last week, a meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy devolved into a feud with Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance, and Zelenskyy was ultimately asked to leave the White House without signing a critical multibillion-dollar rare earth minerals deal. On Monday, the White House said it was pausing military aid to Ukraine.",
      "The contentious meeting came after Mr. Trump had appeared to blame Ukraine for the war Russia started and labeled Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" while declining to say the same of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The U.S. has provided Ukraine with billions in weapons since the Russian invasion three years ago, and a split with Zelenskyy may have major implications for its ability to defend itself.",

The meeting abruptly ended without signing the rare earth minerals deal, and several White House officials told CBS News that the future of military aid for Ukraine was in doubt.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office in January, $3.85 billion has been available in drawdown authority for weaponry that can be pulled from existing U.S. stockpiles and sent to Ukraine, U.S. officials previously told CBS News. But the Trump administration has not packaged any of that aid for a single shipment since Jan. 21, a diplomatic source told CBS News Monday. Still, there have been shipments of weapons sent to Ukraine since Jan. 20 that were promised by the Biden administration in earlier drawdowns, according to defense officials.",
      "The $3.85 billion is spending authority, not congressionally appropriated funds, which means it's up to the White House to determine whether to release the aid. It is also not considered \"real money,\" meaning it cannot be spent elsewhere.",
      "Separately, the State Department also has about $1.5 billion in foreign military financing for Ukraine that is under a policy review by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. So far, the Trump State Department has only given Egypt and Israel waivers for FMF assistance.",
      "After Friday's meeting, Zelenskyy traveled to London for a summit with European and Canadian leaders, where he stressed the importance of Western security guarantees as part of any agreement that would bring the war to an end. He said in Ukrainian that peace with Russia was \"still very, very far away,\" but he thought that Ukraine-U.S. relations would hold.",
      "Mr. Trump later posted a link to an Associated Press story covering Zelenskyy's comments and wrote, \"This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!\"",
      "\"It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be Peace as long as he has America's backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S. - Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "Mr. Trump's hardened stance on Ukraine has rankled some GOP lawmakers.",
      "Republican Sen. Susan Collins, of Maine, said Monday, \"I do not think we should be pausing our efforts. It's the Ukrainians who are shedding blood. It is Putin who launched an unprovoked and unjustified attack on a free, democratic and sovereign country. And I am not backing off my support for Ukraine.\"",
      "Before the Trump administration's announcement Monday, Sen. Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota who serves on the Armed Services Committee, said of Ukraine, \"I'll simply say that we've got to get back on track again.\"",
      "\"It's critical that we get a minerals agreement put together and that we work on getting a security agreement with Ukraine,\" Rounds told reporters at the Capitol. \"They have been attacked. Russia is in the wrong, but we want to find a pathway to peace, and that means somebody has got to be the intermediary. I don't know if the president wants to be that. We need to give him the opportunity, but Russia is the aggressor, and we have to recognize that.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said last month that he had a \"lengthy and highly productive phone call\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and has also directed Rubio and other members of his national security team to \"immediately\" begin negotiations aimed at ending Russia's war with Ukraine.",
      "But Rubio said in February there was \"a long ways to go\" before peace talks could begin.",
      "Delegations led by Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, shortly after those comments, without Ukrainian officials present.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A USAID deputy administrator has been put on leave after issuing memos that said that the organization had failed to implement humanitarian assistance due to \"political leadership\" at USAID, the Department of State and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "He wrote it will \"will no doubt result in preventable death, destabilization, and threats to national security on a massive scale,\" two sources familiar with the situation told CBS News.",
      "Nick Enrich, the acting assistant administrator for USAID Global Health, issued two memos to the Bureau of Global Health on Friday, one that laid out how the Bureau for Global Health had carried out its terminations, while the other had critiques of Secretary of State Marco Rubio's temporary waiver and the overall pause on foreign assistance.",
      "A source familiar with Enrich being put on leave told CBS News that \"I've seen the full memo and Nick was put on leave for trying to do his job and then documenting what is happening.\"",
      "Enrich cited DOGE in particular as creating \"intentional and/or unintentional obstacles that have wholly prevented implementation\" of lifesaving humanitarian assistance.",
      "The memo said this is the result of several actions, including refusal to pay for assistance activities conducted or goods and services rendered, DOGE blocking and restricting access to USAID payment systems, the \"ever-changing guidance as to what qualifies as 'livesaving,'\" and most recently, the \"sweeping terminations.\"",
      "The memo lays out a timeline of how the administration's impact on waivers has hurt USAID's effort for humanitarian assistance. It notes that the Bureau for Global Health got approval to conduct activities to respond to an Ebola outbreak in Uganda, but USAID was never able to draw down the funds and did not receive any funds as of the issuing of the memo on Feb. 28.",
      "The memo also says that as of Feb. 8, the Bureau for Global Health was told by the secretary of state that there are \"tranches\" of awards identified for termination, including of awards that were previously given waivers. While Enrich was reviewing the awards slated for termination, he writes that DOGE adviser Jeremy Lewin emailed him telling him to stop and that it is \"delaying the timeline processing of these termination notices.\"",
      "The memos are the latest in a series of developments for USAID, the government organization that provides humanitarian assistance around the world. The organization, founded in 1961, has been the target of the Trump administration and the Elon Musk-helmed DOGE.",
      "Thousands of USAID workers were placed on leave or terminated as of Feb. 23.",
      "The chaos surrounding USAID has caused disruptions to the supply chain and services for a variety of global life-saving causes have faltered. Musk posted on social media over the weekend that funding for Edesia, a Rhode Island-based company that makes a lifesaving paste for severely malnourished infants, had been restored and the company's payments should resume this week.",

    "story": [
      "Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ed Martin uses the nickname \"The Eagle\" on the job. He has been posting on social media about crime in Washington, D.C., using the hashtag #MarchBadness. Martin, whose nomination for the permanent post of U.S. attorney for D.C. is being considered by the Senate, has been attracting attention with his social media posts, as well as some of his actions in his capacity as acting U.S. attorney.",
      "In one on Saturday, Martin wrote, \"Hey, thugs with guns, you hear that? Yup, we comin.'\"",
      "He was likely referring to a memo circulated Monday to his staff, in which Martin said over a dozen agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives would be dispatched to help with an \"amazing opportunity\" to help initiatives to reduce violent crime in the nation's capital.",
      "Martin's new initiative seeks more federal district court prosecutions of Washington, D.C., gun crimes. His memo, obtained by CBS News, said his office is \"kicking off the Make DC Safe Again initiative,\" which echoes the Make America Great Again slogan invoked by Trump.",
      "\"We are following the direction of President Trump and (Attorney) General Bondi in the recent executive orders and memoranda. We will flood the federal district court with cases\u2014to make our city safe,\" the memo said. This has been attempted before. In February 2019, a Trump-appointed federal prosecutor announced a project to seek higher-level charges for gun cases in the District of Columbia.",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office for D.C. and the Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives D.C. field office declined requests for comment.",
      "While he waits for his confirmation vote, Martin has continued to court controversy with provocative social posts.",
      "In a social media post Saturday, Martin wrote that his predecessor was a \"Biden prosecutor\" who \"upped political prosecutions, he steered resources to a now-debunked legal theory that targeted American citizens, and gun prosecutions went down. Literally. Let me be clear: he used our $ to chase political hoaxes while the people of DC were terrorized by thugs with guns.\"",
      "The U.S. attorney for the D.C. has a unique ability to handle federal crimes in the nation's capital, including those involving federal officials and facilities. As U.S. attorney for D.C., Martin days ago demoted a group of top senior prosecutors in the office to entry level positions, including those who helped with the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection prosecutions. Now, at least some are being assigned to handle misdemeanor cases",
      "His demotions have caused internal dissension, according to multiple sources who spoke with CBS News.",
      "Martin has filed a series of court motions to help promptly close out many of the pending Capitol riot prosecutions. Before his appointment, Martin served as a defense attorney for Capitol riot defendants and was an active member of the \"Stop the Steal\" movement, which promoted baseless claims of election fraud in 2020.",
      "Last month, Martin instructed his staff to respond to surveys, seeking information about \"five things\" they'd accomplished that week, from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Martin also instructed staff to respond to the second survey that was emailed over the weekend.",
      "Martin is also under new scrutiny by congressional Democrats after writing a social media post last month in which he referred to U.S. attorneys as \"Trump's lawyers,\" who are \"vigilant in standing against entities like the [Associated Press] that refuse to put America first.\"",
      "But U.S. attorneys are not the president's lawyers. Their mission is to ensure that federal laws are enforced. In their districts, they're also involved in civil litigations where the U.S. is a party.",
      "Martin also posted a note to the law firm Covington & Burling and former special counsel Jack Smith to \"save your receipts\" and promised, \"We'll be in touch soon.\" The message included a link to a story noting the firm was defending Smith pro bono. Smith indicted President Trump in two separate cases.",
      "House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer praised Martin in a statement, saying, \"By nominating Ed Martin to be the next U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, President Donald Trump wasted no time delivering on his promise to restore law and order in our capital city.\"",
      "But Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat who is the ranking member on the committee, has launched an investigation into Martin's initiatives and actions as acting U.S. attorney. He wrote a letter to Martin questioning his public statements which, he said, \"are directed exclusively at opponents of and express support for the Trump Administration, explicitly criticize the Biden Administration, publicize pending investigative activity by your office, and make assertions of fact for which there exists no evidence.\"",
      "Martin's statements \"raise serious concerns that your new initiative is a pretext for misusing your office for political ends, threatening and intimidating critics of the Administration, and chilling constitutionally protected speech,\" Connolly added.",
      "A spokesperson for Martin declined to comment.",
      "The House Oversight Committee Democrats' inquiry ordered Martin to submit responses by March 11 about how the office would seek to protect the safety of Capitol police officers and federal prosecutors who were part of the Jan. 6 prosecutions. The inquiry also asks Martin to \"confirm your belief that the Department of Justice represents the United States of America and its citizens, and not the personal and individual political or business interests of the President.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 19:11:00 -0500",
    "summary": "With members of the presidential line of succession in the Capitol for President Trump's speech to the joint session of Congress, a designated survivor will be named to stay away in case of a catastrophic event.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's speech Tuesday night will take place in front of members of both Houses of Congress and the entire presidential line of succession \u2014 with one notable exception. Each year, one Cabinet member is chosen as the \"designated survivor\" who will sit out the speech in case of a catastrophic event.",
      "The name of the designated survivor is not usually revealed to the public until shortly before the speech starts \u2014 or even sometimes after it starts.",
      "What is a designated survivor?",
      "The designated survivor is the informal name used for the person in the line of succession who does not attend the joint session of Congress so that there would be a leader available to step up in case of a catastrophic event.",
      "The line of succession was first determined by Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution, but the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 set the modern line of succession if something should happen to the president and he or she cannot undertake his or her duties. First in line for the presidency is Vice President JD Vance. Second in line after the vice president is House Speaker Mike Johnson, third in line is Senate pro tempore Chuck Grassley, fourth in line is Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and fifth in line is Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The line continues through other members of the Cabinet, in the order their departments were created, with the secretary of Homeland Security \u2014 currently\u00a0Kristi Noem \u2014 at 18th in line.",
      "Since all of those people would normally be in attendance at the joint session of Congress, a designated survivor is chosen to stay away.",
      "Why does the practice of choosing a designated survivor exist?",
      "Unlike the line of succession, the designated survivor is not something determined by the Constitution. The practice is believed to have started during the Cold War in the 1950s, but it was not until 1981 that the first official designated survivor was named as then-Education Secretary Terrel Bell.",
      "How do they choose the designated survivor?",
      "It's not clear how the administration chooses a designated survivor since the process is classified. The person must be eligible to serve as president, so they must be a native-born American citizen and at least 35 years old. There have been several Cabinet members over the years who did not fit those criteria, including former Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright, who was born in what is now the Czech Republic, and German-born Henry Kissinger.",
      "Former Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, who was named as designated survivor by President Bill Clinton in 1996, told ABC News in 2014 that she was shown the Situation Room and the White House staff \"talked seriously about the responsibility of the designated survivor.\"",
      "What does the designated survivor do during the speech?",
      "There have been a few designated survivors who have been willing to discuss what they did during the speech. Then-Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who was tapped by Clinton to be designated survivor in 2000, told ABC News in 2014 that he watched the speech from a friend's house in Sherwood, Maryland, about 90 miles outside Washington.",
      "\"It's fun. You're sitting there, you're being watched. You got security. And there are a few thrills,\" he told ABC News. \"My wife and my friends were impressed the fire trucks were there.\"",
      "Former Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman wrote an essay in 2017 in Politico about his own experience after being chosen. According to Glickman, he was taken a secure location outside Washington (in his case, his daughter's New York apartment), where he writes that he was \"accompanied by key military staff and Secret Service, including a military officer carrying what I presumed to be the nuclear football \u2014 a black, leather-encased aluminum briefcase that would be used to authenticate the person ordering a nuclear strike.\"",
      "\"I don't recall getting any specific instructions on what to do if the doomsday scenario happened,\" Glickman wrote. \"All I knew is that if necessary, I could turn to that military officer accompanying me, holding that 45-pound bag, and trigger a military response, including a nuclear strike.\"",
      "Shalala, meanwhile, told ABC News that she stayed in Washington, waited it out at the White House and ordered pizza for her staff",
      "\"I saw the president when he left and when he came back,\" Shalala said. \"He said, 'Don't do anything I wouldn't do.'\"",
      "Who has been named designated survivor in the past?",
      "The designated survivor is usually a member of the Cabinet, although the Secretaries of State, Defense and Treasury have never been chosen. There was no no designated survivor in 2021, since only 200 members of Congress attended the joint session of Congress amid the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "story": [
      "The Senate voted Monday to confirm former wrestling executive Linda McMahon as the nation's education chief, a role that places her atop a department that President Trump has vilified and vowed to dismantle.",
      "McMahon will face the competing tasks of winding down the Education Department while also escalating efforts to achieve Mr. Trump's agenda. Already the Republican president has signed sweeping orders to rid America's schools of diversity programs and accommodations for transgender students while also calling for expanded school choice programs.",
      "At the same time, Mr. Trump has promised to shut down the department and said he wants McMahon \"to put herself out of a job.\"",
      "The Senate voted 51-45 to confirm McMahon.",
      "A billionaire and former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, McMahon, 76, is an unconventional pick for the role. She spent a year on Connecticut's state board of education and is a longtime trustee at Sacred Heart University but otherwise has little traditional education leadership.",
      "McMahon's supporters see her as a skilled executive who will reform a department that Republicans say has failed to improve American education. Opponents say she's unqualified and fear her budget cuts will be felt by students nationwide.",
      "\"Americans believe in public education,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said before the confirmation vote. \"They don't want to see the Department of Education abolished. If the Trump administration follows through on cuts to education, schools will lose billions in funding.\"",
      "At her confirmation hearing, McMahon distanced herself from Mr. Trump's blistering rhetoric. She said the goal is to make the Education Department \"operate more efficiently,\" not to defund programs.",
      "She acknowledged that only Congress has the power to close the department, and she pledged to preserve Title I money for low-income schools, Pell grants for low-income college students, and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Yet she suggested some operations could move to other departments, saying Health and Human Services might be better suited to enforce disability rights laws.",
      "Weeks before McMahon's confirmation hearing, the White House was considering an executive order that would direct the education secretary to cut the agency as much as legally possible while asking Congress to shut it down completely. Some of McMahon's allies pressed the White House to hold the order until after her confirmation to avoid potential backlash.",
      "Created by Congress in 1979, the Education Department's primary role is to disburse money to the nation's schools and colleges. It sends billions of dollars a year to K-12 schools and oversees a $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio.",
      "Mr. Trump argues the department has been overtaken by liberals who press their ideology on America's schools.",
      "Schools and colleges have been navigating a demand to eliminate diversity programs or risk having their federal funding pulled. The Trump administration gave them a Feb. 28 deadline to comply. The Education Department addressed questions about its guidance in a document released Saturday, saying in part that changing program names that reference \"diversity\" or \"equity\" alone is not enough if they treat students differently by race.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump vowed to close the department and grant its authority to states. Schools and states already wield significantly greater authority over education than the federal government, which is barred from influencing curriculum. Federal money makes up roughly 14% of public school budgets.",
      "Already, the Trump administration has started overhauling much of the department's work.",
      "Trump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has cut dozens of contracts it dismissed as \"woke\" and wasteful. It gutted the Institute of Education Sciences, which gathers data on the nation's academic progress, and the administration has fired or suspended scores of employees.",
      "Some of the cuts have halted work that's ordered under federal law. At her hearing, McMahon said the agency will spend money that's directed by Congress, and she played down DOGE's cuts as merely an audit.",
      "McMahon is a longtime Trump ally who left WWE in 2009 to launch a political career, running unsuccessfully twice for the U.S. Senate. She has given millions of dollars to Mr. Trump's campaigns and served as leader of the Small Business Administration during his first term.",

      "President Trump said on social media Sunday that his administration is working toward creating a \"crypto strategic reserve\" that will include bitcoin and ethereum, along with lesser-known cryptocurrencies XRP, solana, and cardano. He later followed up with another post saying his planned reserve would also include bitcoin and ether, the two most popular cryptocurrencies.",
      "The announcement helped crypto prices rebound after recent sell-offs, but only for a few hours. After rising to $90,000 Monday morning, bitcoin fell to roughly $87,000, or 7.3%, by Monday afternoon. Ethereum tumbled 14.6% to $2,153. Massive price spikes in XRP, solana and cardano also fizzled, dropping 12.1%, 13% and 12.3%, respectively.",
      "Nic Puckrin, financial analyst, investor and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, said in a note that the cause of the temporary price boost was most likely a \"combination of 'hopium' with a classic short squeeze,\" adding that more concrete information on the crypto reserve plan is needed to reassure investors of its worth.",

      "As described in the president's executive order\u00a0from January 23, the crypto strategic reserve would be a national stockpile of digital assets created under a federal regulatory framework developed by the newly established Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets.",
      "The working group will be chaired by high ranking officials, including the White House AI & crypto czar, the secretary of the Treasury and chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, among others.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump pledged support for a \"strategic national bitcoin\" stockpile, which would include bitcoin the U.S. government has previously seized in law enforcement actions. Sunday's announcement was the first time he advocated for the government to hold other types of cryptocurrencies.",
      "How the crypto strategic reserve would be structured and maintained is not yet clear, as the White House did not immediately provide additional details, including how much of each type of cryptocurrency Trump wants the U.S. to hold, and how the government would acquire them.",
      "But more information could be revealed this week, as Trump has also recently announced he will speak at and host industry leaders on Friday at a White House \"Crypto Summit.\"",
      "\"The first White House Crypto Summit on Friday will be crucial to watch,\" said Puckrin. \"We will be waiting to see who will be there, what will be discussed, and whether any actual steps toward implementation are outlined. The key question is, how will they fund and legislate this reserve? Until we have some answers, there's little substance to support this rally, and it could fizzle out as quickly as it started.\"",
      "What's the point of a strategic crypto reserve?",
      "Similar to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which protects the U.S. economy from disruptions in oil supplies, a national crypto reserve would help diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risks, according advocates of the plan.",
      "Critics, however, say the volatility of cryptocurrencies makes them a poor choice as a reserve asset.",
      "Potential hurdles",
      "Creating a crypto strategic reserve is likely to require an act from Congress, just as with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was created in December 1975 when then President Gerald Ford signed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.",
      "Also, the inclusion of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin is likely to face sustained pushback among some corners of the heavily divided cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin is the oldest and by far most popular cryptocurrency, and accounts for more than half of the world's global crypto market cap.",
      "The president has cast himself as hero to the crypto industry, which he said in his announcement had been the target of \"years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration.\" The crypto industry felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win election.",
      "The first several weeks of his administration have seen several moves to boost crypto, including ending or pausing high-profile enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Crypto prices soared after Trump's victory last year, and when the price of bitcoin first crossed $100,000 in early December, Trump took credit and posted \"YOU'RE WELCOME!!!\" on social media.",
      "But prices have fallen since Trump's inauguration and Trump has faced criticism, including from allies within the crypto industry, for helping launch a personal meme coin just before he took office that has since collapsed in value.",
      "The crash of meme coins linked to First Lady Melania Trump and Argentine President Javier Milei, along with a massive hack of a major cryptocurrency exchange that the FBI has said was undertaken by North Korea, have also dimmed enthusiasm for crypto.",

      "Multiple U.S. officials tell CBS News that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a directive to U.S. Cyber Command last month to pause planning against Russia, including provocative offensive cyber operations.",
      "The duration of the pause is unclear and comes amid President Trump's efforts to negotiate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war. Hegseth's order was handed down before Mr. Trump sparred with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office late last week.",
      "Two sources familiar with Hegseth's directive said it lacked specificity about the pause.",
      "And, it's not clear how the order about planning was interpreted. Strategizing for future operations was never paused, multiple officials told CBS. U.S. cyber policy on Russia \"is very much intact\" and remains at the same level, one of the officials said.",

      "During previous sensitive negotiations, past Democratic and Republican administrations have paused certain operations to prevent U.S. intentions from being misconstrued and keep diplomacy on track.",
      "Asked for comment, a senior U.S. defense official said, \"Due to operational security concerns, we do not comment nor discuss cyber intelligence, plans, or operations.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-gunmakers-mexico/",
    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 16:06:42 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court is set to consider the Mexican government's effort to hold U.S. gun companies accountable for violence involving trafficked firearms.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to consider Tuesday whether to block the Mexican government's effort to hold U.S. gun companies accountable for the havoc and violence the country has experienced at the hands of drug cartels armed with firearms trafficked across the southern border.",
      "The legal battle marks the first time that the Supreme Court will consider a federal law known as the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, or PLCAA. Enacted with bipartisan support from Congress in 2005, the law provides a legal shield for gun companies from civil suits seeking to hold them liable for harms stemming from the criminal misuse of their products by another person.",
      "But the case, known as Smith & Wesson Brands v. Estados Unidos Mexicanos, also lands before the high court as it has emerged as a bargaining tool in negotiations between President Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. The Trump administration has\u00a0designated Mexican drug cartels\u00a0as terrorist groups and is readying 25% tariffs on goods imported from Mexico. Sheinbaum warned last month that if the U.S. declared the cartels as terrorists, her government would expand its lawsuit against the American gunmakers.",
      "Between 200,000 to 500,000 American-made guns are trafficked into Mexico each year, a pipeline that's been called the \"iron river.\" Nearly half of all guns recovered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.",
      "Mexico's lawsuit",
      "Mexico, which has stringent firearms laws and a single gun store in the entire country, filed its lawsuit against seven of the nation's biggest gun manufacturers and one wholesaler in 2021. The country is seeking $10 billion in damages from the industry, as well as other forms of relief.",
      "A federal district court in Massachusetts dismissed the suit in September 2022, finding that PLCAA \"unequivocally\" bars lawsuits seeking to hold gunmakers responsible for the actions of people using their firearms. The court also found that while PLCAA contains narrow exceptions, none applied to its case.",
      "But in January 2024, a panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit reversed the district court's decision and revived Mexico's lawsuit.",
      "The 1st Circuit found that Mexico's suit fell under one of PLCAA's exceptions, known as the predicate exception, which allows gun manufacturers or sellers to be sued if they knowingly broke the law, and if that violation led directly to Mexico's injuries. That determination pierced PLCAA's liability shield, allowing Mexico's suit to proceed.",
      "The 1st Circuit found that the firearms manufacturers have been \"aiding and abetting\" the illegal sale of guns to traffickers for cartels in Mexico, and that the trafficking of firearms has foreseeably forced the Mexican government to incur significant costs as a result of increased threats and violence wrought by armed drug cartels.",
      "The case remains in the early stages. While the gunmakers' appeal was pending, and before the Supreme Court agreed to step into the dispute, the district court dismissed six of the eight manufacturers from the case. The two remaining companies are Smith & Wesson and Interstate Arms, a wholesaler.",
      "A key focus for the justices is likely to be the whether Mexico can draw a direct link from the manufacturers' lawful production of firearms to the illegal trafficking of those guns and crimes committed by armed cartels.",
      "\"It's where Mexico might be the most vulnerable because however you lay this out, there are certainly a number of intervening actors and things that have to occur before the firearms could actually be used to cause harm in the country of Mexico,\" said Andrew Willinger, executive director of the Duke Center for Firearms Law.",
      "Lawyers for the gun companies, led by Smith & Wesson, argued that Mexico relies on an multi-step chain to tie the lawful production and sale of their guns within the U.S. to the chaos in Mexico incited by drug cartels criminally misusing their weapons. That chain starts with the federally licensed manufacturers, flows to wholesalers who sell to licensed dealers, who then engage in unlawful sales of guns that are trafficked into Mexico and land with the cartels. The final links are the guns being used to commit crimes that injure property and people, and the Mexican government being forced to spend money to respond to that fallout.",
      "\"In its zeal to attack the firearms industry, Mexico seeks to raze bedrock principles of American law that safeguard the whole economy,\" they wrote in a Supreme Court brief. \"Indeed, [i]n Mexico's view, any manufacturer or supplier of a lawful good could face liability over the predictable criminal misuse of its products by downstream consumers. But that is not the law.\"",
      "The industry's lawyers said Mexico's lawsuit rests on routine business practices and likened the gunmakers to Budweiser selling beer to a college-town bar that serves underage drinkers.",
      "\"When the manufacturer or supplier of a lawful product simply puts its product in the general stream of commerce, the aiding-and-abetting statute does not charge that business with broadly policing every bad actor who may pick up its products downstream,\" they wrote.",
      "But lawyers for the Mexican government claim that the gun manufacturers deliberately sell large quantities of their products through so-called red-flag dealers, who are known to disproportionately sell guns recovered at crime scenes in Mexico. One such dealer sold more than 650 guns to straw purchasers who were recruited by a drug cartel, the Mexican government alleged in a filing.",
      "Mexico claims the companies also design and market certain firearms to cater to cartels, like Colt's Super \"El Jefe\" pistol, a reference to the crime bosses, and the Emiliano Zapata 1911 pistol, which is engraved with the Mexican revolutionary's declaration that \"it is better to die standing than to live on your knees.\"",
      "Citing the killings of Mexican police and military by weapons trafficked across the U.S.-Mexico border, as well as its efforts to combat gun trafficking, the Mexican government said it has \"tried to stem this relentless tidal wave.\"",
      "\"But its after-the-fact efforts to find and recover guns from the cartels are small-scale remedies given [the gun manufacturers'] systemic conduct in getting the guns into the trafficker[s]' hands in the first instance,\" they wrote.",
      "The impact of the Supreme Court's ruling",
      "If the court sides with the gunmakers, the impact would depend on the contours of its opinion. Willinger said that the Supreme Court could issue a narrow decision that focuses on some of the unique aspects of the case: the cross-border context and fact that it was brought by a foreign government.",
      "A group of gun violence prevention organizations warned the Supreme Court that accepting the gun manufacturers' argument would have devastating consequences.",
      "\"It would be a signal that our law doesn't appropriately contemplate or even respect the suffering of victims of gun violence, the harm they suffered, the lives lost, the lives changed forever,\" said David Pucino, deputy chief counsel and legal director at Giffords Law Center. \"And it would further suggest an impunity for one particular industry in our country.\"",
      "Giffords is one of several gun violence prevention groups that submitted a friend-of-the-court brief backing Mexico in the case.",
      "\"They're trying to take the existing federal immunity statute and dramatically expand its reach because the statute was written and passed with an exception that prevents law-breakers from claiming immunity,\" he said. \"The restrictions do not apply when the plaintiffs can trace the harm they suffered to a violation of state or federal law.\"",
      "Some lawsuits brought against gun manufacturers in state courts have been successful at getting through PLCAA's liability shield \u2014 notably a historic $73 million settlement the families of the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school shooting reached with Remington Arms, which made the rifle used in the massacre.",
      "And since 2021, at least nine states have enacted laws that authorize civil lawsuits against the gun industry.",
      "Willinger said that if Mexico prevails before the Supreme Court, it \"would be a stamp of approval for some of these state firearm nuisance laws and some of these efforts that have been happening at the state level to essentially make it easier to bring cases under the predicate exception.\"",
      "While the case does not involve the Second Amendment, it comes on the heels of a June 2022 Supreme Court decision that expanded gun rights. The high court is also considering the legality of a rule that regulates unserialized firearms called ghost guns, though that case involves whether the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms exceeded its authority.",

    "story": [
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country felt the full support of its European allies after a summit in London over the weekend, as he reiterated the need for Western security guarantees as part of any agreement to secure a lasting end to the war sparked by Russia's full-scale invasion of his country three years ago. Ukraine fears Russia would renege on any peace deal that doesn't carry with it the threat that Ukraine's partners would come to its aid in case of a violation.",
      "\"For peace to be real, we need real security guarantees. And this is the position of all of Europe \u2013 the entire continent,\" Zelenskyy said in a social media post Monday, three days after President Trump and Vice President JD Vance accused him of being \"disrespectful\" and failing to offer thanks during a contentious Oval Office meeting with news cameras rolling.",
      "\"Of course, we understand the importance of America, and we are grateful for all the support we've received from the United States,\" Zelenskyy said Monday. \"There has not been a day when we haven't felt gratitude. It's gratitude for the preservation of our independence \u2013 our resilience in Ukraine is based on what our partners are doing for us \u2013 and for their own security. What we need is peace, not endless war. And that's why we say security guarantees are the key to this.\"",
      "The Sunday summit of European leaders organized by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer was already scheduled before the tense meeting in Washington between Zelenskyy and Mr. Trump, but it took on new meaning in the wake of the exchange.",
      "Mr. Trump's attitude toward Ukraine's wartime president compounded existing concerns among European leaders about the current American administration's commitment to ensuring not only Ukraine's independence going forward, but European security in general as the continent faces an increasingly aggressive Russian state run by authoritarian leader Vladimir Putin.",
      "\"This is not a moment for more talk. It's time to act,\" Starmer said after the gathering with his fellow European leaders on Sunday. \"Time to step up and lead and to unite around a new plan for a just and enduring peace.\"",
      "After the summit on Sunday, Zelenskyy gave a briefing in Ukrainian in which he said he believed a peace deal with Russia \"is still very, very far away,\" but that Ukraine's relationship with the U.S. would remain strong.",
      "\"I think our relationship (with the U.S.) will continue, because it's more than an occasional relationship,\" Zelenskyy said, referring to the support the U.S. has provided Ukraine since Russia's invasion. His comments were covered by the Associated Press.",
      "Later on Monday, Mr. Trump posted a link to the AP's story covering Zelenskyy's comments and criticized the Ukrainian leader.",
      "\"This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!\" Mr. Trump said. \"It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be Peace as long as he has America's backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S. - Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?\"",
      "What came out of the London summit?",
      "Starmer said Monday that there were \"a number of options on the table\" for possible peace plans to end the war Russia started, all of which were developed alongside Ukraine, but he said he didn't want to get \"into a running commentary on the options.\"",
      "\"We have to learn from the mistakes of the past,\" Starmer said. \"We cannot accept a weak deal which Russia can breach with ease. Instead, any deal must be backed by strength.\"",
      "Ahead of the summit, French President Emmanuel Macron told local media one possible plan would involve a monthlong ceasefire, but covering only the air, sea and energy infrastructure, not the ongoing and deadly ground fighting.",
      "After the summit, Starmer announced four key points that he said had been agreed to by the European leaders:",
      "To maintain military aid flowing to Ukraine and continue applying economic pressure on RussiaThat Ukraine must be present at any peace talks, and that any lasting peace must guarantee Ukraine's sovereignty and securityTo boost Ukraine's defensive capabilities if a peace deal is agreed to halt the warTo create a \"coalition of the willing\" to help defend any peace deal that is implemented in Ukraine.",
      "To maintain military aid flowing to Ukraine and continue applying economic pressure on Russia",
      "That Ukraine must be present at any peace talks, and that any lasting peace must guarantee Ukraine's sovereignty and security",
      "To boost Ukraine's defensive capabilities if a peace deal is agreed to halt the war",
      "To create a \"coalition of the willing\" to help defend any peace deal that is implemented in Ukraine.",
      "Starmer also announced a new agreement that will enable Ukraine to obtain about $2 billion worth of missiles made in Northern Ireland to continue its war effort.",
      "Ripple effects from White House meeting still being felt",
      "Russia has lauded Mr. Trump in the wake of his clash with Zelenskyy, which came after a week that saw the U.S. leader echo false talking points Moscow has pushed since it launched its full-scale invasion, including the assertion that Ukraine started the war and that Zelenskyy is an illegitimate leader.",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Monday that \"the Kyiv regime and Zelenskyy do not want peace,\" adding that the clash between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy, \"demonstrated how difficult it will be to reach a settlement trajectory around Ukraine.\"",
      "\"It is very important that someone forces Zelenskyy himself to change his position,\" Peskov said. \"Someone has to make Zelenskyy want peace. If the Europeans can do it, they should be honored and praised.\"",
      "In the meantime, Russia has continued hammering Ukraine with deadly airstrikes. More than 80 explosive drones were launched at Ukraine overnight, killing at least eight people, including a 7-year-old child, CBS News' partner network BBC News reported Monday.",
      "Zelenskyy said Sunday that Ukraine was still willing to sign a minerals deal with the Trump administration which would grant the U.S. access to Ukraine's prized natural resources. He had been expected to sign the deal during his visit to Washington last week, but never committed to it in advance as it was unclear whether Ukraine was being offered security guarantees in exchange for its mineral wealth, and he was then asked to leave the White House early following the tense exchange with Mr. Trump.",
      "U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz, speaking Monday on Fox News, said it seemed as though Zelenskyy was \"not ready to talk peace.\" He said, however, that if the Ukrainian leader is seen as changing that stance, showing he \"has regret\" for the way things transpired in Washington, and is ready to sign a deal on Ukraine's minerals, he wouldn't rule out Kyiv and Washington reaching an agreement. He even suggested it could come together in time for Mr. Trump to announce a deal when he delivers a national address on Tuesday night.",
      "\"We'd certainly like to see that happen,\" Waltz said.",
      "Earlier, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it was \"impossible to have an economic deal without a peace deal,\" and he accused Zelenskyy of having \"thrown off the sequencing\" of the deals by trying \"to relitigate in front of the world\" in the Oval Office.",
      "But some European leaders disagreed with that interpretation of events.",
      "\"My assessment is that it wasn't a spontaneous reaction to interventions by Zelenskyy, but apparently an induced escalation in this meeting in the Oval Office,\" Friedrich Merz, who is likely to be Germany's next leader, said Monday. \"We must now show that we are in a position to act independently in Europe.\"",

Benning, who was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his extraordinary heroism in action during World War I, when he served in the U.S. Army in France in 1918. Benning died in 1974.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced Monday that a leading Taiwanese semiconductor chip company plans to invest $100 billion in new manufacturing plants in the U.S.",
      "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, is one of the world's largest manufacturers of semiconductor chips, and plans to make the major investment over the next several years. Mr. Trump made the announcement in the White House Roosevelt Room alongside the company's CEO, C.C. Wei.",
      "\"Today, Taiwan Semiconductor is announcing that they will be investing at least $100 billion in new capital in the United States over the next short period of time to build state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facilities,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think mostly it's going to be in Arizona which is what I understand, which is a great state. I like it because I won it.\"",
      "The president called TSMC the \"most powerful company in the world,\" and said the economic development announcement is a \"matter of economic security\" and a \"matter of national security for us.\"",
      "The Wall Street Journal was first to report the investment pledge. TSMC was promised $6.6 billion in funding under the Biden-era CHIPS and SCIENCE Act of 2022, and announced plans for its first U.S. plant in Arizona.",
      "The anticipated announcement comes amid Mr. Trump's threats to impose tariffs on semiconductor chip imports, which TSMC could avoid by manufacturing the chips in the U.S. The president has also floated expedited permits for companies that invest at least $1 billion in the U.S. Mr. Trump noted Monday that if Wei's company made the chips in Taiwan and exported them to the U.S., they'd face 25% tariffs.",
      "Speaking at the White House, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick credited the tariffs with the TSMC announcement.",
      "\"Under the Biden administration, TSMC received a $6 billion grant, and that encouraged them to build $65 billion. So America gave TSMC 10% of the money to build here. And now you're seeing the power of Donald Trump's presidency,\" Lutnick said. \"TSMC, the greatest manufacturer of chips in the world, is coming to America with a hundred-billion-dollar investment, and of course that is backed by the fact that they can come here because they can avoid paying tariffs.\"",
      "Semiconductor chips are small but critical components for today's technology, with small pieces of silicone that contain electronic circuits. Semiconductor chips are found in everything from iPhones to cars, and demand has boomed in recent years thanks to the explosion in artificial intelligence, which requires an enormous amount of computing power.",
      "\"Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"And really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy, powering everything from AI to automobiles to advanced manufacturing.\"",
      "The vast majority of semiconductor chips are manufactured in Asian countries, with Taiwan at the top, and the Trump administration is hoping to draw more manufacturing to the U.S. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have viewed increasing U.S. chip manufacturing a matter of national security.",
      "\"We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in American factories with American skill and American labor,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And that's exactly what we're doing. As you know, Taiwan pretty much has a monopoly on that market.\"",

    "summary": "Two Democrats have asked for documents and communications related to the corruption charges against the New York mayor.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Two top Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have launched an investigation into the Justice Department for seeking to dismiss charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "In a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi on Sunday, Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Jasmine Crockett of Texas accused the Justice Department of attempting to cover up an alleged quid pro quo to drop the corruption charges against Adams if he assisted the Trump administration in carrying out its immigration policies.",
      "\"Last month, troubling reports emerged about the Trump Administration's demand that federal prosecutors move to dismiss the serious public corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams as part of a blatant and illegal quid pro quo to secure the Mayor's loyal assistance in executing the Trump Administration's mass arrest and deportation policies,\" the letter said.",
      "\"Not only did the Department of Justice (DOJ) attempt to pressure career prosecutors into carrying out this illegal quid pro quo, it appears that Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove was personally engaged in a cover-up by destroying evidence and retaliating against career prosecutors who refused to follow his illegal and unethical orders,\" it continued. \"We write to demand that you immediately put an end to the cover-up and retaliation and provide documents and information about these disturbing accounts to Congress.\"",
      "Adams, a Democrat, was indicted on five counts in September, including bribery, conspiracy and campaign finance violations. He was accused of accepting illegal campaign donations, flight upgrades and other travel benefits from a Turkish official and other foreign nationals in exchange for political favors. He pleaded not guilty to all of the charges.",
      "In February, Bove instructed federal prosecutors in New York to drop the corruption case, citing Adams' \"restricted\" ability to help the Trump administration enforce its immigration policies.",
      "The move to drop the charges prompted the resignation of Manhattan's top career federal prosecutor, Danielle Sassoon, who said the request raised \"serious concerns that render the contemplated dismissal inconsistent with my ability and duty to prosecute federal crimes without fear or favor and to advance good-faith arguments before the courts.\"",
      "\"It is a breathtaking and dangerous precedent to reward Adams's opportunistic and shifting commitments on immigration and other policy matters with dismissal of a criminal indictment. Nor will a court likely find that such an improper exchange is consistent with the public interest,\" Sassoon wrote.",
      "The charges have yet to be formally dropped.",
      "In their letter to the Justice Department, Raskin and Crockett said the department \"has strayed far from its principles of equal justice under the law by dismissing a serious criminal public corruption matter in exchange for assistance with the White House's immigration priorities.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, this is yet another example of the Trump DOJ allowing criminals to go free \u2014 whether they assaulted police officers, sold drugs to the community, or are corrupt politicians \u2014 as long as the criminals pledge loyalty to President Trump,\" they wrote.",
      "The lawmakers have requested that the Justice Department turn over notes related to a Jan. 31 meeting between federal prosecutors and Adams' lawyers, and asked whether any of the documents have been destroyed. They also requested the White House and Justice Department communications related to the investigation into Adams. They gave Bondi a March 17 deadline.",
      "But Raskin and Crockett, who are in the minority party, have limited authority to take action against the Justice Department if their requests are denied.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court declined to hear a case involving whether bias-response teams created at universities chill speech on campus.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday declined to consider whether university \"bias-response teams\" chill students' speech in violation of the First Amendment, sidestepping a clash of free speech rights and university efforts to root out bias on campus.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito said he would take up the appeal from the organization Speech First, an organization that aims to protect free speech rights on college campuses. Justice Clarence Thomas dissented from the court's denial of the case.",
      "\"Given the number of schools with bias response teams, this court eventually will need to resolve the split over a student's right to challenge such programs,\" Thomas wrote. \"The court's refusal to intervene now leaves students subject to a 'patchwork of First Amendment rights,' with a student's ability to challenge his university's bias response policies varying depending on accidents of geography.\"",
      "At issue in the case was whether the bias-response teams that have been created at hundreds of universities chill speech on campus. Speech First has mounted similar challenges to bias-response teams at the University of Michigan, University of Texas and University of Central Florida.",
      "The efforts at those schools, however, no longer exist after they reached settlement agreements with the group that eliminated the teams.",
      "Speech First's suit targets the response team at Indiana University, which created a Bias Response and Education initiative that includes a bias incident process. Through this initiative, students who witness or experience a \"bias incident\" are encouraged to submit a report to alert the school. The university defines a bias incident as \"any conduct, speech, or expression, motivated in whole or in part by bias or prejudice meant to intimidate, demean, mock, degrade, marginalize, or threaten individuals or groups based on that individual or group's actual or perceived identities.\"",
      "The university says that bias incident reports are reviewed by a team of university officials who may initiate conversations around the incident and impacted students; refer the reporter to appropriate campus offices; and refer the impacted students to support resources. The team also logs reported incidents and tracks them for trends, notifies campus leaders of ongoing bias incidents and educates the campus community about bias, according to its website.",
      "The bias-response team does not take disciplinary action, conduct formal investigations or \"impinge on free speech rights and academic freedom,\" its website states.",
      "Speech First brought its lawsuit against Indiana University in May 2024 on behalf of members at the school who are \"politically conservative and hold views that are unpopular, controversial, and in the minority on campus,\" according to court filings. One student, for example, believes that \"sex is determined by biology\" and transgender women shouldn't be allowed to compete in women's sports, the group said.",
      "But Speech First said the students censor their speech because of Indiana University's bias policy and fear they will be reported to the school for committing a bias incident.",
      "The group asked a federal district court to block the university from enforcing its bias-incident policy and argued it violates students' free speech rights. The court denied Speech First's request for an injunction because of a ruling in a similar case involving the Bias Assessment and Incident Response Team at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.",
      "In that case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit found that Speech First did not have the legal right to sue because the University of Illinois' team didn't have the power to formally punish students. The 7th Circuit said Speech First failed to demonstrate whether any student faced an \"objectively reasonable chilling effect\" on his or her speech.",
      "The appeals court then upheld the district court's decision in the case involving Indiana University, and Speech First appealed to the Supreme Court.",
      "\"Bias-response teams chill speech by creating a formalized system where students constantly monitor and anonymously report each other to the university,\" the group's lawyers told the Supreme Court in its petition. \"The reputational damage from being labeled a bias offender is chilling too. As is the knowledge that officials are logging and investigating protected speech. \"",
      "The high court has considered the issue of bias-response teams at universities once before. In March 2024, the court ordered a federal appeals court to toss out a case challenging Virginia Tech's bias intervention and response team policy, likely because it had been changed.",
      "But two justices, Thomas and Alito, said they would have agreed to hear that case.",
      "\"This petition presents a high-stakes issue for our nation's system of higher education,\" Thomas wrote in an opinion joined by Alito. \"Until we resolve it, there will be a patchwork of First Amendment rights on college campuses: Students in part of the country may pursue challenges to their universities' policies, while students in other parts have no recourse and are potentially pressured to avoid controversial speech to escape their universities' scrutiny and condemnation.\"",

According to the Justice Department, Shry's voicemail message \"threatened to kill anyone who went after former President Trump.\" The charging documents in Shry's case allege she referred to Chutkan as a \"slave (epithet)\" in the message.",

Some judges noted the frequency of violent threats targeting judges during the Jan. 6 sentencing hearings.",
      "Shry's sentencing has been postponed multiple times, but carries the prospect of a prison term. Her attorney declined CBS News request for comment, including what sentence Shry will seek at the hearing.",
      "At a detention hearing in Shry's case last year, a defense attorney suggested the court order her to undergo mental health and substance abuse treatment. A Justice Department prosecutor argued she could be at risk of making future threats. The prosecutor told the judge in May 2024, \"Judge, my greatest concern in this case is that she starts watching Fox News again, gets herself spun up, she goes out, she gets a case of beer, continues to get herself spun up.

      "A little over a month after\u00a0a civilian jet broke the sound barrier, Boom Supersonic and NASA have released a photo of one of the aircraft's\u00a0historic test flights over the Mojave Desert.",
      "The image released Monday shows the XB-1 aircraft, which Boom Supersonic said is the \"first civil supersonic jet made in America,\" during its second supersonic flight on Feb. 10. The company said it partnered with NASA using a technique known as Schlieren photography to visualize what can't be seen with the naked eye.",
      "\"This image makes the invisible visible,\" Boom Supersonic founder and CEO Blake Scholl said in a news release.",
      "Chief test pilot Tristan \"Geppetto\" Brandenburg had to make sure XB-1 was in the right place at the right time to allow NASA's team on the ground to photograph it in-flight as it eclipsed the sun, the Colorado-based company said. Crews used telescopes with special filters that can detect air distortions like shock waves to capture the image.",
      "The photo was taken during the XB-1's 13th overall test flight, according to the company, but it was the second time it flew at supersonic speed, this time reaching Mach 1.18, or 772 mph, Boom Supersonic said.",
      "Scholl said that the XB-1 didn't make an audible sonic boom that typically occurs when an aircraft is flying faster than the speed of sound. The captured data suggests that, at certain speed and atmospheric conditions, the sonic boom refracts in the atmosphere and never reaches the ground. The finding may lead the way for supersonic commercial flights without sonic booms, the company said in its news release.",
      "NASA first visually captured supersonic shock waves in 2019 after a decade of research. The technology was developed in part to aid the space agency in\u00a0testing its own supersonic aircraft, X-59.",

    "summary": "The Blue Ghost touchdown kicks off two weeks of around-the-clock research by NASA science and technology payloads.",
    "story": [
      "Firefly Aerospace's \"Blue Ghost\" lander dropped out of lunar orbit and swooped to a rocket-powered touchdown early Sunday, pulling off the first fully successful moon landing by a commercially-built and operated robotic spacecraft.",
      "Flying above the far side of the moon in a circular 62-mile-high orbit, the squat lander fired its main engine at 2:31 a.m. EST, kicking off a white-knuckle 63-minute descent to the landing site in Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crises \u2014 in the northeast quadrant of the moon as viewed from Earth.",
      "The 6.6-foot-tall lander coasted for the next 52 minutes before using its main engine and eight smaller reaction control system, or RCS, thrusters to reduce its velocity from about 3,800 mph to just 90 mph as it moved into position above the landing site.",
      "After autonomously analyzing the terrain below for boulders, slopes, and other hazards, Blue Ghost descended using the power of its eight reaction control system jets. The jets pulsed as needed to control velocity and orientation before slowing the craft to just 2.2 mph for the last 30 feet or so of the descent.",
      "Firefly Aerospace employees and family members, known collectively as \"Fireflies,\" watched telemetry stream in on a large monitor near the company's Austin, Texas, headquarters and mission control center, no doubt on the edges of their seats as the 11.5-foot-wide spacecraft neared the surface.",
      "\"Eleven meters up,\" a flight controller said on the Firefly mission control audio loop. A moment later, the thrusters shut down and surface contact sensors on Blue Ghost's shock-absorbing landing legs indicated they were on the lunar surface.",
      "\"Engine shutdown confirmed,\" a flight controller verified.",
      "\"Power is nominal, vehicle is charging (with its solar cells),\" someone else chimed in.",
      "\"IMU (inertial measurement unit) reports lunar gravity, and it is stable,\" another controller reported, prompting the start of applause from onlookers.",
      "Will Coogan, the chief engineer, then came on the line with the official results: \"You all stuck the landing! We're on the moon!\"",
      "The assembled Fireflies instantly burst into cheers, hugs and raucous applause. A few minutes later, \"Make Space Great Again\" hats were handed out.",
      "\"Firefly successfully touched down on the moon in an upright, stable condition, becoming the first commercial company to complete a fully successful moon landing,\" said Brigette Oakes, Firefly vice president of engineering.",
      "Apollo 11 moonwalker Buzz Aldrin said in a post on the social media platform X: \"'Contact light, engine stop!' Congratulations FireFly Aerospace for Blue Ghost's Mission 1 successful Moon landing today! It also marks a new milestone in the collaborations between NASA and private Space companies.\"",
      "Launched on Jan. 15, the landing was timed to coincide with the start of a two-week-long lunar day. The solar-powered Blue Ghost will operate 10 NASA-sponsored experiments while sunlight is available and, if all goes well, for a few hours into the lunar night using stored battery power. After that, it will fall silent.",
      "\"Once in a blue-moon long-time ago, these type of lunar landers took billions of dollars and countries behind (them) to land on the moon,\" Firefly CEO Jason Kim told CBS News in a pre-launch interview.",
      "\"This is Firefly Aerospace that's gonna land on the moon at fractions of the cost on a fixed-price contract, and doing it with the latest commercial technology,\" he said. \"Just like Simone Biles stuck the landing in the Olympics, we're gonna do the same thing for the state of Texas, for America and for the world.\"",
      "For Ray Allensworth, spacecraft program director at Firefly, the moon will never look the same.",
      "\"We were all dreaming up until now that you look up at the (moon) and you just imagine, like, that's where it's gonna be,\" she said. \"But now, you know it's there, and that's a totally different feeling. So, yeah, the next full moon, I just won't sleep. I'll just stare at it all night.\"",
      "NASA agreed to pay Firefly Aerospace $101 million to carry 10 agency-sponsored science instruments and technology demonstrations, built for $44 million, to the moon as part of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program aims to encourage private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"Before we can send our humans back to the moon, we are sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\" said Nicky Fox, director of space science at NASA Headquarters.",
      "\"We learned so many lessons during the Apollo era, and the technological and science demonstrations on board Firefly's Blue Ghost will be critical in our ability to not only discover more science, but also to ensure the safety of our spacecraft instruments, and, most importantly, the safety of our astronauts.\"",
      "Firefly's instruments include three designed to study how landing thrusters disturb the lunar soil, how fine-grained dust particles adhere to spacecraft surfaces and whether electrodynamic techniques for removing accumulated contamination will work in the lunar environment.",
      "A drill will bore into the surface below the Blue Ghost to measure soil temperatures at different depths while a novel sample collection system will attempt to literally blow surface particles into a capture device, foregoing the need for robot arm-type retrieval systems.",
      "A radiation-tolerant computer will be tested, another instrument will attempt to pull in and process GPS navigation satellite data from Earth, a retroreflector will serve as a positioning target for Earth-based lasers and another instrument will take X-ray images showing interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field.",
      "Along with its initial Blue Ghost mission, Firefly holds a $130 million CLPS contract for a second flight in 2026, this one to the moon's far side featuring a Blue Ghost lander and an orbital spacecraft called Elytra. Another CLPS contract valued at $179 million is helping pay for a Blue Ghost lander, a rover and another orbiter.",
      "\"One of these days, we're going to get there in terms of the commercial aspects of the moon,\" Kim said. \"There's going to be a lot of business plans that are going to be self-sustaining and growing. It's a great location to frequently go and test out new missions to sustain life in space, and it's a stepping stone for Mars as well.\"",
      "Blue Ghost is the first of three commercially-developed landers, all launched within the last month and a half, to reach the lunar surface.",
      "Sharing a ride to space with Blue Ghost aboard the same SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket last January was another moon lander, a spacecraft called \"Resilience\" that was built by Tokyo-based ispace. The company sent its first lander to the moon last year, but it crashed to the surface after running out of fuel due to a software glitch.",
      "The appropriately-named Resilience took a different route to the moon than Blue Ghost, a low-energy trajectory utilizing lunar gravity to help reach the desired descent orbit for a landing attempt in May.",
      "Yet another lunar lander, built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines and known as Athena, was launched last Wednesday by another Falcon 9 and is expected to touch down on the moon March 6. The company's first lander, Odysseus, successfully landed on the moon last year, but it tipped over on touchdown and was unable to complete all its planned research.",
      "Athena also was funded in large part by NASA's CLPS program, which agreed to pay the company $62.5 million to carry a sophisticated drill and mass spectrometer to the moon.",
      "NASA awarded a $15 million technology \"tipping point\" contract to Nokia to test cellular communications on the moon and another $41 million to Intuitive Machines for a small rocket-powered \"hopper\" that will jump into a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice deposits.",

      "To see Uranus and Neptune, you'll need a telescope, NASA said. Uranus will appear in the Aries constellation, and Neptune will be in Pisces, Star Walk said.",
      "The display will only be visible for a few minutes after sunset, because the planets near the horizon \u2014 Saturn and Mercury \u2014 will be setting. Once they drop below the horizon, they will no longer be visible, but the other planets will linger in the night sky.",
      "For the best view, head to a location with minimal light pollution and a clear view of the horizon. Clear skies will also be necessary to see all the planets.",
      "How do planetary alignments work?",

      "Arcing to the east through a crystal-clear early evening sky, the rocket quickly disappeared from view as it consumed propellant and lost weight. Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, the first stage fell away and the Falcon 9 continued toward space on the power of its single second stage engine.",
      "A little less than six minutes after that, the upper stage engine shut down, putting the rocket on the planned trajectory. A second one-minute firing was carried out 36 minutes after launch to put the upper stage and its payloads on course for the moon.",

      "A tiny microrover known as Yaoki, provided by Tokyo-based Dymon Co., will be dropped to the surface from the Athena lander. It will provide close-up images of the lunar soil, or regolith, and beam them back to Earth through Athena.",
      "In case all that is not enough, hitching a ride aboard the Falcon 9 are three more independent spacecraft, one provided by NASA and two from private companies.",
      "AstroForge's commercially developed Odin asteroid prospector was released four minutes after Athena, NASA's Lunar Trailblazer satellite was deployed about 20 seconds after that followed a few seconds later by Epic Aerospace's Chimera GEO-1 space tug.",
      "Odin is headed for deep space on an asteroid prospecting mission. It will be the first commercially-built probe to fly beyond the moon, heading for an asteroid flyby to look for potentially valuable mineral deposits.",
      "During the Lunar Trailblazer's two-year mission, two instruments will study the nature of any ice that might be present in the lunar soil below while measuring surface temperatures on a global scale.",
      "The third satellite, known as Chimera GEO, was provided by Epic Aerospace. It's a compact space tug built to move small satellites to different locations in Earth orbit.",
      "The Grace hopper may end up the star of the show. Five hops are planned with the first carrying it to an altitude of about 65 feet to a landing another 65 feet from Athena.",
      "\"On the second hop, we expect to go around 50 meters (164 feet) altitude. And on the third hop we'll go about 100 meters (328 feet) altitude,\" said Trent Martin, a senior vice president at Intuitive Machines.",
      "The fourth hop will carry Grace into a permanently shadowed crater some 1,500 from the lander. It's fifth and final hop, either commanded through the Nokia network or triggered by a backup timer, will carry Gracie back up and out of the crater.",
      "\"The purpose of the demo is to show that we can reach extreme environments with technologies other than rovers,\" Martin said. \"The idea is that if you have a really deep crater and you want to get down into that crater, why not do it with something like a drone?\"",
      "The costs of the mission",
      "NASA paid Intuitive Machines $62 million to deliver the Trident drill and mass spectrometer, known collectively as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million to help fund Nokia's cellular communications integration and another $41 million helps finance Intuitive's Grace hopper.",
      "Finally, NASA spent another $89 million on the Lunar Trailblazer satellite and mission operations. Total cost to NASA: $207 million.",
      "The mission was funded in large part by the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"NASA is investing in commercial delivery services to the moon to enable industry growth and to support long-term lunar exploration, helping the United States stay ahead in space innovation,\" said Nicola Fox, head of NASA's space science mission directorate.",
      "Athena is Intuitive Machines' second CLPS-sponsored lunar lander. The company's first lander, Odysseus, touched down on the moon on Feb. 22, 2024. But the spacecraft came down harder than expected and it was moving slightly to one side at the moment of touchdown. It apparently caught a footpad on the surface and tipped over on its side.",
      "The spacecraft still had power, however, and it sent back data for several days. This time around, multiple upgrades were put in place to insure a safe landing for Athena.",
      "\"If you can routinely land on the moon, all the smart people, the scientists, and the engineers that want to fly things to the moon will now be willing to invest money, to build and engineer the systems that will help us live and work on the moon,\" Altemus said.",
      "\"These are the initial highways or trails that open up a whole new region of exploration of the moon. Like the United States when it was very young, go west, right? This is like that. Just like that.\"",

      "A little over a month after\u00a0a civilian jet broke the sound barrier, Boom Supersonic and NASA have released a photo of one of the aircraft's\u00a0historic test flights over the Mojave Desert.",
      "The image released Monday shows the XB-1 aircraft, which Boom Supersonic said is the \"first civil supersonic jet made in America,\" during its second supersonic flight on Feb. 10. The company said it partnered with NASA using a technique known as Schlieren photography to visualize what can't be seen with the naked eye.",
      "\"This image makes the invisible visible,\" Boom Supersonic founder and CEO Blake Scholl said in a news release.",
      "Chief test pilot Tristan \"Geppetto\" Brandenburg had to make sure XB-1 was in the right place at the right time to allow NASA's team on the ground to photograph it in-flight as it eclipsed the sun, the Colorado-based company said. Crews used telescopes with special filters that can detect air distortions like shock waves to capture the image.",
      "The photo was taken during the XB-1's 13th overall test flight, according to the company, but it was the second time it flew at supersonic speed, this time reaching Mach 1.18, or 772 mph, Boom Supersonic said.",
      "Scholl said that the XB-1 didn't make an audible sonic boom that typically occurs when an aircraft is flying faster than the speed of sound. The captured data suggests that, at certain speed and atmospheric conditions, the sonic boom refracts in the atmosphere and never reaches the ground. The finding may lead the way for supersonic commercial flights without sonic booms, the company said in its news release.",
      "NASA first visually captured supersonic shock waves in 2019 after a decade of research. The technology was developed in part to aid the space agency in\u00a0testing its own supersonic aircraft, X-59.",

      "Microsoft in late 2012\u00a0scrapped its own instant-messaging\u00a0tool, Messenger, after buying Skype the prior year. But in the more than decade since, services including FaceTime, Messenger and WhatsApp have let people connect in ways that made it difficult for Skype to compete.",
      "The difficulties were illustrated in particular during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic that saw people\u00a0stuck at home flocking to Zoom. Microsoft launched Teams for consumers in 2020, while saying at the time it remained committed to Skype.",
      "Skype was launched in 2003 by entrepreneurs Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, with the company's name combining \"Sky\" with a reference to peer-to-peer networks, the technology that during the dotcom boom became an important new way for sharing online files and data.",
      "The company's founders first sold Skype to eBay in 2005 for $2.6 billion. Microsoft's acquisition in May of 2011, at the time the biggest ever purchase for the software maker, gave it access to a user base of about 170 million people who logged in to Skype each month. That count morphed to more than 300 million monthly users by 2016, but had shriveled to 36 million in 2023, Microsoft said.",

    "story": [
      "The Hague\u00a0\u2014 A global campaign has led to at least 25 arrests over child sexual abuse content generated by artificial intelligence and distributed online, Europol said Friday.",
      "\"Operation Cumberland has been one of the first cases involving AI-generated child sexual abuse material, making it exceptionally challenging for investigators due to the lack of national legislation addressing these crimes,\" the Hague-based European police agency said in a statement.",
      "The majority of the arrests were made Wednesday during the world-wide operation led by the Danish police, and which also involved law enforcement agencies from the EU, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. U.S. law enforcement agencies did not take part in the operation, according to Europol.",
      "It followed the arrest last November of the main suspect in the case, a Danish national who ran an online platform where he distributed the AI material he produced.",
      "After a \"symbolic online payment, users from around the world were able to obtain a password to access the platform and watch children being abused,\" Europol said.",
      "Online child sexual exploitation remains one of the most threatening manifestations of cybercrime in the European Union, the agency warned.",
      "It \"continues to be one of the top priorities for law enforcement agencies, which are dealing with an ever-growing volume of illegal content,\" it said, adding that more arrests were expected as the investigation continued.",
      "While Europol said Operation Cumberland targeted a platform and people sharing content fully created using AI, there has also been a worrying proliferation of AI-manipulated \"deepfake\" imagery online, which often uses images of real people, including children, and can have devastating impacts on their lives.",
      "According to a report by CBS News' Jim Axelrod in December that focused on one girl who had been targeted for such abuse by a classmate, there were more than 21,000 deepfake pornographic pictures or videos online during 2023, an increase of more than 460% over the year prior. The manipulated content has proliferated on the internet as lawmakers in the U.S. and elsewhere race to catch up with new legislation to address the problem.",
      "Just weeks ago the Senate passed a bipartisan bill called the \"TAKE IT DOWN Act\" that, if signed into law, would criminalize the \"publication of non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII), including AI-generated NCII (or \"deepfake revenge pornography\"), and requires social media and similar websites to implement procedures to remove such content within 48 hours of notice from a victim,\" according to a description on the U.S. Senate website.",
      "As it stands, some social media platforms have appeared unable or unwilling to crackdown on the spread of sexualized, AI-generated deepfake content, including fake images depicting celebrities. In mid-February, Facebook and Instagram owner Meta said it had removed over a dozen fraudulent sexualized images of famous female actors and athletes after a CBS News investigation found a high prevalence of AI-manipulated deepfake images on Facebook.",

      "The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, had called on Apple to follow other major companies in backing off from DEI, which has come under fire from Republicans and from President Donald Trump.",
      "\"DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to companies, and therefore financial risks to their shareholders, and therefore further risks to companies for not abiding by their fiduciary duties,\" according to the\u00a0proposal offered by the group. It offered a similar proposal at Costco's annual meeting in January that shareholders also\u00a0rejected.",
      "\"The risks to Apple stemming from continuing to push these divisive and value-destroying agendas is only increasing in light of President Trump's recent executive order focusing the Department of Justice on rooting out illegal discrimination being carried out in the name of DEI,\" Stephen Padfield, executive director of the National Center for Public Policy Research's Free Enterprise Project, said in a prerecorded statement played to Apple shareholders on Tuesday.",
      "\"The vibe shift is clear, DEI is out and annual merit is in,\" Padfield said.",
      "In responding to the anti-DEI proposal, Apple defended its diversity program as an integral part of its corporate culture, crediting the policies in part for making the technology giant the most valuable company in the world.",
      "\"We've never had quotas or targets for Apple. Our strength has always come from hiring the very best people and then providing a culture of collaboration,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said during a question-and-answer period at the meeting, while conceding the company may need to revise aspects of its diversity policies \"as the legal landscape\" around DEI evolves.",
      "\"But our North Star of dignity and respect for everyone, and our work to that end, will never waver,\" he said.",
      "Apple disclosed in 2022 that nearly three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees; early two-thirds of its employees were men.",
      "Mr. Trump slammed the decision by Apple shareholders to reject the proposal to end the company's DEI initiatives.",
      "\"Apple should get rid of DEI rules, not just make adjustments to them. DEI was a hoax that has been very bad for our country. DEI is gone!!!\" he wrote in a social media post on Wednesday.",

      "But that trend has reversed of late, with Ford,\u00a0Google, McDonald's, Meta,\u00a0Target, Walmart and other large corporations scaling back their diversity initiatives under pressure from conservative activists emboldened by court rulings and by President Trump, who has banned DEI programs across the federal government.",
      "Shifting DEI landscape",
      "Certain forms of DEI have become more legally risky than just a few years ago, yet practices such as employers posing standardized questions in recruitment to mitigate implicit bias are legally sound, according to David Glasgow, an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law and executive director of its Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging.",
      "\"DEI is a really broad umbrella term covering things like disabilities, parental leave and flexible work. The anti-DEI folks have done a good job of driving the narrative that it's all about racial quotas and preferences,\" which in reality is just a narrow slice of such initiatives, Glasgow told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some companies' response to the current legal and political climate is a matter of rebranding, Glasgow said. Businesses may ditch the terms diversity, equity and inclusion, while substituting references to \"welcoming\" and \"belonging.\"",
      "\"[I]t's more about getting anti-DEI activists off their back,\" Glasgow said.",
      "Critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. By contrast, advocates of these policies say that supporting inclusivity doesn't inhibit companies from rewarding top-performing employees, while also helping organizations create a respectful workplace culture.",
      "Despite the pushback on diversity, roughly half of corporate leaders who were surveyed after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration said they weren't considering rolling back their DEI programs, according to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0of 350 C-suite executives from Littler, a law firm focused on labor and employment issues.

      "Presidents typically address a joint session of Congress early in their tenure to outline a vision or agenda. The first speech before lawmakers is not technically a State of the Union, but rather an Address to a Joint Session of Congress.",
      "As is customary, House Speaker Mike Johnson in January invited Mr. Trump to address Congress and \"share his America First vision for our future.\" In a letter to the president, the speaker wrote that the Trump administration and the Republican majorities in Congress will \"have the chance to make these next four years some of the most consequential in our nation's history.\"",
      "\"America's Golden Age has begun,\" Johnson said in the letter, echoing a line from Mr. Trump's inaugural address, while touting a \"resurgence of patriotism, unity, and hope for the future.\"",
      "What time will Trump's speech start and end?",
      "The president's address is set to begin at 9 p.m. ET. Its running time remains to be seen. During his first term, Mr. Trump's 2017\u00a0joint address to Congress ran about one hour. Over the next three years, his State of the Union addresses averaged 80 minutes, according to the American Presidency Project.",
      "How to watch Trump's speech on cable",
      "CBS News will carry the address live and air a primetime special at 9 p.m. ET. Find your local CBS station here.",
      "Where to stream Trump's speech without cable",
      "Stream CBS News' coverage for free on CBS News 24/7, available on CBSNews.com, the CBS News app and Paramount+.",
      "Context to know for Trump's address to Congress",
      "Mr. Trump's address to Congress comes six weeks after he returned to office for a second term. So far, Americans agree that he is making major changes to how the government works, though there's a divide on whether they view the changes as better or worse, according to CBS News polling released Sunday.",
      "The president has pursued a dramatic overhaul of the federal bureaucracy and a cost-cutting effort alongside Elon Musk, who he's tapped to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. DOGE has been working with Cabinet department and agency heads to shrink the government workforce, while halting swaths of government spending. A number of Democrats are bringing former government employees fired as a result of the DOGE cuts as their guests to Tuesday's address to highlight the individuals personally impacted.",
      "The Trump administration in its first six weeks has also worked to bolster border security with a government-wide immigration crackdown, and illegal border crossings were significantly down during Mr. Trump's first month in office. Still, the administration has faced obstacles in its efforts to conduct what it's billed as the largest deportation operation in American history in the U.S. interior. Top Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have been reassigned in recent weeks amid frustrations that the agency has not carried out sufficient arrests and deportations. ICE's detention capacity has also been stretched thin, with detention centers recently filled at levels above 110%.",
      "While Mr. Trump's approach to immigration has received support in recent\u00a0polling, Americans overwhelmingly say he should prioritize inflation and the economy. At the same time, the president has pursued tariffs that have prompted fears of a trade war among businesses and consumers. On Tuesday, 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico are set to take effect following a month-long delay.",
      "Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress have been pursuing legislation to support Mr. Trump's agenda, facing headwinds with a narrow majority in the House and differing views on the path forward. Last week, the House adopted a budget resolution that paves the way for implementing the president's agenda on border security, defense and energy priorities, while extending the 2017 tax cuts. But it's not yet clear how the budget blueprint will fare in the Senate, where lawmakers have pursued a different approach.",
      "Mr. Trump's return to the White House has also had serious implications on the world stage even in the first six weeks. Last week, a meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy devolved into a feud with Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance, and Zelenskyy was ultimately asked to leave the White House without signing a critical multibillion-dollar rare earth minerals deal. On Monday, the White House said it was pausing military aid to Ukraine.",
      "The contentious meeting came after Mr. Trump had appeared to blame Ukraine for the war Russia started and labeled Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" while declining to say the same of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The U.S. has provided Ukraine with billions in weapons since the Russian invasion three years ago, and a split with Zelenskyy may have major implications for its ability to defend itself.",

      "The Trump administration has paused U.S. military aid to Ukraine, the White House confirmed Monday. It's the latest fallout days after a contentious meeting between President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House erupted into an open dispute in front of TV cameras.",
      "\"The president has been clear that he is focused on peace,\" a White House official told CBS News. \"We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution.\"",
      "The U.S. has been a key supplier of weapons for Ukraine as it continues to fend off Russian troops\u00a0three years after Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion three years ago. But Mr. Trump's return to office has brought a marked shift in U.S. policy toward the conflict, with the president blaming Ukraine for the war Russia started.",
      "Friday's meeting, which was meant to precede the signing of an economic and minerals agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine, devolved into a confrontation.",
      "Mr. Trump told Zelenskyy to reach a ceasefire agreement with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vance accused the Ukrainian president of being \"disrespectful\" after he challenged the vice president's assertion that the war had dragged on because of a lack of diplomacy from Ukraine and the Biden administration. The meeting abruptly ended without signing the rare earth minerals deal, and several White House officials told CBS News that the future of military aid for Ukraine was in doubt.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office in January, $3.85 billion has been available in drawdown authority for weaponry that can be pulled from existing U.S. stockpiles and sent to Ukraine, U.S. officials previously told CBS News. But the Trump administration has not packaged any of that aid for a single shipment since Jan. 21, a diplomatic source told CBS News Monday. Still, there have been shipments of weapons sent to Ukraine since Jan. 20 that were promised by the Biden administration in earlier drawdowns, according to defense officials.",
      "The $3.85 billion is spending authority, not congressionally appropriated funds, which means it's up to the White House to determine whether to release the aid. It is also not considered \"real money,\" meaning it cannot be spent elsewhere.",
      "Separately, the State Department also has about $1.5 billion in foreign military financing for Ukraine that is under a policy review by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. So far, the Trump State Department has only given Egypt and Israel waivers for FMF assistance.",
      "After Friday's meeting, Zelenskyy traveled to London for a summit with European and Canadian leaders, where he stressed the importance of Western security guarantees as part of any agreement that would bring the war to an end. He said in Ukrainian that peace with Russia was \"still very, very far away,\" but he thought that Ukraine-U.S. relations would hold.",
      "Mr. Trump later posted a link to an Associated Press story covering Zelenskyy's comments and wrote, \"This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!\"",
      "\"It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be Peace as long as he has America's backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S. - Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "Mr. Trump's hardened stance on Ukraine has rankled some GOP lawmakers.",
      "Republican Sen. Susan Collins, of Maine, said Monday, \"I do not think we should be pausing our efforts. It's the Ukrainians who are shedding blood. It is Putin who launched an unprovoked and unjustified attack on a free, democratic and sovereign country. And I am not backing off my support for Ukraine.\"",
      "Before the Trump administration's announcement Monday, Sen. Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota who serves on the Armed Services Committee, said of Ukraine, \"I'll simply say that we've got to get back on track again.\"",
      "\"It's critical that we get a minerals agreement put together and that we work on getting a security agreement with Ukraine,\" Rounds told reporters at the Capitol. \"They have been attacked. Russia is in the wrong, but we want to find a pathway to peace, and that means somebody has got to be the intermediary. I don't know if the president wants to be that. We need to give him the opportunity, but Russia is the aggressor, and we have to recognize that.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said last month that he had a \"lengthy and highly productive phone call\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and has also directed Rubio and other members of his national security team to \"immediately\" begin negotiations aimed at ending Russia's war with Ukraine.",
      "But Rubio said in February there was \"a long ways to go\" before peace talks could begin.",
      "Delegations led by Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, shortly after those comments, without Ukrainian officials present. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said after the meeting that Rubio and Lavrov had agreed to appoint \"high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible in a way that is enduring, sustainable, and acceptable to all sides.\"",

      "According to a statement provided to The Associated Press by Parton's publicist, Dean died on Monday and he will be laid to rest in a private ceremony with immediate family attending.",
      "The couple met in 1964, when ran into each other outside the Wishy Washy Laundromat on the first day Parton had moved to Nashville. He swept her off her feet, as\u00a0Parton later described it, and the couple married two years later.",
      "\"I was surprised and delighted that while he talked to me, he looked at my face (a rare thing for me). He seemed to be genuinely interested in finding out who I was and what I was about,\" she said in an interview posted on her website to mark their 50th anniversary.",
      "Dean was a businessman who ran an asphalt-laying company in Nashville until he retired.\u00a0 He remained largely out of the spotlight throughout the years as Parton rose to fame, and they were rarely pictured together in public. In 2011, Parton told Ellen DeGeneres in an interview that he had only come out to see her perform a handful of times because \"he gets nervous.\"",
      "In 2016, Parton said she hadn't expected him to agree to a ceremony to\u00a0renew their wedding vows.",
      "\"Well, he's shy about the public, in fact, I was surprised that he was willing to do this, but he's so proud too that we lasted 50 years,\" she said.",
      "Parton and Dean never had any children together. Asked whether she regretted that, in a 2019 interview with CBS \"Sunday Morning,\" Parton replied, \"No, absolutely not. It wasn't meant to be. And I don't regret it. I never regretted it. I mean, it was a choice. So, you make your choices, you make your sacrifices, and I never looked back. I knew early on that I was gonna walk that road 'til God told me to stop. And I'm still walking it, and He ain't said nothing to me about quittin' yet!\"",

He has been posting on social media about crime in Washington, D.C., using the hashtag #MarchBadness. Martin, whose nomination for the permanent post of U.S. attorney for D.C. is being considered by the Senate, has been attracting attention with his social media posts, as well as some of his actions in his capacity as acting U.S. attorney.",
      "In one on Saturday, Martin wrote, \"Hey, thugs with guns, you hear that? Yup, we comin.'\"",
      "He was likely referring to a memo circulated Monday to his staff, in which Martin said over a dozen agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives would be dispatched to help with an \"amazing opportunity\" to help initiatives to reduce violent crime in the nation's capital.",
      "Martin's new initiative seeks more federal district court prosecutions of Washington, D.C., gun crimes. His memo, obtained by CBS News, said his office is \"kicking off the Make DC Safe Again initiative,\" which echoes the Make America Great Again slogan invoked by Trump.",
      "\"We are following the direction of President Trump and (Attorney) General Bondi in the recent executive orders and memoranda. We will flood the federal district court with cases\u2014to make our city safe,\" the memo said. This has been attempted before.

      "The U.S. Attorney's Office for D.C. and the Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives D.C. field office declined requests for comment.",
      "While he waits for his confirmation vote, Martin has continued to court controversy with provocative social posts.",
      "In a social media post Saturday, Martin wrote that his predecessor was a \"Biden prosecutor\" who \"upped political prosecutions, he steered resources to a now-debunked legal theory that targeted American citizens, and gun prosecutions went down. Literally. Let me be clear: he used our $ to chase political hoaxes while the people of DC were terrorized by thugs with guns.\"",
      "The U.S. attorney for the D.C. has a unique ability to handle federal crimes in the nation's capital, including those involving federal officials and facilities. As U.S. attorney for D.C., Martin days ago demoted a group of top senior prosecutors in the office to entry level positions, including those who helped with the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection prosecutions. Now, at least some are being assigned to handle misdemeanor cases",
      "His demotions have caused internal dissension, according to multiple sources who spoke with CBS News.",
      "Martin has filed a series of court motions to help promptly close out many of the pending Capitol riot prosecutions. Before his appointment, Martin served as a defense attorney for Capitol riot defendants and was an active member of the \"Stop the Steal\" movement, which promoted baseless claims of election fraud in 2020.",
      "Last month, Martin instructed his staff to respond to surveys, seeking information about \"five things\" they'd accomplished that week, from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Martin also instructed staff to respond to the second survey that was emailed over the weekend.",
      "Martin is also under new scrutiny by congressional Democrats after writing a social media post last month in which he referred to U.S. attorneys as \"Trump's lawyers,\" who are \"vigilant in standing against entities like the [Associated Press] that refuse to put America first.\"",
      "But U.S. attorneys are not the president's lawyers. Their mission is to ensure that federal laws are enforced. In their districts, they're also involved in civil litigations where the U.S. is a party.",
      "Martin also posted a note to the law firm Covington & Burling and former special counsel Jack Smith to \"save your receipts\" and promised, \"We'll be in touch soon.\" The message included a link to a story noting the firm was defending Smith pro bono. Smith indicted President Trump in two separate cases.",
      "House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer praised Martin in a statement, saying, \"By nominating Ed Martin to be the next U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, President Donald Trump wasted no time delivering on his promise to restore law and order in our capital city.\"",
      "But Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat who is the ranking member on the committee, has launched an investigation into Martin's initiatives and actions as acting U.S. attorney. He wrote a letter to Martin questioning his public statements which, he said, \"are directed exclusively at opponents of and express support for the Trump Administration, explicitly criticize the Biden Administration, publicize pending investigative activity by your office, and make assertions of fact for which there exists no evidence.\"",
      "Martin's statements \"raise serious concerns that your new initiative is a pretext for misusing your office for political ends, threatening and intimidating critics of the Administration, and chilling constitutionally protected speech,\" Connolly added.",
      "A spokesperson for Martin declined to comment.",
      "The House Oversight Committee Democrats' inquiry ordered Martin to submit responses by March 11 about how the office would seek to protect the safety of Capitol police officers and federal prosecutors who were part of the Jan. 6 prosecutions. The inquiry also asks Martin to \"confirm your belief that the Department of Justice represents the United States of America and its citizens, and not the personal and individual political or business interests of the President.\"",

      "The Senate voted Monday to confirm former wrestling executive Linda McMahon as the nation's education chief, a role that places her atop a department that President Trump has vilified and vowed to dismantle.",
      "McMahon will face the competing tasks of winding down the Education Department while also escalating efforts to achieve Mr. Trump's agenda. Already the Republican president has signed sweeping orders to rid America's schools of diversity programs and accommodations for transgender students while also calling for expanded school choice programs.",
      "At the same time, Mr. Trump has promised to shut down the department and said he wants McMahon \"to put herself out of a job.\"",
      "The Senate voted 51-45 to confirm McMahon.",
      "A billionaire and former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, McMahon, 76, is an unconventional pick for the role. She spent a year on Connecticut's state board of education and is a longtime trustee at Sacred Heart University but otherwise has little traditional education leadership.",
      "McMahon's supporters see her as a skilled executive who will reform a department that Republicans say has failed to improve American education. Opponents say she's unqualified and fear her budget cuts will be felt by students nationwide.",
      "\"Americans believe in public education,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said before the confirmation vote. \"They don't want to see the Department of Education abolished. If the Trump administration follows through on cuts to education, schools will lose billions in funding.\"",

      "She acknowledged that only Congress has the power to close the department, and she pledged to preserve Title I money for low-income schools, Pell grants for low-income college students, and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Yet she suggested some operations could move to other departments, saying Health and Human Services might be better suited to enforce disability rights laws.",
      "Weeks before McMahon's confirmation hearing, the White House was considering an executive order that would direct the education secretary to cut the agency as much as legally possible while asking Congress to shut it down completely. Some of McMahon's allies pressed the White House to hold the order until after her confirmation to avoid potential backlash.",
      "Created by Congress in 1979, the Education Department's primary role is to disburse money to the nation's schools and colleges. It sends billions of dollars a year to K-12 schools and oversees a $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio.",
      "Mr. Trump argues the department has been overtaken by liberals who press their ideology on America's schools.",
      "Schools and colleges have been navigating a demand to eliminate diversity programs or risk having their federal funding pulled. The Trump administration gave them a Feb. 28 deadline to comply. The Education Department addressed questions about its guidance in a document released Saturday, saying in part that changing program names that reference \"diversity\" or \"equity\" alone is not enough if they treat students differently by race.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump vowed to close the department and grant its authority to states. Schools and states already wield significantly greater authority over education than the federal government, which is barred from influencing curriculum. Federal money makes up roughly 14% of public school budgets.",

      "\"It's been happening all morning. Let me know if you see anything. No one else has seen anything except for on the TCAS,\" one air traffic controller can be heard telling an inbound flight. Based on CBS News' review of the ATC audio, at least 12 flight crews reported receiving apparent false TCAS alerts \u2014 leading three flights to perform go-arounds between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. ET on Saturday.",
      "CBS News heard no issues in the 8 a.m. hour. Then, six incidents occurred within 11 minutes of each other after 9 a.m. Saturday.",
      "The pilots of American Eagle flight 4469, operated by Republic Airways, were coming into land from Pittsburgh when they received an alert. The flight was descending between 1200 and 1000 feet when TCAS instructed the pilots to take evasive maneuvers to avoid another object.",
      "\"We had to dive a little bit,\" one of the pilots told air traffic controllers.",
      "Controllers asked the pilots after safely landing, \"did you actually visibly see anything other than what the TCAS was showing?\"",
      "\"Negative, it would just say an unknown target descending rapidly,\" the pilots responded.",
      "\"Alright, that's the same sort of reports we've been getting. It seemed like it had stopped but it sounds like it's starting again,\" a controller replied.",

      "The TCAS is a piece of technology installed on individual planes, not a ground-based or centrally located system. It works by using an aircraft's transponder to detect and communicate with nearby aircraft. After receiving the position and altitude of the nearby aircraft, the system calculates if there's a potential for collision. If it finds there's a potential, it will instruct the pilots via audible alerts and displayed instructions to watch for traffic, climb or descend to avoid a mid-air collision.",
      "\"Yeah, we got a little something there,\" the pilots of American Eagle flight 4538, also operated by Republic, from New York City's John F.

      "The image released Monday shows the XB-1 aircraft, which Boom Supersonic said is the \"first civil supersonic jet made in America,\" during its second supersonic flight on Feb. 10. The company said it partnered with NASA using a technique known as Schlieren photography to visualize what can't be seen with the naked eye.",
      "\"This image makes the invisible visible,\" Boom Supersonic founder and CEO Blake Scholl said in a news release.",
      "Chief test pilot Tristan \"Geppetto\" Brandenburg had to make sure XB-1 was in the right place at the right time to allow NASA's team on the ground to photograph it in-flight as it eclipsed the sun, the Colorado-based company said. Crews used telescopes with special filters that can detect air distortions like shock waves to capture the image.",
      "The photo was taken during the XB-1's 13th overall test flight, according to the company, but it was the second time it flew at supersonic speed, this time reaching Mach 1.18, or 772 mph, Boom Supersonic said.",
      "Scholl said that the XB-1 didn't make an audible sonic boom that typically occurs when an aircraft is flying faster than the speed of sound. The captured data suggests that, at certain speed and atmospheric conditions, the sonic boom refracts in the atmosphere and never reaches the ground. The finding may lead the way for supersonic commercial flights without sonic booms, the company said in its news release.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:57:59 -0500",
    "summary": "A spike in cryptocurrency prices Monday morning after President Donald Trump's surprise Sunday announcement quickly fizzled by Monday afternoon.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said on social media Sunday that his administration is working toward creating a \"crypto strategic reserve\" that will include bitcoin and ethereum, along with lesser-known cryptocurrencies XRP, solana, and cardano. He later followed up with another post saying his planned reserve would also include bitcoin and ether, the two most popular cryptocurrencies.",
      "The announcement helped crypto prices rebound after recent sell-offs, but only for a few hours. After rising to $90,000 Monday morning, bitcoin fell to roughly $87,000, or 7.3%, by Monday afternoon. Ethereum tumbled 14.6% to $2,153. Massive price spikes in XRP, solana and cardano also fizzled, dropping 12.1%, 13% and 12.3%, respectively.",
      "Nic Puckrin, financial analyst, investor and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, said in a note that the cause of the temporary price boost was most likely a \"combination of 'hopium' with a classic short squeeze,\" adding that more concrete information on the crypto reserve plan is needed to reassure investors of its worth.",
      "\"While the crypto reserve announcement was a bullish catalyst for crypto prices in the short term, its long-term impact remains questionable. For one thing, no actual details have been disclosed yet,\" Puckrin said.",
      "That said, the creation of digital currency reserve is a milestone moment for bitcoin and blockchain technology.",
      "\"The launch of a U.S. crypto strategic reserve marks a pivotal moment for digital assets, reflecting a major step in the government's engagement with the crypto industry,\" said Federico Brokate, head of the U.S. business at 21Shares, in an analyst note. \"This initiative not only reinforces Bitcoin's role as a maturing store of value but also highlights the importance of blockchain networks like ethereum, solana, XRP and cardano in financial infrastructure, payments and decentralized finance.\"",
      "What is a crypto strategic reserve?",
      "As described in the president's executive order\u00a0from January 23, the crypto strategic reserve would be a national stockpile of digital assets created under a federal regulatory framework developed by the newly established Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets.",
      "The working group will be chaired by high ranking officials, including the White House AI & crypto czar, the secretary of the Treasury and chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, among others.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump pledged support for a \"strategic national bitcoin\" stockpile, which would include bitcoin the U.S. government has previously seized in law enforcement actions. Sunday's announcement was the first time he advocated for the government to hold other types of cryptocurrencies.",
      "How the crypto strategic reserve would be structured and maintained is not yet clear, as the White House did not immediately provide additional details, including how much of each type of cryptocurrency Trump wants the U.S. to hold, and how the government would acquire them.",
      "But more information could be revealed this week, as Trump has also recently announced he will speak at and host industry leaders on Friday at a White House \"Crypto Summit.\"",
      "\"The first White House Crypto Summit on Friday will be crucial to watch,\" said Puckrin. \"We will be waiting to see who will be there, what will be discussed, and whether any actual steps toward implementation are outlined. The key question is, how will they fund and legislate this reserve? Until we have some answers, there's little substance to support this rally, and it could fizzle out as quickly as it started.\"",
      "What's the point of a strategic crypto reserve?",
      "Similar to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which protects the U.S. economy from disruptions in oil supplies, a national crypto reserve would help diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risks, according advocates of the plan.",
      "Critics, however, say the volatility of cryptocurrencies makes them a poor choice as a reserve asset.",
      "Potential hurdles",
      "Creating a crypto strategic reserve is likely to require an act from Congress, just as with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was created in December 1975 when then President Gerald Ford signed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.",
      "Also, the inclusion of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin is likely to face sustained pushback among some corners of the heavily divided cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin is the oldest and by far most popular cryptocurrency, and accounts for more than half of the world's global crypto market cap.",
      "The president has cast himself as hero to the crypto industry, which he said in his announcement had been the target of \"years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration.\" The crypto industry felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win election.",
      "The first several weeks of his administration have seen several moves to boost crypto, including ending or pausing high-profile enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Crypto prices soared after Trump's victory last year, and when the price of bitcoin first crossed $100,000 in early December, Trump took credit and posted \"YOU'RE WELCOME!!!\" on social media.",
      "But prices have fallen since Trump's inauguration and Trump has faced criticism, including from allies within the crypto industry, for helping launch a personal meme coin just before he took office that has since collapsed in value.",
      "The crash of meme coins linked to First Lady Melania Trump and Argentine President Javier Milei, along with a massive hack of a major cryptocurrency exchange that the FBI has said was undertaken by North Korea, have also dimmed enthusiasm for crypto.",

    "summary": "Here's how new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China could impact car prices for consumers, according to a new analysis.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's tariffs on three key U.S. trade partners, which are set to go into effect\u00a0Tuesday, could drive up automobile costs for U.S. consumers by thousands of dollars and put a dent in U.S. car sales, industry analysts and U.S.-based automakers say.",
      "The 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers.",
      "The price hikes from Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to be substantial enough that some car buyers might balk at the higher costs, according to AEG CEO Patrick Anderson.",
      "\"Our analysis shows the proposed tariffs would have a very big effect on North American assembled cars by multiple automakers,\" Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them.\"",
      "Some product lines and equipment combination could become uneconomical for automakers to continue producing, he noted. \"It would be a huge disruption to the industry,\" Anderson said.",
      "Which vehicles could see the greatest price increases?",
      "The range of added costs on vehicles could run from $4,000 to $10,000, with the cost of producing some electric vehicles that rely heavily on components from China rising by as much as $12,200, according to AEG's analysis.",
      "Here are the projected impacts of the tariffs on some types of popular vehicles, according to the study:",
      "Battery-powered electric crossover vehicles: +$12,200Full-size SUV: $9,000Pickup truck: $8,000Small car: $6,200",
      "Battery-powered electric crossover vehicles: +$12,200",
      "Full-size SUV: $9,000",
      "Pickup truck: $8,000",
      "Small car: $6,200",
      "Tariff-driven cost increases may lead to a \"potential loss of sales\" for domestic automakers, given that consumers might turn to the used car market, or seek out automobiles assembled in Japan, for example, for cheaper alternatives, Anderson added.",
      "\"Or, they could decide simply not to buy one at all,\" he said.",
      "Automobile supply chains are complex because they involve numerous parts, some of which can cross borders more than once over the course of the assembly process. With tariffs added to the equation, costs could quickly escalate for automakers.",
      "\"The automobile sector, in particular, is likely to see considerable negative consequences, not only because of the disruption of the supply chains that crisscross the three countries in the manufacturing process, but also because of the expected increase in the price of vehicles, which can dampen demand,\" Cornell University professor of government and public policy Gustavo Flores-Macias said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Dan Hearsch, Americas leader of the automotive & industrial practice at AlixPartners, a global consulting firm, said the tariffs will present at least a momentary advantage for manufacturers that assemble vehicles in Japan, Korea or Europe, for example.",
      "\"For automakers that don't import from Canada or Mexico, they'll end up with a little bit of an advantage, because they won't be hit with this brand-new tariff,\" he said. \"So for some period of time, vehicles coming in that aren't subject to additional tariffs will have a big advantage over domestic companies, or those that are producing in Canada, Mexico or the U.S.\"",
      "He added, \"It's basically penalizing companies relative to those that are importing vehicles from other places, for now.\"",
      "Ford CEO says tariffs would have \"huge impact\"",
      "In an earnings call with analysts on last month, Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley said a prolonged period of higher tariffs would wipe out the company's profits, drive up vehicle prices and slow economic growth.",
      "\"There is no question that tariffs at 25% level from Canada and Mexico, if they're protracted, would have a huge impact on our industry with billions of dollars of industry profits wiped out and adverse effect on the U.S. jobs as well as the entire value system in our industry,\" Farley said. \"Tariffs would also mean higher prices for customers.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, by contrast, insisted in a\u00a0post on social media that such tariffs would be a \"win\" for American industry by driving \"massive amounts of auto manufacturing\" to Michigan, for one.",

      "Stocks fell sharply on Monday after President Trump said he has decided to move forward\u00a0with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, with Wall Street concerned that the import duties could threaten U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "The broad-based S&P 500 index tumbled 105 points, or 1.8%, to 5,850, marking its biggest one-day decline so far this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index shed 2.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5%.",
      "Additionally, new data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is forecasting an economic contraction in the first quarter, with gross domestic product projected to\u00a0decline an annualized 2.8% in the current quarter \u2014 a reversal from growth of almost 3% that was forecast as recently as early February.",
      "Economists are sounding alarms about growing economic uncertainty caused by Mr. Trump's tariffs, which could push up prices in the U.S. and undermine the president's pledge to eliminate the inflation that ate into consumers' purchasing power during the Biden administration. At the same time, recent economic data is showing some cracks in the financial health of U.S. households, with consumer confidence dropping in February to its lowest in four years.",
      "\"We expect that inflation in the U.S. will be stoked by between 1.1% and 1.4% from tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with another 0.7% coming from those slapped on China,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, in an email. \"The economic implications are vast: the price of everyday goods will rise, corporate profits will feel the squeeze and consumers will ultimately foot the bill.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Americans say their outlook for the next year is mixed, with more people likely to say the economy is getting worse than better, according to CBS News polling. Consumers say they believe the economy and inflation should be Mr. Trump's top issues, but most say they see the president prioritizing other issues, such as downsizing the federal workforce, another CBS News poll found.",

The tax increases might have raised prices on those items, but they had little or no impact on overall inflation, which remained modest. Nor did they do much to restore factory jobs.",
      "Economists agree that a second Trump trade war could be far costlier than the first.",
      "\"That was then. This is now,'' said trade analyst William Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, his trade team carefully focused its tariff hit list to avoid or at least delay the impact on consumers. They targeted industrial products and not those \"that would show up on Walmart's shelves,\" said Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official. \"That tamped down the impact.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's latest round of tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession, said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco.",
      "Because U.S. businesses must bear the added costs from tariffs, they largely pass on the costs to American consumers. That, in turn, could weigh on consumer spending at a time when households are still grappling with the fallout from post-pandemic inflation.",
      "The Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through widespread job cuts, could have a ripple effect, curtailing spending by U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

      "At least 17\u00a0wildfires were actively burning Monday in North and South Carolina, where blazes that erupted over the weekend forced evacuations and a state of emergency. The largest of them, in the Carolina Forest area near Myrtle Beach, spread over 1,600 acres in just a couple of days and remained largely uncontained as of officials' latest updates.",
      "Efforts were underway to contain the fires across both Carolinas. Here are maps illustrating the current situation.",
      "Maps of Carolina fires",
      "Officials listed more than 200 wildfires in North Carolina early Monday, covering almost 2,100 acres of land, according to the North Carolina Forest Service. That figure accounted for both reported fires and confirmed ones, and the latter group included active blazes along with others considered contained or controlled. A contained wildfire is one that still burns but is no longer spreading, while a controlled fire has been extinguished.",
      "The forest service was continuously updating an interactive map to chart the locations and basic characteristics of each fire, marking active incidents in red and reported incidents in green. Contained and controlled fires were marked brown and gray, respectively.",
      "A wildfire in southwestern North Carolina was the largest in the state, having spread more than 400 acres in Polk County near the South Carolina border, according to the forest service. Fire officials had contained 30% of the blaze as of Monday \u2014 a significant jump from zero containment reported a day earlier.",
      "Another 112 wildfires were registered Monday by the South Carolina Forestry Commission, which also released a map to show where blazes have started around the state. Like their northern neighbor, fire officials included reported, active, contained and controlled fires in the list. At least six wildfires were actively burning, although there were at least three other active blazes reported and not yet confirmed.",
      "Where are the fires in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina?",
      "A massive blaze engulfed at least 1,600 acres in Horry County, South Carolina, stemming from a forest fire that first erupted Saturday when brush lit up in flames as a dry spell coincided with unusually warm temperatures. Residents of several neighborhoods in the Carolina Forest, about 10 miles west of the oceanside resort city Myrtle Beach, were ordered to evacuate after the fire broke out.",
      "South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency.",
      "Firefighters were able to contain 30% of the blaze by Sunday afternoon, after planes and a Black Hawk helicopter were seen dumping water onto the fire earlier in the morning. Ground crews were also seen using tractors to dig lines around the wildfire's perimeter.",
      "Horry County officials permitted evacuees to return to their homes on Sunday, but the county's fire rescue service warned that any residents previously ordered to leave the area should remain cautious of potential weather changes to come, and urged them to \"watch for possible rekindling of hot spots.\"",

    "story": [
      "Measles is still making headlines in 2025, prompting questions about the life-threatening disease and how to prevent it.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Measles outbreak",
      "The largest measles outbreak so far this year has been in West Texas, where more than 140 people have been infected since late January.\u00a0State and local health officials say the Texas outbreak is primarily affecting children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were\u00a0unvaccinated.",
      "In late February, a child died of measles after being hospitalized in that outbreak. State and local health officials said the patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child, but did not release their name or other details.",
      "Measles cases have also been reported in a number of other states, including across the state line New Mexico, and in\u00a0New Jersey, Georgia, California, Rhode Island, Kentucky and Alaska.",
      "How deadly is measles?",
      "Without vaccination, measles\u00a0can be dangerous or even deadly. While most people's symptoms improve, 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who catch measles will be hospitalized, 1 out of every 1,000 will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to\u00a03 of every 1,000 will die.",
      "The measles virus is airborne and extremely contagious. Before the first measles vaccine became available in the 1960s, almost everyone would catch it at some point during childhood, and between 400 and 500 Americans \u2014 mostly children \u2014\u00a0died every year from measles.",
      "Measles symptoms",
      "Symptoms typically begin about seven to 14 days after a person is exposed to the measles virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that the initial symptoms may appear similar to those of many other common viral illnesses, including:",
      "FeverCoughRunny noseRed eyes",
      "Fever",
      "Cough",
      "Runny nose",
      "Red eyes",
      "Another characteristic sign is a rash that begins to develop a few days later. A patient's fever may spike to 104 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, the CDC says.",
      "In some cases, serious complications can develop, including pneumonia or encephalitis, a swelling of the brain. Encephalitis may lead to convulsions and can cause deafness or leave a child with a lifelong intellectual disability, health officials warn.",
      "As many as 1 out of every 20 children with measles will develop pneumonia, which the CDC says is the most common cause of death from measles in young children.",
      "\"The predominant issues that we talk about, and that have led patients to be admitted to the hospital, are those respiratory issues, and so that is a frequent cause of death,\" Dr. Lara Johnson, the chief medical officer at Covenant Children's Hospital in Lubbock, Texas, said at a news conference on Feb. 26. At the time, she said, the hospital had seen about 20 patients admitted with confirmed measles cases, including several who needed intensive care.",
      "\"There are also neurological issues that can happen acutely \u2014 encephalitis, swelling of the brain, blindness, other issues along that line that can also be a part of acute measles,\" Johnson said.",
      "She added, \"There are lots of childhood rashes and fevers, and as parents, we all know that our kids get these here and there. This is not that. This is a much more serious illness that has much greater risk of serious complications.\"",
      "Measles rash",
      "Several days after the first symptoms begin, characteristic tiny white spots develop inside the mouth, and a facial rash spreads to the rest of the body.",
      "On \"CBS Mornings,\"\u00a0Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, described the rash as a \"flat, blotchy red rash.\"",
      "Why is there a measles outbreak?",
      "With\u00a0safe, effective vaccines\u00a0available, experts are pointing to lower vaccination rates as a reason why we're seeing these increasing cases. Health officials confirmed that nearly all of the patients in the Texas outbreak were unvaccinated.",
      "\"It is troubling, because this was completely preventable,\" Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins, recently\u00a0told CBS News. \"What we're seeing is, one of the places in Texas \u2014 it has the lowest vaccination rates, the highest school exemption rates from measles vaccination \u2014 having a measles outbreak, including hospitalizations of individuals who've been infected with measles.\"",
      "Measles vaccine",
      "While measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, doctors and public health officials say the vaccine is safe and highly effective. It is normally given in two doses as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, which has been used for decades.",
      "But nationwide, at least 10 states have seen childhood vaccination rates\u00a0decline, jeopardizing communities'\u00a0herd immunity\u00a0from widespread outbreaks.",
      "Like Texas, some Florida schools \u2014 such as an elementary school in Broward County last year \u2014 have\u00a0seen measles outbreaks. The vaccination rate for Florida kindergartners has fallen to 88.1%, according to the CDC, the lowest in decades.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a history as a\u00a0vaccine skeptic, voiced support for the measles vaccine in early March.",
      "Kennedy said he was \"deeply concerned about the recent measles outbreak\" in an opinion piece published by Fox News.",
      "\"Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons,\" he wrote.",
      "When do you get the measles vaccine?",
      "The\u00a0American Academy of Pediatrics\u00a0recommends children get vaccinated with two doses of the MMR vaccine, with their first dose between the ages of 12 to 15 months.",
      "\"That's after the antibodies you get from your mom, through the placenta and through breast milk, have faded away, so that the vaccine will actually work \u2014 so there's a logic to when we vaccinate,\" Gounder explained.",
      "Then the second dose is recommended at about 4 to 6 years of age.",
      "One dose is 93% effective against measles and the recommended two doses is 97% effective,\u00a0research shows. The vaccine also protects against\u00a0mumps and\u00a0rubella, also known as German measles, which are caused by different viruses.",
      "Studies have also shown\u00a0that the MMR vaccine, which was first introduced in 1971, may be given safely and effectively in combination with other vaccines.",
      "But according to recent\u00a0KFF polling, about 17% of parents say they have skipped or delayed a vaccine dose for their children.",
      "\"This is up from about 10% just two years ago. So we're really seeing a lot of exemptions [and] concerns about vaccination that are not warranted,\" Gounder said.",
      "How long does the measles vaccine last?",
      "For most people, the MMR vaccine will protect you for life, Gounder said.",
      "\"If somebody is fully vaccinated against measles and has a normal immune system, they don't need to worry about measles,\" said Adalja. \"You're not going to be at risk for contracting measles because the vaccine is very, very effective.\"",
      "Who should get a measles booster?",
      "While most people have protection that lasts for life after getting vaccinated in early childhood, people born after 1957 but vaccinated before 1968 should consider a booster shot, Gounder said.",
      "\"That group is unlikely to have robust immunity from infection, because at that point in time, they were using less effective vaccines,\" she said.",
      "There are also other people who could potentially benefit from getting a booster, she added, including those working in health care, overseas or in places where there is an active measles outbreak.",
      "If you're unsure if or when you were vaccinated against the measles, start by tracking down your vaccination records if possible, Gounder advised. But, if you can't find those records, there is \"no harm in getting an extra dose,\" she said, adding that no blood test confirmation is needed.",
      "\"That's actually what we would advise to do, as opposed to getting a blood test to see if there are antibodies \u2014 just get a booster if you're in doubt,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced Monday that a leading Taiwanese semiconductor chip company plans to invest $100 billion in new manufacturing plants in the U.S.",
      "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, is one of the world's largest manufacturers of semiconductor chips, and plans to make the major investment over the next several years. Mr. Trump made the announcement in the White House Roosevelt Room alongside the company's CEO, C.C. Wei.",
      "\"Today, Taiwan Semiconductor is announcing that they will be investing at least $100 billion in new capital in the United States over the next short period of time to build state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facilities,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think mostly it's going to be in Arizona which is what I understand, which is a great state. I like it because I won it.\"",
      "The president called TSMC the \"most powerful company in the world,\" and said the economic development announcement is a \"matter of economic security\" and a \"matter of national security for us.\"",
      "The Wall Street Journal was first to report the investment pledge. TSMC was promised $6.6 billion in funding under the Biden-era CHIPS and SCIENCE Act of 2022, and announced plans for its first U.S. plant in Arizona.",
      "The anticipated announcement comes amid Mr. Trump's threats to impose tariffs on semiconductor chip imports, which TSMC could avoid by manufacturing the chips in the U.S. The president has also floated expedited permits for companies that invest at least $1 billion in the U.S. Mr. Trump noted Monday that if Wei's company made the chips in Taiwan and exported them to the U.S., they'd face 25% tariffs.",
      "Speaking at the White House, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick credited the tariffs with the TSMC announcement.",
      "\"Under the Biden administration, TSMC received a $6 billion grant, and that encouraged them to build $65 billion. So America gave TSMC 10% of the money to build here. And now you're seeing the power of Donald Trump's presidency,\" Lutnick said. \"TSMC, the greatest manufacturer of chips in the world, is coming to America with a hundred-billion-dollar investment, and of course that is backed by the fact that they can come here because they can avoid paying tariffs.\"",
      "Semiconductor chips are small but critical components for today's technology, with small pieces of silicone that contain electronic circuits. Semiconductor chips are found in everything from iPhones to cars, and demand has boomed in recent years thanks to the explosion in artificial intelligence, which requires an enormous amount of computing power.",
      "\"Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"And really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy, powering everything from AI to automobiles to advanced manufacturing.\"",
      "The vast majority of semiconductor chips are manufactured in Asian countries, with Taiwan at the top, and the Trump administration is hoping to draw more manufacturing to the U.S. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have viewed increasing U.S. chip manufacturing a matter of national security.",
      "\"We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in American factories with American skill and American labor,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And that's exactly what we're doing. As you know, Taiwan pretty much has a monopoly on that market.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Two top Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have launched an investigation into the Justice Department for seeking to dismiss charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "In a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi on Sunday, Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Jasmine Crockett of Texas accused the Justice Department of attempting to cover up an alleged quid pro quo to drop the corruption charges against Adams if he assisted the Trump administration in carrying out its immigration policies.",
      "\"Last month, troubling reports emerged about the Trump Administration's demand that federal prosecutors move to dismiss the serious public corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams as part of a blatant and illegal quid pro quo to secure the Mayor's loyal assistance in executing the Trump Administration's mass arrest and deportation policies,\" the letter said.",
      "\"Not only did the Department of Justice (DOJ) attempt to pressure career prosecutors into carrying out this illegal quid pro quo, it appears that Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove was personally engaged in a cover-up by destroying evidence and retaliating against career prosecutors who refused to follow his illegal and unethical orders,\" it continued. \"We write to demand that you immediately put an end to the cover-up and retaliation and provide documents and information about these disturbing accounts to Congress.\"",
      "Adams, a Democrat, was indicted on five counts in September, including bribery, conspiracy and campaign finance violations. He was accused of accepting illegal campaign donations, flight upgrades and other travel benefits from a Turkish official and other foreign nationals in exchange for political favors. He pleaded not guilty to all of the charges.",
      "In February, Bove instructed federal prosecutors in New York to drop the corruption case, citing Adams' \"restricted\" ability to help the Trump administration enforce its immigration policies.",
      "The move to drop the charges prompted the resignation of Manhattan's top career federal prosecutor, Danielle Sassoon, who said the request raised \"serious concerns that render the contemplated dismissal inconsistent with my ability and duty to prosecute federal crimes without fear or favor and to advance good-faith arguments before the courts.\"",
      "\"It is a breathtaking and dangerous precedent to reward Adams's opportunistic and shifting commitments on immigration and other policy matters with dismissal of a criminal indictment. Nor will a court likely find that such an improper exchange is consistent with the public interest,\" Sassoon wrote.",
      "The charges have yet to be formally dropped.",
      "In their letter to the Justice Department, Raskin and Crockett said the department \"has strayed far from its principles of equal justice under the law by dismissing a serious criminal public corruption matter in exchange for assistance with the White House's immigration priorities.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, this is yet another example of the Trump DOJ allowing criminals to go free \u2014 whether they assaulted police officers, sold drugs to the community, or are corrupt politicians \u2014 as long as the criminals pledge loyalty to President Trump,\" they wrote.",
      "The lawmakers have requested that the Justice Department turn over notes related to a Jan. 31 meeting between federal prosecutors and Adams' lawyers, and asked whether any of the documents have been destroyed. They also requested the White House and Justice Department communications related to the investigation into Adams. They gave Bondi a March 17 deadline.",

      "Hackman and Arakawa tested negative for carbon monoxide poisoning, he said. The sheriff's office also said there were no signs of blunt force trauma when their bodies were found.",
      "How long had Hackman and Arakawa been dead?",
      "Hackman's pacemaker recorded its last event on Feb. 17, which was nine days before the bodies were found, Mendoza said Friday. The sheriff said it's possible that was Hackman's last day of life.",
      "A search warrant issued the day Arakawa and Hackman's bodies were found says they showed signs of decomposition, bloating in the face and mummification of hands and feet.\u00a0Mummification preserves a body after death and can happen naturally when the skin dries out, according to the National Library of Medicine.",
      "Where were Hackman and Arakawa found?",
      "Hackman and Arakawa were found dead in their home outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico, according to deputies who responded to the house at about 1:45 p.m. local time on Feb. 26.",
      "Hackman was found in what is believed to be the home's mudroom. It appeared he had fallen suddenly, the search warrant says. He was found wearing sweatpants, a long-sleeve T-shirt and slippers.",
      "Arakawa was found in a bathroom near the front door of the home, according to the warrant. The door to the bathroom was opened.",
      "Arakawa was on the ground, wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt. An opened orange prescription bottle and scattered pills were seen on a countertop near Arakawa, the warrant says. A space heater was also seen near Arakawa's head.",
      "Hackman and Arakawa's dog also found dead",
      "A German Shepherd was found dead in a closet of the bathroom where Arakawa's body was discovered, the warrant says. Mendoza said the dog was in a kennel or crate.",
      "The dog's cause of death also remains undetermined.",
      "There were two dogs found alive on the property when deputies arrived, the warrant says.",
      "No immediate signs of foul play",
      "Deputies found the door to Hackman and Arakawa's home \"unsecured and opened,\" the warrant says. They were initially called to the home after someone who arrived to do maintenance did not receive an answer and became concerned, the sheriff's office said.",
      "There were no signs of forced entry or that the house had been rummaged through, deputies said.",
      "No signs of a carbon monoxide leak",
      "There were no obvious signs of a gas leak at the home, deputies said. The Santa Fe City Fire personnel and the New Mexico Gas Company tested the scene for carbon monoxide and other foreign elements and did not find any, the sheriff's office said.",
      "Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that kills hundreds of people each year.",
      "What movies was Gene Hackman in?",
      "Hackman's career spanned multiple decades in which he starred in dozens of films.",
      "Some of his notable roles included Detective \"Popeye\" Doyle in \"The French Connection\" (1971), a surveillance expert who suspects a murder in \"The Conversation\" (1974) and a sheriff in Clint Eastwood's \"Unforgiven\" (1992).",
      "He won Academy Awards for best actor in a leading role in 1972 for his performance in \"The French Connection\" and best actor in a supporting role in 1993 for his role in \"Unforgiven.\"",

      "When she was 11, she performed at the Honolulu International Center Concert Hall and later in life, she played with the Honolulu Symphony Orchestra, the AP reported.",
      "Arakawa and Hackman met while she was working part-time at a California fitness center in the 1980s, according to a New York Times article.",
      "Arakawa helped found Pandora's, a home decor store in Santa Fe, in 2001, the AP reported.",
      "Does Gene Hackman have any children?",

      "In a March 2 letter to Dudek, Warren highlights a LinkedIn post from before his appointment as acting commissioner, in which he wrote that he had \"bullied agency executives\" to help the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, billionaire Elon Musk's cost-cutting effort. Dudek added that he shared executive contact information and \"moved contractor money around\" to add resources to his anti-fraud team, according to Warren's letter.",

Since being appointed as acting commissioner, Dudek has announced a significant restructuring of the agency, including cutting 7,000 jobs, or about 12% of its workforce, which current employees say could hamper\u00a0its mission to provide retirement and disability benefits to almost 70 million Americans.",
      "\"The circumstances of your appointment raise questions about the truthfulness of President Trump's assertion that 'Social Security will not be touched [by DOGE],'\" Warren wrote in the letter. DOGE has \"launched an attack on the agency, closing at least 10 local offices,\u00a0firing scores of personnel and gaining access to SSA internal systems.\"",
      "Warren added that SSA leaders \"were reportedly so concerned about your behavior that they placed you on administrative leave pending an investigation into your efforts on DOGE's behalf.\"",

    "story": [
      "Mexican authorities were investigating the killing of a local reporter Monday in the central state of Guanajuato, the country's homicide leader.",
      "The state prosecutor's office identified the victim only by his first name, but local media outlets said the victim was Kristian Zavala, who covered local goings on in the city of Silao on his Facebook page. Zavala and another person were killed Sunday, according to the office. According local media, Zavala and his companion were shot dead by unknown individuals aboard a vehicle after midnight",
      "It was at least the\u00a0third killing of a media worker\u00a0so far this year, though it remained unclear if the motive was connected to his work. The U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists and Mexico's chapter of Articulo 19 demanded a thorough investigation.",
      "Violence in Guanajuato is linked to ongoing conflict between the Santa Rosa de Lima gang and the\u00a0Jalisco New Generation cartel, one of the most powerful in the Latin American nation. Last month, the Trump administration formally\u00a0labeled eight cartels\u00a0as terrorist groups, including the Jalisco cartel.",
      "For years, Mexico has been one of the world's most dangerous countries outside a war zone for journalists. A record number of journalists were killed worldwide in 2024, the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a report released last month.",
      "How journalist killings are counted",
      "Sometimes authorities say the victim was a journalist, but usually only if it was someone well known. More commonly, press advocacy organizations share the information.",
      "The information, however, can vary between sources. In many cases, like that of Zavala, the victims cover very local events using social platforms rather than for a traditional newspaper, television or radio station. In those cases, it's also common that the coverage is only one of the person's jobs. They may also drive a taxi or do something else to make ends meet.",
      "The same authorities who are looked to for answers in some cases quickly dismiss a journalist's work as a possible motive or suggest they were involved with unseemly people or business.",
      "The number of journalist killings is down, but does that mean it's safer?",
      "No. Mexico had its deadliest year for journalists in 2022 with 13 killings, according to CPJ and Articulo 19. In 2023 and 2024, that fell to half or fewer, but non-lethal attacks shot up.",
      "In 2023, Articulo 19 recorded 561 such attacks, which includes disappearances as well.",
      "Hyperlocal journalists like Zavala are frequently the most exposed. They cover crime in places where cartels operate with impunity or cover local politics where justice is difficult to access and politicians may consider it easier to simply silence a critical voice.",
      "All but a handful of media workers' killings and abductions remain unsolved.",
      "\"Impunity is the norm in crimes against the press,\" the\u00a0the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a report\u00a0on Mexico last year.",

      "The pope, who is 88 and has a long history of pulmonary trouble, has struggled to get over this illness, leading to the longest hospitalization of his pontificate.",
      "Before spending a restful weekend without any crises, Francis experienced a \"sudden worsening of the respiratory picture\" on Friday, the Vatican said, when he had a single \"isolated crisis of bronchospasm,\" which is when the muscles that line the airways in the lungs tighten.",
      "That episode caused the pope to inhale vomit, the Vatican said in a statement. Francis was treated with noninvasive mechanical ventilation and had a good response, the Vatican said Friday.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has paused U.S. military aid to Ukraine, the White House confirmed Monday. It's the latest fallout days after a contentious meeting between President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House erupted into an open dispute in front of TV cameras.",
      "\"The president has been clear that he is focused on peace,\" a White House official told CBS News. \"We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution.\"",
      "The U.S. has been a key supplier of weapons for Ukraine as it continues to fend off Russian troops\u00a0three years after Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion three years ago. But Mr. Trump's return to office has brought a marked shift in U.S. policy toward the conflict, with the president blaming Ukraine for the war Russia started.",
      "Friday's meeting, which was meant to precede the signing of an economic and minerals agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine, devolved into a confrontation.",
      "Mr. Trump told Zelenskyy to reach a ceasefire agreement with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vance accused the Ukrainian president of being \"disrespectful\" after he challenged the vice president's assertion that the war had dragged on because of a lack of diplomacy from Ukraine and the Biden administration. The meeting abruptly ended without signing the rare earth minerals deal, and several White House officials told CBS News that the future of military aid for Ukraine was in doubt.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office in January, $3.85 billion has been available in drawdown authority for weaponry that can be pulled from existing U.S. stockpiles and sent to Ukraine, U.S. officials previously told CBS News. But the Trump administration has not packaged any of that aid for a single shipment since Jan. 21, a diplomatic source told CBS News Monday. Still, there have been shipments of weapons sent to Ukraine since Jan. 20 that were promised by the Biden administration in earlier drawdowns, according to defense officials.",
      "The $3.85 billion is spending authority, not congressionally appropriated funds, which means it's up to the White House to determine whether to release the aid. It is also not considered \"real money,\" meaning it cannot be spent elsewhere.",
      "Separately, the State Department also has about $1.5 billion in foreign military financing for Ukraine that is under a policy review by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. So far, the Trump State Department has only given Egypt and Israel waivers for FMF assistance.",
      "After Friday's meeting, Zelenskyy traveled to London for a summit with European and Canadian leaders, where he stressed the importance of Western security guarantees as part of any agreement that would bring the war to an end. He said in Ukrainian that peace with Russia was \"still very, very far away,\" but he thought that Ukraine-U.S. relations would hold.",
      "Mr. Trump later posted a link to an Associated Press story covering Zelenskyy's comments and wrote, \"This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!\"",
      "\"It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be Peace as long as he has America's backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S. - Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "Mr. Trump's hardened stance on Ukraine has rankled some GOP lawmakers.",
      "Republican Sen. Susan Collins, of Maine, said Monday, \"I do not think we should be pausing our efforts. It's the Ukrainians who are shedding blood. It is Putin who launched an unprovoked and unjustified attack on a free, democratic and sovereign country. And I am not backing off my support for Ukraine.\"",
      "Before the Trump administration's announcement Monday, Sen. Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota who serves on the Armed Services Committee, said of Ukraine, \"I'll simply say that we've got to get back on track again.\"",
      "\"It's critical that we get a minerals agreement put together and that we work on getting a security agreement with Ukraine,\" Rounds told reporters at the Capitol. \"They have been attacked. Russia is in the wrong, but we want to find a pathway to peace, and that means somebody has got to be the intermediary. I don't know if the president wants to be that. We need to give him the opportunity, but Russia is the aggressor, and we have to recognize that.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said last month that he had a \"lengthy and highly productive phone call\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and has also directed Rubio and other members of his national security team to \"immediately\" begin negotiations aimed at ending Russia's war with Ukraine.",
      "But Rubio said in February there was \"a long ways to go\" before peace talks could begin.",

Ukraine fears Russia would renege on any peace deal that doesn't carry with it the threat that Ukraine's partners would come to its aid in case of a violation.",
      "\"For peace to be real, we need real security guarantees. And this is the position of all of Europe \u2013 the entire continent,\" Zelenskyy said in a social media post Monday, three days after President Trump and Vice President JD Vance accused him of being \"disrespectful\" and failing to offer thanks during a contentious Oval Office meeting with news cameras rolling.",
      "\"Of course, we understand the importance of America, and we are grateful for all the support we've received from the United States,\" Zelenskyy said Monday. \"There has not been a day when we haven't felt gratitude. It's gratitude for the preservation of our independence \u2013 our resilience in Ukraine is based on what our partners are doing for us \u2013 and for their own security. What we need is peace, not endless war. And that's why we say security guarantees are the key to this.\"",
      "The Sunday summit of European leaders organized by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer was already scheduled before the tense meeting in Washington between Zelenskyy and Mr. Trump, but it took on new meaning in the wake of the exchange.",
      "Mr. Trump's attitude toward Ukraine's wartime president compounded existing concerns among European leaders about the current American administration's commitment to ensuring not only Ukraine's independence going forward, but European security in general as the continent faces an increasingly aggressive Russian state run by authoritarian leader Vladimir Putin.",
      "\"This is not a moment for more talk. It's time to act,\" Starmer said after the gathering with his fellow European leaders on Sunday. \"Time to step up and lead and to unite around a new plan for a just and enduring peace.\"",
      "After the summit on Sunday, Zelenskyy gave a briefing in Ukrainian in which he said he believed a peace deal with Russia \"is still very, very far away,\" but that Ukraine's relationship with the U.S. would remain strong.",
      "\"I think our relationship (with the U.S.) will continue, because it's more than an occasional relationship,\" Zelenskyy said, referring to the support the U.S. has provided Ukraine since Russia's invasion. His comments were covered by the Associated Press.",
      "Later on Monday, Mr. Trump posted a link to the AP's story covering Zelenskyy's comments and criticized the Ukrainian leader.",
      "\"This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!\" Mr. Trump said. \"It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be Peace as long as he has America's backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S. - Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?\"",
      "What came out of the London summit?",
      "Starmer said Monday that there were \"a number of options on the table\" for possible peace plans to end the war Russia started, all of which were developed alongside Ukraine, but he said he didn't want to get \"into a running commentary on the options.\"",
      "\"We have to learn from the mistakes of the past,\" Starmer said. \"We cannot accept a weak deal which Russia can breach with ease. Instead, any deal must be backed by strength.\"",
      "Ahead of the summit, French President Emmanuel Macron told local media one possible plan would involve a monthlong ceasefire, but covering only the air, sea and energy infrastructure, not the ongoing and deadly ground fighting.",
      "After the summit, Starmer announced four key points that he said had been agreed to by the European leaders:",
      "To maintain military aid flowing to Ukraine and continue applying economic pressure on RussiaThat Ukraine must be present at any peace talks, and that any lasting peace must guarantee Ukraine's sovereignty and securityTo boost Ukraine's defensive capabilities if a peace deal is agreed to halt the warTo create a \"coalition of the willing\" to help defend any peace deal that is implemented in Ukraine.",
      "To maintain military aid flowing to Ukraine and continue applying economic pressure on Russia",
      "That Ukraine must be present at any peace talks, and that any lasting peace must guarantee Ukraine's sovereignty and security",
      "To boost Ukraine's defensive capabilities if a peace deal is agreed to halt the war",
      "To create a \"coalition of the willing\" to help defend any peace deal that is implemented in Ukraine.",
      "Starmer also announced a new agreement that will enable Ukraine to obtain about $2 billion worth of missiles made in Northern Ireland to continue its war effort.",
      "Ripple effects from White House meeting still being felt",
      "Russia has lauded Mr. Trump in the wake of his clash with Zelenskyy, which came after a week that saw the U.S. leader echo false talking points Moscow has pushed since it launched its full-scale invasion, including the assertion that Ukraine started the war and that Zelenskyy is an illegitimate leader.",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Monday that \"the Kyiv regime and Zelenskyy do not want peace,\" adding that the clash between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy, \"demonstrated how difficult it will be to reach a settlement trajectory around Ukraine.\"",
      "\"It is very important that someone forces Zelenskyy himself to change his position,\" Peskov said. \"Someone has to make Zelenskyy want peace. If the Europeans can do it, they should be honored and praised.\"",
      "In the meantime, Russia has continued hammering Ukraine with deadly airstrikes. More than 80 explosive drones were launched at Ukraine overnight, killing at least eight people, including a 7-year-old child, CBS News' partner network BBC News reported Monday.",
      "Zelenskyy said Sunday that Ukraine was still willing to sign a minerals deal with the Trump administration which would grant the U.S. access to Ukraine's prized natural resources. He had been expected to sign the deal during his visit to Washington last week, but never committed to it in advance as it was unclear whether Ukraine was being offered security guarantees in exchange for its mineral wealth, and he was then asked to leave the White House early following the tense exchange with Mr. Trump.",
      "U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz, speaking Monday on Fox News, said it seemed as though Zelenskyy was \"not ready to talk peace.\" He said, however, that if the Ukrainian leader is seen as changing that stance, showing he \"has regret\" for the way things transpired in Washington, and is ready to sign a deal on Ukraine's minerals, he wouldn't rule out Kyiv and Washington reaching an agreement. He even suggested it could come together in time for Mr. Trump to announce a deal when he delivers a national address on Tuesday night.",
      "\"We'd certainly like to see that happen,\" Waltz said.",
      "Earlier, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it was \"impossible to have an economic deal without a peace deal,\" and he accused Zelenskyy of having \"thrown off the sequencing\" of the deals by trying \"to relitigate in front of the world\" in the Oval Office.",
      "But some European leaders disagreed with that interpretation of events.",
      "\"My assessment is that it wasn't a spontaneous reaction to interventions by Zelenskyy, but apparently an induced escalation in this meeting in the Oval Office,\" Friedrich Merz, who is likely to be Germany's next leader, said Monday. \"We must now show that we are in a position to act independently in Europe.\"",

      "Dutch police say they have cracked the case of the mysterious disappearance of a Brueghel painting from a Polish museum over 50 years ago. Authorities say the case was finally solved with the help of arts magazine journalists and a well-known art detective.",
      "\"Woman Carrying the Embers,\" also known as \"Woman Moving A Bonfire\" and painted by the Flemish-Dutch master Pieter Brueghel the Younger around 1626, vanished from the National Museum in Gdansk during communist times around 1974.",
      "Its whereabouts sparked numerous rumors -- including involvement by the Polish secret service at the time -- in a story worthy of a spy novel.",
      "The round painting, measuring just 6.6 inches, was thought to have disappeared forever.",
      "But the stolen painting is currently under lock and key at a museum in the Dutch province of Limburg, Richard Bronswijk of the Dutch police's arts crime unit said.",
      "\"We are 100% sure that it's the same painting that disappeared from the National Museum in Gdansk back in 1974,\" Bronswijk told AFP.",
      "\"Indiana Jones of the Art World\"",
      "Arthur Brand, a well-known Dutch art detective, said suspicions were first raised when journalists from the leading Dutch arts magazine \"Vind\" spotted the painting at a Dutch exhibition last year.",
      "Billed as \"not being seen for the past 40 years,\" the painting was on loan to the Gouda Museum from a private collection.",
      "\"A magazine contributor, John Brozius, did some research and stumbled upon an article on a Polish website with an old black-and-white picture,\" Brand told AFP.",
      "\"The article was about a theft that took place in Gdansk in 1974 in which two artworks were stolen: 'The Crucifixion', a sketch by Anthony van Dyck, and a Brueghel the Younger painting,\" he said.",
      "\"Although the people from 'Vind' were not sure, it looked pretty similar to the Brueghel on display in Gouda,\" Brand said.",
      "The painting depicts a peasant woman holding tongs with smoldering embers in one hand and a cauldron of water in the other, a reference to an old Dutch proverb: \"Never believe a person who carries water in the one hand and fire in the other\", or beware duplicity.",
      "The painting's value is unknown, but Brueghel the Younger's works generally sell for millions, according to the auction house Christie's.",
      "Brand, nicknamed the \"Indiana Jones of the Art World\" for his high-profile recoveries of stolen pieces, was called in for help.",
      "\"It's a match!\"",
      "Together with Dutch police, Brand investigated the identity of the painting, which in the meantime had been moved to a museum in Venlo, the southern Netherlands.",
      "Brand also scoured Interpol's database, which had put out a \"database alert\" for the Brueghel painting.",
      "\"I concluded that the painting listed by Interpol and the one on display was one and the same,\" he told AFP.",

      "Dutch police have informed Polish authorities, who were expected to submit a request for legal assistance, Bronswijk said.",
      "Neither the Dutch museums nor Polish authorities were immediately available for comment.",
      "The theft was discovered on April 24, 1974, when a museum worker accidentally knocked the Brueghel off a wall.",
      "\"Instead of the original work by the famous Flemish painter, a reproduction cut out of a magazine fell out of the frame,\" stolen Polish arts expert Mariusz Pilus wrote in \"Arts Sherlock\" in 2019.",
      "Days after the discovery, a Polish customs officer who had reported the illegal export of artworks through the Baltic port of Gdynia, is said to have been set alight and killed, shortly before he was to be interviewed by police.",
      "Investigations into the customs officer's death and the paintings' disappearance were shut down shortly afterwards, Polish reports said.",
      "Dutch police are now investigating how the painting eventually ended up in a private Dutch collection.",

    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014 There was shock in the courtroom in western France on Friday as former doctor Joel Le Scouarnec admitted without any solicitation that he had sexually abused his own granddaughter. Le Scouarnec, 74, had been on trial for about a week by Friday, accused of raping or sexually assaulting 299 children, but his granddaughter is not among the alleged victims in the case \u2014 all of whom were his patients at the time.",
      "The former surgeon stood up and addressed the court just after his eldest son, whose name has not been used in the trial, gave evidence.",
      "\"This is possibly, almost certainly, the last time I will see my son, because I heard his anger and his distress,\" Le Scouarnec told the court in the town of Vannes, Brittany. \"I respect that anger, it is well-founded. Yes, I admit to having abused my granddaughter, his daughter.\"",
      "He then turned to his son and said, \"forgive me.\"",
      "The trial was adjourned immediately after he made the statement. Later Friday evening, regional prosecutors confirmed that new charges would be brought against Le Scouarnec in relation to his courtroom confession.",
      "It was the latest in a series of emotional moments at the trial, which opened on February 24.",
      "Le Scouarnec is accused of raping or sexually assaulting 299 people, almost all of whom were children under his treatment at the time of the alleged assaults. By number of purported victims, it's the single largest trial related to alleged child sexual abuse in France and one of the biggest ever in the world. It has shocked France, coming on the heels of another mass rape trial involving a\u00a0man who drugged his wife\u00a0and brought strangers into their home to assault her for years.",
      "The public prosecutor handling Le Scouarnec's case has said the alleged assaults took place over 25 years between 1989 and 2014, in several hospitals in France's western Brittany region, where the doctor worked. The prosecutor said the average age of the victims \u2014 who are both male and female \u2014 was 11 at the time of the alleged abuse.",
      "During the first week's proceedings, members of Le Scouarnec's immediate family testified about what they knew regarding the allegations.",
      "His ex-wife, Marie-France Le Scouarnec, took the stand Wednesday and denied having had any knowledge of her husband's purported actions.",
      "\"There was nothing that could have made me think that. Nothing,\" she told the court. \"I never had an inkling. It's so huge, so unthinkable, inconceivable that my husband could have done all that.\"",
      "The alleged assaults came to light in 2017 after Le Scouarnec's neighbors' then-6-year-old daughter told her parents he had exposed himself and touched her through the fence that separated their yards.",
      "During a search of his home as part of that investigation, police said they discovered hard drives containing more than 300,000 photos and videos of child sex abuse. They also said they found notebooks with meticulous records of the alleged abuse of child patients.",
      "The doctor was convicted in December 2020 of sexually abusing four young girls \u2014 the young neighbor as well as a 4-year-old patient and two of his nieces. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison.",
      "In court on Friday, his eldest son spoke of how his world had fallen apart, and how he turned to alcohol for a while after those initial revelations. He said he and his father had been very close when he was growing up and he had only good memories of his childhood.",
      "Questioned last week about her husband's conviction for abusing his two nieces, Marie-France Le Scouarnec said she had known nothing about that, either. The next day, the former surgeon's sister \u2014 the mother of the two nieces \u2014 took the stand and accused the perpetrator's ex-wife of \"cruelty\" and \"lies\" in her testimony.",
      "The woman, Annie, whose last name was not made public at the trial, claimed Marie-France Le Scouarnec had known that her husband abused his nieces. Annie said the youngest of her two daughters confided in her in October 2000 that Le Scouarnec had sexually abused her. She told the court that her brother admitted the assault to her and said that his wife was aware of what had happened.",
      "The 2017 investigation was not Le Scouarnec's first brush with the law. In 2005, he was convicted of possession of child sexual abuse images after an FBI investigation into an international network. He was given a four-year suspended sentence for those crimes. The court did not order any psychological followup, however, or any restrictions on his work.",
      "During his career, Le Scouarnec worked in several hospitals across the Brittany region. Victims' associations have asked how he could have carried out so many alleged assaults without any alarms being raised.",
      "Investigators have said few of the children had any memory of the alleged assaults. For many of them, it came as a complete shock when police contacted them with evidence of what had allegedly happened, as recounted in the surgeon's journals.",
      "As the trial got underway on February 24, Le Scouarnec told the court he had \"committed heinous acts,\" and his lawyer said he admitted to carrying out \"the vast majority\" of the assaults of which he's been accused.",
      "\"I owe it to all these people and their loved ones to take responsibility for my actions and the consequences they may have had,\" Le Scouarnec told the court.",
      "Outside the courthouse that first day, a small group of protesters brandished placards denouncing \"more than 20 years of silence\" about the surgeon's past.",
      "The trial is expected to last four months. During that time, the 299 alleged victims \u2014 who are now men and women \u2014 will be called on to recount what they can remember of their interactions with Le Scouarnec, who faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.",

The knife attack came just one day after Israel blocked aid to the Gaza Strip amid an impasse with Hamas over how to extend the ceasefire in the decimated Palestinian territory.",
      "The six-week first phase of the truce ended on Saturday. It had enabled the entry of vital food, shelter and medical assistance for the roughly 2 million people living in Gaza and the return of 33 Israeli hostages, both dead and alive. But there was nothing immediately agreed upon to keep the relative peace.",
      "Negotiations for a second phase of the deal have not started yet as intended, and Israel insisted over the weekend on an intermediary measure it has attributed to the Trump administration, which would significantly change the rough terms of the agreement that were initially discussed.",

      "Police called it a terrorist attack and said the perpetrator was killed, but there were unconfirmed reports suggesting the man could have been inadvertently hit by a bullet fired by Israeli security forces responding to the knife attack.",
      "After Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to Hamas' unprecedented terrorist assault, repeated attacks \u2014 often involving knives \u2014 saw people killed or wounded in Israel. Until Monday, however, the Gaza ceasefire had coincided with a halt to such attacks within Israel, as violence largely subsided in Gaza after more than 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Police identified the assailant on Monday as a member of Israel's Druze Arab minority who had recently returned from another, unspecified country.",
      "Hamas lauded the attack in Haifa, calling it a response to purported Israeli crimes \"in the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem, including killing, destruction and displacement in the northern West Bank, the siege on Gaza, projects to displace Palestinians from the Jordan Valley, and the desecration of Al-Aqsa Mosque.\"",
      "The U.S., European Union and Israeli-designated terrorist group called on \"our people in the West Bank, Jerusalem, and inside Israel to escalate the confrontation with the enemy and engage them using all available means.\"",

      "Mediators Egypt and Qatar, which brokered the Gaza ceasefire and hostage exchange agreement along with the U.S., have accused Israel of blatantly violating the ceasefire deal by halting the aid convoys \u2014 a move that left trucks loaded with goods lined up on the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing with Gaza.",
      "The first six-week phase of the truce also saw the exchange of prisoners and hostages between Israel and Hamas. Of the 251 captives taken during Hamas' attack, Israel says 59 are still being held in Gaza, of whom at least 35 are dead.",
      "Early on Sunday Israel's government said it wanted to extend the first phase of the ceasefire until mid-April \u2014 a stopgap measure that it said President Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff had proposed. Netanyahu said Hamas must accept the new proposal and hand over half of the remaining hostages immediately, before any negotiations begin on a second phase of the ceasefire agreement.",
      "Hamas has repeatedly rejected an extension, instead favoring a transition to the truce deal's second phase that could bring a permanent end to the war and a withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, as envision in the deal negotiated by the U.S. and its regional partners.",
      "Hamas called Netanyahu's \"decision to suspend humanitarian aid is cheap blackmail, a war crime and a blatant coup against the (ceasefire) agreement.\"",
      "Egypt and Qatar, along with Saudi Arabia and Jordan, denounced Israel's aid decision.",
      "The European Union condemned what it called Hamas' refusal to accept the extension of the first phase, and added that Israel's subsequent aid block \"risked humanitarian consequences.\"",
      "Brussels called for \"a rapid resumption of negotiations on the second phase of the ceasefire.\"",
      "Hamas sparked the war in Gaza with its Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack on Israel, which saw the group kill more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and take 251 others hostage. Israel's retaliatory war in Gaza has killed more than 48,300 people in the Palestinian enclave, also mostly civilians, according to the territory's Hamas-run Ministry of Health.",
      "The war has also destroyed or damaged most buildings in Gaza, displaced almost the entire population and triggered widespread hunger, according to the U.N.",
      "Netanyahu's office said Sunday that he had \"decided that, from this morning, all entry of goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will be suspended,\" accusing the group of multiple violations of the ceasefire during phase-one, and of controlling the humanitarian aid that had entered the territory thus far and \"turning it into a budget for terrorism directed against\" Israel.",
      "\"In Witkoff's plan, half of the hostages would be released right away and the remaining half would be released if we reach an agreement on a permanent ceasefire,\" Netanyahu said Sunday. \"Israel has accepted this plan. I accepted this plan. But so far, Hamas has rejected it.\"",
      "His government warned there would be \"consequences\" for Hamas if it did not accept the temporary truce extension.",
      "Under the first phase of the ceasefire, Gaza militants handed over 25 living hostages and eight bodies in exchange for about 1,800 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.",
      "In Jerusalem late Sunday, AFP images showed protesters outside Netanyahu's residence calling on their government to make a deal that would bring home the remaining Israeli hostages.",
      "Netanyahu's critics in Israel have regularly blamed him for delays throughout the months of truce negotiations.",
      "Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, the leader of the far-right faction in Netanyahu's governing coalition, has threatened to quit if the war is not resumed, a move that would likely precipitate national elections and force Netanyahu to seek a new mandate at a time when the Israeli electorate is deeply divided over his handling of the hostage crisis.",
      "The prime minister is also on trial for corruption charges, which he denies, and on Monday he appeared in court to testify in the case, video images from the court showed.",

      "An Oval Office showdown between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would have been cheered by Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who served as Mr. Trump's national security adviser during his first administration.",
      "The U.S. imposed sanctions on Russia and provided aid to Ukraine after the war began but last month, Mr. Trump flipped U.S. policy on its head. He opened peace talks with Russia, which occupies 20% of Ukraine while bombing the rest, and did not invite Ukraine. Then on Friday, he berated Zelenskyy during an explosive Oval Office meeting.",
      "\"Vladimir Putin couldn't be happier,\" McMaster, who is a CBS News contributor and author of \"At War with Ourselves: My Tour of Duty in the Trump White House,\" said. \"Because what he sees is all of the pressure on Zelenskyy, all of the pressure on Ukraine and no pressure on him.\"",
      "Trump and Russia",
      "During his Friday Oval Office meeting with Zelenskyy, Mr. Trump revealed something of a common cause with the Russian president. Mr. Trump complained that he and Putin had both been slandered for years by allegations that Russia helped Mr. Trump's campaigns, allegations the U.S. president ties to his Democratic opponents.",
      "\"Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia, Russia,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "McMaster, who was ousted by Mr. Trump in 2018, said Putin has manipulated many world leaders, including the U.S. commander in chief.",
      "\"He appeals to President Trump's sense of aggrievement, right? That, you know, 'Donald, you know, like me, you know, you've been treated so unfairly,'\" McMaster said. \"And he's been very successful at it because he's a master manipulator and one of the best liars in the world.\"",
      "The president, McMaster said, is being played.",

      "Fact-checking President Trump's claims on Ukraine",
      "Mr. Trump, who's boasted that only he can end the war quickly, has repeatedly made false claims about Ukraine. Last month, he suggested that Ukraine was responsible for Russia's invasion, saying \"You should never have started it.\"",
      "Ukraine did not start the war. Fighting erupted just over three years ago with Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.",
      "The president also said the U.S. gave $350 billion toward Ukraine. It's $122 billion, according to\u00a0Kiel Institute data.",
      "He's also gone after Zelenskyy.",
      "\"A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left,\" Mr. Trump said on Feb. 19 in a Truth Social post.",
      "Zelenskyy is not a dictator. He was elected in 2019. There hasn't been a vote since because of the war.",
      "McMaster addressed some of Mr. Trump's claims on Zelenskyy and Ukraine in recent weeks.",

      "Mr. Trump also doesn't always consider how his words could hurt his agenda or how they could be received abroad, McMaster said.",
      "\"War really is a contest of wills, and I think what you're seeing is Donald Trump delivering a series of body blows to the Ukrainians in a way that could affect, you know, their will to continue to fight,\" McMaster said.",
      "Ukraine's allies were likely confused by the meeting, according to McMaster.",
      "\"They think, you know, 'How can President Trump be berating the leader of Ukraine while he says kind things about Vladimir Putin?\"",
      "Immediately after the Oval Office fight, many Republicans rallied around the president. On X, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said America was \"disrespected\" during the Oval Office meeting. He said he was proud of both the president and vice president for \"standing up for America First.\"",
      "After the meeting, Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted on X: \"Thank you @POTUS for standing up for America in a way that no President has ever had the courage to do before. Thank you for putting America First. America is with you!\"",
      "But some lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have expressed concerns. Republican Rep. Don Bacon, a retired Air Force brigadier general, stood by Ukraine when he spoke with 60 Minutes before the Oval Office fight.",
      "\"America's the leader of the free world. We're the indispensable power. Nobody can stand up to Russia and China if we're not a part of that. And Ukraine's the victim,\" Bacon said. \"And I think Putin has made clear that he wants to reestablish his old borders and that's not in our national security interest. So, to me, this is a national security issue, also a moral issue.\"",
      "He said it appears as though Mr. Trump is appeasing Putin.",
      "\"I don't know his motives. Some people think he's doin' this for negotiating and maybe he'll get a better deal. I don't know,\" Bacon said. \"All I know is what he says, and when he says that Russia is not the invader, that it's Ukraine's fault, that's just wrong.\"",
      "While other Republican lawmakers rushed to condemn President Zelenskyy after the Oval Office meeting, calling him disrespectful to President Trump, Bacon stood by Ukraine's president, saying on social media that this was \"A bad day for America's foreign policy. Ukraine wants independence, free markets and rule of law. It wants to be part of the West. Russia hates us and our Western values. We should be clear that we stand for freedom.\"",
      "Sen. Angus King, an Independent from Maine serving on the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, said he was ashamed when the U.S. recently sided with Russia at the United Nations, joining Russia in voting against a Europe-backed Ukrainian resolution.",
      "\"I always try to think of, you know, what's the argument on both sides? I cannot think of a rational argument for pulling our support from Ukraine,\" King told 60 Minutes.",
      "King likes to point out that Europe has given more to Ukraine than the U.S. and Ukraine has given the most.",

    "summary": "The meeting has been overshadowed by the extraordinary scolding of Ukrainian President Volodymyr by President Trump at the White House.",
    "story": [
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told leaders gathered Sunday for a summit on the\u00a0war in Ukraine\u00a0that they need to step up and continue to support Kyiv and meet a \"once in a generation moment\" for the security of Europe.",
      "Starmer pledged to supply more arms to defend Ukraine, announcing that the U.K. will use 1.6 billion pounds ($2 billion) in export financing to supply 5,000 air defense missiles.",
      "His call for European allies to increase their arms spending to shore up their own defenses and Ukraine's was not a sign that he thought the United States had become an unreliable ally, he said. No two countries are as closely aligned as the U.K. and the U.S., Starmer said.",
      "\"One thing our history tells us is that if there is conflict in Europe, it will wash up on our shores,\" he said.",
      "Starmer, flanked by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron, said the three of them have agreed to work on a plan to stop the fighting, and then take it to the United States, which has discussed brokering a peace deal.",
      "The meeting, which has taken on greater importance in defending the war-torn ally, has been overshadowed by the extraordinary scolding of Zelenskyy by President Trump, who blasted him Friday at the White House as being ungrateful for U.S. support against the invasion by Russia.",
      "Starmer told CBS News partner BBC\u00a0that he does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin but does trust Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Do I believe Donald Trump when he says he wants lasting peace? The answer to that is yes,\" he said.",
      "Starmer said there are \"intense discussions\" to get a security guarantee from the U.S.",
      "\"If there is to be a deal, if there is to be a stopping of the fighting, then that agreement has to be defended, because the worst of all outcomes is that there is a temporary pause and then Putin comes again,\" Starmer said. \"That has happened in the past, I think it is a real risk, and that is why we must ensure that if there's a deal, it is a lasting deal, not a temporary pause.\"",
      "The three essentials Starmer listed for a successful peace deal were: arming the Ukrainians to put them in a position of strength; including a European element to guarantee security; and providing a \"U.S. backstop,\" to prevent Putin from breaking promises.",
      "\"That's the package. All three parts need to be in place, and that's what I'm working hard to bring together,\" Starmer said.",
      "Starmer hosted the meeting at Lancaster House, a 200-year-old mansion near Buckingham Palace, following a charm offensive last week to persuade Mr. Trump to put Ukraine at the center of negotiations and tilt his allegiances toward Europe.",
      "Leaders from Germany, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Canada, Finland, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Romania were at the summit. The Turkish foreign minister, NATO secretary-general and the presidents of the European Commission and European Council were also in attendance.",
      "Meetings in recent days had provided some hope \u2014 until Zelenskyy visited the White House.",
      "Visits to the Oval Office by Macron, who had declared his visit a \"turning point,\" and Starmer were seen as steps in the right direction. The meetings were cordial and Mr. Trump even took a gentler tone toward Ukraine, though he would not commit to providing U.S. security guarantees and maintained Europe would need to provide peacekeeping troops.",
      "European Union top diplomat Kaja Kallas told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" in an interview taped Friday that the visits to the White House were coordinated with a message that the fight is \"much broader\" than just Ukraine's sovereignty.",
      "\"It's about freedom of the free world, really. It is about the world where international law applies and the world where might does not make right,\" she said. \"It is clear that Russia attacked Ukraine. There is one aggressor and one victim. And we need to really make sure that Russia doesn't attack again. And for that, we need to concentrate our efforts. I mean putting politically and economically pressure on Russia to stop this war, but at the same time also help Ukraine to defend itself.\"",

      "He had no fever or signs of elevated white blood cells, which would signal his body was fighting a new infection.",
      "Cardinal Pietro Parolin and his chief of staff, Archbishop Edgar Pena Parra, also called on the pope Sunday morning, their second visit since Francis' Feb. 14 hospitalization, according to the Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni. There were no details of what was discussed, but the mere visit suggested Francis' condition was stabilizing.",
      "Francis' hospitalization has come as the Vatican is marking\u00a0its Holy Year, drawing pilgrims to Rome\u00a0from all over. Many have added a pilgrimage destination to their itineraries so they can pray for Francis at the Gemelli hospital, which is around a 20-minute drive from the Vatican, longer in rush hour or on public transport.",

North Korea hasn't directly responded to Trump's overture but alleged U.S.-led hostilities against North Korea have intensified since Trump's inauguration.",

      "During an appearance on \"Fox Report,\" Baden explained that Hackman's pacemaker, which the sheriff said last recorded an event on Feb. 17, could offer a key clue.",
      "\"That event would have been a cardiac arrest caused by an abnormal pulse rate,\" he said. \"The pacemaker keeps track of the pulse, and when it gets down too low, it discharges. And that's all in the record.\"",
      "Dr. Michael Baden shared his expert opinion on the \"unusual\" circumstances behind Gene Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa's deaths. (Getty)",
      "\"So the autopsy showed he didn't have any injury,\" Baden continued. \"There was no carbon monoxide. And he had \u2014 the most common cause of death in this country \u2014 severe heart disease, coronary artery disease and high blood pressure perhaps, from what's been released. So that would cause him, having cardiac arrest in the mudroom, to collapse right there.\"",
      "In a search warrant affadvit released by the Santa Fe Sheriff's Office and obtained by Fox News Digital, investigators stated that they had found Hackman's body on the floor in a mud-room with a walking cane and sunglasses nearby. According to the documents, the detectives suspected that the actor may have \"suddenly fallen.\"",
      "Baden shared his theory that Arakawa's death may have occurred after Hackman's pacemaker stopped while she was trying to help her husband.",
      "\"The circumstances and who he was \u2014 he was beloved by so many \u2014 are what make it so unusual.\"",
      "The affidavit stated that Arawkawa was found on the ground in a bathroom with a space heater near her head. An orange prescription bottle was found near Hackman's wife, according to a search warrant affidavit. It appeared to be open, with pills scattered on a countertop. Authorities listed thyroid medication, blood pressure medication and Tylenol among the items they took from the house.",

      "\"His wife was found in the bathroom,\" Baden said. \"They haven't released the information about her findings, except that she did not have carbon monoxide in her, and that what appears to be from the scene and from what's been said is that she found her husband in the mudroom.\"",
      "Baden explained that in an agitated state, Arakawa could have rushed to the bathroom to get Hackman's blood pressure medication before falling to the floor while scattering the pills and taking the space heater down with her.",
      "\"She may have struck her head on the way down and had some internal injury to the brain that doesn't show up on the outside or bleeding in the inside of the brain,\" Baden said. \"Or that she may also, at 65, had severe heart disease and excitement can cause a trigger to the cardiac rhythm causing death under those circumstances. I think the first, that striking her head would be more common.\"",
      "Baden theorized that Hackman suffered a cardiac event and Arakawa may have died while trying to get his medication. (Donaldson Collection/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images)",
      "According to the affidavit, the deceased dog, a German Shepherd, was found \"10-15 feet\" away from Arakawa in a closet of the bathroom. Two other living dogs were discovered on the property. Detectives observed that \"one of the healthy dogs was initially observed near the deceased female (inside the bathroom) and the other healthy dog was observed outside the residence.\"",
      "\"What was perplexing to me initially with the release was the death of a dog also, which I thought was free in the house,\" Baden said. \"And that's why I think that the carbon monoxide[theory] was a very good thought with them breathing in the same air. But it turns out from what they say, that the dog was constrained in his cage or kennel and would have died from just dehydration and lack of water during the nine-day period that he couldn't get out of the kennel.\"",
      "Baden noted that his theory could explain why an emergency call wasn't immediately made after Hackman experienced the cardiac event on Feb. 17. A maintenance worker who discovered Hackman and Arakawa's bodies called 911 on Feb. 26.",
      "GENE HACKMAN AND WIFE'S DEATHS CALLED 'SUSPICIOUS,' BODIES SHOWED SIGNS OF \u2018MUMMIFICATION\u2019",
      "\"The circumstances and who he was \u2014 he was beloved by so many \u2014 are what make it so unusual,\" Baden said. \"Because heart disease and collapsing and dying with a pacemaker is common in the United States.\"",
      "\"But the circumstances of the two of them isolated by themselves,\" he continued. \"And that may have been the reason that 911 wasn't called, for example, while his wife was trying to get him some medication and fell.\"",

      "\"It has utility in the treatment of acne and for skin rejuvenation purposes, making it popular for both young and older patients.\"",

FrigidStealer spreads through compromised websites that display deceptive browser update prompts. When users click on these prompts, they unknowingly download a malicious DMG file. Once executed, the malware requests the user\u2019s system password to gain elevated privileges before stealing sensitive information, including browser cookies, password-related files, cryptocurrency data and Apple Notes.",
      "Proofpoint identified two new threat actors behind the operation: TA2726, which functions as a traffic distribution service provider, and TA2727, which delivers FrigidStealer to Mac users. The campaign also deploys malware on Windows and Android devices, signaling a multi-platform attack strategy. The cybersecurity firm assessed with high confidence that TA2726 distributes traffic for other malware campaigns as well. Some operations previously attributed to TA569 have now been reclassified under TA2726 and TA2727.",

      "1) Beware of fake software updates: One of the most common infection methods is through deceptive browser update prompts. Never download updates from pop-ups or random websites. Instead, always update your software directly from official sources, such as the App Store or the application\u2019s official website. If in doubt, check out my\u00a0detailed guide on how to keep your device and software updated.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method, such as a one-time code sent to your phone. Use 2FA for all critical accounts, including email, banking and cloud services.",
      "3) Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated\u00a0password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "4)\u00a0Be cautious with downloads and links. Use a strong antivirus: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

FrigidStealer is just the latest reminder that no platform, not even macOS, is immune to the growing sophistication of cybercriminals. With infostealers like Lumma, StealC and Redline already compromising millions of devices and billions of credentials in 2024, the rise of AI-driven attacks and social engineering scams signals a challenging road ahead.",

During the study, the hand was floated in a liquid to minimize friction, and adding elastic or more MuMuTAs would solve the issue of the segments floating back to a neutral position after being flexed. However, by bundling the tissue together, they overcame a major hurdle in scaling up biohybrid devices. Previously, such devices were limited to about a centimeter in size.",

      "The Zacks Investment breach first came to light in late January 2025 when a hacker known as \"Jurak\" claimed on BreachForums that they had gained access to Zacks' systems as early as June 2024.",
      "According to the hacker, they obtained domain administrator privileges for Zacks' active directory, a critical network security component, allowing them to steal source code for Zacks.com and 16 other websites, including internal tools, along with user account data. The stolen information was then put up for sale on hacker forums, with samples offered for a small cryptocurrency payment to prove authenticity, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer.",
      "Further investigation confirmed the breach occurred in June 2024, exposing 12 million unique email addresses and other personal data. The fact that the attacker managed to gain domain admin access suggests a highly sophisticated attack, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in Zacks' network security.",

The leaked data includes email addresses, IP addresses, names, phone numbers, physical addresses, usernames, and unsalted SHA-256 hashed passwords.",
      "This kind of information can be misused for phishing, identity theft, credential stuffing, harassment, SIM swapping and even physical threats. Alarmingly, 93% of the leaked email addresses had already been exposed in previous breaches, making reused passwords an even bigger problem. The use of unsalted SHA-256 hashes \u2014 widely considered outdated \u2014 only adds to the risk, making it easier for attackers to crack passwords and compromise accounts.",

      "7 ways you can protect yourself after a data breach like this",
      "1. Beware of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0After a data breach, scammers often use the stolen data to craft convincing phishing messages. These can come via email, text or phone calls, pretending to be from trusted companies. Be extra cautious about unsolicited messages with links asking for personal or financial details, even if they reference recent orders or transactions. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "2. Invest in identity theft protection:\u00a0Given the exposure of personal data, such as names, addresses and order details, investing in identity theft protection services can provide an extra layer of security. These services monitor your financial accounts and credit report for any signs of fraudulent activity, alerting you to potential identity theft early on. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on accounts:\u00a0Enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. Even if hackers get hold of your login credentials, they won\u2019t be able to access your accounts without the second verification step, such as a code sent to your phone or email. This simple step can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive personal information.",
      "4. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the breach, and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a\u00a0password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this breach, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The Zacks Investment breach highlights just how real the threat of cyberattacks is for financial institutions. With millions of users affected and personal data exposed, the risks of scams and identity theft are higher than ever. The fact that Zacks hasn\u2019t said much about the breach only adds to the uncertainty for those impacted. As these types of attacks become more common, it\u2019s more important than ever to stay on top of your online security \u2014 use unique passwords, keep an eye on your accounts, and stay alert for any signs of suspicious activity.",

The team, led by Antonio Bicchi and Dario Farina, developed a method that integrates these postural synergies with the analysis of electrical signals from the nervous system. By decoding the activity of spinal motoneurons (the nerve cells that control muscle movement), they can predict the hand movements a user intends to make.

One of the most exciting features of this new prosthetic hand is its ability to perform in-hand manipulation.

    "summary": "Just two months into 2025 there have been numerous Mac malware threats targeting Apple laptops, ranging from infostealers to malicious software.",
    "story": [
      "Jose-Marie Griffiths discusses the increasingly important subject with Fox News Digital.",
      "It's early, but 2025 is not shaping up to be a great year for Mac cybersecurity.",
      "In less than two months, we've seen numerous Mac malware threats targeting Apple laptops, which are generally considered very secure. These threats range from infostealers to malicious software capable of reading screenshots and stealing passwords.",
      "Now, Microsoft has identified a resurfaced malware that has returned after years, equipped with new malicious capabilities, including stealing sensitive information such as digital wallets and data from the legitimate Notes app.",
      "STAY SAFE & IN THE KNOW \u2013 AT NO COST! SUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S THE CYBERGUY REPORT FOR FREE SECURITY ALERTS & TECH TIPS",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the malware",
      "Microsoft Threat Intelligence has discovered a new version of XCSSET, a dangerous macOS malware that spreads by infecting Xcode projects, which are files used by developers to create Mac apps. While this malware is currently being seen in only a few attacks, it has been upgraded with new tricks to make it harder to detect and remove.",
      "One of the biggest changes is how the malware hides itself. It now scrambles its code in a more unpredictable way, making it difficult for security software to recognize. It also renames parts of its code to disguise its true purpose, allowing it to stay hidden for longer.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Once it infects a Mac, the malware ensures it keeps running even after the computer is restarted. It does this in two ways. First, it inserts itself into system files that launch when the computer starts. Second, it replaces the shortcut to Launchpad, which is the tool used to open apps, with a fake version that runs both the real Launchpad and the malware at the same time.",
      "This malware also finds new ways to sneak into Xcode projects, making it more difficult to spot. If an infected project is shared or downloaded, the malware can spread to other devices without the user realizing it.",
      "A person working on their Mac (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "SPOTIFY PLAYLISTS ARE BEING HIJACKED TO PROMOTE PIRATED SOFTWARE AND SCAM",
      "What data can it steal?",
      "The XCSSET malware is designed to steal a variety of sensitive information from infected Macs, putting both personal and financial data at risk. One of its primary targets is digital wallets, which are used to store cryptocurrency. If a user has a crypto wallet on their Mac, the malware can attempt to access and steal funds.",
      "It can also collect data from the Notes app, where many users store personal information, passwords and other sensitive details. If important data is saved in Notes, it could be accessed and sent to hackers.",
      "Beyond this, the malware can exfiltrate system information and files, meaning it can gather details about the Mac itself, installed applications and even specific files stored on the device. This could include work documents, saved login credentials or any other valuable information. Because XCSSET is a modular malware, meaning it can be updated with new capabilities, it may gain even more data-stealing abilities over time.",

      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "5 tips to protect yourself from Mac malware",
      "Follow these essential tips to safeguard your Mac from the latest malware threats, including the notorious XCSSET.",
      "1. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Protect your Mac from XCSSET and other threats by installing strong antivirus software on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Be cautious with downloads and links: Only download software from reputable sources such as the Mac App Store or official websites of trusted developers. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links.\u00a0Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3. Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS and all installed applications are up to date. Apple frequently releases security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4. Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here; it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, Google account, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Mac users can\u2019t afford to be complacent anymore. Gone are the days when Macs were considered \"safe by default.\" Cybercriminals have leveled up, moving beyond basic adware to full-blown information stealers. They\u2019re swiping passwords, hijacking authentication cookies, intercepting OTPs and even emptying crypto wallets. The threats are getting smarter and more aggressive, and no platform is off-limits. Staying ahead means taking security seriously, because the bad guys definitely are.",

      "We saw a rise in infostealer malware in 2024, with hackers using it to steal credentials, cryptocurrency and other personal data from millions of users. If you recall, I reported countless\u00a0incidents of an infostealer called Lumma preying on Android, Windows and even iOS and Mac users.",
      "A new cybersecurity report now highlights that hackers using Lumma, along with StealC, Redline and other infostealers, infected 4.3 million machines in 2024, leading to an astonishing 330 million compromised credentials.",
      "Security researchers have also observed 3.9 billion credentials shared in credential lists that appear to be sourced from infostealer logs.",

      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Infostealer-related attacks on the rise in 2024",
      "A\u00a0cybersecurity report by threat intelligence platform KELA has uncovered a sharp rise in infostealer malware in 2024. Researchers also observed an alarming trend in how stolen data was circulated. Large compilations of credentials, often referred to as \"credential lists,\" were being shared across cybercrime forums. These lists, primarily sourced from infostealer logs, contained billions of login details harvested from infected devices.",
      "One of the most notable incidents linked to infostealer malware was the breach of Snowflake, a cloud data storage provider. In April 2024, threat actors gained access to customer accounts using stolen login credentials, many of which were obtained through infostealers. Exploiting weak security practices, such as the absence of multifactor authentication, attackers extracted valuable data and later attempted to sell it on underground markets. The breach affected at least 165 companies.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The KELA report highlights that hackers deploying Lumma, StealC, Redline and other infostealers infected 4.3 million machines, leading to the compromise of 330 million credentials. Nearly 40% of these infected machines contained credentials for corporate systems, including content management platforms, email accounts, Active Directory Federation Services and remote desktop environments. In total, this accounted for 1.7 million compromised bots and 7.5 million stolen credentials.",
      "The report also found that 3.9 billion credentials were shared in credential lists that appear to be sourced from infostealer logs. KELA\u2019s analysis suggests that almost 65% of infected devices were personal computers storing corporate credentials, making them a prime target for infostealer malware.",

      "2025 is not going to be any different",
      "Infostealer malware is not going anywhere in 2025. With malware-as-a-service platforms on the rise and infostealers becoming more advanced, cybercriminals will likely keep using them as a go-to method for stealing credentials and gaining access to systems.",
      "Law enforcement has been cracking down, though. In 2024, authorities managed to take down key parts of the infostealer ecosystem, including disrupting Redline, one of the most widely used infostealers. This showed that international agencies can go after not just the malware developers but also the networks and underground markets that keep these operations running.",
      "But takedowns like these rarely put an end to the problem. When one major infostealer operation is shut down, others quickly step in to take its place. The constant demand for stolen credentials and the ability of cybercriminals to adapt means infostealer attacks will likely remain a major threat in 2025.",

      "Ways to stay safe from infostealer malware",
      "With infostealer malware becoming a growing threat, protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are some effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "2. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "HOW TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST DEBIT CARD HACKERS WHO ARE AFTER YOUR MONEY",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Given the surge in infostealer malware warnings, it is clear that cybercriminals are actively targeting passwords. Both organizations and individuals are urged to strengthen their security measures by enabling 2FA, monitoring credential exposure and using endpoint protection tools. While no security measure is completely foolproof, combining these practices can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to infostealer malware.",

      "\"That\u2019s completely out the window now,\" said Nik Nanos, founder and chief data scientist of the Canadian polling firm, who also believes Trudeau\u2019s imminent departure and Trump\u2019s rhetoric against Canada have contributed to the Liberals\u2019 bump in the polls.",

      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) released most of its investigation of what happened on Oct. 7, 2023, and in the days leading up to Hamas\u2019 massacre. While the initial investigation began in November 2023, outgoing IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi ordered all units to start probes in March 2024. The IDF refrained from offering recommendations in its report, saying that those would be left to incoming IDF Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir, who will enter the role next week.",

      "1. Oct. 7 in numbers",
      "According to the IDF\u2019s assessment, 5,000-5,600 militants infiltrated Israel in three waves. Meanwhile, 4,696 rockets and mortars were fired towards Israel. The attacks left 829 Israeli civilians, 76 foreign nationals and 415 security personnel dead. Additionally, 251 hostages were taken into the Gaza Strip.",
      "\"The fundamental failure was a result of failure to understand Hamas's intentions and readiness for a wide-scale surprise attack,\" IDF senior officials say in the report.",
      "2. Hamas attack timeline",
      "Hamas\u2019 attacks were not done hastily, according to the IDF, the planning began nearly seven years before the massacre, with the formation of the \"fundamental concept\" in November 2016 and an \"initial plan\" in July 2017. Hamas\u2019 plan was approved in July 2019 and the operational plan was set in August 2021. In early 2022, a readiness committee was established and over the course of the year the terror group evaluated options for implementing its plan.",
      "The IDF says Hamas considered numerous dates for the attacks, including Sept. 16, which was Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, and Sept. 25, Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement. Ultimately, Oct. 7, 2023, which coincided with the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, which marks the end and re-start of the Torah.",

      "LOOKING BACK ON THE TIMELINE OF ISRAEL'S WAR AGAINST HAMAS AFTER OCT. 7",
      "3. Full timeline of Oct. 7",
      "The attack, according to the IDF\u2019s assessment began taking shape in the early hours of Oct. 7. Hamas allegedly began preparing its forces around 11:00 p.m. on Oct. 6, after spending much of the day putting them on alert and gathering weapons, and concluded briefings by 4:00 a.m. on Oct. 7.",
      "The infiltration itself began with the first wave at 6:29 a.m. when 1,154 members of Hamas\u2019 Nukhba forces invaded, breaking the security barrier between Gaza and Israel. The IDF declared a state of emergency at 6:43 a.m., and at 7:10 a.m. the Israeli Air Force (IAF) followed suit.",
      "Between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m., 3,400 militants were inside Israeli territory. Additionally, just before 8:00 a.m., Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif called on civilians in Gaza to join the attacks. The assessment states that after 9:00 a.m. attackers took advantage of IDF failures and seized opportunities to further the assault. Some allegedly planned to go deeper into Israeli territory.",
      "Several of the \"main attacks\" were stopped by the IDF around 1:00 p.m., but there were still hundreds of attackers in Israel at 3:00 p.m. The IDF says it gained control of some of the communities and surrounding areas by 9:00 p.m., but dozens were present around midnight.",
      "\"We did not predict Hamas would be able to be so brutal in its fighting,\" IDF senior officials wrote.",
      "4. IDF\u2019s incorrect assessment of threats",
      "Much of the IDF\u2019s focus was on Iran and Hezbollah prior to the Oct. 7 attacks, and Hamas was defined as a secondary threat at the time. Additionally, the IDF assumed that it could contain Hamas activity as it worked toward \"gradually improving the existing reality\" with the goal of removing the terror group.",
      "The IDF also believed that \"Hamas didn\u2019t want a full-scale war,\" leading Israel to conclude that a large-scale invasion was unlikely. In the assessment, the IDF says Hamas took advantage of Israel\u2019s perception of the situation and used it to its advantage.",
      "Another major misconception highlighted in the assessment is the IDF\u2019s thinking that the main threat from Hamas were the rockets and mortars being shot from Gaza. This combined with reliance on defense tactics and a barrier, as well as the reduction of troops on the Israel-Gaza border would lead to catastrophe.",
      "5. Intelligence failures",
      "Israel\u2019s Intelligence Directorate did not fully grasp or analyze intel it had on Hamas and its intentions. This apparently also applies to the IDF\u2019s perception of the Shi\u2019ite \"Axis\" and its views on Israel. The IDF says that during the review it found deep-rooted systemic issues with the intelligence directorate and culture.",
      "Since 2018, the Intelligence Directorate had been gathering information on Hamas\u2019 concept for a large-scale attack on Israel. However, the plan was deemed unfeasible and was thought to reflect Hamas\u2019 long-term goals.",
      "In August 2021, intel on Hamas\u2019 military wing described the plan for a large-scale attack on Israeli communities and military outposts surrounding the Gaza Strip. Intelligence officials failed to make the connection between this new intel and what it had gathered in 2018.",
      "The intelligence received in the months leading up to Oct. 7 indicated that Hamas was carrying out training exercises for raids. This apparently changed Israel\u2019s elite Unit 8200\u2019s assessment of the situation, but this was allegedly not communicated with senior leadership.",
      "Israeli soldiers inspect the burnt cars of festival-goers at the site of an attack on the Nova Festival by Hamas gunmen from Gaza, near Israel's border with the Gaza Strip, in southern Israel, Oct. 13, 2023.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Amir Cohen)",
      "ISRAELI ARMY FINDS BODIES OF 3 HOSTAGES IN GAZA KILLED AT OCT. 7 MUSIC FESTIVAL",
      "6. \"Early signs\" missed",
      "In the evening hours of Oct. 6, 2023, Israeli sim cards were activated inside Gaza. However, this was not alerted as it had happened before. Those same sim cards would later allow Hamas militants to communicate after they crossed the border into Israel. There were also indications that night that Hamas leaders were meeting. However, according to the IDF\u2019s assessment, neither of these facts were enough to change the Intelligence Directorate\u2019s way of thinking on Gaza, therefore there was no alert.There were also indications of both usual and unusual Hamas activity that evening. The inquiry revealed that there were intelligence sources that could have been utilized overnight to enhance information that were not used. However, the IDF asserts that had the Intelligence Directive changed its assessment of the situation, there would have been a higher alert for a localized Hamas offensive, but not for an all-out war.",
      "7. Assessment of the IAF",
      "The IAF was found to have met and even exceeded the defined standards for readiness except for two instances due to heavy rocket fire. However, these standards did not align with what would have been required to prepare for a large-scale surprise attack. The IDF concluded that there was \"significant difficulty\" distinguishing IDF troops, civilians and terrorists from one another.",
      "While the IAF struck key Hamas command centers, the IDF admits that even in its review of the strikes it is challenging to determine if there could have been a more effective strike effort given the circumstances.",
      "However, it was noted that the IDF did not prepare for anything like the brutal Oct. 7 massacre.\"We were addicted to the precise intelligence and information we got as commanders and did not consider other scenarios. This failure will forever be etched in our memories, and we will never and should never forget,\" IDF senior officials wrote.",

      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "In its conclusion, the IDF notes that the assessment of the situation in Gaza and regarding Hamas was so entrenched in the establishment that there was no deep discussion about alternate possibilities. Additionally, it now says that it was \"incorrect\" to try to \"conflict manage\" Hamas and, in the future, the removal of threats should be prioritized.",
      "The assessment also addresses the possibility of a future attack, saying that a preventative strategy will be key.",

If the U.S. attempts to exert extreme pressure on China, it is simply targeting the wrong country and miscalculating its moves.\u201dLin also said China had \u201ctaken strong measures\u201d to help stem the international flow of fentanyl, which Trump has cited as justification for the tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, and that the U.S. was using fentanyl as an excuse to wage a trade war.",
      "In addition to the new tariffs, China added 10 U.S. companies to its \u201cunreliable entity\u201d list and 15 to its export control list, mostly defense and intelligence firms with little exposure to the Chinese economy.",
      "Beijing is also filing a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization over the new 10% tariff, as it did in response to a previous 10% tariff that President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese goods starting Feb. 4.",
      "The combined 20% U.S. tariff on Chinese goods comes on top of tariffs Trump imposed during his first term that were maintained and in some cases sharply increased by former President Joe Biden.",
      "Canada said it would move ahead with an earlier plan to impose 25% tariffs on 155\u00a0billion Canadian dollars ($107 billion) in American goods if the U.S. tariff took effect as scheduled.",
      "Tariffs on $20.7 billion worth of goods will take effect immediately, while tariffs on the remaining $86.3 billion in U.S. products will begin in 21 days, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement late Monday. They will remain until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn, he said.",
      "\u201cBecause of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cTariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term.\u201d",
      "Trump, who had been threatening tariffs against Canada and Mexico since November, had accused them of failing to stem the international flow of fentanyl and other illicit drugs.",
      "While precursor chemicals for fentanyl are known to be shipped from China to Mexico, where they are processed into the deadly opioid which is then smuggled into the U.S., Canada says it has virtually no role in the international flow of fentanyl.",
      "According to U.S. customs data, only 0.2% of the more than 20,000 pounds of fentanyl seized at the U.S. border in the 2024 fiscal year came from Canada.",
      "Trudeau said Canada had nonetheless stepped up its drug enforcement efforts, resulting in fentanyl seizures from Canada dropping a further 97% from December to January, to 0.03 pounds.",
      "The tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which Trump issued in an executive order he signed on Feb. 1, had been put on hold for 30 days after the leaders of both countries announced moves to tighten border security. They also include a 10% tariff on Canadian energy imports.",
      "U.S. stocks tumbled Monday after Trump said the tariffs on Canada and Mexico would go ahead as planned, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 650 points, or 1.48%, and the S&P 500 dropping 1.76% for its worst day so far this year.",
      "In Asia, Japan led declines in markets around the region with stocks falling almost 2%, CNBC reported. Stocks in mainland China and Hong Kong were muted.",
      "The U.S.-China tariff tit-for-tat comes as Chinese leaders and lawmakers gather in Beijing this week for the country\u2019s biggest political event of the year, the National People\u2019s Congress, where the ruling Chinese Communist Party will signal its priorities and goals for the year, including its approach to the Trump administration.",
      "Though China spared U.S. agriculture in its response to the first 10% tariff, \u201cTrump\u2019s impatient tariff offensive may be changing the calculus\u201d and the U.S. farming sector \u201cshould start to feel the pinch,\u201d said Tianchen Xu, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing.",
      "\u201cSounds like it\u2019s telling the U.S. that \u2018we\u2019re really going to hit you hard if you don\u2019t stop,\u2019\u201d he said in an email.",
      "In Canada, meanwhile, retaliation against U.S. tariffs could also extend to its individual provinces. Ontario Premier Doug Ford told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press NOW\u201d on Monday that Canada would \u201crespond like they\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d",
      "He said he was prepared to retaliate by cutting off the transmission of electricity from his province to the U.S. as well as shipments of nickel, which \u201cwill shut down manufacturing because 50% of the nickel you use is coming out of Ontario.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry to the American people that your president has decided to do this,\u201d Ford said. \u201cI apologize, but he\u2019s giving us no choice.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump, in a joint address to Congress on Tuesday night, is expected to lay out his efforts to rapidly slash the size of the federal government in ways critics warn overstep his authority and threaten lasting damage.",
      "The speech comes as Trump is making a sharp break from the previous administration, both on the international and domestic fronts. On Friday, Trump and Vice President JD Vance had a heated confrontation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, rocking international relations and prompting concerns from critics that the White House is moving away from a democratic ally and hewing closer to Russia, an authoritarian adversary.",
      "Tuesday's speech \u2014 Trump's first address to Congress of his second term \u2014 gives him the opportunity to further justify the shake-ups, both at home and abroad, to lawmakers and the public, and to preview what's coming next.",
      "The president plans to use the address to tout what he views as his administration's initial successes, while also hosting guests the White House said benefited from Trump's first term, according to an administration official and a senior White House official.",
      "The theme of Trump\u2019s speech is \u201cthe renewal of the American Dream,\u201d a senior administration official said.",
      "The president is likely to focus his remarks on immigration, new tariffs and the Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to slash budgets and fire federal workers, as well as the administration's efforts to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government, a senior administration official told NBC News last week.",
      "Elon Musk, who has spearheaded DOGE\u2019s efforts despite not being the acting administrator of the initiative, will attend the speech, according to a White House official.",
      "\u201cThere will be a lot of surprises and a lot of made-for-TV moments,\u201d another administration official said.",
      "In his last joint address to Congress, his 2020 State of the Union speech, Trump awarded right-wing talk show host Rush Limbaugh the Medal of Freedom \u2014 the country\u2019s highest civilian honor. (Limbaugh, 70, died a year later.)",
      "Trump may not travel the country to amplify his message in the days after the address, as is typical for presidents, according to a White House official. The official said that the president and his team believe he\u2019s accomplishing much of his agenda from the White House, adding that they were comfortable with him explaining his message to Americans from his perch in the Oval Office.",
      "\u201cThe priority is making sure business here at the White House is settled,\u201d the official said, adding that post-address plans could change.",
      "Instead, Vance will travel outside of Washington to highlight the key points in the president\u2019s address,\u00a0a senior administration official said. He will begin with a trip to the southern border Wednesday, according to a spokesperson for the vice president. Vance is expected to tour a processing facility in Eagle Pass, Texas, becoming the highest-ranking Trump administration official to visit the border so far during Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Vance played a key role in Friday's combative meeting with Zelenskyy, an unprecedented public confrontation with a U.S. ally that was later cheered by current and former Russian officials. The move was slammed by Democrats, and many Republicans have since doubled down on the administration's criticisms of Zelenskyy.",
      "Sen. Elissa Slotkin, of Michigan, will deliver the Democratic response to the joint address. The president's opposing party typically selects someone considered to be a rising political star to lay out the party's priorities and perspectives on the administration. Slotkin won Michigan's competitive open Senate seat in November, outperforming then-Vice President Kamala Harris in her presidential bid.",
      "Slotkin's speech will lean into her security background as a former CIA analyst, according to a source familiar with her speech, who said her background gives her a unique perspective on the Oval Office confrontation between Trump, Vance and Zelenskyy. The senator will also highlight a proactive economic vision and discuss what Democrats see as the path forward, the source said.",
      "Members of Congress also typically invite guests to presidential joint addresses in an effort to highlight specific issues.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., asked the Democratic caucus to bring guests who \"have suffered under the Trump administration\u2019s policies,\" according to a spokesperson. The spokesperson said that Schumer planned to bring two Medicaid recipients, a child with spinal muscular atrophy, whose survival was credited to a National Institutes of Health program, and two fired federal workers.",
      "Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech in 2020 echoed campaign speeches, touting his economic and migration records just a month before the country ground to a halt because of Covid. At the end of his remarks, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripped up a copy of the president\u2019s speech."

    "summary": "Trump\u2019s friendlier approach to dealing with Republican lawmakers is a stark departure from his first term, when he often took his critics to task on social media.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 As President Donald Trump traveled to visit natural disaster areas in North Carolina and California shortly after his inauguration, his team was concerned about a possible political disaster back in Washington. To defuse it would require a type of political dexterity he hadn\u2019t always displayed during his first term.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., had raised concerns about defense secretary nominee Pete Hegseth to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who had communicated them to the White House. Hegseth couldn\u2019t afford to lose Tillis\u2019 vote, and Trump and his political team knew it.",
      "Walking into an Air Force One cabin filled with members of North Carolina\u2019s GOP congressional delegation, Trump mused, \u201cI hear your man Thom might not be with us,\u201d according to a person who heard the remark. Trump then openly speculated, \u201cMaybe someone will primary him. ... Do we have any takers?\u201d",
      "The threat wrapped in a joke was never deployed publicly. Instead, Trump took a different tack. Before the comment, his political team had set up meetings for Tillis with Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance. The behind-the-scenes pressure campaign then culminated with a meeting between Trump and Tillis the day of Hegseth\u2019s confirmation vote.",
      "\u201cWe went into overdrive,\u201d said a senior administration official who was granted anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. \u201cTillis just kept shrinking with each passing hour.\u201d",
      "Tillis ultimately fell in line and supported Hegseth, who squeaked through after Vance cast the tiebreaking vote to secure his confirmation. Notably, Trump never used what was his preferred tool of congressional diplomacy during his first term: a social media scolding.",
      "Trump\u2019s more measured management of his relationships with Republican lawmakers \u2014 in which blow-ups still occur, but over the phone or behind closed doors rather than on social media \u2014 has been a critical difference between his two terms so far, according to eight sources on both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue familiar with the dynamic between Trump and members of Congress.",
      "\u201cHe has stronger relationships on the Hill, so he doesn\u2019t feel the need to be as \u2014 he\u2019s a relationships guy,\u201d a senior White House official said. \u201cNow he has deeper, more personal relationships.\u201d",
      "'He's proven himself to me'",
      "When Trump, a former Democrat, first arrived in Washington in 2017, few congressional Republicans knew him \u2014 or trusted him. And there were Republicans then who were unafraid to break with Trump\u2019s actions or rhetoric, from Sens. John McCain and Bob Corker to Reps. Charlie Dent and Mark Sanford.",
      "Eight years later, Trump is regarded as the most dominant GOP figure in generations, those vocal critics are out of office, and he is deploying a softer touch with the loyalists who remain. Unlike the start of his first term, he knows Republican lawmakers on a first-name basis, passes out his cellphone number to them and frequently hosts them and their spouses at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.",
      "\u201cHe was my fifth choice for president, and I was wondering what we were getting into\u201d in 2016, recalled Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., who endorsed Marco Rubio in that primary campaign. \u201cAnd then I became a convert to support him because of the policies that he had. It\u2019s not what he said; it\u2019s what he did. He\u2019s proven himself to me.\u201d",
      "Wilson then pulled out of his jacket pocket a photo of him with Trump at Mar-a-Lago from a visit in January.",
      "Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., who publicly pushed back against Trump\u2019s stolen election claims in 2020 and endorsed another candidate for president last year, said in an interview last Thursday that Trump \u201cis prepared this time\u201d around.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s had four years to plan his first six months in office. And it has been a very successful first two months for sure,\u201d he said.",
      "Those relationships were tested last week when Trump used his pull with House Republicans to break an impasse over a budget resolution that\u2019s critical to advancing his border security, energy and tax agenda through Congress.",
      "Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., were getting squeezed on both sides \u2014 from GOP moderates fretting about potential Medicaid cuts that could harm their constituents and conservative fiscal hawks furious that the proposed spending cuts weren\u2019t deep enough.",
      "Trump and Johnson began assuaging concerns of the moderates. One, Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., said he spoke to Trump twice last week, including just hours before the vote. Van Drew said that he called Trump and left a message for him last Tuesday and that Trump called him back soon after. Rather than insist that Van Drew vote for the budget blueprint, he recalled, Trump asked him whether he thought the votes were there to pass it. The two talked about protecting Medicaid for low-income Americans, many of whom voted for Trump.",
      "\u201cWaste, fraud and abuse. Yes, we all want to get rid of that. But the issue ... are people that are disabled, people that are in nursing homes, people that are working poor, a lot of all these people are wearing red hats,\u201d Van Drew said. \u201cThey\u2019re the new Republican Party, the populist conservative party. [Trump] understands that.\u201d",
      "But the quartet of conservatives dug in and refused to move off their opposition. During a dramatic standoff on the House floor, Trump began calling three of the remaining conservative holdouts: Reps. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, and Victoria Spartz, R-Ind. The House Republican leadership team is using its \u201cphone a friend lifeline with caution,\u201d said a source involved in discussions, who didn\u2019t want Trump to waste political capital so early in a perilous process.",
      "Trump spent 25 minutes on the phone with Spartz, who walked away from the conversation telling Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., she would still vote against the resolution, according to a person who witnessed the conversations. Trump and Spartz then had a second phone call.",
      "\u201cWe had a productive conversation, and he reassured me that he will back me up when things are important for me and he agrees with me,\u201d Spartz said, adding that Trump recognized strong-arming her would backfire. \u201cPresident Trump is a smart man. He would know better than that, you know, that it would never work, right? ... President Trump was very nice. ... He cares a lot, and he always listens.\u201d",
      "Republicans said Trump\u2019s defter behind-the-scenes approach most likely has to do with his paper-thin majority in the House. The budget resolution passed 217-215 \u2014 a single-vote margin \u2014 and he\u2019ll need nearly every Republican on board again to pass the reconciliation package later this year. Publicly bashing and alienating opponents, lawmakers said, could risk blowing up his entire agenda.",
      "That\u2019s a marked difference from 2017, when House Republicans had a 241-194 majority. That year, 20 House Republicans bucked Trump and voted against a partial repeal of Obamacare. McCain would later kill the package in the Senate.",
      "And that December, a dozen Republicans voted no on a sweeping tax bill that Trump later signed into law.",
      "Trump\u2019s \u201cgot to be real careful, which he is not. There will be problems on the hard right, with pragmatic members and others,\u201d said Dent, the former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania who voted against the Obamacare repeal bill in 2017 and resigned from the House a year later. \u201cNo margin for error.\u201d",
      "'It's like night and day'",
      "Trump also genuinely likes the Republican leaders of both chambers, administration sources say, a dynamic that was absent during his first stint in the Oval Office with Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the former Senate leader and House speaker, respectively.",
      "After the bill to repeal Obamacare collapsed, Trump posted on social media that McConnell, R-Ky., \u201ccouldn\u2019t get it done.\u201d And when McConnell blamed Trump for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Trump called him a \u201cdour, sullen, and unsmiling political hack.\u201d As for Ryan, R-Wis., Trump has called him a \u201cweak and ineffective leader\u201d and a \u201ccurse to the Republican Party.\u201d",
      "Congressional Republicans acknowledge Trump is also generally more accessible to them in his second term, with many in possession of his personal cellphone number.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like night and day from what it was in the first term,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told NBC News.",
      "Cornyn also credited Trump\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d chief of staff, Susie Wiles, who has long-standing relationships with many Republicans on Capitol Hill and can help lawmakers \u201cnavigate\u201d disagreements with Trump.",
      "\u201cShe hears the good, bad and the ugly,\u201d Cornyn said.",
      "Trump also has another tool at his disposal in managing Congress: billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who spent more than a quarter-billion dollars on the 2024 elections.",
      "Musk\u2019s embrace of Trump has been a net positive in his relationship with Congress, a senior administration official said, \u201cand not just by the threat his very existence imposes\u201d \u2014 referring to his ability to spend massive sums of money on an election.",
      "Musk\u2019s penchant for fiery posts on his X platform requires White House management. But he has proven to be a valuable ally for Trump, having recently spent 45 minutes on the phone lobbying a \u201cdifficult\u201d senator on behalf of an administration priority, the senior official said.",
      "\u201cWe just have to be cognizant that if he\u2019s not on the same page, we could risk something being said at any time that sets us back,\u201d the official said.",
      "Still, there are limits to Musk\u2019s influence. During the Republican Senate leadership race last year, in which all votes were private, Musk endorsed Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., against Thune and Cornyn. Shortly after Musk\u2019s posts on X, Senate Republicans were flooded with voicemails, emails and even protesters at their hometown offices. Scott ended up losing the vote in the first round, anyway.",
      "For now, Trump\u2019s primary threats against fellow Republicans remain on ice or, at least, only implied. But he has a massive war chest and a long memory, and that won\u2019t always be the case.",
      "\u201cAt the end of year one there\u2019s a scorecard,\u201d the senior administration official said. \u201cWe\u2019ve either achieved everything we need to and people have taken the right votes and are in good graces ... or at the end you\u2019ve made yourself persona non grata.\u201d"

      "That quick response is caused by inflammation \u2014 and it can save your life.",
      "At its core, inflammation is the \u201cresponse of the body to an illness or an injury to try to restore health,\u201d said Dr. Robert Shmerling, a rheumatologist and faculty member at Harvard Medical School who helped author a report on inflammation.",
      "Inflammation has come under fire for its link to a variety of chronic diseases, including diabetes, heart disease and even allergies. Longevity experts even see reducing chronic inflammation as key to healthier aging.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a classic double-edged sword,\u201d said Dr. David Hafler, a neurologist and professor of immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine.",
      "Inflammation is necessary for survival, and without it our bodies wouldn\u2019t be able to fight off intruders like viruses and bacteria. A sore throat, for example, turns red and is painful because the immune system is fighting the infection to prevent it from spreading, which doctors call acute inflammation, said Dr. Moshe Arditi, a pediatrician and director of the infectious and immunological diseases research center at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cLocalized immune response in the acute stage \u2014 to a limited extent \u2014 is all beneficial inflammation,\u201d he said.",
      "The discovery of inflammation dates back centuries to the Roman encyclopedist Aulus Cornelius Celcus, one of the first people to define it. Celcus described the core signs of inflammation in Latin as rubor, tumor, calore, delore. The terms translate to redness, swelling, heat and pain, which still hold true.",
      "At a microscopic level, acute inflammation includes our bodies\u2019 sending fluid, proteins and white blood cells to the sites of infections or injuries, which help fight foreign pathogens and promote healing.",
      "While inflammation can be lifesaving in the short term, there is another type of inflammation, chronic inflammation, that can damage the body over the long term.",
      "What causes chronic inflammation?",
      "Several risk factors make your body more likely to have chronic inflammation \u2014 including obesity, which promotes a low-level inflammatory state throughout the body, tobacco smoking and diet.",
      "Dr. Thaddeus Stappenbeck, chair of inflammation and immunity at the Cleveland Clinic, suspects the modern American diet is a major source of chronic inflammation.",
      "Processed foods, refined sugars, trans fats and excessive consumption of red meat are associated with increased inflammation. The Food and Drug Administration banned trans fats in 2015, and they were finally removed from snacks, bread, cookies and other baked goods in 2018.",
      "\u201cI suspect that there\u2019s more people with underlying, chronic inflammation than there were in the past,\u201d Stappenbeck said. \u00a0\u201cI think about the way we\u2019ve shifted our diet where we eat a lot of chemicals that we are not adapted to consume, and these have a number of effects on our intestines.\u201d",
      "Shmerling said, \u201cLack of exercise, lack of sleep, too much stress, all of those are lifestyle factors associated that are pro-inflammatory.\u201d",
      "What are symptoms of inflammation?",
      "Signs may vary, but they include:",
      "Joint pain that doesn't improve. Fatigue.  ConstipationDepression.",
      "Joint pain that doesn't improve.",
      "Fatigue.",
      "Constipation",
      "Depression.",
      "Weight loss, regular exercise and avoiding highly processed foods can reduce levels of inflammation in the body, Shmerling said. Studies have suggested that following a Mediterranean diet, largely plant-based with an emphasis on whole fruits and vegetables, can reduce levels of inflammation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s often not an on/off kind of switch,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have perfect ways to measure inflammation after making a lifestyle modification, but inflammatory markers can improve with lifestyle changes.\u201d",
      "How chronic inflammation affects the heart",
      "An estimated 129 million people in the United States have at least one chronic disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The prevalence of chronic disease has grown by about 7 million people every five years, according to estimates from Stanford University.",
      "The causes of chronic disease are complicated, but experts are increasingly convinced that inflammation is playing a role.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a fair amount of consensus that a lot of the chronic diseases we see now in higher prevalence than in the past could well be related to chronic inflammation,\u201d Shmerling said.",
      "What comes first \u2014 the inflammation or the disease?\u00a0When the body is in an inflammatory state, it can start to destroy the very things it needs to function, such as our vital organs and blood vessels.",
      "\u201cOngoing inflammation may lead to heart disease and building of plaque in the blood vessels, which can lead to heart attack and strokes,\" said Arditi, of Cedars-Sinai. \u201cLong-term inflammation in your brain may lead to development of neurodegenerative diseases by damaging neurons and interfering with normal brain function.\u201d",
      "Autoimmune disorders like lupus or multiple sclerosis are also linked to chronic inflammation as the immune system starts to attack various parts of the body in friendly fire.",
      "\u201cThe body is not distinguishing properly between itself and an outside intruder or a pathogen,\u201d Shmerling said. \u201cThere\u2019s chronic inflammation that\u2019s ongoing and quite damaging.\u201d",
      "Diseases including Parkinson\u2019s and even diabetes all have inflammatory components to them, Stappenbeck said. Because of inflammation\u2019s close relationship to a host of diseases, he\u2019s not surprised by patients coming in asking to be checked for it.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a desire from patients to say, \u2018Can you actually detect this in me earlier, before I get super sick?\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Is there a test for chronic inflammation?",
      "There are blood tests for inflammation, but they aren\u2019t perfect. They don't provide clear answers about where the inflammation may be lurking in the body.",
      "There can also be false positives. That's why experts say the tests must be interpreted along with symptoms.",
      "One of the most common tests is called the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, a blood test that measures the level of certain proteins that correlate with the amount of inflammation in the body.",
      "Another test assesses c-reactive protein (CRP), a protein the liver produces in response to inflammation.",
      "Because of the limitations, Shmerling doesn't recommend that healthy people with no symptoms be routinely screened for inflammation.",
      "\u201cThere can be normal inflammation tests even when inflammation is present, and sometimes the tests are abnormal even when it doesn\u2019t seem there is any inflammation present,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they\u2019re not perfect.\u201d",
      "Stappenbeck agreed.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a role for it, actually,\u201d he said.",
      "There is some potential for a test called hs-CRP, a more sensitive test that can find smaller increases in c-reactive protein in the blood. High levels of that protein in the blood have been linked to heart attacks and strokes.",
      "Some argue that this test should be done routinely, just like checking cholesterol, to determine who is more at risk of heart attacks and stroke.",
      "The evidence, however, has been mixed, which is why the test isn\u2019t widely performed.",
      "\u201cThere are people who are so low-risk or so high-risk that it\u2019s very unlikely the CRP is going to help you,\u201d Shmerling said. \u201cThere are subsets of people, maybe at moderate risk, where a CRP for cardiac risk could be helpful.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Most of America \u201csprings forward\u201d Sunday for\u00a0daylight saving time\u00a0and losing that hour of sleep can do more than leave you tired and cranky the next day. It also could harm your health.",
      "Darker mornings and more evening light together knock your body clock out of whack \u2014 which means daylight saving time can usher in sleep trouble for weeks or longer. Studies have even found an uptick in heart attacks and strokes right after the March time change.",
      "There are ways to ease the adjustment, including getting more sunshine to help reset your circadian rhythm for healthful sleep.",
      "Daylight saving time begins Sunday at 2 a.m., an hour of sleep vanishing in most of the U.S. The ritual will reverse on Nov. 2 when clocks \u201cfall back\u201d as daylight saving time ends.",
      "Hawaii and most of Arizona don\u2019t make the spring switch, sticking to standard time year-round along with Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Worldwide, dozens of countries also observe daylight saving time, starting and ending at different dates.",
      "Some people try to prepare for daylight saving time\u2019s sleep jolt by going to bed a little earlier two or three nights ahead. With a third of American adults already not getting the recommended seven hours of nightly shuteye, catching up can be difficult.",
      "The brain has a master clock that is set by exposure to sunlight and darkness. This circadian rhythm is a roughly 24-hour cycle that determines when we become sleepy and when we\u2019re more alert. The patterns change with age, one reason that early-to-rise youngsters evolve into hard-to-wake teens.",
      "Morning light resets the rhythm. By evening, levels of a hormone called melatonin begin to surge, triggering drowsiness. Too much light in the evening \u2014 that extra hour from daylight saving time \u2014 delays that surge and the cycle gets out of sync.",
      "Sleep deprivation is linked to heart disease, cognitive decline, obesity and numerous other problems. And that circadian clock affects more than sleep, also influencing things like heart rate, blood pressure, stress hormones and metabolism.",
      "Fatal car crashes temporarily jump the first few days after the spring time change, according to a study of U.S. traffic fatalities. The risk was highest in the morning, and researchers attributed it to sleep deprivation.",
      "Then there\u2019s the cardiac connection. The American Heart Association points to studies that suggest an uptick in heart attacks on the Monday after daylight saving time begins, and in strokes for two days afterward.",
      "Doctors already know that heart attacks, especially severe ones, are a bit more common on Mondays generally \u2014 and in the morning, when blood is more clot-prone.",
      "Researchers don\u2019t know why the time change would add to that Monday connection but it\u2019s possible the abrupt circadian disruption exacerbates factors such as high blood pressure in people already at risk.",
      "Gradually shift bedtimes about 15 or 20 minutes earlier for several nights before the time change, and rise earlier the next morning, too. Go outside for early morning sunshine that first week of daylight saving time, another way to help reset your body\u2019s internal clock. Moving up daily routines, like dinner time or when you exercise, also may help cue your body to start adapting, sleep experts advise.",
      "Afternoon naps and caffeine as well as evening light from phones and other electronic devices can make adjusting to an earlier bedtime even harder.",
      "Every year there\u2019s talk about ending the time change. In December, then-President-elect Donald Trump promised\u00a0to eliminate daylight saving time. For the last several years, a bipartisan bill named the\u00a0Sunshine Protection Act\u00a0to make daylight saving time permanent has stalled in Congress; it has been reintroduced this year.",
      "But that\u2019s the opposite of what some health groups recommend. The American Medical Association and American Academy of Sleep Medicine agree it\u2019s time to do away with time switches but say sticking with standard time year-round aligns better with the sun \u2014 and human biology \u2014 for more consistent sleep."

      "LOS ANGELES\u00a0\u2014 Every morning for 47 years, Gaily Cowart\u2019s mother woke up in her sun-filled bedroom overlooking a lush garden and the San Gabriel Mountains beyond.",
      "That garden and much of her mother\u2019s home are now covered in ash and soot after the Eaton Fire ripped through Altadena on Jan. 7, destroying more than 9,000 residences in the foothill community north of downtown Los Angeles. At least 17 people died, and thousands more were displaced.",
      "Cowart\u2019s childhood house survived the flames but is surrounded by charred homes and razed businesses near what used to be Altadena\u2019s bustling business corridor. The neighborhood off Lake Avenue sustained some of the worst damage in one of two major fires that swept through Los Angeles County in January.",
      "The Eaton and Palisades fires displaced about 150,000 residents, and many remain in rentals and hotel rooms nearly two months later. Survivors whose homes are standing face ballooning smoke remediation and restoration costs, as well as insurance companies that are lowballing payouts even though some offer smoke damage coverage.",
      "NBC News spoke with seven homeowners whose houses survived the fires. Six of them paid for smoke damage coverage through insurance, and one did not have the option through the state\u2019s insurer of last resort.",
      "Still reeling from the destruction, they now face tens of thousands of dollars in costs or more to deep clean and remediate remaining toxins inside their homes. They anticipate being displaced for months as they begin rebuilding.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really tricky being in a home that did not burn down,\u201d Cowart said. \u201cThere\u2019s such a gray area with insurance thinking, \u2018Just wipe everything down and it\u2019ll be back the way it used to be.\u2019 But it\u2019s like, 'No, I\u2019ve got soot and ash that I can see with my eyes.'\u201d",
      "The insurance industry has long been fraught in California, where wildfires are getting bigger and deadlier every year. Major insurance companies have stopped writing new policies or are refusing to renew existing ones to offset skyrocketing costs across much of the state.",
      "Residents were blindsided last year when State Farm, California\u2019s largest insurer, announced it would drop coverage for 72,000 houses and apartments. It blamed costs associated with inflation, catastrophe exposure, reinsurance and regulations for its need to protect its bottom line.",
      "On Friday afternoon, Altadena resident Andrea-Marie Stark emerged from a State Farm information tent frustrated by the lack of progress in getting her remediation estimate approved. Service was scheduled to start Monday on her three-bedroom, two-bathroom ranch-style house facing Eaton Canyon, where the fire was first reported.",
      "But State Farm had not yet approved the estimate, which ranged from $80,000 to $100,000 to pull insulation from the walls, remove harmful particles from all surfaces and replace furniture, clothing and appliances exposed to excessive smoke and ash.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m worried I\u2019m going to lose my place in line,\u201d Stark said of the approval delay. \u201cAnd then I could lose a place to live.\u201d",
      "Stark\u2019s house is one of several that survived the inferno on her block, but its proximity to the flames meant everything inside was coated with a thick layer of soot. Christmas decorations turned gray in the ash, and her clothing has the strong odor of smoke.",
      "A charred smoky smell lingers on Stark's street. A neighboring house has been razed to its foundation, with only the chimney left standing. In the distance, green moss and leaves sprout amid the burned branches and fallen limbs of Eaton Canyon.",
      "Stark and her husband evacuated to a friend\u2019s home the night of the fire after they secured their four rabbits, five chickens, three cats, a dog and a horse in their crates. They have been jumping from friend\u2019s home to friend\u2019s home ever since. They hoped to return to Altadena by mid-March after having booked a smoke remediation company that said it could complete the work quickly.",
      "But State Farm had not responded to her claim for two weeks, and she worried she would need to pay for the remediation herself, plus rent if her appointment had to be rescheduled.",
      "In an emailed statement, State Farm said it is \u201ccommitted to paying what we owe, promptly, courteously, and efficiently.\u201d As of Feb. 26, it has received more than 11,750 fire and auto claims related to the fires and paid nearly $2.2 billion to customers, it said.",
      "To cope with the anxiety associated with surviving a catastrophic event, Stark and her husband started a Monday night support group for residents whose homes are still standing. It is a way for people to speak openly about what few others can understand.",
      "\u201cSafeness is an internal feeling. Safety is external, and they\u2019re both ruptured right now,\u201d said Stark, a trauma-trained counselor. \u201cI don\u2019t want to express this to someone without a home, you know, because I don\u2019t want to disrespect their experience and make them think that I\u2019m not grateful. That\u2019s called survivor\u2019s guilt.\u201d",
      "The smell in Marcie Habell\u2019s Altadena home nauseates her. A remediation company recommended taking it down to the studs to fully restore it. She cannot imagine returning to it right now, let alone sitting on her fabric couch or using any of her towels or linens.",
      "\u201cI can be in my house for less than five minutes,\" said Habell, whose home is one of just two standing on her block. \"It\u2019s insane that it happened, and then on top of it, the way that insurance is behaving just compounds the tragedy.\u201d",
      "She has been quoted upward of $22,000 just for toxicity testing, and she expects rent could run $4,000 to $4,500 a month. That's on top of paying her mortgage if her insurance company does not agree to cover the full cost, she said.",
      "\u201cWe are getting zero guidance from anyone for those of us who happen to have a standing home and are surrounded by the apocalypse,\u201d she said.",
      "Michael Sollner, California's deputy insurance commissioner, said in a statement that \"smoke damage is real and insurance companies must investigate claims properly, not deny them outright or pressure homeowners into accepting less than they are owed.\"",
      "More than 33,710 insurance claims related to the Los Angeles-area fires have been filed, and nearly $7 billion in claims have been paid, according to state Insurance Department.",
      "Cowart is handling her mother\u2019s smoke damage claim from Dallas, where she has been living for more than a decade. She flew to Los Angeles on Jan. 8 to pick up her mother from a friend\u2019s house and took her back to Texas. Cowart\u2019s mother, Faye Howard, has early onset Alzheimer\u2019s and struggles with being in a new place. But Cowart fears her old neighborhood is too toxic to return to.",
      "Initial estimates to remediate the Spanish-style two-bedroom, two-bathroom house started at $55,000. A landscaper bid $3,000 to restore the garden and remove potentially toxic soil. Including furniture removal and buying new clothing, Cowart fears, the cost to fully restore her mother\u2019s home and everything in it could quickly top $100,000. Howard\u2019s Allstate adjuster has not finalized their payout or agreed to pay long-term rent while Howard remains displaced, Cowart said.",
      "\u201cMy mom doesn\u2019t understand why she can\u2019t go home,\u201d Cowart said. \u201cJust on a basic human level, no one has told us what we\u2019re supposed to be doing.\u201d",
      "Allstate was not available for comment Monday.",
      "Rob Rhatt, an insurance analyst for Lending Tree, said it is \u201cfrustrating and not surprising\u201d that insurance companies are slow to handle smoke damage claims. Unlike damage from fires, which is structural and clearly visible, damage caused by invisible smoke does not neatly fall into most categories. It requires professional testing, cleaning and restoration with expensive outside vendors.",
      "Simply put, homes in high wildfire-risk areas are bad for business.",
      "\u201cThese catastrophic losses have really cut into their profitability,\u201d Rhatt said of insurance companies. \u201cIt\u2019s not just cutting into their profitability where they\u2019re making less money, but it\u2019s actually threatening their solvency to the point where they\u2019re losing money insuring homes in California.\u201d",
      "Pacific Palisades resident Ian Hardcastle said he never had the option to fully insure the 2,600-square foot home he shared with his wife and 14-month-old child near Temescal Gateway Park, where the Palisades Fire sparked.",
      "After they bought their house in 2021, he signed up for the California FAIR Plan, which provides coverage for those who cannot obtain insurance from private companies, and hoped any wildfires would stay tucked in the mountains and canyons, as they had historically.",
      "But on Jan. 7, a wind-driven inferno ripped through the state park behind his house and devastated the surrounding neighborhood. His home was overwhelmed with billowing smoke and toxic ash for several days. Hardcastle can stand to be inside for only a few minutes at a time.",
      "His adjuster quoted $1,826 for remediation, but a $5,000 deductible means Hardcastle will receive no payout for work that could cost much more.",
      "\"This, this little plot of land was our special happy place, so we're happy it's still here,\" Hardcastle said Thursday as he toured his property. \"We want to come back, but again, we don't know when that will be.\""

Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, alleges they collectively caused harm to his personal and professional reputation.",

    "story": [
      "California's attorney general on Monday announced the unsealing of an indictment charging 30 detention officers assigned to a Los Angeles-area juvenile hall with child abuse for allegedly allowing and sometimes encouraging so-called gladiator fights among youths.",
      "At the heart of the grand jury indictment is the allegation that officers stood by as children and teenagers at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall engaged in the fights, the attorney general's office said in a statement. The detention center is in Downey, about 13 miles south of downtown Los Angeles.",
      "The office of Attorney General Rob Bonta said there were at least 69 fights in the second half of 2023, with 143 children and teens between 12 and 18 years old involved. Some fights, Bonta's office said, resulted in physical injury.",
      "Officers, Bonta said in the statement, were allegedly \u201coverseeing \u2018gladiator fights\u2019 when they should have intervened.\"",
      "The defendants took advantage of the vulnerability of the victims and their own position of trust, his office said.",
      "\"Let today\u2019s charges be a warning for all those who abuse their power,\" Bonta said. \"The California Department of Justice is watching, and we will hold you accountable.\"",
      "The fights came to the attention of the attorney general and state investigators after video of one of the altercations was \"leaked\" in January 2024, Bonta's office said. Speaking to news media by video, he described the violence.",
      "\u201cThe footage, which was later circulated widely by the media and on social media, shows one youth in the detention center being attacked by a series of other youth who come at him one by one as detention officers stand by watching,\u201d Bonta said in video aired Monday by NBC affiliate\u00a0KCRA of Sacramento. \u201cThe officers look more like referees or audience members at a prize fight, not adults charged with the care and supervision of young people.\u201d",
      "Stacy Ford, president of the L.A. County Deputy Probation Officers Union, AFSCME Local 685, which represents the 30 officers in labor negotiations, said in a statement that the organization \"will do everything in our power\" to support the officers.",
      "\"Every American is innocent until proven guilty,\u201d Ford said. \u201cOur members are entitled to this same presumption of innocence and deserve to be treated with fairness and due process, just as they provide to those in their custody.\"",
      "He said juvenile detention officers are tasked with keeping peace and order among children and teens often accused of violent crimes.",
      "\u201cDespite these challenges, our professional peace officers remain committed to maintaining the highest level of professionalism,\" he said. \"We will continue to advocate for the safety, rights, and integrity of our members.\"",
      "According to the indictment, each of the 30 officers is charged with felony child abuse under a California law aimed at those who enable child endangerment, with those convicted of the charge facing two to six years in state prison.",
      "One of the 30 faces an additional count of misdemeanor battery for allegedly using force and violence against an unnamed subject, according to the document.",
      "Three of the defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit a crime, according to the indictment. It alleges two of them allowed some of the fights, knew beforehand when and where they would happen, and told new detention officers to watch but not report the bouts.",
      "Prosecutors alleged the third joined the other two in allowing some of the fights, one of the which resulted in a broken nose for an unnamed victim.",
      "One of the three told new officers that nine fights on Dec. 22, 2023, in a unit of the juvenile facility, were an example of how the detention employees controlled the children in their care, according to the indictment.",
      "Twenty-two of the defendants were arraigned Monday. The rest will be arraigned April 18, the attorney general's office said.",
      "All the defendants have been placed on unpaid leave, the county's probation department said in a statement. In April 2024, probation chief Guillermo Viera Rosa said officers involved in the alleged abuse captured on video had been removed from duty as he sought investigation from an outside agency.",
      "\u201cWe will not tolerate misconduct like that depicted in the video,\u201d the chief said at the time.",
      "The next month, he said 66 officers had been placed on leave amid an internal investigation. Viera Rosa said he would root out the \"culture of violence, drug use, neglect and sexual misconduct in the nation\u2019s largest probation agency,\" according to a county statement at the time.",
      "Saying the indictment announced on Monday is an example of the need for change in the culture of county probation officers, L.A. County Supervisor Janice Hahn said she would support firing any officers found guilty.",
      "\"The young people in Los Padrinos are not only in our custody, they are in our care,\" she said in a statement.\u00a0\"It is unacceptable that probation officers who were entrusted with this responsibility would use their power to abuse these kids.\""

    "story": [
      "A woman who owned a New York City day care center where a toddler died after ingesting fentanyl has been sentenced to 45 years in prison after pleading guilty to federal drug charges.",
      "Grei Mendez, 37, dropped her head into her crossed arms in anguish as Judge Jed S. Rakoff announced the sentence that triggered sobs among Mendez\u2019s family and the mother whose 22-month-old child, Nicholas Feliz-Dominici, died in September 2023.",
      "Rakoff had previously given the same sentence to Mendez\u2019s husband, Felix Herrera-Garcia, after he pleaded guilty to drug charges and causing bodily harm related to the death. The couple each faced a mandatory minimum of 20 years in prison and a maximum of life for their crimes.",
      "Mendez had pleaded guilty to drug charges including conspiracy to distribute narcotics resulting in death.",
      "Before the sentence was imposed, she apologized to the families of children who attended the Divino Ni\u00f1o day care that she operated out of a Bronx apartment where the couple stored and packaged narcotics.",
      "\u201cI do want all to know it was an accident,\u201d she said through an interpreter. \u201cI am very sorry. I hope that someday I may be forgiven.\u201d",
      "When the poisoning occurred on Sept. 15, 2023, Feliz-Dominici was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he died. Three other children exposed to the fentanyl at the day care survived after medics administered the overdose-reversing drug Narcan.",
      "Police found a brick of fentanyl stored on top of playmats for the children, along with equipment often used to package drugs, as well as packages of fentanyl beneath a trap door in a play area.",
      "Both of Feliz-Dominici\u2019s parents spoke at the sentencing, with the child\u2019s mother saying it was not possible to forgive Mendez and the father describing the lasting pain, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re living, but we\u2019re not alive.\u201d",
      "Rakoff cited the emotions he once felt when his older brother \u201cwas murdered in cold blood,\u201d but he added that the \u201cglory of the law is not to ignore emotions but to put them in broader perspective.\u201d",
      "He said Mendez had chosen to put the welfare of her own children and her husband above the welfare of the families and their children that became customers of her day care business.",
      "In a presentence brief, a defense attorney submitted proof that Mendez had suffered trauma herself as a child. Prosecutors urged a lengthy sentence, saying she ignored \u201cclear warning signs\u201d that the babies were becoming seriously ill and took no action to call for lifesaving medical intervention.",
      "\u201cAnd after tragedy struck, she lied to law enforcement and destroyed evidence in an effort to protect herself and her co-conspirators from their culpability in the death of one baby and poisoning of three others,\u201d they wrote.",
      "In a release, Acting U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky said Mendez put babies as young as 8 months old \u201cin harm\u2019s way as they slept, played and ate in a room where over 11 kilograms of fentanyl was hidden underneath their feet.\u201d"

    "summary": "Opening statements begin Monday in the trial of Robert Crimo III, who is accused of opening fire at a Fourth of July parade in the affluent Chicago suburb of Highland Park.",
    "story": [
      "WAUKEGAN, Ill. \u2014 The trial of the man accused of opening fire at a Fourth of July parade in the affluent Chicago suburb of Highland Park ended almost as quickly as it began Monday when the suspect surprised the courtroom by pleading guilty.",
      "Robert \u201cBobby\u201d E. Crimo III, who faced 69 counts of murder and attempted murder stemming from the July 4, 2022, mass shooting, entered the plea shortly before opening statements were supposed to get underway.",
      "\u201cIs that what you went over with your attorneys?\u201d Lake County Circuit Court Judge Victoria Rossetti asked Crimo to make sure he understood.",
      "\"Yes,\" Crimo replied.",
      "Crimo faces life in prison for killing seven people and wounding nearly 50 more when he is sentenced April 23. Illinois abolished the death penalty in 2011.",
      "Dressed in a black suit, his face tattooed with the number 47 and more tattoos adorning his neck and hands, the 24-year-old suspect made no additional statements before he left the Lake County Courthouse.",
      "Earlier, Crimo's mother Denise Pesina, was called to the bench after one of her son's lawyers announced the change of plea and she yelled out \"There's a court order on this!\"",
      "Rossetti told her if she wanted to stay in the courtroom she would have to sit down and be quiet. Pesina complied and was allowed to remain in the courtroom.",
      "Lake County State\u2019s Attorney Eric Rinehart, in a written statement, said \"This was not a negotiation. This was not a deal.\"",
      "\"He made a free decision to plead guilty to every single count that this trial team and this law enforcement team was about to present to this jury,\u201d  Rinehart wrote. \u201cHe received nothing in exchange for this plea today. We were 1000% ready\u201d to go to trial and present evidence today.",
      "Asked when they found out Crimo was pleading guilty, Rinehart told reporters, \"We learned this morning.\"",
      "Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering said \"we're all just sort of surprised and relieved that they don't have to experience the unbelievable pain of reliving this experience for the next three to five weeks.\u201d",
      "Shooting survivor Ashbey Beasley, who was at the parade with her 6-year-old son but escaped unharmed, said she felt \"relief and shock\" when Crimo pleaded guilty.",
      "\u201cI think we were all just surprised and waiting to see what happened,\" said Beasley, who has since become an anti-gun activist.",
      "Later, the law firms representing dozens of shooting victims released a statement expressing relief that Crimo pleaded guilty and vowing to continue \"civil litigation against this individual and others including Smith & Wesson and the companies that sold the assault weapon that was used in the shooting.\"",
      "Last week, while jury selection was underway, Crimo gave no sign that he was intending to plead guilty.",
      "From time to time, Crimo watched while his defense attorneys, Lake County Public Defender Gregory Ticsay and Assistant Public Defender Anton Trizna, and the prosecutor took turns posing questions to the jury candidates.",
      "But mostly Crimo sat scribbling on a sheet of paper as the pool of jurors was narrowed to the six men and six women picked to serve on the panel.",
      "Before the first juror was seated, prosecutors moved to dismiss an additional 48 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm against Crimo.",
      "Monday, Rinehart said they already had \"a mountain of evidence.\"",
      "\"He attempted to murder every single person that he shot at at that parade,\" he said.",
      "Rinehart got no pushback from the defense team or Rossetti.",
      "Police said Crimo, an aspiring rapper who used the stage name Awake the Rapper and was described by friends as a music-obsessed loner, spent weeks planning the massacre.",
      "On that July Fourth, Crimo climbed up a fire escape to the rooftop of a building above the parade route and, at 10:14 a.m., began raining down bullets onto the spectators below, police said.",
      "Killed in the attack were Stephen Straus, 88; Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78; Eduardo Uvaldo, 69; Katherine Goldstein, 64; Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63; and married couple Kevin McCarthy, 37, and Irina McCarthy, 35.",
      "Dozens more were wounded, the youngest of whom was 8-year-old Cooper Roberts, who was left paralyzed from the waist down when a bullet severed his spinal cord.",
      "Also wounded was 63-year-old John Kezdy, who took a bullet to the elbow. Kezdy worked for the Illinois Attorney General\u2019s Office and had earlier been the lead singer of Chicago\u2019s influential punk rock band The Effigies. He died a year after the attack in a bicycle accident.",
      "Crimo disguised himself by wearing women\u2019s clothing during the rampage, police said.",
      "\u201cFollowing the attack, Crimo exited the roof, dropped his rifle, and he blended in with the crowd and escaped,\u201d Lake County Major Crime Task Force spokesman Chris Covelli said at the time.",
      "Crimo made it home, took his mother\u2019s car and drove north to Madison, Wisconsin, where he considered staging another massacre, police said. He was arrested when he returned to Illinois.",
      "\u201cHe went into details about what he had done,\u201d Rinehart told reporters after the incident. \u201cHe admitted to what he had done. We don\u2019t want to speculate on the motives right now.\u201d",
      "This was just the latest surprise from Crimo.",
      "Last June, Crimo was expected to accept a plea deal but surprised the court by suddenly changing his mind and keeping his not-guilty plea.",
      "In late 2023, Crimo fired his public defenders, saying he would represent himself at trial. The next month, he asked a judge to reinstate his public defender.",
      "Meanwhile, Crimo\u2019s father, Robert Crimo Jr., pleaded guilty to seven felony counts of reckless conduct and was sentenced to 60 days in prison for agreeing to sponsor his then-19-year-old son\u2019s gun license application. He did so even though a relative had reported to police only a few months earlier that Crimo had a collection of knives and had threatened to \u201ckill everyone.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors had turned over some 10,000 pages of evidence along with a videotaped interrogation during which police say Crimo confessed to the mass shooting.",
      "In December, Rossetti declined an attempt by Crimo\u2019s lawyers to throw out statements Crimo made to police when he was arrested. The judge said Crimo willingly gave up his right to remain silent and police did not prevent him from speaking with the lawyer his family had hired to represent him."

      "\u201cCarl Dean, husband of Dolly Parton, passed away March 3rd in Nashville at the age of 82. He will be laid to rest in a private ceremony with immediate family attending. He was survived by his siblings Sandra and Donnie,\" the statement said.",
      "\u201cCarl and I spent many wonderful years together. Words can\u2019t do justice to the love we shared for over 60 years. Thank you for your prayers and sympathy.\u201d",
      "The star asked for privacy for the family as they grieve Dean\u2019s death.",
      "Parton and Dean, a businessman from Nashville, married in 1966 after meeting two years prior and\u00a0mostly kept their relationship out of the public eye.",
      "In a November 2023 interview for her\u00a0Apple Music show, \u201cWhat Would Dolly Do? Radio,\u201d\u00a0Parton opened up about why they kept their relationship so private.",
      "\u201cCarl has never been in the limelight and all, never wanted to be in it. He don\u2019t like it,\u201d Parton explained at the time. \u201cHe went to one thing with me early on when we first married to a BMI Song of the Year (event), and he came out there taking off his tuxedo, his tie and all that and said, \u2018Don\u2019t ever ask me to go to another one of these damn things because I ain\u2019t going.\u2019\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cI never asked him and he never did.\u201d",
      "Parton famously penned one of her biggest songs, \u201cJolene,\u201d which was released in 1973, about a woman flirting with her husband.",
      "Speaking about the inspiration behind the song in an interview with\u00a0NPR in 2008, she said, \u201cShe got this terrible crush on my husband. And he just loved going to the bank because she paid him so much attention. It was kinda like a running joke between us \u2014 when I was saying, \u2018Hell, you\u2019re spending a lot of time at the bank. I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve got that kind of money.\u2019 So it\u2019s really an innocent song all around, but sounds like a dreadful one.\u201d",
      "In May 2016, the longtime couple decided to renew their vows. She told\u00a0Rolling Stone\u00a0that they had an intimate ceremony at their Nashville-area home.",
      "\u201cI got all dressed up in the most beautiful gown you\u2019ve ever seen and dressed that husband of mine up. He looked like a handsome dude out of Hollywood,\u201d she gushed. \u201cWe had a few family and friends around. We didn\u2019t plan anything big at all because we didn\u2019t want any kind of strain, any kind of tension, any kind of commotion, so we planned it cleverly and carefully. We just had a simple little ceremony at our chapel at our place. We just had just a few people who needed to be there to make sure they got the pictures and the few things that we needed.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated threats to dramatically expand tariffs are now a reality. Tariffs of 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada went into effect Tuesday morning, alongside an additional 10% tax on Chinese goods.",
      "It\u2019s a move that affects trillions of dollars in trade and will reshape prices for everything from cars to medication \u2014 while straining relationships with key U.S. trading partners.",
      "Imported goods are a key driver of the American economy, totaling $2.9 trillion in 2024, according to the U.S. Census Bureau \u2014 with China, Canada and Mexico accounting for over 40% of that volume.",
      "It\u2019s these top trading partners that Trump has frequently criticized.",
      "The U.S. has a trade deficit, meaning it imports more goods than it exports. Tariffs could help close that gap by raising the prices of foreign goods and encouraging Americans to purchase domestic alternatives. In some cases, even the threat of tariffs might accomplish some of that by incentivizing manufacturers to move operations elsewhere. However, those operations won\u2019t necessarily be relocated to the United States.",
      "China was long the biggest exporter of goods to America. But its export total began to fall after Trump levied tariffs on the country during his first term, when companies began moving manufacturing from China to Mexico. As a result, Mexico surpassed it for total exports in 2023.",
      "Tariffs often lead to higher costs for consumers, as affected companies pass their new costs along. One economic study concluded that the costs of Trump\u2019s 2018 trade war were \u201cpassed on entirely to U.S. importers and consumers.\u201d A 2019 report from the Federal Reserve concluded the 2018 tariffs led to U.S. job losses and higher consumer prices.",
      "Among all categories of goods, the most-imported in the U.S. are machinery-related products, electronics and automotive products. Canada, China and Mexico account for a meaningful share of these imports, which means consumers could soon see prices ratcheted up on everything from new cars to smartphones to bicycles.",
      "While tariffs will increase the price of consumer goods, Trump has hinted at reducing or eliminating the personal income tax with the new tariff revenue.",
      "If that\u2019s the case, it could ease consumer pain in the face of sky-high mortgages and rising prices on essentials including eggs and milk. However, income taxes make up most of the trillions in revenue the government collected last year.",
      "On the other hand, customs duties, aka tariffs \u2014 while still a significant sum \u2014 represent a slight fraction of national revenue."

      "Gun dealers, lawyers for Mexico say in court papers, often sell the firearms to \"straw purchasers\" whose intent is to traffic the guns across the border. The companies even design certain weapons to appeal to cartel members, including a Colt handgun known as the Super El Jefe, the lawyers say.",

He will begin with a trip to the southern border Wednesday, according to a spokesperson for the vice president. Vance is expected to tour a processing facility in Eagle Pass, Texas, becoming the highest-ranking Trump administration official to visit the border so far during Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Vance played a key role in Friday's combative meeting with Zelenskyy, an unprecedented public confrontation with a U.S. ally that was later cheered by current and former Russian officials. The move was slammed by Democrats, and many Republicans have since doubled down on the administration's criticisms of Zelenskyy.",
      "Sen. Elissa Slotkin, of Michigan, will deliver the Democratic response to the joint address. The president's opposing party typically selects someone considered to be a rising political star to lay out the party's priorities and perspectives on the administration. Slotkin won Michigan's competitive open Senate seat in November, outperforming then-Vice President Kamala Harris in her presidential bid.",
      "Slotkin's speech will lean into her security background as a former CIA analyst, according to a source familiar with her speech, who said her background gives her a unique perspective on the Oval Office confrontation between Trump, Vance and Zelenskyy. The senator will also highlight a proactive economic vision and discuss what Democrats see as the path forward, the source said.",
      "Members of Congress also typically invite guests to presidential joint addresses in an effort to highlight specific issues.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., asked the Democratic caucus to bring guests who \"have suffered under the Trump administration\u2019s policies,\" according to a spokesperson. The spokesperson said that Schumer planned to bring two Medicaid recipients, a child with spinal muscular atrophy, whose survival was credited to a National Institutes of Health program, and two fired federal workers.",
      "Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech in 2020 echoed campaign speeches, touting his economic and migration records just a month before the country ground to a halt because of Covid. At the end of his remarks, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripped up a copy of the president\u2019s speech."

    "published": "Tue, 04 Mar 2025 10:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump\u2019s friendlier approach to dealing with Republican lawmakers is a stark departure from his first term, when he often took his critics to task on social media.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 As President Donald Trump traveled to visit natural disaster areas in North Carolina and California shortly after his inauguration, his team was concerned about a possible political disaster back in Washington. To defuse it would require a type of political dexterity he hadn\u2019t always displayed during his first term.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., had raised concerns about defense secretary nominee Pete Hegseth to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who had communicated them to the White House. Hegseth couldn\u2019t afford to lose Tillis\u2019 vote, and Trump and his political team knew it.",
      "Walking into an Air Force One cabin filled with members of North Carolina\u2019s GOP congressional delegation, Trump mused, \u201cI hear your man Thom might not be with us,\u201d according to a person who heard the remark. Trump then openly speculated, \u201cMaybe someone will primary him. ... Do we have any takers?\u201d",
      "The threat wrapped in a joke was never deployed publicly. Instead, Trump took a different tack. Before the comment, his political team had set up meetings for Tillis with Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance. The behind-the-scenes pressure campaign then culminated with a meeting between Trump and Tillis the day of Hegseth\u2019s confirmation vote.",
      "\u201cWe went into overdrive,\u201d said a senior administration official who was granted anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. \u201cTillis just kept shrinking with each passing hour.\u201d",
      "Tillis ultimately fell in line and supported Hegseth, who squeaked through after Vance cast the tiebreaking vote to secure his confirmation. Notably, Trump never used what was his preferred tool of congressional diplomacy during his first term: a social media scolding.",
      "Trump\u2019s more measured management of his relationships with Republican lawmakers \u2014 in which blow-ups still occur, but over the phone or behind closed doors rather than on social media \u2014 has been a critical difference between his two terms so far, according to eight sources on both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue familiar with the dynamic between Trump and members of Congress.",
      "\u201cHe has stronger relationships on the Hill, so he doesn\u2019t feel the need to be as \u2014 he\u2019s a relationships guy,\u201d a senior White House official said. \u201cNow he has deeper, more personal relationships.\u201d",
      "'He's proven himself to me'",
      "When Trump, a former Democrat, first arrived in Washington in 2017, few congressional Republicans knew him \u2014 or trusted him. And there were Republicans then who were unafraid to break with Trump\u2019s actions or rhetoric, from Sens. John McCain and Bob Corker to Reps. Charlie Dent and Mark Sanford.",
      "Eight years later, Trump is regarded as the most dominant GOP figure in generations, those vocal critics are out of office, and he is deploying a softer touch with the loyalists who remain. Unlike the start of his first term, he knows Republican lawmakers on a first-name basis, passes out his cellphone number to them and frequently hosts them and their spouses at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.",
      "\u201cHe was my fifth choice for president, and I was wondering what we were getting into\u201d in 2016, recalled Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., who endorsed Marco Rubio in that primary campaign. \u201cAnd then I became a convert to support him because of the policies that he had. It\u2019s not what he said; it\u2019s what he did. He\u2019s proven himself to me.\u201d",
      "Wilson then pulled out of his jacket pocket a photo of him with Trump at Mar-a-Lago from a visit in January.",
      "Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., who publicly pushed back against Trump\u2019s stolen election claims in 2020 and endorsed another candidate for president last year, said in an interview last Thursday that Trump \u201cis prepared this time\u201d around.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s had four years to plan his first six months in office. And it has been a very successful first two months for sure,\u201d he said.",
      "Those relationships were tested last week when Trump used his pull with House Republicans to break an impasse over a budget resolution that\u2019s critical to advancing his border security, energy and tax agenda through Congress.",
      "Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., were getting squeezed on both sides \u2014 from GOP moderates fretting about potential Medicaid cuts that could harm their constituents and conservative fiscal hawks furious that the proposed spending cuts weren\u2019t deep enough.",
      "Trump and Johnson began assuaging concerns of the moderates. One, Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., said he spoke to Trump twice last week, including just hours before the vote. Van Drew said that he called Trump and left a message for him last Tuesday and that Trump called him back soon after. Rather than insist that Van Drew vote for the budget blueprint, he recalled, Trump asked him whether he thought the votes were there to pass it. The two talked about protecting Medicaid for low-income Americans, many of whom voted for Trump.",
      "\u201cWaste, fraud and abuse. Yes, we all want to get rid of that. But the issue ... are people that are disabled, people that are in nursing homes, people that are working poor, a lot of all these people are wearing red hats,\u201d Van Drew said. \u201cThey\u2019re the new Republican Party, the populist conservative party. [Trump] understands that.\u201d",
      "But the quartet of conservatives dug in and refused to move off their opposition. During a dramatic standoff on the House floor, Trump began calling three of the remaining conservative holdouts: Reps. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, and Victoria Spartz, R-Ind. The House Republican leadership team is using its \u201cphone a friend lifeline with caution,\u201d said a source involved in discussions, who didn\u2019t want Trump to waste political capital so early in a perilous process.",
      "Trump spent 25 minutes on the phone with Spartz, who walked away from the conversation telling Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., she would still vote against the resolution, according to a person who witnessed the conversations. Trump and Spartz then had a second phone call.",
      "\u201cWe had a productive conversation, and he reassured me that he will back me up when things are important for me and he agrees with me,\u201d Spartz said, adding that Trump recognized strong-arming her would backfire. \u201cPresident Trump is a smart man. He would know better than that, you know, that it would never work, right? ... President Trump was very nice. ... He cares a lot, and he always listens.\u201d",
      "Republicans said Trump\u2019s defter behind-the-scenes approach most likely has to do with his paper-thin majority in the House. The budget resolution passed 217-215 \u2014 a single-vote margin \u2014 and he\u2019ll need nearly every Republican on board again to pass the reconciliation package later this year. Publicly bashing and alienating opponents, lawmakers said, could risk blowing up his entire agenda.",
      "That\u2019s a marked difference from 2017, when House Republicans had a 241-194 majority. That year, 20 House Republicans bucked Trump and voted against a partial repeal of Obamacare. McCain would later kill the package in the Senate.",
      "And that December, a dozen Republicans voted no on a sweeping tax bill that Trump later signed into law.",
      "Trump\u2019s \u201cgot to be real careful, which he is not. There will be problems on the hard right, with pragmatic members and others,\u201d said Dent, the former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania who voted against the Obamacare repeal bill in 2017 and resigned from the House a year later. \u201cNo margin for error.\u201d",
      "'It's like night and day'",
      "Trump also genuinely likes the Republican leaders of both chambers, administration sources say, a dynamic that was absent during his first stint in the Oval Office with Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the former Senate leader and House speaker, respectively.",
      "After the bill to repeal Obamacare collapsed, Trump posted on social media that McConnell, R-Ky., \u201ccouldn\u2019t get it done.\u201d And when McConnell blamed Trump for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Trump called him a \u201cdour, sullen, and unsmiling political hack.\u201d As for Ryan, R-Wis., Trump has called him a \u201cweak and ineffective leader\u201d and a \u201ccurse to the Republican Party.\u201d",
      "Congressional Republicans acknowledge Trump is also generally more accessible to them in his second term, with many in possession of his personal cellphone number.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like night and day from what it was in the first term,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told NBC News.",
      "Cornyn also credited Trump\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d chief of staff, Susie Wiles, who has long-standing relationships with many Republicans on Capitol Hill and can help lawmakers \u201cnavigate\u201d disagreements with Trump.",
      "\u201cShe hears the good, bad and the ugly,\u201d Cornyn said.",
      "Trump also has another tool at his disposal in managing Congress: billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who spent more than a quarter-billion dollars on the 2024 elections.",
      "Musk\u2019s embrace of Trump has been a net positive in his relationship with Congress, a senior administration official said, \u201cand not just by the threat his very existence imposes\u201d \u2014 referring to his ability to spend massive sums of money on an election.",
      "Musk\u2019s penchant for fiery posts on his X platform requires White House management. But he has proven to be a valuable ally for Trump, having recently spent 45 minutes on the phone lobbying a \u201cdifficult\u201d senator on behalf of an administration priority, the senior official said.",
      "\u201cWe just have to be cognizant that if he\u2019s not on the same page, we could risk something being said at any time that sets us back,\u201d the official said.",
      "Still, there are limits to Musk\u2019s influence. During the Republican Senate leadership race last year, in which all votes were private, Musk endorsed Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., against Thune and Cornyn. Shortly after Musk\u2019s posts on X, Senate Republicans were flooded with voicemails, emails and even protesters at their hometown offices. Scott ended up losing the vote in the first round, anyway.",
      "For now, Trump\u2019s primary threats against fellow Republicans remain on ice or, at least, only implied. But he has a massive war chest and a long memory, and that won\u2019t always be the case.",
      "\u201cAt the end of year one there\u2019s a scorecard,\u201d the senior administration official said. \u201cWe\u2019ve either achieved everything we need to and people have taken the right votes and are in good graces ... or at the end you\u2019ve made yourself persona non grata.\u201d"

    "summary": "Despite keeping their relationship out of the limelight, Dolly Parton and her husband Carl Thomas Dean were together for 60 years before his death.",
    "story": [
      "Dolly Parton and her husband, Carl Thomas Dean, were married for nearly 60 years.",
      "While the country music legend has been in the spotlight since the 50s, her relationship with the businessman mostly remained out of the limelight.",
      "On March 3, it was announced on Parton's Instagram that her beloved husband died that same day at the age of 82.",
      "\u201cCarl and I spent many wonderful years together. Words can\u2019t do justice to the love we shared for over 60 years. Thank you for your prayers and sympathy,\u201d she wrote on her Instagram, alongside the announcement of his death.",
      "Dean, who was from Nashville, was a businessman without any industry ties. In a 2023 interview for \"What Would Dolly Do? Radio,\" the singer gave insight into her long-standing private relationship.",
      "\"Carl has never been in the limelight and all, never wanted to be in it. He don\u2019t like it,\" said Parton.",
      "She shared that after one public outing, he knew that life wasn't for him.",
      "\"He went to one thing with me early on when we first married to a BMI Song of the Year (event), and he came out there taking off his tuxedo, his tie and all that and said, 'Don\u2019t ever ask me to go to another one of these damn things because I ain\u2019t going,'\" she said. \"I never asked him and he never did.\"",
      "But despite their different approaches to public life, the two have had a lasting relationship, celebrating 58 years of marriage last year.",
      "Here's a look back at the major events in their relationship, from their first meeting at a laundromat to his support for her music.",
      "Parton and Dean meet in 1964",
      "Many people can live in a city for years before going on a date, but Parton met her husband on her very first day in Nashville. She told the New York Times that she brought a lot of dirty clothes with her, and stopped at the \"Wishy-Washy\" laundromat.",
      "\"After I\u2019d put my clothes in the machine, I started walkin' down the street, just looking at my new home, and this guy hollered at me, and I waved,\" Parton told the New York Times in 1976. \"Bein' from the country, I spoke to everybody. And he came over and, well, it was Carl, my husband.\u201d",
      "In that 1976 interview, Parton had more to say about their first meeting.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go out with him. I mean, that was somethin' we was taught. You gotta know somebody or they may take you on a back road and kill you. But I said, 'You\u2019re welcome to come up to the house tomorrow because I\u2019m baby\u2010sittin\u2019 my little nephew.'\"",
      "She said he came over every day for a week, and they sat on the porch and talked. \"I wouldn\u2019t even take him in the house,\" she said.",
      "But the first day she didn't have to babysit, she said that Dean took her to meet his parents. \"Cause he said he knew right the minute he saw me that that\u2019s the one he wanted.\u201d",
      "A secret 1966 wedding",
      "After dating for about two years, Dean proposed to her and they wed in May of that same year. While preparing for her wedding, the upcoming nuptials caused tension between her and her then-manager, Fred Foster.",
      "\u201cHe asked me not to get married. He said it\u2019ll make it so much harder if you\u2019re married with all this promotion,\" she said in a 2012 interview with Chattanooga, Tennessee, NBC affiliate WRCB.",
      "\u201cMy mother-in-law had already sent out invitations,\u201d Parton said. \u201cIt broke her heart because\u00a0I said we had to call the wedding off.\u201d",
      "But that didn't stop the two from getting married in a more private ceremony the following weekend. Only her mother, Avia Lee Owens, and Pastor Don Duvall and his wife were present at Ringgold Baptist Church where they tied the knot.",
      "Parton writes 'Jolene' in 1973",
      "One of her most famous songs, \"Jolene\" tells the story of a woman begging for Jolene not to \"take her man.\" Parton said this was inspired by a \"flirtation\" that her husband had with a woman working at the local bank.",
      "\u201cShe got this terrible crush on my husband,\u201d Parton told NPR in 2008. \u201cAnd he just loved going to the bank because she paid him so much attention. It was kinda like a running joke between us \u2014 when I was saying, \u2018Hell, you\u2019re spending a lot of time at the bank. I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve got that kind of money.\u2019 So it\u2019s really an innocent song all around, but sounds like a dreadful one.\u201d",
      "Parton gets close with her bandleader in the 1980s",
      "In a 1986 interview with Ladies' Home Journal, republished in her book, \"Dolly on Dolly: Interviews and Encounters with Dolly Parton,\" the country icon spoke about how she had gotten \"wrapped up\" in an \"affair of the heart\" in 1982.",
      "She told the outlet she'd faced the disloyalty of \"a special friend, an affair of the heart, which just about killed me. Oh, I cried an ocean. But I ain\u2019t gonna talk about it anymore,\u201d she said, playfully. \u201cI\u2019ve got to keep some mystery.\u201d",
      "Parton said at the time that she and Dean were not divorcing, reiterating what she has said years earlier.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll just always be together,\" she told People in 1982. \"To him it\u2019s all a joke. There ain\u2019t a man in this world could ever live up to my husband. That\u2019s one of the things that keeps me from going too far.\u201d",
      "In a 1982 interview with Barbara Walters, Parton confirmed that she'd been stuck at home in Tennessee for health issues alongside her husband. She joked that her months at home had \"just about busted\" their relationship.",
      "\"I'm glad to be going,\" she explained. \"He's glad for me to be going and so we're glad to get back to our abnormal.\"",
      "In the Walters interview, Parton added that she and her husband were \u201cflirts\u201d but were faithful \"best I know how.\"",
      "\"I just love people there and ... being a woman away from home, there are these good looking guys that come on to you pretty strong. And every now and then I like to come on pretty strong myself,\" she said. \"But I know that I've got something at home, that I wouldn't threaten or take a chance on losing for anything in the world.\"",
      "Parton says she and Dean are still a team in 1997",
      "In a 1997 interview with Out Magazine in which she promoted her latest collection of dance club remixes, Parton explained that she and her longtime companion, Judy Ogle, was \"just an old maid\" and not her lover.",
      "\"People think because she\u2019s never married that she must be a lesbian, and because we\u2019ve been together, that we must be lovers. But the fact is, I think Judy would rather be called a lesbian than an old maid,\" she quipped. \"If I was gay, I\u2019d certainly never find a finer person than Judy as a mate. I\u2019m as close to her just about as I am with (my) husband.\u201d",
      "She also responded to rumors about her husband being out of the picture.",
      "\"They don\u2019t ... see my husband because he hates being in the limelight. But I see him all the time,\u201d she told the outlet.",
      "Parton added that the secret to her decadeslong marriage is simple.",
      "\"We just make a point to enjoy the stuff we enjoy and stay out of each other\u2019s faces. I don\u2019t get in his s---, and he don\u2019t get in mine. And we get along great.\"",
      "The Out interview, along with many others, were reported in the 2017 book \u201cNot Dumb and Not Blonde: Dolly in Conversation.\u201d The book \u2014\u00a0which cites Parton and Randy Schmidt as authors \u2014 collected and published interviews with Parton dating as far back as 1967.",
      "Parton and Dean renew their vows",
      "In May 2016, Parton and Dean got the wedding they planned years ago, but never got to have. The private affair was held at their Nashville-area home, and she said they \"just had fun with it.\"",
      "\u201cI got all dressed up in the most beautiful gown you\u2019ve ever seen and dressed that husband of mine up. He looked like a handsome dude out of Hollywood,\u201d Parton told Rolling Stone. \u201cWe had a few family and friends around. We didn\u2019t plan anything big at all because we didn\u2019t want any kind of strain, any kind of tension, any kind of commotion, so we planned it cleverly and carefully. We just had a simple little ceremony at our chapel at our place. We just had just a few people who needed to be there to make sure they got the pictures and the few things that we needed.\"",
      "Parton also said that their vow renewal inspired a large portion of her album \"Plain and Simple,\" which was released that August.",
      "Parton surprises Dean with a racy Playboy look for his birthday",
      "In honor of her husband's birthday, Parton donned a throwback look that she knew he would love. In July 2021, she put on a Playboy bunny costume in his honor.",
      "\u201cRemember sometime back I said I\u00a0was going to pose on the cover of Playboy Magazine\u00a0when I was 75? Well, I\u2019m 75 and they don\u2019t have a magazine anymore,\u201d she said in a\u00a0video at the time. \u201cBut my husband always loved the original cover of 'Playboy' so I was trying to think of something to do to make him happy.\u201d",
      "Parton was the first country star to pose for the now-defunct magazine, appearing on the cover in 1978. According to her\u00a0official website, her contract at the time had \u201cvery specific parameters that did not include nudity,\u201d but she still wore the classic bunny suit.",
      "In her 2021 video, she said that she had a new cover made with her fresh outfit and \"the new Dolly.\"",
      "\u201cWell, the\u00a0old\u00a0new Dolly,\u201d she said, good-naturedly. \u201cIn the first one, I was kind of a little butterball in that one. Well, I\u2019m string cheese now.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut he\u2019ll probably think I\u2019m cream cheese,\u201d Parton said with a wink. \u201cI hope!\u201d",
      "Parton releases her 2023 rock album, with Dean's support",
      "The singer recently released her newest album titled \"Rockstar.\" On \"What Would Dolly Do? Radio,\" she spoke more about her husband's reaction to hearing the album.",
      "\"I played him the whole album and he said, which to me was the greatest compliment in the world, he said, 'You know, it\u2019s pretty good,'\" she said. \"That would be like anybody else saying, 'Oh, that\u2019s best I ever heard. That\u2019s just so fantastic.'\"",
      "She said Dean has always been honest with her about his opinions.",
      "\"I had done a couple of things in the past, just some rock things. He said, 'It\u2019s OK. It\u2019s OK,'\" Parton added. \"He\u2019s very honest. We have such a great relationship. I know not to ask him if I don\u2019t want an honest answer.\"",
      "Parton announces Dean's death",
      "On March 3, a statement was shared on Parton's Instagram announcing the death of her husband.",
      "\u201cCarl Dean, husband of Dolly Parton, passed away March 3rd in Nashville at the age of 82. He will be laid to rest in a private ceremony with immediate family attending. He was survived by his siblings Sandra and Donnie,\u201d the statement first reads, followed by a personal message by Parton.",
      "\u201cCarl and I spent many wonderful years together. Words can\u2019t do justice to the love we shared for over 60 years,\u201d the singer wrote. \u201cThank you for your prayers and sympathy.\u201d"

      "Shortly after accepting the best supporting actress Oscar for her work in the film, Salda\u00f1a was whisked away to the Oscars press room to field a few questions.",
      "Backstage, Mexican journalist Cristina Iba\u00f1ez asked Salda\u00f1a to address criticism of \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" from Mexican audiences.",
      "Much has been said about the movie, Iba\u00f1ez said, but \"less has been said about Mexico, which is the heart of it.\"",
      "\"So what would you say about the heart of this movie, but also about the topic, which (has been) really hurtful for us Mexicans?\" Iba\u00f1ez asked the actor.",
      "Salda\u00f1a started by apologizing for any pain the film has caused viewers.",
      "\u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m very, very sorry that you and so many Mexicans felt offended. That was never our intention. We spoke and we came from a place of love and I will stand by that,\u201d she said.",
      "The actor went on to share her own views on the matter \u2014 which is that the movie, while set in Mexico, was not about Mexico.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t share your opinion. For me, the heart of this movie was not Mexico. We weren\u2019t making a film about a country. We were making a film about four women. And these women could have been Russian, could have been Dominican, could have been Black from Detroit, could have been from Israel, could have been from Gaza,\" she noted. \"And these women are still very universal women that are struggling every day, trying to survive systemic oppression and trying to find their most authentic voices. So I will stand by that.\"",
      "Salda\u00f1a ended her statement by welcoming further discussion on the topic.",

      "Since its release in November 2024, \"Emilia Perez\" has won several awards at awards shows like the Golden Globes, Critics Choice Awards, SAG Awards and BAFTAs.",
      "The movie also ignited controversy on multiple fronts, including on matters of Mexican representation.",
      "\u201cEmilia Perez\u201d is set in Mexico, but most of the lead actors aren\u2019t from Mexico. Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, who plays Emilia, is from Spain; Salda\u00f1a is from the U.S. and has Dominican and Puerto Rican ancestry; and Selena Gomez is from the U.S. with Mexican and Italian heritage.",
      "Only supporting cast member Adriana Paz, who plays Emilia\u2019s lover, Epifan\u00eda, is from Mexico. Paz, calling director Audiard a \"genius,\" defended the movie in an interview with\u00a0IndieWire.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve heard people saying it\u2019s offensive to Mexico. I really want to know why, because I didn\u2019t feel that way. And I have questioned some people that I trust, not just as artists but as people, and they don\u2019t feel that way, so I am trying to understand,\u201d Paz said.",
      "Director Audiard told a reporter he \"didn't study much\" about Mexico to make the film, per a translation done by NBC News.",
      "According to the\u00a0Hollywood Reporter, the majority of filming took place on a sound stage in Paris, with five days of exterior shots in Mexico.",
      "The movie also started debate about the depiction of its main character. Gasc\u00f3n plays a cartel leader who undergoes gender reassignment surgery to live freely as Emilia P\u00e9rez, her true identity.",
      "Some viewers argued that \u201cEmilia Perez\u201d misrepresents trans people. LGBTQ+ advocacy group GLAAD described the film as a \u201cstep backward for trans representation,\u201d adding that it \u201crecycles the trans stereotypes, tropes, and clich\u00e9s of the not-so-distant past.\u201d",
      "Gasc\u00f3n defended her \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d character against accusations that the depiction was transphobic.",
      "\u201cThere are some that say, \u2018I want to see LGBTQ or trans characters outdoing what people do in real life,\u2019 but we do bad things too ... I don\u2019t understand the criticism about the representation of portraying Emilia P\u00e9rez this way,\u201d she told\u00a0Vanity Fair\u00a0in January. \u201cThe reality is that the trans experience is not the same for everybody \u2014 my trans experience is different from somebody else\u2019s.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, go and make your own movie,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n also said. \u201cGo create the representation you want to see for your community.\u201d",
      "Then, weeks before the Oscars, Gasc\u00f3n herself was the target of backlash when tweets she posted in 2020 resurfaced containing racist and Islamophobic sentiments. Gasc\u00f3n later issued an apology.",
      "In January 2025, Salda\u00f1a responded to her cast mate's controversy.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still processing everything that has transpired in the last couple of days. It makes me really sad because I don\u2019t support and I don\u2019t have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group,\" she said during a Q&A session for the film, per The Hollywood Reporter."

      "The end of the statement asked for privacy for the family as they grieve Dean\u2019s death.",

      "In a November 2023 interview for her Apple Music show, \u201cWhat Would Dolly Do? Radio,\u201d Parton opened up about why they kept their relationship so private.",
      "\"Carl has never been in the limelight and all, never wanted to be in it. He don\u2019t like it,\" Parton explained at the time. \"He went to one thing with me early on when we first married to a BMI Song of the Year (event), and he came out there taking off his tuxedo, his tie and all that and said, \u2018Don\u2019t ever ask me to go to another one of these damn things because I ain\u2019t going.'\"",
      "She added, \"I never asked him and he never did.\"",

      "Speaking about the inspiration behind the song in an interview with NPR in 2008, she said, \"She got this terrible crush on my husband. And he just loved going to the bank because she paid him so much attention. It was kinda like a running joke between us \u2014 when I was saying, \u2018Hell, you\u2019re spending a lot of time at the bank. I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve got that kind of money.\u2019 So it\u2019s really an innocent song all around, but sounds like a dreadful one.\"",
      "In May 2016, the longtime couple decided to renew their vows. She told Rolling Stone that they had an intimate ceremony at their Nashville-area home.",
      "\"I got all dressed up in the most beautiful gown you\u2019ve ever seen and dressed that husband of mine up. He looked like a handsome dude out of Hollywood,\" she gushed. \"We had a few family and friends around. We didn\u2019t plan anything big at all because we didn\u2019t want any kind of strain, any kind of tension, any kind of commotion, so we planned it cleverly and carefully. We just had a simple little ceremony at our chapel at our place. We just had just a few people who needed to be there to make sure they got the pictures and the few things that we needed.\""

    "story": [
      "For more than 20 years, John Cena established himself as one of WWE\u2019s ultimate good guys \u2014 a 16-time world champion who preached hustle, loyalty and respect.",
      "That\u2019s why it was so shocking when Cena did something so disrespectful at WWE\u2019s Elimination Chamber event in Toronto on Saturday, March 1.",
      "Moments after he won the men\u2019s Elimination Chamber match to earn the opportunity to face Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 41 in Las Vegas in April, Rhodes joined him in the ring. Rhodes wasn\u2019t there just to congratulate Cena \u2014 he was also there to respond to Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson\u2019s demand that Rhodes sell his soul to him. (If that sounds unusual to you, well, just know that it\u2019s not strange in the world of professional wrestling.)",
      "The Rock emerged from backstage, with rapper Travis Scott, asking Rhodes for his answer. Rhodes declined using colorful language, and Cena celebrated behind him. Cena then hugged Rhodes, but as they embraced, his smile transformed into a more sinister expression. He looked at The Rock, who made a throat-slashing gesture. That was Cena\u2019s cue to kick Rhodes in the groin, to the utter shock of the live crowd. He then proceeded to hit Rhodes with objects including Rhodes\u2019 championship belt.",
      "In short, Cena turned heel \u2014 a wrestling phrase that indicates a good guy became a bad guy.",
      "It\u2019s been the talk of wrestling fans since the event, with some comparing the moment to the time another wrestling hero, Hulk Hogan, famously turned heel in the 1990s.",
      "\u201cCena\u2019s face muscles going into heel mode is one of the coldest faces I\u2019ve ever seen. Top tier,\u201d wrote one fan in the comments of a YouTube video WWE posted of the heel turn.",
      "\u201cThis is genuinely one of the most insane moments in the history of this company,\u201d wrote another.",
      "A number of fans capitalized on Cena's support of Make-a-Wish while sharing their reactions to the big move. \u201cCena starts Break-A-Wish Foundation,\u201d one of the YouTube comments quipped.",
      "Cena himself chose not to address his attack on Rhodes at a post-event press conference, staying in character as he literally dropped a mic and walked away.",
      "What does it mean for a wrestler to turn heel?",
      "In simple terms, a wrestler turning heel means he became a villain in the storyline. Some wrestlers switch back and forth between depicting a good guy and a bad guy over the course of their careers. Cena\u2019s heel turn was so unusual and so unexpected because he\u2019s been a good guy for the vast majority of his time with WWE. (In the early days of his WWE career, his character was a villainous rapper who would tear down opponents with his rhymes.)",
      "Another reason the heel turn is so newsworthy is that Cena is currently in the midst of a retirement tour with WWE. Instead of facing Rhodes at WrestleMania in a matchup of babyfaces (the wrestling term for a good guy), it now appears he\u2019ll enter WWE\u2019s biggest event of the year as one of the company\u2019s top heels."

      "Throughout the \u201cWicked\u201d press tour and award season, Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo have been sticking consistently to their characters\u2019 signature colors \u2014 Glinda\u2019s pink and Elphaba\u2019s green, respectively.",
      "Looking ahead to the Oscars, where \u201cWicked\u201d was up for 10 awards, fans guessed at what the duo might wear to the red carpet \u2014 and at least two got it right.",

      "Writer and actor Christian Weissmann also tweeted his guess on Feb. 1. \u201cNeed ariana grande to wear this to the oscars or else,\u201d he said, along with a picture of the same Schiaparelli gown.",

      "\u201cKnowing the Oscars is the most formal of awards shows and that it was such a big deal for Ariana, I knew this look had to be special,\u201d she told TODAY.com over email. After following Grande\u2019s entire \u201cWicked\u201d awards show circuit, Bonadies said the Schiaparelli dress fit into the pattern.",
      "\u201cAriana has been wearing tons of muted, neutral tones lately, and the majority of her dresses are strapless tops with full skirts,\u201d Bonadies said.",
      "Bonadies had observed the evolution of Grande\u2019s looks from the \u201cWicked\u201d press tour in November into awards season in 2025, noticing she and her stylist Mimi Cuttrell used different color palettes for different situations.",
      "Bonadies said that for \u201cWicked\u201d-centric events, like the premiere, Grande opted to lean \u201cmuch further into her Glinda character \u2014 wearing more pinks and sparkles.\u201d",
      "During awards shows, where Grande was being individually recognized as an artist, she leaned more into her own personal styles, which Bonadies called \u201cless obviously Glinda-inspired but still aligned.\u201d",
      "\u201cI thought this Oscars look was the perfect finale to the press tour part one \u2014 it had all the elements that made both Ariana as an actress and as her character shine,\u201d she said.",
      "Grande has worn Schiaparelli multiple times, so this particular dress felt like a \u201cmatch made in heaven.\u201d",
      "When Bonadies realized she got her prediction about Grande\u2019s dress right, she said she \u201cfelt so excited.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was watching the carpet with my husband and two best friends and literally screamed \u2014 sorry to our apartment neighbors! I felt really proud of myself for nailing it, but I also felt so excited for Ariana and Mimi knowing she\u2019d easily be the best dressed of the evening,\u201d she said.",

      "The Vatican said the pope\u2019s episodes were caused by \u201ca significant accumulation of endobronchial mucus and resulting bronchospasm.\u201d",
      "Two bronchoscopies \u2014 when doctors use a bronchoscope to examine the windpipe and the lungs \u2014\u00a0were performed. By the afternoon, he was given noninvasive mechanical ventilation.",
      "The Vatican said that Francis remained alert and oriented throughout treatment and that his prognosis \u201cremains reserved.\u201d",
      "The pope had a good night's rest Sunday evening. Earlier Monday, he was described as stable and off mechanical ventilation, and he showed no sign of new infection after he suffered a respiratory crisis late last week.",
      "He has been hospitalized since Feb. 14 at Rome's Gemelli Hospital.",
      "Francis had spent all Sunday without using the noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask that pumps oxygen into his lungs, which he had to use after Friday\u2019s coughing episode. Francis did continue to receive high-flow supplemental oxygen through a nasal tube.",
      "Friday\u2019s respiratory crisis sparked\u00a0fears of a new lung infection\u00a0because Francis inhaled some vomit. Doctors aspirated it and said they needed 24 to 48 hours to determine whether any new infection had taken hold.",
      "On Sunday evening, they said Francis remained stable, with no fever or signs of an infection, indicating he had overcome the crisis. His prognosis remained guarded, however, meaning he wasn\u2019t out of danger.",
      "Francis also received a visit Sunday from the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and his chief of staff, Archbishop Edgar Pe\u00f1a Parra, with whom he meets at least weekly when he is at the Vatican. The content of their talks wasn\u2019t known.,",
      "He again skipped his weekly noon blessing to avoid even a brief public appearance from the hospital. Instead, the Vatican distributed a message written by the pope from the 10th floor in which he thanked his doctors for their care and well-wishers for their prayers and prayed again for peace in Ukraine and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cFrom here, war appears even more absurd,\u201d Francis said in the message, which he drafted in recent days. Francis said he was living his hospitalization as an experience of profound solidarity with people who are sick and suffering everywhere.",
      "\u201cI feel in my heart the \u2018blessing\u2019 that is hidden within frailty, because it is precisely in these moments that we learn even more to trust in the Lord,\u201d Francis said in the text. \u201cAt the same time, I thank God for giving me the opportunity to share in body and spirit the condition of so many sick and suffering people.\u201d",
      "Francis, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, was admitted to Gemelli on Feb. 14 after his bronchitis worsened and turned into a complex pneumonia in both lungs.",
      "On Sunday night at the Vatican, Cardinal Konrad Krajewski presided over the evening rosary prayer in St. Peter\u2019s Square.",
      "\u201cLet us pray together with the entire church for the health of the Holy Father Francis,\u201d said Krajewski, who is the pope\u2019s personal Almoner, a centuries-old job of handing out alms. Francis has elevated the job to make it an extension of his personal charity.",

      "Starmer, who met with Trump at the White House on Thursday to discuss efforts at ending the Russia-Ukraine war and a possible trade deal with the U.S., said in an interview with NBC News that economic ties between Washington and Kyiv could be considered a form of security.",
      "\u201cI can see the value in the approach in relation to minerals,\u201d Starmer said in the interview. \u201cThat\u2019s a matter between President Trump and President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy. But I can see very clearly the argument that President Trump makes in relation to minerals, and I can also see the validity of his points when he says that if there is a deal on minerals then the U.S. has economic interests in Ukraine, which, if you like, form at least one element of any security guarantee.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cThat, in its own right, is an important aspect.\u201d",
      "Trump has been vocal about his interest in settling the yearslong conflict in Ukraine and talked about compensation for the billions of dollars in aid that Washington has provided Ukraine since Russia's invasion in February 2022. But he has shied away from committing to any security guarantees, saying this week that he would ask Europe to take the lead on that.",
      "Earlier in the day, Trump warned that if a peace deal \u201cdoesn\u2019t happen quickly, it may not happen at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody wants peace, everybody wants bloodshed to end. Not least the Ukrainians,\u201d Starmer told NBC News, adding that discussions were already underway on what security would look like.",
      "Asked if Britain can achieve its objectives without U.S. participation, Starmer responded that \u201cthe first thing is to get the European element in place.\u201d",

      "\u201cMy concern is that we know, historically, that Putin might go again,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cHe has ambitions in relation to Ukraine. And therefore, if there\u2019s to be a deal, it has got to be a deal that lasts.\u201d",
      "The Starmer-Trump meeting comes at a sensitive time for the United Kingdom as the prime minister commits to sending British troops to Ukraine to help secure a \u201clasting peace\u201d if a peace deal with Russia is reached.\u201cThe stakes, they couldn\u2019t be higher,\u201d Starmer said during a joint news conference with Trump at the White House. He said it was essential that Ukraine be \u201cbacked by strength that will stop Putin coming back for more.\u201d",
      "Starmer, standing beside Trump, insisted that any deal should put to rest Russian ambitions and committed to putting \u201cboots on the ground and planes in the sky\u201d to limit future incursions into Ukrainian territory.",
      "Trump offered praise to Starmer, greeting him warmly at several junctures throughout the day. The two leaders held a bilateral meeting and continued their discussions on Ukraine and a possible trade deal over lunch, Trump said during the news conference.",
      "Starmer is a \u201cspecial man,\u201d Trump said, adding that they \u201cget along famously.\u201d",
      "The meeting came a day before the president is scheduled to meet with Zelenskyy in Washington, as Trump hopes the U.S and Ukraine can sign an agreement on rare mineral rights.",

      "In less than two weeks, President Donald Trump has upended America\u2019s\u00a0long-standing\u00a0role in the world.",
      "At the United Nations on Monday, in the same hall where U.S. diplomats for decades confronted their Russian counterparts on behalf of the \u201cfree world,\u201d Washington\u2019s envoy joined\u00a0Moscow\u00a0in voting against a resolution condemning\u00a0Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "The vote followed a week\u00a0in which\u00a0Trump seemed to side with Russia against Ukraine, announcing plans to negotiate a peace deal without Ukraine at the table, and blaming Kyiv for starting the war that Russian\u00a0President Vladimir Putin\u00a0launched with a full-scale invasion three years ago.",
      "Governments in Europe and democracies around the world are treating Trump\u2019s actions and statements not as provocative posturing, but as an earthquake.",
      "\u201cThis administration\u2019s policies are a fundamental shift,\u201d said James Bindenagel, a former senior U.S. diplomat who served for years in Germany.",
      "After Trump\u2019s\u00a0move toward\u00a0Russia, threats of tariffs against\u00a0NATO allies and talk of acquiring Greenland, European and other democratic governments are adjusting to the reality that the U.S. can no longer be considered a trusted ally, current and former Western diplomats told NBC News.",
      "An opportunity for China",
      "With American\u00a0reliability in doubt, some European\u00a0nations and other countries may seek alternative partners and markets, possibly in China, Bindenagel said.",
      "\u201cThe loss of trust in America creates a vacuum, and that vacuum is likely to be filled by cooperation between Moscow, Beijing, Pyongyang and Iran,\u201d said Bindenagel, professor emeritus at the University of Bonn.",
      "Trump\u2019s shift away from Europe creates\u00a0an\u00a0opportunity for Beijing\u00a0to try to draw Europe further into its orbit, he said,\u00a0adding, \u201cChina is the real winner here.\u201d",
      "If the Trump administration continues to antagonize its partners and question its alliances, there is a risk that China \u2014 as well as Russia\u2014\u00a0could expand their spheres of influence in the Asia-Pacific region, Africa and Eastern Europe, experts said.\u00a0In Asia, stunned officials in countries aligned with the United States are grappling with the implications of the apparent about-face in Washington, said Michael Green, chief executive officer of the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.",
      "\u201cIt is no exaggeration to say that this deeply unnerved even our closest allies in Asia,\u201d said Green, who served on the White House National Security Council under President George W. Bush.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s aggressive dismantling of the U.S. agency overseeing foreign aid has had ripple effects abroad, according to Green. U.S. embassies are hampered by the chaos in Washington and funding for democracy programs has dried up, a potential boon for China, he said.",
      "\u201cSenior officials in Japan, Australia, Indonesia and Thailand have told me that China is swooping in, offering to replace the United States as the partner of choice,\u201d Green said.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s treatment of Ukraine has raised fears among Asian allies that Washington may not come to the aid of Taiwan if China seeks to seize control of the island by force or coercion, former U.S. officials said.",
      "Before French President Emmanuel Macron met with Trump in Washington on Monday, Macron said: \u201cHow can you, then, be credible in the face of China if you\u2019re weak in the face of Putin?\u201d",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said that if America were to scale back military assistance for Ukraine, it would allow the U.S. to focus its resources on the Asia-Pacific region.",
      "The image that America has long tried to present to the world, as a champion of democratic rule and a counterweight to autocracy, also seemed to be radically altered. Singaporean Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen said last week that America had once been seen as a force for \u201cmoral legitimacy\u201d and was now looking like \u201ca landlord seeking rent.\u201d",
      "Pushing allies?",
      "The Trump administration and its supporters say the president is merely pushing allies to pay a bigger share of their own defense needs, recalibrating trade relationships and working to bring an end to the war in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s America First approach to diplomacy prioritizes what\u2019s in the best interest of the United States,\u201d said Brian Hughes, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration will continue to engage our allies and partners to improve burden-sharing measures for defense spending, rebalancing trade deficits and ensuring global adversaries do not take advantage of America as they did under Biden,\u201d Hughes added.",
      "But for Europe, there is now a grim determination to prepare for a future without America at its side.",
      "Friedrich Merz, the presumptive next chancellor of Germany after the country\u2019s parliamentary elections Sunday, said it was unclear if the NATO alliance would survive.",
      "\u201cAfter Donald Trump\u2019s statements in the last week, it is clear that the Americans are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe,\u201d Merz, the leader of the center-right CDU/CSU alliance, said on German television.",
      "Members of NATO and the European Union currently lack the military strength, economic unity and political will to be able to secure peace in Ukraine and fill the void currently filled by the U.S., Bindenagel and other former officials said.",
      "\u201cRussia is not an all-powerful adversary with an economy the size of Italy\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is simply far more determined than we are, which amplifies its limited potential tremendously.\u201d",
      "Nile Gardiner, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation think tank, which strongly supports the president\u2019s agenda, said that despite the friction with European governments, Trump will likely bolster the NATO alliance with his policies and possibly end a war that threatens to destabilize Europe.",
      "European countries, including the United Kingdom, recently announced further increases in defense spending, which Gardiner said was a response to Trump\u2019s demands for NATO allies to take more responsibility for the continent\u2019s defense.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re already seeing the Trump effect across Europe, and I think that Trump\u2019s goal is to leave NATO in far, far stronger shape four years from now, than when he inherited it,\u201d he said.",
      "But a flawed peace agreement that fails to provide sufficient security guarantees for Ukraine against future Russian attacks could embolden Putin and produce even greater dangers for Europe, said Timothy Sayle, author of \"Enduring Alliance: A History of NATO and the Postwar Global Order.\"",
      "\u201cWhat might feel like peace in the short term could be laying the conditions for a broader war in the future,\u201d said Sayle, an associate professor of history at the University of Toronto.",
      "If Russia is allowed to retain the territory it has seized in Ukraine, a peace deal could provide Moscow with a platform to stage further incursions or covert operations against other European countries nearby, including the Baltic states, he said.",
      "In a speech at Monday\u2019s U.N. session on Ukraine, Polish Foreign Minister Rados\u0142aw Sikorski said that ending the war \u201cat any cost\u201d by appeasing Russia would be a fatal error.",
      "Such a move would only invite further aggression, he said. \u201cIf Ukraine is abandoned today, who will be next?\u201d"

      "Children as young as 1 are being raped and sexually assaulted by armed forces in Sudan, where a bitter civil war has been raging for almost two years, according to a new report by the United Nations children\u2019s agency.",
      "The first comprehensive account illustrating how mass sexual violence is being wielded as a weapon of war against children inside the northeast African nation found that more than 200 children had been raped since the start of last year, although the authors stressed that this was only a small fraction of the total number of cases.",

      "Four 1-year-olds were among those who survived the assaults and another 16 survivors were children under the age of 5, the report said. Of the reported 221 cases of child rape, 66% of the victims were girls, while 33% were boys, it added.",
      "The number of violations recorded against Sudanese children was 16% higher in 2024 than in 2023, which had already seen an increase of 473% from 2022 when the war broke out, the report said.",
      "The report contained distressing details that highlighted the gravity of the situation on the ground.",
      "\u201cAfter nine at night, someone opens the door, carrying a whip, selects one of the girls, and takes her to another room. I could hear the little girl crying and screaming. They were raping her,\u201d read one testimony by Omnia, an adult female survivor who was held by armed men in a room with other women and girls.",
      "Nearly two years of war between Sudan's armed forces controlled by the country\u2019s top commander and de facto ruler,\u00a0Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, led by his former deputy,\u00a0Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, have left more than 30 million people \u2014 or more than half of the population \u2014 in need of humanitarian assistance.",
      "Once allies, both men were part of the military establishment that seized power following the collapse of the Western-backed government of Prime Minister\u00a0Abdalla Hamdok\u00a0in 2021.",
      "But although they agreed to rule together, their alliance broke down over how to manage the transition to a civilian government. With neither willing to cede power, war broke out in April 2023.",
      "More than 12 million people have been displaced and tens of thousands of people have been reportedly killed, according to the U.N.",
      "While both sides have been accused of extensive human rights violations, a U.N. fact-finding mission in October found that the RSF was responsible for committing sexual violence on a large scale in areas under its control, including gang rapes, abductions and sexual slavery.",
      "In January, the United States determined that the RSF had committed genocide in areas under its control.",
      "UNICEF, which has been providing safe spaces for children through emergency response rooms set up by local activists, said in the report that the outcome of sexual crimes against children was \u201cdevastating\u201d due to the fact that victims have \u201cfew places to turn to for medical help.\u201d",
      "Women and girls are fleeing their homes and families to other cities where they end up becoming internally displaced and continue to face high risk of sexual violence, the report added.",
      "\u201cWidespread sexual violence in Sudan has instilled terror in people, especially children,\u201d Russell said, calling on all parties to the conflict to put an end to the violations.",
      "\u201cThese scars of war are immeasurable and long-lasting,\u201d she added."

      "A 25% U.S. tariff on almost all goods imported from Canada and Mexico took effect Tuesday just after midnight, along with an additional 10% tariff on goods from China. The three countries together accounted for\u00a0more than 40% of total U.S. imports last year and are also the top three U.S. export markets.",
      "China will impose additional tariffs of up to 15% on some U.S. goods, its government said, while Canada vowed tariffs of up to 25%. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum is expected to announce her response at a news conference in Mexico City on Tuesday morning, the country\u2019s economy ministry said.",
      "The new Chinese levies, which take effect on March 10, include a 15% tariff on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton and a 10% tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, fruits, vegetables, and dairy and fish products. Chinese state media had reported earlier that U.S. agricultural products would be targeted.",
      "China says the U.S. tariffs undermine cooperation between the world\u2019s two largest economies and they hurt American businesses and consumers, as well as international trade.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese people have never believed in coercion or intimidation, nor do we succumb to bullying and hegemonic tactics,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cPressure, threats and coercion are not the right way to engage with China. If the U.S. attempts to exert extreme pressure on China, it is simply targeting the wrong country and miscalculating its moves.\u201dLin also said China had \u201ctaken strong measures\u201d to help stem the international flow of fentanyl, which Trump has cited as justification for the tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, and that the U.S. was using fentanyl as an excuse to wage a trade war.",
      "In addition to the new tariffs, China added 10 U.S. companies to its \u201cunreliable entity\u201d list and 15 to its export control list, mostly defense and intelligence firms with little exposure to the Chinese economy.",
      "Beijing is also filing a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization over the new 10% tariff, as it did in response to a previous 10% tariff that President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese goods starting Feb. 4.",
      "The combined 20% U.S. tariff on Chinese goods comes on top of tariffs Trump imposed during his first term that were maintained and in some cases sharply increased by former President Joe Biden.",
      "Canada said it would move ahead with an earlier plan to impose 25% tariffs on 155\u00a0billion Canadian dollars ($107 billion) in American goods if the U.S. tariff took effect as scheduled.",
      "Tariffs on $20.7 billion worth of goods will take effect immediately, while tariffs on the remaining $86.3 billion in U.S. products will begin in 21 days, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement late Monday.

      "\u201cBecause of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cTariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term.\u201d",
      "Trump, who had been threatening tariffs against Canada and Mexico since November, had accused them of failing to stem the international flow of fentanyl and other illicit drugs.",
      "While precursor chemicals for fentanyl are known to be shipped from China to Mexico, where they are processed into the deadly opioid which is then smuggled into the U.S., Canada says it has virtually no role in the international flow of fentanyl.",
      "According to U.S. customs data, only 0.2% of the more than 20,000 pounds of fentanyl seized at the U.S. border in the 2024 fiscal year came from Canada.",
      "Trudeau said Canada had nonetheless stepped up its drug enforcement efforts, resulting in fentanyl seizures from Canada dropping a further 97% from December to January, to 0.03 pounds.",
      "The tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which Trump issued in an executive order he signed on Feb. 1, had been put on hold for 30 days after the leaders of both countries announced moves to tighten border security. They also include a 10% tariff on Canadian energy imports.",
      "U.S. stocks tumbled Monday after Trump said the tariffs on Canada and Mexico would go ahead as planned, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 650 points, or 1.48%, and the S&P 500 dropping 1.76% for its worst day so far this year.",
      "In Asia, Japan led declines in markets around the region with stocks falling almost 2%, CNBC reported. Stocks in mainland China and Hong Kong were muted.",

      "Though China spared U.S. agriculture in its response to the first 10% tariff, \u201cTrump\u2019s impatient tariff offensive may be changing the calculus\u201d and the U.S. farming sector \u201cshould start to feel the pinch,\u201d said Tianchen Xu, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing.",

      "In Canada, meanwhile, retaliation against U.S. tariffs could also extend to its individual provinces. Ontario Premier Doug Ford told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press NOW\u201d on Monday that Canada would \u201crespond like they\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry to the American people that your president has decided to do this,\u201d Ford said. \u201cI apologize, but he\u2019s giving us no choice.\u201d"

    "summary": "The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened high-profile provocations in response to the arrival of a U.S. aircraft carrier in South Korea and other U.S. military activities.",
    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened Tuesday to launch high-profile provocations in response to the arrival of a U.S. aircraft carrier in South Korea and other U.S. military activities, which she slammed as \u201cconfrontation hysteria of the U.S. and its stooges.\u201d",
      "The warning by Kim Yo Jong implies that North Korea will most likely ramp up weapons testing activities and maintain its confrontational posture against the U.S., though President Donald Trump has said he would reach out to Kim Jong Un to revive diplomacy.",
      "In a statement carried by state media, Kim Yo Jong accused the U.S. of clearly showing \u201cits most hostile and confrontational will\u201d to North Korea with the deployments of the USS Carl Vinson and other powerful U.S. military assets and U.S.-South Korean military drills this year.",
      "\u201cThe DPRK is also planning to carefully examine the option for increasing the actions threatening the security of the enemy at the strategic level to cope with the fact that the deployment of U.S. strategic assets in the Korean Peninsula has become a vicious habit and adversely affects the security of the DPRK,\u201d she said, using the acronym of North Korea\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.",
      "Her statement suggests North Korea may test-launch powerful missiles designed to strike the mainland U.S. or American military bases in the region, observers say.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry warned later that it was ready to repel any provocations by North Korea based on a solid military alliance with the U.S. A ministry statement called Kim Yo Jong\u2019s warning \u201csophistry\u201d meant to justify her country\u2019s nuclear development and future provocations.On Sunday, the USS Carl Vinson and its strike group arrived in South Korea, the latest temporary deployment of a U.S. strategic asset aimed at displaying the firmness of the U.S.-South Korean military alliance in the face of North Korean threats and strengthening interoperability of the allies\u2019 combined assets. The U.S. carrier\u2019s arrival came four days after North Korea conducted cruise missile tests, its fourth missile launch event this year.",
      "North Korea views arrivals of such powerful U.S. military assets in South Korea as major security threats and often responds with missile tests.",
      "North Korea has not directly responded to Trump\u2019s overture, but alleged U.S.-led hostilities against North Korea have intensified since the start of Trump\u2019s second term in January.",
      "Experts say Kim Jong Un is not likely to embrace Trump\u2019s outreach anytime soon as he is now focusing on his support of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine with supply of weapons and troops. They say Kim could consider returning to diplomacy with Trump when he thinks he cannot maintain his country\u2019s current booming cooperation with Russia.",
      "Kim and Trump met three times from 2018 to 2019 during Trump\u2019s first term to discuss the future of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. Their high-stakes diplomacy eventually collapsed due to wrangling over U.S.-led economic sanctions on North Korea."

      "President Donald Trump has said Ukraine \u2014 not Russia \u2014 started the war. He\u2019s called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u2014 not Vladimir Putin \u2014 a dictator. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s administration is standing down on a suite of tough anti-Kremlin policies.",
      "In just over a month, Trump has executed a startling realignment of American foreign policy, effectively throwing U.S. support behind Moscow and rejecting the tight alliance with Kyiv cultivated by former President Joe Biden.",
      "The extraordinary pivot has upended decades of hawkish foreign policy toward Russia that provided a rare area of bipartisan consensus in an increasingly divided nation. Trump\u2019s recent moves have drawn international attention, unsettling U.S. allies in Europe and thrilling conservative populists who favor a turn away from Zelenskyy.",
      "The new posture was put in stark relief on Friday during a tense Oval Office meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy. The leaders clashed in front of the press, raising questions about the future of American support for Kyiv, more than three years after Russia opened the largest conflict in Europe since World War II.",
      "U.S. officials have made a series of policy changes in recent weeks that seem to herald a more cooperative stance with Russia:",
      "The White House ordered a pause on military aid to Ukraine\u00a0as the administration carries out a review, a\u00a0White House official and a U.S. official told NBC News on Monday.Late last week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the U.S. Cyber Command to cease offensive cyber operations and information operations against Russia, a U.S. official familiar with the matter told NBC News. It\u2019s unclear how long the order will last.Attorney General Pam Bondi, on her first day in office, disbanded efforts to seize the assets of Russian oligarchs, breaking up Biden-era programs known as Task Force Klepto Capture and the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative.In a separate directive, Bondi ordered a halt to a federal law enforcement initiative to combat secret influence campaigns by Russia, China and other traditional U.S. adversaries that attempt to sow division in U.S. politics.Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other top Trump administration officials traveled to Saudi Arabia last month to start peace negotiations with Russia \u2014 but Zelenskyy said Ukrainian officials hadn\u2019t been invited.",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other top Trump administration officials traveled to Saudi Arabia last month to start peace negotiations with Russia \u2014 but Zelenskyy said Ukrainian officials hadn\u2019t been invited.",
      "Trump has long professed a desire to reset and improve relations with Russia. He has repeatedly said he believes it is in the national interest to \u201cget along\u201d with Moscow and cast doubt on the value of core parts of the post-World War II global security architecture, including NATO and the European Union. Trump\u2019s first term was shadowed by former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation \u2014 a probe that Trump has repeatedly dismissed as the \u201cRussia hoax.\u201d",
      "Trump has pushed back on Democrats and other critics who have accused him of deferring to Russia.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not aligned with Putin. I\u2019m not aligned with anybody. I\u2019m aligned with the United States of America, and for the good of the world, I\u2019m aligned with the world, and I want to get this thing over with,\" Trump said Friday from the Oval Office, referring to the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "But the U.S. government now appears to be pivoting away from Kyiv. In the weeks since his inauguration, Trump has suggested Ukraine was responsible for Russia\u2019s invasion and \u201cstarted\u201d the war, echoing familiar talking points from the Kremlin.",
      "The president's relationship with Zelenskyy has long been fraught, partly owing to a July 2019 phone call in which Trump pressured the Ukrainian leader to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter over the latter's position on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. After the call leaked, it helped touch off the first impeachment of Trump. (He was ultimately acquitted by the Senate.)",
      "Vice President JD Vance has likewise been consistently skeptical of continued U.S. assistance to Ukraine\u2019s government.",
      "\u201cThe bitter irony of America\u2019s present predicament is that the very people who cheer for permanent arms shipments to Ukraine also supported the de-industrialization of America,\u201d Vance said in a post on X on Sunday. \u201cThe very things you want us to send are things we don\u2019t make enough of.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s approach is\u00a0a dramatic departure from traditional U.S. foreign policy toward Russia, a period spanning the Cold War with the former Soviet Union as well as the rise of Putin. American presidents, Republicans and Democrats alike, typically struck a more bellicose tone on the threat posed by an emboldened Russia.",
      "Putin\u2019s regime has welcomed the overtures from Trump. In statements reported by Russian state media agency TASS, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov praised Trump as a pragmatist who operates with \u201ccommon sense.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe see that the collective West has begun to partially lose its unity,\u201d Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow on Monday.",
      "Democrats and anti-Trump Republican commentators have sharply criticized the administration since the Oval Office meeting, accusing Trump of effectively selling out Ukraine. In a post on his Truth Social platform early Monday, Trump defended himself and insisted he had helped keep much of Ukraine intact.",
      "\u201cThe only President who gave none of Ukraine\u2019s land to Putin\u2019s Russia is President Donald J. Trump,\u201d he wrote in the post. \u201cRemember that when the weak and ineffective Democrat\u2019s criticize, and the Fake News gladly puts out anything they say!\u201d",
      "But there is a partisan divide on Ukraine; Gallup recently found that 84% of Democrats have a favorable view of Ukraine, whereas only 54% of Republican poll respondents said the same.",
      "In the wake of the Trump-Zelenskyy spat, a handful of Republican lawmakers defended Ukraine, while most \u2014 including House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. \u2014 said Zelenskyy may have to resign.",
      "The feud between continued Monday, with Trump disparaging his Ukrainian counterpart in a post on social media.",
      "Trump is by no means the first president to aim for a less hostile relationship with Moscow, however. Barack Obama and his first secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, embarked on a high-profile bid to \u201creset\u201d relations with Russia. But those efforts largely fell apart after Putin invaded Crimea and seized it from Ukraine in 2014.",
      "The relationship between Biden and Zelenskyy showed signs of strain, too. NBC News has reported that Biden lost his temper with Zelenskyy during a phone call in June 2022, according to four people familiar with the call. Biden raised his voice and said Zelenskyy could afford to show more gratitude for the billions in U.S. military assistance for Kyiv.",
      "Biden and his top diplomats nonetheless worked to rally international support for Kyiv\u2019s resistance to Moscow; the United Kingdom, France and other European allies joined the fight.",
      "The disagreement between Biden and Zelenskyy came in a private phone call \u2014 not a public dressing down in the Oval Office. During their meeting, Trump told Zelenskyy he should be much more grateful as the conversation grew more tense, ending with the Ukraine leader leaving the U.S. without signing a minerals deal.",
      "\u201cYou got to be more thankful, because, let me tell you, you don\u2019t have the cards,\u201d Trump said."

      "CULIAC\u00c1N, Mexico \u2014 Before dawn, an elementary school principal in the capital of Mexico\u2019s Sinaloa state checks various chats on his phone for word of shootouts or other incidents. If there\u2019s danger, he sends a message to his students\u2019 parents suspending classes.",
      "It isn\u2019t the only new routine in Culiac\u00e1n, a city of 1 million residents that for the past six months has been the battlefield for the two main factions of the Sinaloa drug cartel.",
      "The violence has limited the hours to bury the dead. Bands that played big parties now play for money at intersections. Any loud noise sends children scurrying for cover. And those who live on the shifting front lines fear for their lives daily.",
      "This is the first extended period of violence that has touched Culiac\u00e1n\u2019s residents because there was safety in the cartel\u2019s total domination. Now, many residents are grateful for the pressure applied by U.S. President Donald Trump to get Mexico to go after the cartels and some are optimistic that this difficult period could change the persistent view that the cartel has been their protector.",
      "\u2018Tired of being among the bullets\u2019",
      "It started in September, more than a month after Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada \u2014 the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s oldest and most astute leader \u2014 says he was kidnapped by one of the sons of former leader Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n and taken to the U.S. where they were both arrested.",
      "It unleashed a power struggle between both cartel factions and the unwritten agreement to not attack residents uninvolved in the drug trade was broken.",
      "There were carjackings, kidnappings, innocents caught in crossfires and cartel roadblocks where gunmen would scan people\u2019s cell phones looking for any trace of contact with the other side. According to government data, there have been more than 900 killings since September.",
      "A resident of Costa Rica, a small town south of the capital, traced the front line on the horizon: on one side the \u201cChapos,\u201d on the other the \u201cMayos.\u201d He, like most others, requested anonymity because of the danger.",
      "An old man there said he saw gunmen dump two bodies in the street.",
      "And sometimes people just disappear. Julio H\u00e9ctor Carrillo, 34, never arrived home from visiting a relative in late January. According to his brother-in-law, Mario Beltr\u00e1n, his only transgression was not respecting the locals\u2019 self-imposed curfew.",
      "His family didn\u2019t dare to put up signs for their search, instead sticking to social platforms. A search collective looking for the disappeared found a body that is undergoing DNA testing.",
      "\u201cAt no other time in the last 30 to 40 years that we have crime stats, have we had so many families with disappeared (relatives),\u201d said Miguel Calder\u00f3n of the State Public Security Council, a citizen organization. Some are simply picked up, interrogated and released, but others end up on the wall of faces at Culiacan\u2019s cathedral.",
      "\u201cTruly, we\u2019re very tired, very tired of being among the bullets,\u201d said a 38-year-old small business owner who has imposed his own family security protocol: no cycling for their 18-year-old son, who they take everywhere, including to visit his girlfriend, and track in real time through his cell phone.",
      "Their 7-year-old daughter asks in the morning: \u201c\u2018Dad, am I going to be able to go to school today? Did you already check (Facebook)?\u2019\u201d",

      "U.S.: The solution or the problem?",
      "How Mexican authorities are addressing the violence has changed notably in the past month and locals believe Trump is the reason.",
      "When it started, Mexico was led by President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who minimized cartel violence and expressed no interest in going after cartel leaders. His close ally, Sinaloa Gov. Rub\u00e9n Rocha did the same. Rocha\u2019s spokesman, Feliciano Castro, maintains that the U.S. set off the violence by arresting Zambada.",
      "Things changed when Trump won the election. Shutting down illegal immigration and going after drug traffickers were among his campaign promises and he\u2019s threatened to impose 25% tariffs Tuesday. Mexico\u2019s new President Claudia Sheinbaum had already shown herself willing to take a more aggressive hand with the cartels, especially Sinaloa, whose main business is fentanyl.",
      "The number of security operations and arrests in Sinaloa have multiplied and now there is direct federal supervision of all security action.",
      "\u201cWe have never seen such an overwhelming and daily operation against the cartels,\u201d said Ismael Boj\u00f3rquez, a veteran Sinaloa journalist covering organized crime, who was critical of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s hands-off approach.",
      "In December, authorities seized more than a ton of fentanyl in Sinaloa compared to just 286 pounds in all of Mexico in the first six months of 2024.",
      "In the last 10 days of February, authorities dismantled 113 synthetic drug labs, according to preliminary state data. Authorities have not clarified if they produced fentanyl or methamphetamine. It\u2019s unknown what, if any, role U.S. intelligence played.",
      "In Culiac\u00e1n, authorities took down more than 400 cartel surveillance cameras, double what authorities had.",
      "The recent actions have weakened both cartel factions but the government can\u2019t let up if it really wants to decimate them, Boj\u00f3rquez said.",
      "\u201cI never thought (Trump) would have so much power to do that \u2026 but I\u2019m grateful,\u201d said the owner of a beer store stopped at a police checkpoint.",
      "A 55-year-old woman sitting on a bench watching a forensics team load a murder victim\u2019s body into a truck agreed. The day before, she had attended a Mass for her son-in-law who was killed five months earlier by a stray bullet while he was walking with his daughter a few blocks away.",
      "\u201cWe leave home but we don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll return,\u201d she said.",

      "Principal Victor Manuel Aispuro says he can\u2019t remember what it was like to have all of his nearly 400 students in school. Some 80 families fled the city and there were days when no more than 10 kids attended. He decides each day if there will be in-person classes.",
      "The last time he closed was late last month when intense firefights and low-flying helicopters panicked residents. Two key cartel members were arrested.",
      "In January, one of his students, a 9-year-old boy, was killed along with his 12-year-old brother and their father in a carjacking. Thousands of residents took to the streets in a rare public display of indignation.",
      "At a workshop, a nongovernmental organization of ex-police led students through an exercise writing down what scares them. One listed spiders, gun shots and white trucks (the preferred cartel transportation). Another said he\u2019s afraid of being extorted or killed.",
      "\u201cThe people are full of a sense of collective anguish, anxiety, social anger and that\u2019s different from other crises,\u201d said Calder\u00f3n, the coordinator of the citizen security group. He said he hopes it could dissolve the complicity of citizens, who for years saw the cartel as protectors, heroes or figures to emulate."

      "LONDON \u2014 Russia's Vladimir Putin has for years unsuccessfully tried to oust Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Now, those efforts are being entertained by senior officials in Ukraine\u2019s single most important backer, the United States.",
      "Either Zelenskyy \u201cneeds to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country to do that,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. Two days after the Ukrainian president was publicly berated by President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, and asked to leave the White House without signing an important deal, Johnson said it was \u201cup to the Ukrainians to figure that out.\u201d",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz said Washington needed \u201ca leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians, and end this war.\u201d He told CNN that \u201cif it becomes apparent that President Zelenskyy\u2019s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in this country, then I think we have a real issue.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he wasn\u2019t sure if the U.S. \u201ccan ever do business with Zelenskyy again.\u201d He said that Ukraine\u2019s leader \u201ceither needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\u201d",
      "Critics say this plays into the hands of Russia, aiding Moscow\u2019s yearslong bid to oust Ukraine\u2019s pro-Western leader, while fanning Kyiv\u2019s domestic political divisions during wartime.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov on Monday called the White House clash an \u201cunprecedented event\u201d that showed \u201cZelenskyy largely demonstrated a complete lack of diplomatic skills.\u201d The exchange was part of Ukraine\u2019s \u201crefusal to acknowledge the real situation on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly a blind person could fail to see this, and only a deaf person would refuse to hear it.\u201d",
      "Still, the Ukrainian leader has remained defiant and popular among European leaders. There is also evidence that last week\u2019s clash in the Oval Office may have even boosted his domestic support.",
      "\u201cIf they replace me, given what is going on, given the support, simply replacing me will not be simple,\u201d Zelenskyy told British media. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just hold an election. You need to also not let me run. This will be a bit more difficult. Looks like you will have to negotiate with me.\u201d",
      "Trump and his advisers such as Elon Musk have criticized Ukraine\u2019s indefinite postponement of elections scheduled for 2024, delayed because the country is under martial law following its invasion by Russia. That led to Trump calling democratically elected Zelenskyy  \u201ca dictator without elections.\u201d",
      "More and more Ukrainians are in favor of this pause, with support\u00a0 up to 58% from 52% last week, Ukrainian pollster Gradus found in data published Sunday.",
      "Other polling suggests that, while certainly more politically fallible than he was during the early days of the war, Zelenskyy remains widely popular and could well win a democratic ballot. In fact, another Gradus survey suggested that the Oval Office bust-up has coincided with a boost in Zelenskyy\u2019s domestic approval rising to 49% as of Saturday.",
      "Meanwhile, trust in Zelenskyy appears to be increasing, up to 65% from 57% in January, a poll by\u00a0the Ukrainian research organization Rating Group found.",
      "Zelenskyy \u201cwas elected in 2019 with the large margin,\u201d said Yevhen Mahda, director of the Kyiv think tank Institute of World Policy, adding that there isn\u2019t a serious risk to his leadership inside the country. Although Zelenskyy has offered to resign if Ukraine gets NATO membership, these statements are \u201ca bit populistic\u201d because of how unlikely that is, Mahda said.",
      "One man possibly more popular than him is Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine\u2019s former top military commander \u2014 known as the Iron General \u2014 whom Zelenskyy fired in a February 2024 shakeup. Zaluzhniy, since posted to the United Kingdom as ambassador, was trusted by 76% of respondents in the Rating Group survey \u2014 higher than his boss, the president.",
      "But in informal conversations over the weekend, political, military and diplomatic figures in Kyiv, even those who did not personally support the Ukrainian leader, unanimously told NBC News that replacing Zelenskyy now would only benefit Russia. Rather than seeing a humiliation of their leader, they saw it as an example of Ukraine standing up to the U.S. and saying \u201cno.\u201d",
      "Still, many in Ukraine are under no illusions at the leverage Washington still holds over them.",
      "One soldier in Kramatorsk, Volodymyr Chystyi, whose nickname is clean guy, laid it out in stark terms: \u201cThe only international pressure that could possibly force Zelenslyi to resign is a pressure from America.\u201d",
      "Yevheniia Kravchuk, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy\u2019s Servant of the People party, said her leader has \u201cmade it clear he\u2019s not in politics for power. His aim is to ensure real, lasting peace to Ukraine and to achieve some security guarantees.\u201d",
      "\u201cHonestly, I do not understand calls for President Zelenskyy to resign in the middle of an existential genocidal war,\u201d she added. \u201cOur defense heavily depends on President Zelenskyy\u2019s leadership. Even the critics in Ukraine acknowledge that the discussion about replacing him is absurd and premature.\u201d",
      "Trump has wrongly claimed that Zelenskyy\u2019s approval rating is 4%, and Musk said the Ukrainian leader was avoiding a vote because he would \u201close in a landslide.\u201d",
      "There doesn\u2019t appear to be much evidence for either of these assertions. Trump appears to have gotten his statistic from an unscientific poll on the Telegram messaging service by one of Zelenskyy\u2019s political rivals.",
      "Alexander Smith reported from London, and Victor Sema and Daryna Meyer from Kyiv."

      "The meetings and gathering during the National People\u2019s Congress, expected to last for about a week, are still important. The rubber-stamp parliament retains an important function: to signal the priorities of the government for the coming year and to disseminate instructions to party members and officials across the country.",
      "The messaging from leadership appears unchanged from previous years \u2014 stay the course on fostering innovation while also spurring domestic consumption.",
      "The question will be how they balance those two goals, and will it be enough to reinvigorate the economy? And to what extent will the government buffer the impact of what might be another phase in the U.S.-China trade war?",
      "This year also marks the end of China\u2019s current 5-year plan, and experts will be looking for clues on the government\u2019s priorities for the next, 2026 to 2030 plan.",
      "Here is what to watch for at this year\u2019s event:",
      "What is China\u2019s economic growth target?",
      "The National People\u2019s Congress kicks off on Wednesday, with Premier Li Qiang, China\u2019s top economic official, announcing the economic growth target for the year.",
      "Analysts expect it to come in at around 5% \u2014 holding the same target as the previous two years, and slightly lower than the 5.5% target in 2022. This would be no small feat considering China is still grappling with a sluggish real estate sector and lackluster consumer spending.",
      "Another uncertainty is trade tensions with the U.S. under President Donald Trump, who last month slapped a 10% tariff on Chinese imports while an additional 10% comes into effect on Tuesday. Forecasters at the International Monetary Fund are projecting a lower 4.6% growth rate this year.",
      "What are the government\u2019s priorities?",
      "A commentary last Friday from the official Xinhua News Agency indicated that priority would be placed on increasing domestic demand and promoting innovation in science and technology.",
      "There\u2019s also anticipation of more government support for the private sector to fuel growth.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping met in February with business leaders, including Alibaba founder Jack Ma and Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei, signaling support for the private sector at the highest level of leadership. A draft bill is also to be deliberated during the Congress over making a fairer and more equitable business environment for the private sector.",
      "China has already released a slew of measures to prop up the economy. Much of these have fallen short of hopes for a bigger stimulus, and analysts are tempering expectations on what to expect from the Congress.",
      "\u201cI would not expect anything ... to come out that will really meaningfully shift that policy away from industrial policy and towards boosting consumption in meaningful, sufficient ways,\u201d said Jacob Gunter, lead analyst for the economics research team at the Mercator Institute for China Studies.",
      "Instead, experts say leaders are staying the course on pushing for innovation that would increase China\u2019s self-reliance.",
      "The purpose of the economy is no longer to improve household incomes and expand the middle class, Gunter said.",
      "\u201cThis is not a development-oriented economy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a geopolitically oriented economy, and technology and industry are way more important for that.\u201d",
      "Where is China\u2019s diplomacy headed?",
      "Li is expected to touch on foreign policy and Taiwan, but more attention will likely be on Foreign Minister Wang Yi.",
      "His annual news conference, to be held later in the week, will be closely watched to decipher China\u2019s stance on U.S.-China relations under Trump. After the first 10% tariffs in February, China retaliated with a 15% tariff on American coal and liquefied natural gas, as well as 10% on crude oil, agriculture machinery and large-engine cars.",
      "\u201cBeijing\u2019s response to Trump\u2019s initial 10% tariffs was measured \u2014 restrained enough to signal openness to negotiations yet firm enough to demonstrate its willingness to escalate if necessary,\u201d Neil Thomas and Jing Qian wrote in a report for the Asia Society Policy Institute.",
      "They note that China\u2019s president might use speeches in closed-door meetings during the Congress to send signals on bilateral relations, as he did two years ago when Xi named the United States as leading \u201ccontainment encirclement and suppressions\u201d against China.",
      "Also closely watched will be China\u2019s relations with Russia and its position on the Ukraine war. At a recent Group of 20 foreign ministers\u2019 meeting in South Africa, Wang said a \u201cwindow for peace is opening\u201d in Ukraine, and that China supported \u201call efforts committed to peace, including the recent consensus reached by the United States and Russia.\u201d",
      "What does the National People\u2019s Congress do?",
      "The legislature is made up of nearly 3,000 delegates from China\u2019s provinces, ministries, People\u2019s Liberation Army, party organizations and various groups that represent workers and other interests.",
      "Their role is largely ceremonial in that the body does not have any real power to decide on legislation. Any vote is usually unanimous or near-unanimous to formalize decisions already taken by Communist Party leaders behind closed doors.",
      "Still, the Congress is a rare opportunity to see what the central government sees as its priorities and goals, and the reports and speeches during it can give indications of the future direction of government policy.",
      "An advisory body, the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, will meet at the same time. Members include business leaders, athletes, academics, religious leaders and representatives of ethnic groups. The concurrent meetings of the two bodies are known as the Two Sessions."

      "An Australian man credited with saving more than 2 million babies through decades of regular blood and plasma donations has died at age 88.",
      "James Harrison, whose blood contained a rare antibody, died in his sleep Feb. 17 at a nursing home in the Australian state of New South Wales, according to the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, also known as Lifeblood.",
      "The antibody in Harrison\u2019s blood was used to make the medication anti-D, which is given to pregnant women whose blood might attack their unborn babies. Without it, babies may develop hemolytic disease of the fetus\u00a0and newborn (HDFN), a blood disorder that can be fatal.",
      "Despite an aversion to needles, Harrison began donating in 1954 at age 18, keeping a promise he made at 14 when he received life-saving blood transfusions as part of a major surgery. A decade later, it was found that his blood contained an antibody essential for producing anti-D injections.",
      "Known as the \u201cman with the golden arm,\u201d Harrison donated his blood and plasma 1,173 times, never missing an appointment for more than 60 years until he retired in 2018 at the age of 81.",
      "\u201cI hope it\u2019s a record that somebody breaks, because it will mean they are dedicated to the cause,\u201d Harrison\u00a0said at the time.",
      "In total, over 3 million doses of anti-D with Harrison\u2019s blood have been given to 2 million mothers in Australia since 1967. In 1999, he received the Medal of the Order of Australia in recognition of his support for Lifeblood and the anti-D program.",
      "His daughter, Tracey Mellowship, who also received anti-D, said Harrison was a \u201chumanitarian at heart,\u201d adding that her family \u201cmay not have existed without his precious donations.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was also very proud to have saved so many lives, without any cost or pain. It made him happy to hear about the many families like ours, who existed because of his kindness,\u201d Mellowship said.",
      "\u201cHe always said it does not hurt, and the life you save could be your own,\u201d she continued.",
      "Australia has some 200 anti-D donors helping around 45,000 mothers and their babies annually, Lifeblood says.",
      "Though HDFN currently can be prevented only through blood donation, researchers are using blood from Harrison and other donors to produce a lab-grown version of the anti-D antibody in the hope that it can help prevent the disease in pregnant women in Australia and around the world.",
      "Lifeblood Chief Executive Officer Stephen Cornelissen said Harrison had left behind an \u201cincredible\u201d legacy.",
      "\u201cOn behalf of Lifeblood, and the entire Australian community, we thank James for the incredible life-saving contribution he made and the millions of lives he saved,\u201d he said."
