      "The inspiration for Kate Hamill\u2019s latest play came from across centuries and the planet",
      "NEW YORK -- The inspiration for Kate Hamill's latest play came from across centuries and the planet.",
      "The actor-playwright was honeymooning in Italy in 2020 when she walked into the Uffizi Gallery in Florence and spotted a painting by pioneering Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi created around 1620. The art immediately stirred more art.",
      "\u201cI was standing in front of this painting, just like crying and shaking for like 20 minutes. And then I was like, \u2018I\u2019m going to write a play about this woman,\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "The result is \u201cThe Light and the Dark\" \u2014 a Primary Stages production at 59E59 Theatres \u2014 which looks at the hard but inspiring life of Gentileschi, who created bold works despite a society keen on keeping her down. Hamill calls the play a \u201cfeminist primal scream.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am disheartened by how extremely relevant this play is right now,\u201d Hamill says. \u201cMuch of the same things that Artemisia Gentileschi was dealing with then are still true now.\u201d",
      "Gentileschi rebelled against the male-dominated art world \u2014 even using herself as a nude model \u2014 and has lately become a symbol of courageous women for testifying in court, even while being tortured, against a prominent painter who raped her. \u201cPlease don\u2019t let her give up \u2014 she is a survivor,\u201d Hamill writes in the play\u2019s notes.",
      "Hamill \u2014 consistently among the most produced playwrights in America \u2014 not only wrote the work, but she also stars as Gentileschi, nightly reliving the traumas and the betrayals but also the triumphs of her sister-in-art.",
      "\u201cIt was important to me as a female artist to put my own body in the line of the service of a female artist who used the power of her body to say something,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cI felt like if what I need to do to get survivors' stories heard is take off all my clothes and scream in the middle of off-Broadway, then that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d",
      "The painting in Italy that stirred so much in Hamill was Gentileschi's Judith Slaying Holofernes, which depicts the Biblical story of Judith, who saved her people by beheading the Assyrian general Holofernes.",
      "It came at a time when Hamill was disheartened by #MeToo stories at home and wondered how \u2014 or even if \u2014 she could continue as a feminist playwright.",
      "\u201cI swear to you, I felt this woman reach through time and reach into that room and slap me up across the face and go \u2018Snap out of it! You have a voice. You have privilege. You\u2019re going to let those guys beat you? Get louder, get bolder!\u2019\u201d",
      "Hamill\u2019s husband, actor-director Jason O\u2019Connell, recalls seeing her transfixed in front of the painting. \u201cIt was like she was seized,\u201d he says, adding that her stillness and the light on her face made her look like a painting herself. \u201cI just watched her commune with it for a while and it was very moving.\u201d (Hamill soon ordered more than a dozen books about Gentileschi that were waiting for her on her return home.)",
      "The painting depicts Gentileschi and her maid plunging a sword into their enemy, inspiring the play's final powerful speech: \u201cEvery daughter of mothers who ever sees this work/Will know she is not alone/She will see what it means/To survive, despite the hands at your throat.\u201d",
      "The play has plenty of signature Hamill touches \u2014 strong women, humor and an encouragement to mix in modern elements despite whatever period the play is set. \u201cThe Light and the Dark\u201d has actors in jeans beneath Renaissance silhouettes, and Hamill kept her piercings in.",
      "\u201cWe wanted it to feel like we are gesturing at a time that is both back then and now, because I\u2019m going to argue all of this story could happen now,\u201d she says.",
      "Hamill has built a reputation as a foremost adapter of novels to the stage, including dust-blowing-off versions of \u201cVanity Fair,\u201d \u201cMansfield Park,\u201d \u201cThe Scarlet Letter,\u201d \u201cLittle Women\u201d and \u201cPride and Prejudice.\u201d In her \u201cSense and Sensibility,\u201d she added a Greek chorus of gossips to represent social pressures.",
      "\u201cI come at adaptation from a sort of a new play lens,\u201d she says. \u201cSo, I think of it as a collaboration between myself and an author who\u2019s often currently dead. So, in a way, it\u2019s sort of the same muscle.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Connell, who often acts alongside his wife, has two roles in the new play \u2014 an art appraiser who testifies against Gentileschi and a court officer who tortures her. \u201cI betray her two different ways in one scene,\u201d he says, turning to his wife: \u201cThe play is just so her. Her voice is so strong.\u201d",
      "Hamill says she is tapping into the same thing Gentileschi tapped into \u2014 extreme dissatisfaction with how the world is and this feeling that the world could be different.",
      "\u201cFeminist stories are about envisioning a future that\u2019s more egalitarian for women and men and people who do not identify on that binary. I think there is a healthy proportion of people who really want to live in that world or who want to see the ways in which our current world is not like that world.\u201d"

      "The Bayreuth Festival has dropped four productions from its 150th anniversary season in 2026 because of budget cuts",
      "The Bayreuth Festival dropped four productions from its 150th anniversary season in 2026 because of budget cuts, the festival said Thursday.",
      "The German festival devoted to composer Richard Wagner attributed the decision to its employees' public-service sector labor contracts and an inability to increase revenue. The festival said it is 55% self-financed.",
      "Bayreuth, built to the composer's specifications and run by his great-granddaughter Katharina Wagner, had planned to present all 10 of his mature works plus the festival debut of \u201cRienzi,\u201d Wagner's rarely performed third opera.",
      "Citing labor costs, the festival said it will limit its 2026 schedule to \u201cRienzi\u201d along with the four-opera \u201cDer Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung),\u201d which inaugurated the festival in 1876; Wagner's final opera, \u201cParsifal,\u201d which premiered at the house in 1882; and \u201cDer Fliegende Holl\u00e4nder (The Flying Dutchman),\u201d Wagner's fourth opera and what is considered the first of his mature works.",
      "Bayreuth dropped planned 2026 revivals of \u201cTannh\u00e4user,\u201d \u201cLohengrin,\u201d \u201cTristan und Isolde\u201d and \u201cDie Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg.\u201d",
      "The 2026 Ring Cycle will be a special production and not the Valentin Schwarz staging that debuted in 2022 and is to be staged for the final time in 2025. Bayreuth said it will announce the \u201cRienzi\u201d director next summer and that 2026 will be the only time it presents \u201cRienzi.\u201d",
      "The 2026 season will open as planned with Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony, which was conducted by Wagner following the foundation stone ceremony in 1872 and was later played at the 1951 postwar reopening of Bayreuth."

      "An annual festival on a German North Sea island that had drawn criticism because of a practice of men hitting women with cow\u2019s horns has passed without reports of assaults this year",
      "BERLIN -- An annual festival on a German North Sea island that had drawn criticism over a practice of men hitting women with cow's horns passed without reports of assaults this year, police said Friday.",
      "The Klaasohm festival on Borkum, the westernmost of a string of German islands, takes place on Dec. 5 ahead of St Nicholas' Day. A report by ARD public television aired late last month showed women being stopped by costumed men and hit on the buttocks with a cow's horn at the 2023 festival, and anonymous witnesses discussing aggressive behavior at the event.",
      "The association that organizes the festival said ahead of this year's festival that the practice would be scrapped and it would no longer tolerate violence against women.",
      "The island's mayor, J\u00fcrgen Akkermann, said that the violence had developed from \u201ca tradition of a kind of chastisement\u201d of people who approach the \u201cKlaasohms\u201d \u2014 men dressed up in masks, sheepskin and feathers \u2014 without permission. He said that, following earlier incidents, a rethinking had already started over the past decade, but the matter hadn't been pursued emphatically enough until now, German news agency dpa reported.",
      "For Thursday's festival, police said they raised their presence on Borkum significantly. About 500 people took part in the parade, which drew a large crowd of spectators.",
      "Police said Friday that, when the festival ended around midnight, they had received no reports of bodily harm or any assaults. Regional police chief Thomas Memering said in a statement that, if offenses from this year's or past festivals come to light after the event, they will be prosecuted.",
      "\u201cCustoms and traditions don't provide protection against prosecution,\u201d he said."

      "LONDON -- Beatles legend Paul McCartney is being honored in a specially minted British coin collection.",
      "The Royal Mint, which has struck the coins of monarchs from Alfred the Great in the ninth century through to King Charles III, revealed Friday that it is launching a McCartney coin collection for collectors to buy.",
      "On one side of the coins, as is custom, will be the king. On the other, it will be all about McCartney's career in the wake of the Beatles split in 1970.",
      "The Royal Mint said the range will come in a variety of finishes as well as colored editions. The most valuable one will be the 2-ounce gold proof coin, which will have a face value of 200 pounds ($255), but will go on sale at a recommended retail price of 5,890 pounds ($7,510).",
      "Though legal tender, but with the price differential, it's unlikely \u2014 if not irrational \u2014 for anyone using the coins in everyday to use them to pay for, say, a McCartney concert.",
      "Among other features, the coins feature McCartney\u2019s iconic Magic Piano. a multicolored upright he first used in 1967 while still in arguably the greatest band of all with John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. A replica was made for McCartney's 1989/1990 world tour and been used in subsequent tours.",
      "There are other references too, including piano notes chosen by McCartney, his famous H\u00f6fner Violin Bass guitar, the logo of his post-Beatles band, Wings, as well as his signature.",
      "\u201cThis feels like a huge honor,\u201d McCartney said. \u201cIt\u2019s not anything I would have ever expected to happen when I was a kid.\u201d",
      "The Royal Mint also said it has created a special edition plectrum-shaped version of the coin to gift to the 82-year-old McCartney, who in his early days played with pennies as guitar picks.",
      "The coins are part of the Royal Mint\u2019s Music Legends collection that also features the likes of David Bowie, George Michael and the Rolling Stones.",
      "\u201cOur coins recognize the greatest icons and events in British history, so it\u2019s fitting that Paul McCartney\u2019s remarkable music career is now celebrated on an official U.K. coin,\" said Rebecca Morgan, Director of Commemorative Coin at The Royal Mint.",
      "\u201cWhat makes this coin extra special is that Paul has been involved throughout the design process,\u201d she added.",
      "The Royal Mint also said that it will auction a signed, gold edition of McCartney\u2019s coin. The bespoke gold coin weighs five kilograms and took over 250 hours to make, including three days of hand polishing. It was signed by McCartney during his 2024 \u201cGot Back\u201d tour in Paris and will be auctioned alongside four silver five-kilogram editions."

      "LOS ANGELES -- Although the friendly competition is fierce each day among the four talented young pass rushers on the Los Angeles Rams\u2019 defensive front, this week was a whole new tune.",
      "Defensive tackle Braden Fiske won the NFL's defensive rookie of the month award Thursday \u2014 but he had to share the spotlight with nose tackle Kobie Turner, who was revealed Wednesday night as one of the final four costumed performers on \u201cThe Masked Singer,\u201d Fox's celebrity musical competition show.",
      "Fiske, Turner and edge rushers Jared Verse and Byron Young inspire and challenge each other as they build the new core of the Rams' defense together. They regularly compare everything from their sack totals \u2014 they've combined for a whopping 21 1/2 this season \u2014 to their pickup basketball skills, always attempting to outdo each other with a smile.",
      "But when Turner pulled off his mask on television following his elimination after a season of impressive vocal performances, the rest of the Rams' defensive front knew Turner had won this round.",
      "\u201cIt really caught me by surprise,\u201d Fiske said with a laugh. \u201cWe saw it in the group chat last night, and it was all over social media. But knowing Kobie, knowing who he is, that's pretty cool. I know it was pretty special to him and his family with how his upbringing was with music and how much he appreciates that. I'm glad to see he had that opportunity. That's definitely not my forte, to be out there singing in front of people.\u201d",
      "Fiske got plenty of congratulations for his own performance after a five-sack November in which the second-round draft pick established himself alongside Turner as two of the league's top young interior pass rushers. Fiske is the third member of the Rams' young group to get the defensive rookie of the month honor in the past two years, joining Verse (September 2024) and Turner (December 2023).",
      "Meanwhile, Turner wowed another segment of the entertainment world with his powerful voice.",
      "The second-year pro has indulged his musical talent in several venues, even singing the national anthem before Lakers and Kings games. Turner conducts a few notes of an imaginary orchestra during his signature celebration after each sack.",
      "He balanced choral classes and weightlifting classes during high school and college, maintaining both of his passions. But the challenge of singing and dancing in the heavy costumes on \u201cThe Masked Singer\u201d was a whole new experience.",
      "\u201cTo be up under that mask and be the silly, goofy version of myself that I always have been wasn\u2019t something I was really expecting,\u201d Turner said, adding that he fell asleep onstage during one break in filming while wearing his costume, which was extra bulky because of his athletic strength.",
      "Turner said his marketing agent got him onto the show. Turner taped his first episode way back during the Rams' organized team activities last summer, but he had to keep his participation secret until this week.",
      "\u201cOnce the recording was done, it was like, \u2018OK, let\u2019s get back to ball,\u2019\u201d Turner said. \u201cAnd then when the show started coming on (this fall), I got really excited.\u201d",
      "Turner admits he was \u201cfrustrated\u201d not to advance to the show's finale, saying he maintains a competitive fire even in his musical side. He still doesn't forget to have fun, however.",
      "\u201cSometimes there are expectations on how you handle yourself on a football field, and with my personality, I've pushed those limits,\u201d Turner said. \u201cLast year, AD (Aaron Donald) used to always pick on me about doing crazy dance moves in walkthrough. But when it's time to go, I was completely locked in.\u201d",
      "NOTES: Verse was limited in practice Thursday by an ankle injury. ... LT Alaric Jackson (foot) returned to practice on a limited basis after sitting out Wednesday. ... WR Demarcus Robinson (hand) was a full participant after being limited Wednesday, while QB Matthew Stafford (ankle) had his second straight full day of work.",

      "Jagde\u2019s appearance as Don Alvaro opposite soprano Anna Netrebko will mark his third performance at Milan\u2019s storied Teatro alla Scala. He appeared twice as a substitute tenor opposite Netrebko, replacing Roberto Alagna in \u201cTurandot\u201d this summer, and now he will replace Jonas Kaufmann in the coveted season opener.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy to be their guy,\u2019\u2019 Jagde told The Associated Press in a phone interview.",
      "While it is not unheard of for Americans to sing on La Scala\u2019s opening night, a highlight of the European cultural calendar, it remains a rarity in an opera house where Europeans tend to dominate.",
      "Beside Maria Callas last century, American Brian Hymel opened the 2016 season in \u201cMadame Butterfly\u201d and Lisette Oropesa was cast in \u201cLucia di Lammermoor\u201d but sang in a gala concert to an empty theater when the 2020 season premiere was shuttered by the pandemic.",
      "In 2008, American tenor Stuart Neill was promoted from understudy to the \u201cDon Carlo\u201d opening night cast after the headlining tenor made too many dress rehearsal mistakes. Neill received generous applause from the tough La Scala crowd.",
      "\u201cIt's definitely one of the things that every artist dreams about,\u2019\u2019 Jagde said. \u201cI think it is about the artist and meeting the moment at the right time. I think that is more of what it's about than necessarily where they are from.\u201d",
      "Jagde said singers are drawn to La Scala's \u201crich tradition.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery artist wants to not just perform there, but have great success there,\u201d Jagde said. \u201cThe public is known to be a very devoted fanship \u2014 and they can love you or they can hate you. You really want to be embraced by that audience specifically.\u201d",
      "So far, the reviews from La Scala\u2019s upper balconies of exacting opera fans have been positive on his previous two outings, Jagde said, adding that artists should accept all feedback.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s our job as artists to embrace the fact that we are making people feel something. Whatever they feel is appropriate to them,\" he said.",
      "Jagde, 45, grew up outside of New York City, and started singing in musicals in high schools and choirs in college, but never gave a thought to the opera. He started studying computer science and business upstate but then a classical music program at Purchase College closer to home grabbed his attention, thinking it might lead him to Broadway.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know at the time that classical voice meant opera,\" he said laughing. He got accepted off the waiting list, and quickly fell in love with opera as the purest expression of the unadulterated voice.",
      "\u201cI remember being on stage and experiencing something I had never experienced on stage before, which was a completely acoustic, magical sound,\" Jagde said. \u201cThis was completely natural, hearing an orchestra underneath me, and my voice carrying over that. I remember committing full-heartedly (to opera) on stage at the moment.\u201d",
      "His college teachers pegged him as a baritone, and he spent eight years doing auditions and artists programs in that range until he realized that \u201cI was still warming up to high Cs and still had no low notes.\u201d",
      "Once he started auditioning as a tenor, the offers started rolling in. He made his principal role debut at the Metropolitan opera in 2021 in the role of Cavaradossi in \u201cTosca,\" and has sung on such renowned stages as the Paris Opera, the Vienna Staatsoper and Naples' Teatro di San Carlo.",
      "During the 2023/24 season, he warmed up his Don Alvaro at the Metropolitan Opera House and London's Royal Opera House. His La Scala debut last spring was as Turiddu in \u201cCavalleria rusticana.\u201d",
      "La Scala general manager Dominique Meyer said his only consideration in casting an opera is whether a singer \u201cis up to the role.\u201d Jagde, he said, is among five or six tenors who could sing the Don Alvaro role, \u201cand he was available.\u201d",
      "Jagde finished his Barcelona performances on Nov. 18, and showed up for rehearsals at La Scala the next day. Don Alvaro, he said, is a role, \"that has kind of grown with me, as I have grown as an artist.\u201d",
      "Jagde said singing alongside an international opera star like Netrebko for the second time this year will help take some of the jitters out of the gala premiere.",
      "\u201cShe is a wonderful colleague. She is a good person to work with, always available to you. She is nothing but smiles and fun,\" he said."

      "Nandito Badea, 19, and George Stana, 23, face extradition to the U.K. following their arrests Wednesday on a charge of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.",
      "Pouria Zeraati, a presenter at London-based Iran International, was stabbed in the leg on March 29 outside his home in the Wimbledon section of the city. He recovered from the attack and returned to work, saying \u201cthe show must go on.\"",
      "Police said two men attacked Zeraati and fled with a getaway driver. Metropolitan Police said the suspects then flew out of the country from Heathrow Airport.",
      "The attack was investigated by counterterrorism police because of Zeraati\u2019s occupation and recent threats to U.K.-based Iranian journalists. Iran International, a satellite news channel that broadcasts in Farsi, has previously received threats due to coverage that has long been critical of Iran\u2019s theocratic government.",

      "Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche became friends while playing lovers in \u201cWuthering Heights.\u201d A few years later, they would share the screen again in Anthony Minghella\u2019s \u201cThe English Patient,\u201d that historical epic that would take them all the way to the Oscars.",
      "They\u2019ve kept in touch in the years since, fused by those early experiences and their admiration for one another\u2019s minds and processes. There were dinners and phone calls and trips to catch one another on the stage. Binoche went to see him in \u201cMacbeth.\u201d He went to see her in \u201cAntigone.\u201d",
      "But they hadn\u2019t managed to work together again until now. And, appropriate for the occasion, the story is an epic: the reunion of Odysseus and Penelope.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re very, very, very good friends,\u201d Fiennes said. \u201cThere\u2019s a trust, there\u2019s a bond, there\u2019s a respect. There\u2019s the love of friends and we celebrate each other\u2019s work.\"",
      "\u201cThe Return,\u201d in theaters Friday, has been a passion project for director and co-writer Uberto Pasolini, who worked on it on and off for some 30 years (longer than Odysseus\u2019 entire journey, he noted).",
      "\u201cI thought I was too old,\u201d Fiennes said. \u201cHe said, \u2018No, no, no, no, you\u2019re there. This is your last year.\u2019\u201d",
      "Binoche and Fiennes spoke to The Associated Press about the enduring appeal of Homer\u2019s story, their process and the value of fighting for provocative cinema. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "FIENNES: I\u2019ve been fascinated by Odysseus since I was a young boy and my mother read me the Greek myths. I think it\u2019s something about coming home and having the courage and the sort of sense of destiny to take what is yours, to clarify what you have. There are great symbols at work in this piece.",
      "Uberto had shared this with me for some time and we got to the point of, well, when are we going to do this? And who should play Penelope? And I said, \u201cIt must be Juliette Binoche.\u201d And he said, \u201cDon\u2019t you think it should be Juliette Binoche?\u201d And I said, \u201cThat\u2019s just what I said. Uberto, it has to be Juliette Binoche.\u201d",
      "BINOCHE: On another interview, he didn\u2019t want to say that he chose me. And I said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you say it?\u201d So now he\u2019s saying that three times. I\u2019m so happy.",
      "FIENNES: It wasn\u2019t long before Juliette Binoche was the only person on the planet who could play Penelope.",
      "BINOCHE: I didn\u2019t ask that much.",
      "FIENNES: I\u2019m saying that. You can\u2019t say that. I can.",
      "BINOCHE: You prepared more than I did. Ralph was really training like crazy for it. As for me, you want to be present and allow truth in the moment and make these figures, these big myths, these archetypes real. Uberto was quite controlling because he wanted to succeed so much with this film, he wanted it to be so close to his dream. We had to relax him in a way so we would have space to engage in this acting moment between us. We wanted to give something special to the film so people would experience as a spectator something ancient and yet very truthful and modern.",
      "FIENNES: We felt strongly that once we were going to do it, we were on this shared road. You have the baggage of these two archetypes, symbols that are heightened, mythical. Our job is to make them human. We felt the pressure of that all the time and we were hungry to do it and wanted it. It was a conversation: Please don\u2019t over-define every second of how you\u2019re going to shoot this because we will get to a place where our combined energies will hopefully send you messages about how you want to shoot it.",
      "FIENNES: The industry is challenged. And I know for a fact that the independent film finance world is very challenged. I think I\u2019m a bit of a dinosaur. The days of the independent film that was going to be in cinemas, I think they may be past. The hunger to go to the cinema is something that might be dwindling, and we are always grateful when we hear about films where people have left their homes for the cinema experience.",
      "So that begs the question about what is the cinema experience? Everything is changing and shifting. But there are determined writers, producers, actors, directors who believe in making provocative adult dramas. I read about this film, \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d I\u2019m dying to see it. It sounds extraordinary. It sounds like exactly what I\u2019m trying to describe. A brave filmmaker who is determined to go out there and push the boundaries with a piece of work. There are those people who are determined to keep giving us this expression in cinema. But it\u2019s very tough.",
      "BINOCHE: As an audience, you have to observe what stays in you. Because, of course, you\u2019re going to have a wonderful time while you\u2019re watching and thinking, wow, you\u2019re doing this and that and this color and this pace and the editing is exciting but at the end of the day, what do you bring with you? What stays in you? I think that\u2019s the key question because otherwise you spent hours and hours of watching things and you don\u2019t think about it the next day or the next hour. It\u2019s ridiculous, in my opinion, because it needs to nourish something in your life. I believe that an art form can change your life. And we\u2019re doing it for that purpose."

      "Associated Press Music Writer Maria Sherman has chosen 10 of the best songs of 2024",
      "NEW YORK -- Ten of the best songs of the year, as determined by Associated Press Music Writer Maria Sherman, in no particular order.",
      "It is not only the biggest song of the year, but one of the longest-reigning No. 1s of all time, as far as the Billboard Hot 100 is concerned \u2014 Shaboozey\u2019s \u201cA Bar Song (Tipsy)\u201d tied Lil Nas X\u2019s \u201cOld Town Road\u201d with an impressive 19 weeks atop the charts. It makes sense that these two songs resonated in similar ways: Both are cross-genre, monolithic musical moments, classically country and an amalgamation of styles forming something completely modern. Shaboozey\u2019s earworm interpolates J-Kwon\u2019s \u201cTipsy\u201d and places it squarely on the faded bar stool of a hard-working weekend warrior. Like a few too many whiskey shooters, it'll inspire a singalong of \u201cOh my, good lord\u201d from anyone.",
      "There was a time where describing \u201cNot Like Us\u201d required a taxonomy of the freshly reignited beef between Kendrick Lamar and Drake, a period of diss tracks begetting diss tracks with dizzying alacrity \u2014 and a clear victor. The truth is, of course, the song stands on its own: a triumphant declaration of West Coast hip-hop, funny and bombastic.",
      "Future and Metro Boomin have long made ideal collaborators, but this year's joint album, \u201cWe Don\u2019t Trust You,\u201d felt like a long time coming. It was an event. Immediately upon its release, \u201cLike That\" stood out, not only for its fiery guest verse from Lamar, or its hyper-speed sample of Rodney O and Joe Cooley\u2019s \u201cEverlasting Bass\u201d and Eazy-E\u2019s \u201cEazy-Duz-It,\u201d but for its ferocity. It's the big ... three?",
      "Face it: 2024 belonged to Chappell Roan. A veteran of the music industry now experiencing what feels like an unparalleled rocket launch into fame, Roan has long wielded her theatricality and sexual candor like a wand (and a rabbit) in her songs. But it\u2019s \u201cGood Luck, Babe!\u201d that thrust her into the mainstream, a pop megahit that tackles lust, frustration and compulsory heterosexuality atop strings, \u201980s synths, and a soaring vocal performance. How could you not fall in love with her?",
      "For the caffeinated \u2014 or those in dire need of an energy boost \u2014 Sabrina Carpenter's \u201cEspresso\" emerged like all great pop hits should: Almost from nowhere, as addictive as its namesake and confounding in its lyrics, directly recalling the Y2K period of off-kilter pop songs with nonsensical lyrics atop sunny productions. (\"That\u2019s that me espresso\" is up there with the Backstreet Boys' declaration of \u201cI never wanna hear you say / I want it that way.\u201d) But this one isn't simply fueled by nostalgia. It's disco-pop when the genre was dead and buried, revitalized and made clever through Carpenter's ever-present sense of humor. Cheeky!",
      "For career-long fans of Beyonc\u00e9, the memory of the once-teenaged singer who spoke with a soft, pronounced Texas twang is all but distant. For them, a hybridist country album from the superstar performer was simply a prophecy fulfilled. When \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d arrived, it became immediately clear that B was dedicated to reclaiming country music as a Black woman. But it was the introduction of this new era with \u201cTexas Hold 'Em\u201d that solidified it \u2014 a honky-tonk stomper with a lot of western soul.",
      "Give her No. 1 for the best lyric of the year \u2014 \u201cIs somebody gonna match my freak?\u201d Tinashe\u2019s \u201cNasty\u201d is the hit fans of her smooth R&B-pop have been waiting for years; an exemplar of her particular talents. It\u2019s a sultry, goodtime hit \u2014 a kick, a snare, bare production and a scare beat \u2014 melodic and stacked with backing vocals. No wonder TikTok immediately embraced it. \u201cNasty\u201d is for dancing, a song that evokes a quote regularly attributed to Oscar Wilde: a vertical expression of a horizontal urge.",
      "Of any contemporary pop performer, Post Malone has benefitted the most from his ability to shapeshift. In an alternative universe, it might be hard to think of the \u201cWhite Iverson\u201d rapper launching a successful country career. In this one, it makes too much sense \u2014 the Texas musician has been dropping \u201cma\u2019ams\u201d and \u201csirs\u201d in his speech since day one, and his signature autotuned vibrato works across the genre spectrum. (It's that same idiosyncrasy that had both Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift calling him for features this year.) But it is his red solo cup collaboration with controversial hitmaker Morgan Wallen that undoubtedly made waves, an immediate anthem for hanging out in the bed of a pickup truck or at a backyard barbecue.",
      "One of the biggest music stories of the last few years has been the increasing popularity of regional Mexican music \u2014 a thrilling reflection of Latin music's continued global growth. But the artists at the center of the movement, including Peso Pluma, know that their music succeeds because it both celebrates tradition and transcends it, like in his gruff rapping over corridos. In Kali Uchis' \u201cIgual Que Un \u00c1ngel,\u201d Pluma experiments with new genres entirely, and she welcomes him into her world. Here, Uchis' glossy, shimmery disco dream-pop is the foundation, and Pluma's stony vocal tone a smooth accent. It's an addictive song, and a reminder of the power at the heart of inventive collaborations.",
      "A vocal harmony between Waxahatchee\u2019s Katie Crutchfield and MJ Lenderman is a marvel from the jump \u2014 two kindred spirits, schooled in folky Americana and raised in DIY punk \u2014 but that\u2019s only one fraction of the magic of \u201cRight Back to It.\u201d The song considers long-term relationships, the kind of love that can be tested, steady, reliable and, at times, restive. \u201cI let my mind run wild / Don\u2019t know why I do it,\u201d she sings, \u201cBut you just settle in like a song with no end.\u201d"

      "UNESCO has inscribed ethnic Slovak na\u00efve paintings from a village in Serbia on its list of intangible cultural heritage",
      "KOVACICA, Serbia -- Nearly a century ago, two farmers in an ethnic Slovak village in northern Serbia started painting to pass the time during the long winter months. This week, their art is being inscribed on UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage list.",
      "The farmers' paintings and those of others from the village of Kovacica are what is known as na\u00efve art \u2014 a form that depicts everyday scenes, landscapes, village life and farm surroundings with a childlike simplicity.",
      "With their bright colors and folk motives, the self-taught na\u00efve painters of Kovacica, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) northeast of Belgrade, Serbia's capital, have developed a unique tradition among the country's ethnic Slovak minority.",
      "\u201cNa\u00efve art in Kovacica began in 1939 when Martin Paluska and Jan Sokol started painting,\u201d explained Ana Zolnaj Barca, the head of the Gallery of Na\u00efve Art in the village. \u201cThey were farmers with only four grades of elementary school.\u201d",
      "Paluska and Sokol initially painted scenes they saw on postcards, such as Venetian gondolas or wild animals, explained Zolnaj Barca. But their art really bloomed over time, when they turned to their own surroundings rather than far-away lands, she said.",
      "The village's na\u00efve art gallery, established in 1955, now holds the works of nearly 50 recognized artists and hosts some 20,000 visitors each year.",
      "Among its most famous artists is Zuzana Chalupova, who often painted children and whose work was featured on millions of UNICEF postcards. Another Kovacica artist, Martin Jonas, depicted farmers with oversized hands and feet but small heads \u2014 meant to symbolize their hard-working life.",
      "And though the Kovacica style of na\u00efve paintings originated in the village, it has since spread far beyond the area.",
      "\u201cAn identifying factor, the practice is a means of transmitting the cultural heritage and history of the Slovak community in Serbia,\u201d UNESCO said in its citation.",
      "Serbia\u2019s government said Tuesday that the UNESCO decision to inscribe Kovacica's na\u00efve paintings confirms the Balkan nation\u2019s \u201cpromotion of cultural diversity.\u201d",
      "For gallerist and expert Pavel Babka, na\u00efve art represents a treasure chest of traditional ways and customs \u2014 he points to a painting in his gallery showing a girl in traditional Slovak multi-layered skirt being sent off to church alone for the first time.",
      "Another painting in Babka's gallery features a horse-drawn cart and a yellow house dating back to Austro-Hungarian times, testifying of the long presence of the ethnic Slovak community in what is today Serbia.",
      "Contemporary na\u00efve artists, Babka said, often also seek inspiration in the tales of the past and \u201cwould rather paint a horse than a tractor.\u201d",
      "Artist Stefan Varga, 65, agrees. He said he paints images based on the \u201cstories my grandmother told me from when she was a little girl.\"",
      "Those times weren't easy but they were \u201csimple and beautiful,\u201d he said.",
      "Varga\u2019s paintings feature cheerful, red-cheeked villagers in traditional clothes, bright colors, farm animals and huge pumpkins. The main characteristics of na\u00efve painting are \u201cjoy and purity, the purity of heart and colors,\" he said.",
      "\u201cNa\u00efve painters usually use simple colors,\u201d said Varga. They \u201cuse the simplest way to say what they want to say so everybody can understand them, whether they are Chinese, Japanese, English or Serb.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 15:54:29 -0500",

      "More than two dozen historic prints that depict Native American life and culture on the Upper Missouri River nearly 200 years ago will soon be more accessible to the public, thanks to a donation",
      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- More than two dozen historic prints that depict a slice of Native American life and culture on the Upper Missouri River nearly 200 years ago will soon be more accessible to the public thanks to a gift that enabled a North Dakota organization to buy the rare aquatints.",
      "The State Historical Society of North Dakota on Wednesday presented four of the 26 aquatints reproduced from 1839 to 1843 from works done by Swiss-born artist Karl Bodmer. He made the artwork during his journey from 1832 to 1834 with Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied across the U.S., as far west as present-day Montana.",
      "The Historical Society is reviewing the prints, which for some time had been stored at a San Francisco arthouse, and will develop a plan to exhibit the images, State Historical Society spokeswoman Kara Haff, said.",
      "The aquatints are notable in part because they are more vibrant than most historic black and white imagery, State Historical Society Director Bill Peterson said.",
      "\u201cIt's not incredibly often that we get a chance to look at the richness of the color and the vibrancy and what the paintings represent and what the art represents,\u201d Peterson said.",
      "The aquatints are presumed to be from an original collection by Bodmer. Aquatints were common in his era and often were used to illustrate books, said David Borlaug, an owner of Masters Gallery in Bismarck, which facilitated the acquisition.",
      "\u201cAn original painting would then be converted to metal, copper or steel, by an engraver, which is an art form all of its own, in reverse, and then they would pull a print, if you will, off that plate, usually with just one or two colors. Then the next set of artisans would come in, watercolor artists who would hand-tint, add all the colors to each image, one by one by one,\u201d Borlaug said.",
      "The images depict a variety of scenes and people, Haff said, including Fort Union, a Mandan village, an Arikara warrior, Mandan chief Mato Tope or Four Bears, the funeral scaffold of a Sioux chief, Mandan dog sledges, bison hunting, a scalp dance and travelers along the Missouri River.",
      "The artworks are printed in textbooks and accessible in other formats and reproduced in other ways, Haff said. But it is rare to have ownership of prints made during the initial publishing, she said. Bodmer's images were created for a book by Maximilian, \u201cTravels in the Interior of North America,\u201d she said.",
      "Bodmer used ink and pencil for sketching but also used watercolors, Borlaug said.",
      "His images are beautiful pieces and an important component of the history of the American West, said Dakota Goodhouse, a Native American historian and enrolled member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. But some of Bodmer's artworks are posed and set up, which can misinform the viewer of the daily life of Native American peoples, he said.",
      "\u201cWhen Four Bears got all dressed up for Bodmer's portrait, it's not like he went about his everyday life completely dressed up,\u201d Goodhouse said.",
      "Given the Native American subjects, Goodhouse said he thinks a percentage of sales of Bodmer's prints today could go toward supporting contemporary Native American efforts to improve education, health and housing.",
      "Several years after Bodmer\u2019s journey, a smallpox epidemic in 1837 nearly destroyed the tribes he portrayed along the Upper Missouri. Amy Mossett, a member of the State Historical Board and education administrator for the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation\u2019s Tribal Education, said entire families died and people had no time to save or pass along material possessions.",
      "\u201cSo much was lost, and so when I look at these images, it just kind of preserves ... the images of our culture when it was still very active and still very much alive,\u201d said Mossett, a Mandan/Hidatsa member of the MHA Nation.",
      "To have the aquatints back in the area where they originated may be serendipitous but also destiny, she said.",
      "\u201cJust thinking about the whole circular approach to life, I think there's just a reason why they came back here and this is really where they belong,\u201d Mossett said.",
      "The State Historical Society is still tracing where the artworks' provenance. North Dakota history lover Sam McQuade Jr. donated $150,000 to the State Historical Society of North Dakota Foundation, which worked with Masters Gallery and purchased the artworks and donated them to the State Historical Society for its permanent collection."

      "Amy Adams' grounding presence \u2014 and brave honesty \u2014 resonates throughout \u201cNightbitch,\u201d a story of how one woman experiences the shattering loneliness that comes with leaving work and staying home all day with her young son",
      "The question sounds so basic and friendly. But it\u2019s actually loaded, as many mothers can attest. \u201cDo you just love getting to be home with him all the time?\u201d asks the younger, more put-together woman in the supermarket. \u201cMust be so wonderful.\u201d",
      "Wonderful, of course \u2014 and sometimes brain-numbing and soul-draining too, some exhausted fulltime moms might reply. Especially if, like Amy Adams\u2019 character in Marielle Heller's \u201cNightbitch,\" they\u2019d left their prized art gallery job to this other woman.",
      "And so Adams responds, twice, showing in this very opening scene exactly why her typically brave, brutally frank performance lifts this movie from an oddly uneven script to something unequivocally worth seeing.",
      "First we get the honest answer, the one no one really gives until later in the shower: she feels \u201cstuck inside of a prison of my own creation,\u201d where she torments herself and ends up binge-eating Fig Newtons to keep from crying. She is angry all the time. Oh and, she has gotten dumber.",
      "Then we rewind and director-writer Heller has Adams give her real answer: \u201cI do, I love it! I love being a Mom.\u201d",
      "There we are, two minutes and 13 seconds into \u201cNightbitch\u201d and you may already find yourself wowed by Adams. If not, just wait until her Mother is sitting at a chic restaurant with a bunch of colleagues from the art world, and her fangs come out.",
      "And we don\u2019t mean figuratively. We mean literally.",
      "Let\u2019s go back to the beginning, shall we?",
      "\u201cNightbitch\u201d is based on the 2021 novel by Rachel Yoder, a feminist fable that the author has said came from her own malaise when pausing work for child-rearing.",
      "She sets her tale in an unidentified suburb of an unidentified city. Mother (characters all have generic names), formerly an admired installation artist, spends her weekdays alone with her adorable, blond 2-year old Son. Husband has a job that seems to bring him home only on weekends.",
      "The early scenes depicting Mother\u2019s life are tight and impactful, a contrast to the confused havoc that will come toward the end of the film. Life revolves around the playground and the home, with occasional trips to storytime at the library where she notes, in narration, that she has no interest in the company of other moms \u2014 why should they be friends just because they're moms?",
      "In fact, Mother lives in solitude, and director Heller does a nice job illustrating how that feels. You can almost feel the weight of the afternoon coming around, at this comfortable but hardly ostentatious home, when it\u2019s too early for dinner and you\u2019ve done all the activities already and you wonder if you can make it through the day.",
      "Then things start to get weird. In the bathroom mirror, Mother starts noticing things. Her teeth are getting sharper. There\u2019s something weird coming out of an apparent cyst at the bottom of her spine. She finds extra nipples. And that\u2019s before she starts eating rare meat. (Also, if you love cats, you may want to close your eyes at one point.)",
      "Somehow Adams, who also produces here, makes these things seem, if not quite natural, then logical. What's happening is that Mother\u2019s frustration is becoming ferocious. Dangerously ferocious. But also \u2014 empowering. At night, or so she thinks, she is a wild dog.",
      "Aspects of the film work wonderfully. Mother\u2019s relationship with Son (twins Arleigh and Emmett Snowden) is lovely, largely due to a decision to let the young boys talk freely, with the adult actors reacting to their words. It lends a grounding realism to a film that quickly veers surreal.",
      "Less successful is the relationship between Mother and Husband (Scoot McNairy), which takes on too much importance as the film goes on, in a baffling way. (Also, just asking, has anyone in this movie ever heard of a babysitter?)",
      "More importantly, a story that posits itself on such a tantalizing idea \u2014 that by transforming into a dog, Mother discovers her true nature and power \u2014 resorts late in the game to a safer story about a marriage that never seemed appealing enough for us to care about anyway. It doesn't help that it's hard to grasp the distracting subplot about Mother\u2019s own mother.",
      "None of this takes away from the strength of Adams\u2019 performance. You believe her love for her child as much as you believe her resentment for what he is taking away from her. And Adams can make almost any line work, including one about a walnut. But we digress.",
      "It\u2019s an irony that for reasons of storytelling, characters have generic names \u2014 because Adams is such a singular and particular talent. The journey she embarks upon is bizarre indeed, but you won\u2019t regret taking it with her.",
      "\u201cNightbitch,\u201d a Searchlight Pictures release, has been rated R by the Motion Picture Association \u201cfor language and some sexuality. \u201c Running time: 98 minutes. Two stars out of four."

      "Associated Press Music Writer Maria Sherman has chosen 10 of the best albums of 2024",
      "NEW YORK -- Ten of the top albums of the year, as chosen by Associated Press Music Writer Maria Sherman.",
      "She rode in on a white horse, in patriotic chaps and wielding an American flag. She declared, this \u201cain\u2019t a Country album\u201d but \u201ca \u2018Beyonc\u00e9\u2019 album\u201d \u2014 positioning herself in opposition to the genre's rigid power structures. And yet, she made the year\u2019s best country (and then some) release: Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cAct ll: Cowboy Carter,\u201d a 78-minute, 27-track masterclass in inherited and uncelebrated histories, pulling from the Black and brown performers at the core of country's canon, and providing visibility to oft-overlooked progenitors. It\u2019s heard in the inclusion of Linda Martell, the first Black woman to play the Grand Ole Opry. And it\u2019s heard in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s natural twang, a return to form for the Texas native \u2014 at times, a vibrato that pulls directly from the earth. It may only be 2024, but it's hard to imagine this record not being considered one of the decade's best.",
      "It wasn\u2019t just brat summer, babes, but a brat movement: English singer-songwriter Charli XCX\u2019s sixth album altered the language of 2024. The music oscillates between hedonism and anxiety \u2014 \u201cthe euphoria of a late night on the dancefloor and the creeping disquietude of the morning after,\u201d as the AP reviewed it \u2014 but also manages to bring the underground's pop queen into the mainstream without compromising her vision. There was a period where Charli XCX\u2019s collaborations with the future-seeking PC Music collective and producer A .G. Cook seemed too progressive for everyday ears. But \u201cBrat,\u201d and its vomit-chartreuse iconography, resonated. Listeners were ready to return to the rave \u2014 or attend for the very first time \u2014 and dance-pop music is far more interesting for it.",
      "When alligators kill, they do what is known as a \u201cdeath roll\u201d: They sink their teeth into their prey and spin rapidly, flipping their bodies in and out of the water, drowning, disorienting and dismembering whatever was unlucky enough to get in its way. Florida rapper Doechii\u2019s breakout mixtape, \u201cAlligator Bites Never Heal,\u201d embodies that kind of intensity \u2014 not in aggression, per se, but in acuity \u2014 for a versatile album that teeters from the romance of her smooth R&B and the particularity of her flows. Single \u201cBoom Bap\u201d made her greatness known. Tracks like \u201cCatfish\u201d confirm it.",
      "Last year, AP named \u201cRat Saw God,\u201d the album from Asheville alt-country indie rockers Wednesday, as one of 2023\u2019s best. The band features MJ Lenderman, whose \u201cManning Fireworks\u201d is almost frustratingly addictive. It's a record of hilariously evocative moments from pathetic people (or is it pathetic moments from hilariously evocative people?) atop purposeful, easy slacker rock melodies. From there, it's a kaleidoscope of brilliant lyrical short stories. (An oft-quoted favorite of his cult following? \u201cKahl\u00faa shooter / DUI scooter\u201d from \u201cJoker Lips.\u201d) For fans of alternative music, it is an immediate classic. We\u2019d suggest placing \u201cManning Fireworks\u201d next to Pavement on your record shelf, but it's unlikely to leave your turntable.",
      "When Amy Winehouse first emerged, she was celebrated for being a once-in-a-generation voice, an old soul in a modern world \u2014 not overly sentimental or stuck, but an artist willing to communicate with the past to make art in the future. In many ways, the same can be said about Kali Uchis and her 2024 album, \u201cOrqu\u00eddeas.\u201d Her superpower is her syrupy voice, which feels in time and out of it \u2014 classically and effortlessly smoothing over and disrupting her lush sonic worlds. If 2024 is about fluidity \u2014 of genre, language, love, loss and divination \u2014 Uchis provides a roadmap from restrained reggaeton to alt-R&B.",
      "The holidays arrived early this year when Pulitzer Prize-winning rapper Kendrick Lamar surprise released \u201cGNX\" in late November. It is his first album since 2022\u2019s \u201cMr. Morale & the Big Steppers\u201d \u2014 and perhaps more tellingly, his first since his victory lap over Drake in their recently reignited beef that inspired one of the year\u2019s best songs, \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d In full, \u201cGNX\u201d builds off the promise of his blockbuster single \u2014 West Coast hip-hop showboating from one of the greatest living rappers anywhere. But it\u2019s Lamar\u2019s performance that makes this one of the year\u2019s best. As the AP reviewed, it is his effortless ability to \u201cswitch cadences and lyrical perspectives mid-song\u201d and seemingly limitless breath control that stand out.",
      "It often seems like there is no record Billie Eilish can\u2019t break, no accomplishment she cannot summit. So where was she to go, at just 22, with her third studio album? Up, as it turns out. \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft\u201d is a 10-track testament to her own ambition. It fuses insights pulled from her first two records \u2014 the gothic humor and unusual production of her first record and the classist detours of her second \u2014 but wizened. There are the fan favorites of \u201cLunch\u201d and \u201cBirds of a Feather,\u201d but also standouts like \u201cChihiro,\u201d with its delicate promise and techno-house crescendo at its coda. No one is doing it like her.",
      "Upon first listen, if New Jersey guitar virtuoso Mk.gee confounds, do not worry. He is a 2024 success story who emerged fully formed and completely unusual, only to make fans of everyone from Justin Bieber to Eric Clapton \u2014 and their influence is heard throughout \u201cTwo Star & The Dream Police.\u201d The record is gauzy, ripe for a \u201clo-fi music to study to\u201d playlist, but also commands attention for its spaced-out production and sparkling pop, all reliant on the malleability of his guitar compositions. Those range from sticky staccato to a kind of soulful \u201980s melodicism.",
      "Hurray for the Riff Raff, the musical moniker of Alynda Segarra, has long studied Americana, blues, and folk punk, perfecting their craft with each new release. On the narrative \u201cThe Past Is Still Alive,\u201d their eighth studio album, Segarra pulls from their background as a hitchhiker, train hopper and outsider artist to document the kind of life-altering adventures \u2014 ugly and rejuvenating \u2014 that can only happen far from home. It\u2019s a beautiful portrayal of the U.S. \u2014 all big skies, starry nights and idiosyncratic people \u2014 as well as dumpster diving, shoplifting, addiction, politics, queer bars and poetry. In a word: America.",
      "Nearly a decade ago, Helado Negro \u2014 the bilingual musical project of Roberto Carlos Lange \u2014 released the single \u201cYoung, Latin and Proud,\u201d a celebratory exploration of Latino identity that became a rallying cry for indie kids with similar heritage. It doubles as a kind of framework in which to think about all of his art, in particular, the inventive, breezy, slow synths of \u201cPhasor.\u201d The album, recorded in English and Spanish, uses electronic sounds to express inspirations pulled from nature. It's a wide-ranging release, effervescent and ambitious, easy to listen to and joy to dissect."

      "Mayberry\u2019s striking voice has been central to CHVRCHES' electro-pop since the trio started making music together in 2011. It is sharp and distinct, a key instrument used alongside Iain Cook and Martin Doherty's synths to create a sound that has endured throughout the subsequent decade. Now, her soprano voices feelings and experiences uniquely hers \u2014 adding a fire to a project all about ownership.",
      "\u201cMust be something in the air,\u201d she declares on the album\u2019s opening track. And later: \u201cToo much noise might leave you on your own.\u201d",
      "Throughout the album, she explores past relationships, family, the music industry and memory.",
      "\u201cI killed myself to be one of the boys,\u201d she sings on \u201cSorry, etc.\u201d bluntly listing the concessions she's had to make in order to exceed in the male-dominated music business. \u201cI bit my tongue to be one of the boys/I sold my soul to be one of the boys,\" she continues, the chorus morphing into a confessional chant. Above drums and piercing electronic production, the song is all angst and theatrical flair \u2014 particularly on the final, whispered verse \u2014 and feels distinctly Mayberry.",
      "On \u201cChange Shapes,\u201d she details how and why that self-sacrificing happens. \u201cI change shapes till I get what I want from you,\" she sings over a bouncy guitar and steady percussion. \u201cPunch Drunk\u201d is just that, a lively song atop analog crackles and loose riffs. \u201cMantra\u201d uses a warbled beat to a hypnotic effect, as Mayberry takes on an enemy.",
      "Those moments \u2014 the ones where Mayberry brawls, heard in her lyrics and the wolf howling back at the boy crying wolf in \u201cCrocodile Tears\" \u2014 are some of the album's best.",
      "But there are dialed back moments as well \u2014 quieter songs, the furthest from her work with CHVRCHES \u2014 and they come with their own revelations.",
      "Those songs, like the acoustic guitar led \u201cAnywhere But Dancing,\" and piano ballads \u201cOh, Mother\u201d and \u201cAre You Awake,\" are anchors for the project. They serve as reminders that \u201cVicious Creature\" was motivated by Mayberry's desire to center her storytelling as a soloist, the parts, it can be assumed, suppressed in her previous pursuits.",

      "Donald Trump isn't even in office yet, but he says he's already accomplished more than President Joe Biden did in his entire term",
      "GREENVALE, N.Y. -- Not yet even in office, Donald Trump said Thursday he's already accomplished more than President Joe Biden did in his entire term, an outsized claim by the president-elect just a month out from the election.",
      "Trump, who has been largely ensconced at his Mar-a-Lago club in recent weeks as he's worked to staff his new administration, made the comment as he ventured to New York's Long Island to be honored as part of Fox Nation\u2019s annual Patriot Awards on Fox's streaming platform.",
      "\u201cI think you have seen more happen in the last two weeks than you have in the last four years,\u201d Trump told the crowd at the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts.",
      "\u201cIt was a tremendous day, a tremendous night,\u201d he said, recalling his election victory in a 10-minute acceptance speech that sounded like a highlight reel of his campaign rally speeches. It came complete with a live performance of \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d by the singer Lee Greenwood, calls to \u201cget the criminals out of our country\u201d and an embrace of all-paper election ballots and mandatory voter ID.",
      "Trump also pointed to the conversations he's had with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum since he threatened two of the country's top trading partners with a 25% tariff on all imported goods unless they do more to tackle illegal border crossings and drug flows.",
      "\u201cJustin came flying right in,\u201d Trump said in reference to Trudeau's trip to Mar-a-Lago. That prompted some in the audience to chant \u201c51!\u201d \u2014 a nod to Trump apparently joking at his dinner with Trudeau that Canada could become the 51st U.S. state.",
      "The annual awards \u201chonor and recognize America\u2019s finest patriots, including military veterans, first responders and other inspirational everyday heroes,\u201d according to Fox. The event was hosted by Fox host Sean Hannity, a longtime Trump friend who stepped in after the president-elect nominated Pete Hegseth, the original host, as defense secretary.",
      "Among those recognized Thursday night were conservative actor and evangelist Kirk Cameron; Gen. Dick Cody, who used his own helicopter to deliver supplies to people after Hurricane Helene; and Jonathan Diller, the New York Police Department officer who was killed during a traffic stop in Queens. His widow, Stephanie, received a standing ovation and thanked Trump for his support. Others invoked Trump as well.",
      "The ceremony also honored Paws of War, an organization that provides service dogs to veterans and helps those serving overseas bring animals they meet in war zones to the U.S.",
      "The heartfelt moments were juxtaposed against the kind of boisterous and incendiary political fare that loyal watchers of Fox hosts like Hannity expect.",
      "The anchor used his introduction to take an election victory lap, boasting that Democrats \u201cgot their ass kicked.\" He played \u201cYMCA\u201d \u2014 the song Trump has long used to close out his rallies \u2014 and invited audience members to dance like the president-elect. And he offered a series of impressions, mimicking former vice presidential candidate Tim Walz\u2019s enthusiasm and Biden appearing lost, complete with a backdrop of the rainforest where he spoke during a recent trip to the Amazon.",
      "Later, he donned an orange safety vest \u2014 a nod to the one Trump wore when he delivered a press conference from a garbage truck during the campaign after Biden suggested Trump\u2019s supporters were garbage.",
      "Trump's award marks the culmination of Fox's reembrace of the president-elect, who has had an up-and-down relationship with the network in recent years.",
      "Fox paid $787 million in 2023 to settle a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems over false claims by Fox personalities who echoed Trump's lies that the 2020 election was stolen from him through mass voter fraud. For more than six months ending in spring 2023, Fox had what many considered a \u201csoft ban\u201d on Trump appearances, with its leaders looking to move on. But when it became clear that voters did not want to, Fox and its personalities were quick to embrace Trump again.",
      "Individual personalities have undergone their own journeys: Former Fox host Megyn Kelly drew Trump\u2019s ire in a 2015 debate for her sharp question about his treatment of women; now she\u2019s a popular podcast host and Trump supporter. The Dominion lawsuit uncovered emails in which former Fox host Tucker Carlson spoke disparagingly of Trump, including saying he \u201ctruly can\u2019t wait\u201d for Trump to become an ex-president. They\u2019ve since made amends.",
      "Through it all, Trump has been quick to take to social media to criticize Fox for content he deems insufficiently loyal.",
      "On Thursday, he was more magnanimous.",
      "\u201cYou have incredible people at Fox,\" he said before quipping, \u201cA couple I don\u2019t like.\"",
      "Trump has begun to emerge more in public since spending most of his transition so far behind closed doors at his club in Palm Beach, Florida. This week, he made an unannounced appearance at a memorial service for three Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputies who were killed in a car crash last month.",
      "This weekend, he will travel to Paris to join other world leaders and dignitaries for a ceremony to celebrate the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral, which was devastated by a fire five years ago.",

      "Lucinda Williams isn't easily intimidated, but it would be hard for any musician not to shudder at the task before her.",
      "The mission? Record an album of Beatles songs \u2014 only one of the best-known catalogs in popular music \u2014 in the same London studio where most of the originals were made. She and her band had just three days.",
      "The result, \u201cLucinda Williams sings the Beatles from Abbey Road,\u201d becomes public on Friday. It's the seventh in her series of \u201cLu's Jukebox\u201d projects and the first one that will be made available on streaming services.",
      "The Nashville-based singer-songwriter delivers her take on 12 Beatles songs, most of them from the band's later period. She takes on hits like the Paul McCartney ballads \u201cLet it Be\u201d and \u201cThe Long and Winding Road,\" while also choosing the more obscure \u201cWhite Album\u201d cuts \u201cYer Blues\u201d and \u201cI'm So Tired.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt felt like the Holy Grail,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is where the Beatles recorded. And we're going to go in there where they made all of these majestic, classic, amazing songs?\u201d",
      "Abbey Road was the idea of her manager-husband, Tom Overby, and they blocked out a small amount of time before a British tour earlier this year. Her Beatles fan producer, Ray Kennedy, said he believed Williams was the first major artist to use the London studio to remake the band's work.",
      "And, yes, it was intimidating. Fortunately, it was a modern, working studio and did not feel like working in a museum. One quirk was the control room was on a different floor than where the musicians were, and Williams repeatedly climbed the stairs to hear playbacks. \u201cThe engineers all looked at me, like, \u2018what are you doing here,'\u201d she said.",
      "Stripping down songs for the band to build up again revealed complexities they hadn't anticipated. She particularly enjoyed John Lennon's \u201cYer Blues.\u201d \u201cThe depth and the edginess and the grittiness of it kind of surprised me,\" she said.",
      "They stuck to the basics of her rock band's sound. The orchestral flourishes of \u201cThe Long and Winding Road,\u201d for example, are replaced by an organ and pedal-steel guitar.",
      "\u201cMy greatest fear was, I didn't want to sound like a cover band doing Beatles songs,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd everyone I've talked to about it said you don't have to worry about that, that you achieved your goal of staying true to the songs while still sounding like you.\u201d",
      "During the pandemic, Williams made six \u201cLu's Jukebox\u201d projects, themed in-studio concerts. They included Tom Petty and Bob Dylan songs, albums of Southern soul, '60s country classics and holiday music. She made a disc of Rolling Stones material only days before having a stroke in November 2020.",
      "Sold largely by mail order, they haven't been available to stream, although a spokesperson said they're likely to be made available in that format in the future."

      "ATLANTA -- The long-running gang and racketeering trial that led Atlanta rapper Young Thug to plead guilty in October ended on Tuesday with the last two defendants found not guilty of racketeering, murder and gang-related charges.",
      "Deamonte Kendrick, who raps as Yak Gotti, was acquitted of all charges and Shannon Stillwell was found guilty only of gun possession. The verdicts came nearly two years after jury selection began and a year after opening statements in a trial plagued with problems.",
      "The original, sweeping indictment used song lyrics and social media posts as evidence and charged 28 people with conspiring to violate Georgia\u2019s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Young Thug, a Grammy-winning artist whose real name is Jeffery Williams, was set free on probation after he pleaded guilty in October to gang, drug and gun charges.",
      "Kendrick and Stillwell were charged in a 2015 drive-by shooting outside an Atlanta barbershop that killed Donovan Thomas Jr., also known as \u201cBig Nut,\u201d who prosecutors said was in a rival gang. Stillwell also was charged with fatally shooting Shymel Drinks at a red light in 2022, allegedly in retaliation for the killings days earlier of two associates in a gang known as YSL, which prosecutors said was co-founded by Young Thug.",
      "Stillwell was sentenced to the 10-year maximum for possessing a firearm as a convicted felon previously convicted of a felony involving a gun, with credit for the two years he already served and the balance to be served on probation.",
      "Nine of the defendants, including the rapper Gunna, accepted plea deals before the trial began, and four more pleaded guilty during the trial, in October. Charges against 12 others remain pending. Prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case. That left Kendrick and Stillwell, both of whom were stabbed while in jail \u2014 Stillwell last year and Kendrick on Sunday.",
      "Tuesday's verdicts were a major setback for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. Critics had criticized her use of the state\u2019s anti-racketeering law, which she also used to bring charges against President-elect Donald Trump for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "\u201cWe always respect the verdict of a jury,\u201d said Jeff DiSantis, a spokesperson for Willis.",
      "Defense attorneys said the state relied on faulty evidence \u2014 song lyrics, cherry-picked social media posts and unreliable witness testimony \u2014 to create a misleading narrative about young men who turned to music to escape economic hardship and difficult pasts.",
      "The jury's decision left Kendrick\u2019s mom, Tasha Kendrick, in tears.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just thankful for a lot of things right now,\u201d she said. \u201cMy emotions are all over the place right now.\"",
      "Prosecutors said Williams and two others founded Young Slime Life in association with the national Bloods gang in 2012. The 33-year-old artist also has a record label called Young Stoner Life. Deamonte Kendrick is featured on two of the most popular songs from the label\u2019s compilation album Slime Language 2, \u201cTake It to Trial\u201d and \u201cSlatty,\u201d as well as Young Thug\u2019s \u201cSlime Sh-t,\" which prosecutors presented as evidence.",
      "Williams entered a risky \u201cblind\u201d plea \u2014 meaning he pleaded guilty without an agreement on his sentence \u2014 in October. Williams\u2019 lawyer said he felt like they were winning, but the rapper complained that sitting in court felt like \u201chell\u201d and wanted to go home to his family. Judge Paige Reese Whitaker let him out of jail on probation with tight restrictions, including a 10-year ban from metro Atlanta except for certain occasions.",
      "The trial shook Atlanta\u2019s rap scene. Williams grew up in an Atlanta housing project and became a highly successful artist who added his own melodic twist to the modern Southern trap sound he helped popularize.",
      "Fulton County Superior Court Judge Ural Glanville was removed from the case in July after he met with prosecutors and a state witness without defense attorneys present. Kendrick\u2019s attorney Doug Weinstein said defendants got a \u201cfair trial\u201d once Whitaker took over. Among other things, she reprimanded the prosecution for being disorganized and not sharing evidence.",
      "During closings, Stillwell\u2019s defense attorney Max Schardt sought to cast doubts on the gang investigators and other state witnesses. Several alleged YSL members testified they had lied to police to stay out of prison. Schardt said officers had threatened them with long prison sentences if they didn\u2019t say the right thing.",
      "Prosecutors said those witnesses were honest with police but lied on the stand, in front of the people they had \u201csnitched\u201d on. They said their statements were corroborated by other evidence such as songs and social media posts where they said defendants were \u201cbragging about murder.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors threw together lyrics, social media posts and irrelevant evidence to \u201csee what sticks,\u201d Weinstein argued, but did not prove they were connected to a criminal enterprise.",
      "While defendants did commit crimes in the past, Schardt said during closings, it was to make money for themselves in communities stripped of economic opportunity \u2014 not to advance a gang. And music let some of them move on.",
      "\u201cAs a whole, we know the struggles that these communities have had,\u201d Schardt said. \u201cA sad, tacit acceptance that it\u2019s either rap, prison or death.\u201d",
      "Both defense attorneys said Kendrick and Stillwell have other pending charges but hope to get them released from jail as soon as possible.",
      "Stillwell is not \u201cblind to the fact that he is getting a second chance at life,\" Schardt said.",
      "Weinstein said Kendrick, who is close friends with Young Thug, was laser-focused on his music career before the state pulled him back into the criminal justice system.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so happy that he can kind of draw a line in the sand now,\u201d Weinstein said. \u201cAll of this is behind him. He can get on with his life and not worry about this nonsense.\u201d",

      "Democrats in Michigan are pressing to pass reproductive health care legislation before the party loses its majority with the new legislative session next year",
      "LANSING, Mich. -- Michigan Democrats are pushing this month to pass legislation they say will improve reproductive health care, in particular the safety of digital health data, ahead of Republicans taking over the state House in 2025.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is backing a bill designed to protect reproductive health data including data logged on menstrual cycle tracking apps. Similar legislation that has passed in other states is aimed at keeping the data from being used to target people seeking abortions.",
      "\u201cThis feels like a very urgent need for us to get this done while we have a window in Michigan with the Democratic majority for the next few weeks,\u201d said state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, sponsor of the digital privacy bill.",
      "The rush is a reaction to expectations that it will be harder to pass the reproductive health care policies Democrats favor after Republicans take control of the state House in January. Democrats kept control of the state Senate in the November election.",
      "Republicans have opposed the digital privacy bill over a section they say will stifle anti-abortion advertising.",
      "Other reproductive health bills to be considered during the December session that began Tuesday include a package on Black maternal health and an expansion of access to birth control.",
      "After the overturn of Roe v. Wade, some women in states with strict abortion bans began to worry that their health information could be used to track their reproductive status. Apps that track menstrual cycles became a major focus point.",
      "Abortion is constitutionally protected in Michigan. But McMorrow does not trust President-elect Donald Trump's campaign promise to veto any possible national abortion ban nor his campaign's efforts to distance itself from Project 2025, which proposed a rollback on abortion and contraception access.",
      "Period tracking apps allow women to take detailed day-by-day notes about their health, from how heavy their period flow is to additional symptoms such as cramping. They can log pregnancies and miscarriages.",
      "\u201cThese tools are really valuable,\u201d McMorrow said. \u201cI just want to make sure that the guardrails are there when indications from the incoming federal administration is they would potentially weaponize the data in a way that is very dangerous.\u201d",
      "Federal law bars medical providers from sharing health data without a patient\u2019s consent but doesn\u2019t prevent digital tech companies from tracking menstrual cycles or an individual\u2019s location and selling it to data brokers. Legislation for federal bans have never gained momentum, largely because of opposition from the tech industry.",
      "How the legislation works varies from state to state. Washington state has digital privacy law that broadly covers all health-related data while Virginia has a law that explicitly prohibits the issuance of search warrants, subpoenas or court orders for electronic or digital menstrual health data.",
      "Michigan\u2019s proposal would require businesses or organizations to use reproductive health data only for the services it provides, and consumers must be informed of how the data is being used. In order to sell that data, an entity would need explicit, signed consent from the consumer. Consumers would also have the option to opt out from their data being sold at any time.",
      "It would also regulate retailers, who often compile data to target consumers with advertisements, and the use of geofencing, which allows marketers to target consumers with ads based on their location.",
      "The bill would prohibit identifying who is receiving reproductive health care by using location information and targeting them with advertisements. This would apply to people visiting fertility or abortion clinics.",
      "The geofencing provision of the bill has drawn objection from anti-abortion advocates. Genevieve Marnon, legislative director for Right to Life of Michigan, said in committee testimony Tuesday that the bill would prevent women visiting an abortion clinic from being reached by anti-abortion ads.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t safeguarding women\u2019s reproductive health data,\" she said. \u201cIt is limiting the options presented to women.\u201d",
      "Republican Sen. John Damoose, who voted against the bill in committee, believes the geofencing provision encroaches on freedom of speech and religion by preventing anti-abortion advertising.",
      "The bill was voted out of committee Tuesday on party lines and advanced Thursday toward a final vote in the Senate chamber.",
      "Kimya Forouzan, principal state policy director at the Guttmacher Institute, expects the topic to be taken up by other state legislatures next year. Guttmacher, which supports abortion rights, tracks reproductive health trends.",
      "Over the past two years, Michigan Democrats have passed bills repealing a number of anti-abortion laws, including the state\u2019s 1931 ban, and adding surrogacy protections to state law. Lawmakers are considering a number of others related to reproductive health this month.",
      "A group of bills focused on improving maternal health for Black women would create a doula scholarship, among other measures. The Senate voted its package on the topic through to the House on Tuesday.",
      "Rep. Jaime Churches, a Democrat from the downriver area of Detroit who lost her seat in November, is trying to gain traction for two bills that would require insurance to cover fertility treatments, including in vitro fertilization and intrauterine insemination.",
      "Three bills seeking to expand access to birth control through insurance have passed the state House. McMorrow also introduced a series of bills aimed at providing long-lasting reversible contraception, such an implants or intrauterine devices, to patients who have given birth before they are discharged from a hospital.",
      "There is competition among Democrats for time during this short, lame duck session. Advocates for economic development, infrastructure and gun control measures are among the many looking to push through bills in the month that is left. Major contention over new paid sick leave and minimum wage requirements is likely to garner attention. Those discussions could reduce the amount of time available to debate reproductive health measures.",

      "Thirteen children under the age of 14 have died at hospitals in central Mexico, and authorities suspect contaminated IV feeding bags",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Thirteen children under the age of 14 have died in central Mexico and authorities said Thursday they suspect contaminated IV feeding bags as the culprit.",
      "The federal Health Department ordered doctors across the country not to use IV nutrition bags made by the company Productos Hospitalarios S.A de C.V., though the exact source of the infections is still under investigation. Phone calls to numbers listed for the company and emails seeking comment went unanswered.",
      "The outbreak appeared to be Klebsiella oxytoca, a multidrug-resistant bacteria. It was first detected in November at three government hospitals and one private one in the State of Mexico, on the outskirts of Mexico City.",
      "The department said the children appeared to have died from a blood infection.",
      "So far, of 20 possible cases, the bacteria was ruled out in one case, suspected in four and confirmed in 15 cases. Of the 19 patients, 13 died and the six others are being treated at hospitals.",
      "Asked about the cluster of cases, President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday that health officials \"told me about a case yesterday, but let's say, it's under control.\u201d",
      "It was the latest public blow to Mexico\u2019s tottering, underfunded health care system. Last week, the director of the country\u2019s flagship national cardiology institute said the hospital didn\u2019t have money to buy essential supplies, calling the situation \u201ccritical.\u201d",
      "Dr. Jorge Gaspar, the hospital's director, wrote an internal letter saying that budget cuts \u201chave affected the acquisition of supplies necessary for the institution's functioning.\u201d In a subsequent public letter the next day, he clarified that the initial message was intended for an \u201cinternal\u201d audience and assured the public that \u201cwe are working to solve the situation.\u201d",
      "Mexico has been plagued by contaminated medical supply scandals for years.",
      "In 2023, authorities arrested an anesthesiologist they blamed for an outbreak of meningitis that killed 35 patients and sickened 79.",
      "The doctor, whose name was withheld, apparently carried his own morphine from one private hospital to another, spreading a fungal infection that contaminated the medication at the first clinic, authorities said.",
      "The drug may not have been stored properly. Some smaller hospitals or maternity clinics in Mexico don\u2019t have their own dispensing pharmacies or are not authorized to handle controlled medications like opiates, and thus long relied on anesthesiologists to bring their own.",
      "In 2020, 14 people died after a hospital run by Mexico\u2019s state-owned oil company gave a drug to dialysis patients that was contaminated with bacteria. More than 69 patients were sickened in that outbreak.",
      "Former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who left office on Sept. 30, complained frequently that drug supply companies were charging too much, and so he essentially revamped the whole medical purchasing system, pledging to provide Mexicans a health care that is \u201cbetter than in Denmark.\u201d",
      "However, the new system of government-run warehouses has foundered, plagued by chronic shortages of supplies and drugs, while a gargantuan government supply depot L\u00f3pez Obrador set up and called the \u201cmega drug store\u201d now sits largely empty.",

      "Efforts to reduce the nation's persistently high maternal mortality rates involve state panels of experts that investigate and learn from each mother's death.",
      "The panels \u2014 called maternal mortality review committees \u2014 usually do their work quietly and out of the public eye. But that's not been the case recently in three states with strict abortion laws.",
      "Georgia dismissed all members of its committee in November after information about deaths being reviewed leaked to the news organization ProPublica. Days later, The Washington Post reported that Texas' committee won\u2019t review cases from 2022 and 2023, the first two years after the state banned nearly all abortions. In Idaho, the state let its panel disband in 2023 only to reinstate it earlier this year.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve become more of a lightning rod than they were before,\u201d said epidemiologist Michael Kramer, director of the Center for Rural Health and Health Disparities at Mercer University in Georgia.",
      "Here\u2019s what maternal mortality review committees across the nation do and what might happen next:",
      "\u201cMaternal mortality review committees are important because they are the most comprehensive source of information about maternal mortality that we have,\u201d said David Goodman, who leads the maternal mortality prevention team at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The panels review deaths that occur during pregnancy or within a year after it ends, whether directly related to the pregnancy or not. Causes of death can range from hemorrhage during childbirth to drug overdoses to traffic accidents.",
      "The goal, Kramer said, is to examine maternal deaths and help \"decide what we can do about them.\u201d",
      "All states, a few cities and Puerto Rico have these committees. Their membership varies and may include OB-GYNs, maternal-fetal medicine doctors, nurses, midwives, mental and public health experts and members of patient advocacy groups. Most have representatives from several areas of expertise, which the CDC recommends.",
      "How members are selected also varies; people may apply, submit letters of interest or be invited to serve.",
      "The selection shouldn\u2019t be politically motivated, Kramer said, because \u201cif there\u2019s a systematic exclusion of certain data or certain perspectives\u201d it\u2019s difficult to truly understand what\u2019s happening.",
      "First, the panels work with state vital statistics offices and epidemiologists to identify deaths associated with pregnancy by examining death certificates and looking for a pregnancy checkbox or a related cause of death. They may also search for links to birth and fetal death records, or delve into hospital discharge data, media reports and obituaries.",
      "Once they identify cases, they collect as much information as possible, such as prenatal care records, hospital and social service records, autopsy reports and interviews with family members. Professional \u201cabstractors\u201d distill all this into case narratives, which committee members pore over. Most use a standardized review process developed by the CDC \u2014 and all panels can get help and guidance from the agency.",
      "They consider questions such as: Was the death pregnancy-related? What was the underlying cause? Was it preventable? What factors contributed?",
      "States generally have privacy rules that protect committee members and people who provide information on the deaths.",
      "The groups then issue public reports that don\u2019t name moms or hospitals but include overall findings, trends and recommendations. Some come out a couple of years or more after the deaths.",
      "Across the nation in 2023, Goodman said, 151 recommendations from those reports were implemented by communities, hospitals, medical professionals and policymakers.",
      "Georgia will rebuild its committee through a new application process, the state public health commissioner said.",
      "Texas' committee has been reviewing 2021 deaths and will start on 2024 cases at its next meeting, Texas Department of State Health Services spokesperson Lara Anton said in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cReviewing cases is a lengthy process and legislators have asked for more recent data. Starting the next review cycle with 2024 cases will allow us to provide that in the next report,\u201d Anton said, adding that maternal and child health epidemiologists will continue to analyze and publish data for 2022 and 2023.",
      "In Idaho, the reconstituted review committee now falls under the state board of medicine, which licenses doctors, instead of the state's health and welfare department. It will operate like it always has, said Bob McLaughlin, spokesperson for the medical board. Members met for the first time in November and plan to issue a report by Jan. 31. Because the legislature wanted the most up-to-date information, McLaughlin said the first report will cover only 2023 cases, and the group will review 2022 deaths next.",
      "Goodman said he\u2019s encouraged that every state has a review committee now \u2014 only 20 had them in 2015.",

      "Black and Latino neighborhoods were most vulnerable to the retail pharmacy closures, which can chip away at already-limited care options in those communities, researchers said in a study published Tuesday in Health Affairs.",
      "The trend has potentially gained momentum since the study's timeframe, because many drugstores are still struggling. In the last three years, the major chains Walgreens and CVS have closed hundreds of additional stores, and Rite Aid shrank as it went through a bankruptcy reorganization.",
      "Drugstores have been dealing with shrinking reimbursement for prescriptions, rising costs and changing customer shopping habits. The chains have been closing money-losing stores and transferring prescription files to more profitable locations.",
      "The study found that more than 29% of the nearly 89,000 retail U.S. pharmacies that operated between 2010 and 2020 had closed by 2021. That amounts to more than 26,000 stores.",
      "Researchers using data from the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs found that the number of U.S. pharmacies had actually increased from 2010 to 2017 because of store openings, but the pace of closings picked up starting in 2018.",
      "They also highlighted which stores were more likely to close. Those include independent pharmacies, which were more likely than chain stores to be in Black, Latino and low-income neighborhoods.",
      "Pharmacies in neighborhoods with higher rates of patients on government-funded Medicaid and Medicare also were at greater risk for closing, said Dima Qato, a University of Southern California pharmacy professor who was the study's lead author. Those programs tend to reimburse less than private health insurance.",
      "Researchers also noted that the exclusion of some pharmacies, particularly independent drugstores, from pharmacy benefit manager networks can hurt. That can mean fewer prescriptions and customers visit for those stores.",
      "Retail drugstores can be important sources for vaccinations, contraception, overdose prevention and opioid use disorder treatments, aside from prescriptions, Qato said. She noted that Black and Latino communities often have fewer pharmacies to begin with, so store closings hit residents of those communities particularly hard.",
      "\u201cThere aren\u2019t many other options for them,\u201d she said.",

      "A judge is weighing which of Missouri's sweeping abortion restrictions will fall under a new constitutional amendment",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Abortion-rights advocates on Wednesday asked a judge to overturn Missouri\u2019s near-total ban on the procedure, less than a month after voters backed an abortion-rights constitutional amendment.",
      "Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang did not immediately rule after the hearing. Planned Parenthood and other plaintiffs had asked her to issue a temporary order blocking enforcement of Missouri\u2019s numerous abortion laws.",
      "Emily Wales, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said abortions could begin Friday in clinics in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis if the judge issues the order.",
      "\u201cEvery single day that they cannot access abortion rights they are being denied critical care,\" Wales said of Missouri residents.",
      "Several anti-abortion protesters knelt on the ground as they prayed outside the courthouse during the hearing. They covered their mouths with a red piece of tape that read \u201clife.\u201d",
      "Missouri is one of five states where voters approved ballot measures this year to add the right to an abortion to their state constitutions. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "Reproductive rights advocates in Arizona on Tuesday sued to undo a 15-week abortion ban that conflicts with that state's new constitutional amendment expanding access up to fetal viability.",
      "The Missouri amendment does not specifically override any state laws. Instead the measure leaves it to advocates to ask courts to knock down bans that they believe would now be unconstitutional.",
      "Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, an abortion opponent, last week issued an opinion agreeing that most abortions will be legal when the amendment takes effect Thursday.",
      "But Bailey\u2019s office is still fighting for a ban on most abortions after viability, along with a number of regulations that Planned Parenthood argues made it nearly impossible to offer abortions in the state even before abortion was almost completely banned in 2022.",
      "Missouri\u2019s constitutional amendment allows lawmakers to restrict abortion after viability, with exceptions to \u201cprotect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.\u201d",
      "The term \u201cviability\u201d is used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Though there\u2019s no defined time frame, doctors say it is sometime after the 21st week of pregnancy.",
      "Other abortion laws that Bailey is defending include a 72-hour waiting period before an abortion can be performed; bans on abortions based on race, sex or a possible Down syndrome diagnosis; and a requirement that medical facilities that provide abortions be licensed as ambulatory surgical centers.",
      "Missouri Solicitor General Josh Divine argued in court that the right to reproductive freedom includes the right to childbirth, which he said supports laws such as the state's 72-hour waiting period.",
      "\u201cThose laws are enabling childbirth,\u201d he said. \"They are giving time to choose childbirth.\u201d",
      "But Planned Parenthood Federation of America attorney Ella Spottswood during the hearing told the judge that by 2019, the slew of Missouri laws regulating abortion had effectively limited access to a single St. Louis clinic.",
      "\u201cThe voters have changed all that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe questions should begin and end with the amendment.\u201d",
      "It is unclear when Zhang will rule on the request for a preliminary injunction.",

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 19:06:23 -0500",

    "story": [
      "Social media users are misrepresenting a Vermont Supreme Court ruling, falsely claiming that it gives schools permission to vaccinate children even if their parents do not consent",
      "Social media users are misrepresenting a Vermont Supreme Court ruling, claiming that it gives schools permission to vaccinate children even if their parents do not consent.",
      "The ruling addressed a lawsuit filed by Dario and Shujen Politella against Windham Southeast School District and state officials over the mistaken vaccination of their child against COVID-19 in 2021, when he was 6 years old. A lower court had dismissed the original complaint, as well as an amended version. An appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was filed on Nov. 19.",
      "But the ruling by Vermont's high court is not as far-reaching as some online have claimed. In reality, it concluded that anyone protected under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, or PREP, Act is immune to state lawsuits.",
      "Here's a closer look at the facts.",
      "CLAIM: The Vermont Supreme Court ruled that schools can vaccinate children against their parents' wishes.",
      "THE FACTS: The claim stems from a July 26 ruling by the Vermont Supreme Court, which found that anyone protected by the PREP Act is immune to state lawsuits, including the officials named in the Politella's suit. The ruling does not authorize schools to vaccinate children at their discretion.",
      "According to the lawsuit, the Politella's son \u2014 referred to as L.P. \u2014 was given one dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at a vaccination clinic held at Academy School in Brattleboro even though his father, Dario, told the school's assistant principal a few days before that his son was not to receive a vaccination. In what officials described as a mistake, L.P. was removed from class and had a \u201chandwritten label\u201d put on his shirt with the name and date of birth of another student, L.K., who had already been vaccinated that day. L.P. was then vaccinated.",
      "Ultimately, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that officials involved in the case could not be sued.",
      "\u201cWe conclude that the PREP Act immunizes every defendant in this case and this fact alone is enough to dismiss the case,\u201d the Vermont Supreme Court's ruling reads. \u201cWe conclude that when the federal PREP Act immunizes a defendant, the PREP Act bars all state-law claims against that defendant as a matter of law.\u201d",
      "The PREP Act, enacted by Congress in 2005, authorizes the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to issue a declaration in the event of a public health emergency providing immunity from liability for activities related to medical countermeasures, such as the administration of a vaccine, except in cases of \u201cwillful misconduct\" that result in \u201cdeath or serious physical injury.\u201d A declaration against COVID-19 was issued on March 17, 2020. It is set to expire on Dec. 31. Federals suits claiming willful misconduct are filed in Washington.",
      "Social media users described the Vermont Supreme Court's ruling as having consequences beyond what it actually says.",
      "\u201cThe Vermont Supreme Court has ruled that schools can force-vaccinate children for Covid against the wishes of their parents,\u201d reads one X post that had been liked and shared approximately 16,600 times as of Tuesday. \u201cThe high court ruled on a case involving a 6-year-old boy who was forced to take a Covid mRNA injection by his school. However, his family had explicitly stated that they didn't want their child to receive the \u2018vaccines.\u2019\u201d",
      "Other users alleged that the ruling gives schools permission to give students any vaccine without parental consent, not just ones for COVID-19.",
      "Rod Smolla, president of the Vermont Law and Graduate School and an expert on constitutional law, told The Associated Press that the ruling \u201cmerely holds that the federal statute at issue, the PREP Act, preempts state lawsuits in cases in which officials mistakenly administer a vaccination without consent.\u201d",
      "\u201cNothing in the Vermont Supreme Court opinion states that school officials can vaccinate a child against the instructions of the parent,\u201d he wrote in an email.",
      "Asked whether the claims spreading online have any merit, Ronald Ferrara, an attorney representing the Politellas, told the AP that although the ruling doesn't say schools can vaccinate students regardless of parental consent, officials could interpret it to mean that they could get away with doing so under the PREP Act, at least when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines. He explained that the U.S. Supreme Court appeal seeks to clarify whether the Vermont Supreme Court interpreted the PREP Act beyond what Congress intended.",
      "\u201cThe Politella\u2019s fundamental liberty interest to decide whether their son should receive elective medical treatment was denied by agents of the State and School,\u201d he wrote in an email to the AP. \u201cThe Vermont Court misconstrues the scope of PREP Act immunity (which is conditioned upon informed consent for medical treatments unapproved by FDA), to cover this denial of rights and its underlying battery.\u201d",
      "Ferrara added that he was not aware of the claims spreading online, but that he \u201ccan understand how lay people may conflate the court's mistaken grant of immunity for misconduct as tantamount to blessing such misconduct.\u201d",
      "John Klar, who also represents the Politellas, went a step further, telling the AP that the Vermont Supreme Court ruling means that \u201cas a matter of law\u201d schools can get away with vaccinating students without parental consent and that parents can only sue on the federal level if death or serious bodily injury results.",

      "The women were each sentenced to four years in prison after being found guilty of selling, buying or exchanging a person for cross-border transfer, the Kandal Provincial Court said late Monday.",
      "According to the verdict, two of the four years in prison were suspended, meaning they won't have to be served unless they're found guilty of another crime.",
      "The women are held at a police hospital outside Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, and authorities have previously said they would not have to serve prison time until after giving birth.",
      "The women can appeal the verdict, said court spokesperson So Sarin. He refused to comment on how many were still pregnant, or what would happen to the babies after they have given birth.",
      "Developing countries have been popular for surrogacy because costs are much lower compared to the United States and Australia, where surrogate services could cost around $150,000.",
      "The Cambodia case was unusual because surrogates normally are employed in their own countries, not transported elsewhere.",
      "Authorities have said the business that recruited the women was based in Thailand, and that their food and accommodation in Cambodia was organized there.",
      "The women were arrested in late September in a raid on a villa in Kandal province, where authorities found 20 Filipinos and four Vietnamese.",
      "At the time the women were charged in October, Cambodia\u2019s Interior Ministry said the ringleaders had not been identified. It said, however, that it considered the women offenders who conspired with the organizers to act as surrogates and then sell the babies for money, rather than victims.",
      "Eleven of the women who were not pregnant were deported, and the 13 Filipinos were charged under a provision on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation. The law was updated in 2016 to ban commercial surrogacy after Cambodia became a popular destination for foreigners seeking women to give birth to their children.",
      "Cambodia has a bad reputation for human trafficking, especially in connection with online scams in which foreigners recruited for work under false pretenses are kept in conditions of virtual slavery and help perpetrate criminal fraud online against targets in many countries.",
      "The surrogacy business boomed in Cambodia after it was put under tight restrictions in neighboring Thailand, as well as in India and Nepal.",
      "In July 2017, a Cambodian court sentenced an Australian woman and two Cambodian associates to 1 1/2 years in prison for providing commercial surrogacy services."

      "BOISE, Idaho -- A federal appeals court on Monday ruled that most of Idaho's first-in-the-nation law that makes it illegal to help minors get an abortion without the consent of their parents can take effect while a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality continues.",
      "The decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the statute\u2019s prohibition on helping a minor get an abortion by harboring and transporting them with the intent to conceal the procedure from the minor\u2019s parents is likely to be found constitutional and can be enforced.",
      "Part of the law remains blocked, however. The court found that the law\u2019s prohibition on \u201crecruiting\u201d pregnant youth violates the First Amendment. That means prosecutors, for now, will not be able to charge a person with \u201crecruiting\u201d or influencing a minor to have an abortion.",
      "\"Encouragement, counseling, and emotional support are plainly protected speech,\u201d the court wrote, even when that speech happens in the \u201ccontext of deciding whether to have an abortion.\u201d",
      "The ruling largely reverses U.S. Magistrate Judge Debora K. Grasham's decision, which prevented the law from being enforced after opponents sued the state in the summer of 2023.",
      "Abortion is banned in Idaho at all stages of pregnancy, and the law enacted in 2023 was designed to prevent minors from getting abortions in states where the procedure is legal if they don\u2019t have their parents\u2019 permission.",
      "Supporters of the law call it an \u201cabortion trafficking\u201d ban. Opponents say it is an unconstitutional prohibition on interstate travel and free speech rights. Both sides framed Monday's ruling as a victory.",
      "\u201cThis decision is a significant victory for the plaintiffs, as it frees Idahoans to talk with pregnant minors about abortion health care,\u201d Wendy Heipt, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an emailed statement Monday.",
      "She said the plaintiffs, which include multiple advocacy groups, are also considering their appeal options.",
      "Idaho Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador in an emailed statement called the ruling a victory for the state.",

      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- A law prohibiting abortion services for women raped by their husbands and girls under the age of 18 is unconstitutional, Zimbabwe\u2019s High Court has ruled.",
      "In his ruling handed down on Nov. 22 and made public this week, Judge Maxwell Takuva said since Zimbabwe\u2019s laws already criminalize marital rape and sex with a minor, victims should be allowed to abort if they become pregnant.",
      "The ruling is significant, given Zimbabwe\u2019s restrictive abortion laws that often lead women and girls into illegal and unsafe backstreet abortions that in many cases turn fatal.",
      "Abortion is allowed in very few circumstances in Zimbabwe, including such as if the pregnancy endangers the life of a woman, or if there is a risk of a physical or mental defect \u201cof such a nature that (the child) will permanently be seriously handicapped.\u201d Women can also access legal abortion services in cases of unlawful sex such as incest.",

      "When SmileDirectClub shut down a year ago, scores of existing customers of the teeth-straightening company were left in limbo",
      "NEW YORK -- When SmileDirectClub shut down a year ago, scores of existing customers of the teeth-straightening company were left in limbo. Now, tens of thousands are set to get some relief.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James has announced that her office recovered $4.8 million to distribute nationwide to more than 28,000 consumers. SmileDirectClub illegally charged those customers after it ceased operations, James said.",
      "\u201cDental care is expensive and SmileDirectClub promised customers that they would provide affordable, quality care without the price tag, but instead, they extracted thousands of dollars from hardworking people,\" James said in a prepared statement Monday. \u201cToday, we are putting money back into people\u2019s pockets who were cheated.\"",
      "SmileDirectClub, once a publicly traded company known for selling clear dental aligners, shut its doors in December 2023 \u2014 just months after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In an abrupt move, the company canceled outstanding orders and announced that its \u201cLifetime Smile Guarantee\u201d would no longer exist. At the time, SmileDirectClub also said that \u201cSmilePay\u201d customers were expected to continue payments, causing confusion and frustration.",
      "According to James' announcement, the majority of customers paid for their aligner treatments through the \u201cSmilePay\u201d program, which generally totaled more than $2,500 between an up-front payment and following installments.",
      "After the company folded in December 2023, James' office said it received complaints from New York consumers who were told to keep paying monthly installments, despite no longer receiving treatment in return \u2014 and that it soon sent SmileDirectClub a cease-and-desist letter.",
      "In response, SmileDirectClub directed her office to HPS Investment Partners, the agent of the company's secured lenders, and SmilePay service provider Healthcare Finance Direct. The company also revised its online FAQ to remove the note about continuing payments, and instead direct customers' further questions to HFD.",
      "Monday's settlement agreement means that impacted consumers should soon see some relief, either in the form of \u201ca partial or full refund of their installment payments or a reduction of their future payment obligations,\u201d according to HFD\u2019s website.",
      "If you're eligible, the amount of money you\u2019ll get will depend on several factors. Those include the date when you first received aligners from SmileDirectClub, if your services had begun yet, as well as how much of your treatment plan was completed at the time the company ceased operations, and the outstanding balances on your account.",
      "And not all refunds will come in the form of a settlement check. Compensation will first be applied to the outstanding balance on your account \u2014 meaning that future payments, while reduced, may still remain for those who were farther along in their treatment. But consumers eligible for a refund that exceeds their outstanding account balance will see that excess amount sent back to a bank account, debit card or credit card on file. If that's unsuccessful, HFD notes, a check will be mailed out.",
      "How many people end up registering for the settlement is also a factor. Total compensation plan is capped at $4.8 million, so it\u2019s possible refunds could be slightly below or above initial estimates once all requests are in.",
      "A portion of these refunds will be automatic, but other customers will only be available to submit a request to HFD directly. The deadline to submit that request is March 11, 2025. While eligible consumers will likely be contacted by HFD via email, more information can be found of the service provider's official website.",
      "Before shutting its doors, SmileDirectClub served over 2 million people since its 2014 founding. The company once promised to revolutionize the oral-care industry by selling clear dental aligners, via mail and in major retailers, that were marketed as a faster and more affordable alternative to braces.",
      "Still, the company later proved to be unprofitable year after year. By the time SmileDirectClub filed for bankruptcy in September 2023, it reported nearly $900 million in debt.",
      "And beyond financial woes, dental associations around the world have also continued to urge caution or express opposition to direct-to-consumer aligners \u2014 what some call \u201cDIY\u201d dentistry \u2014 citing risks around services that don't require in-person visits to a dentist or orthodontist. That resulted in ample criticism around SmileDirectClub, particularly after customers saw treatments discontinued last year, although other companies still provide similar direct-to-consumer aligners today."

      "There have been no new cases reported since Oct. 21, when McDonald's pulled the Quarter Pounder off its menu in the affected states, the CDC said Tuesday. Taylor Farms initiated a voluntary recall of yellow onions on Oct. 22.",
      "Federal and state health officials in Colorado didn\u2019t find the strain of E. coli that caused the illnesses in onions it tested or in any samples from the environment. But they concluded that evidence showed that recalled yellow onions were the likely source of the outbreak.",
      "\u201cMcDonald\u2019s is no longer serving recalled onions and there does not appear to be a continued food safety concern related to this outbreak,\u201d the FDA said Tuesday in a statement.",
      "McDonald's briefly pulled Quarter Pounders from 3,000 U.S. stores as a result of the outbreak, then narrowed that to 900 stores once testing had pinpointed onions \u2014 and not hamburger patties \u2014 as the likely source of E. coli. The company found an alternate supplier and resumed selling Quarter Pounders with slivered onions at all U.S. stores last month.",
      "But the outbreak has hurt demand. In mid-November, McDonald's said it planned to spend $100 million to bring customers back to stores, including $65 million that will go directly to the hardest-hit franchisees.",
      "Chicago-based McDonald's wouldn't say Tuesday whether its sales have returned to normal levels in the affected regions. But it thanked U.S. regulators for their quick action and said it remains confident in its rigorous food-safety standards.",
      "McDonald's last major food-safety issue happened in 2018, when more than 500 people contracted an intestinal illness after eating its salads.",
      "McDonald's also declined to comment Tuesday on legal action against the company as a result of the E. coli outbreak.",
      "Nicole and Richard West of Townsend, Montana, are suing McDonald\u2019s after their 11-month-old daughter, Logan, was hospitalized in October with E. coli poisoning. The toddler ate a few bites of her father\u2019s Quarter Pounder hamburger with onions during a family road trip on Oct. 2.",
      "She fell ill a few days later with severe vomiting and diarrhea. Her mother rushed her to the hospital, where she was found to be infected with E. coli O157:H7, which can cause life-threatening illness, particularly in young children.",
      "Richard West also fell ill but didn\u2019t seek medical attention because he was at home caring for the family\u2019s other children. He lost more than two weeks of work as a truck driver because of the outbreak and the family faces a barrage of medical expenses.",
      "Nicole West said Tuesday that Logan's health has improved but the outbreak has shaken the family\u2019s confidence in the fast-food giant.",
      "\u201cWith kids, when you want to go out to eat, they want to go to McDonald\u2019s. They want to get a Happy Meal,\u201d West said. \u201cBut we just don\u2019t trust it anymore.\u201d"

      "A California farm expanded a recall of raw milk sold in stores and halted production after state health and agriculture officials found bird flu virus in more milk samples.",
      "Raw Farm, of Fresno, voluntarily recalled all whole milk and cream products from stores late Tuesday after tests found bird flu virus in \u201cmultiple\u201d retail samples and dairy storage and bottling sites. The recall covers all Raw Farm milk and cream produced between Nov. 9 and Nov. 27.",
      "The California Department of Food and Agriculture quarantined the farm and suspended distribution of raw milk, cream, kefir, butter and cheese products produced on or after Nov. 27.",
      "\u201cCalifornians are strongly encouraged not to consume any raw milk or cream products in their possession or still on store shelves,\u201d officials said in a statement.",
      "The move followed recalls of two lots of Raw Farm products after bird flu was first detected in retail milk on Nov. 21.",
      "No known cases of bird flu virus have been confirmed in people who drank raw milk, health officials said. Pasteurized milk is heat-treated to kill the virus and remains safe to drink.",
      "Pet owners also should avoid feeding Raw Farm products sold nationwide as \u201cpet food topper\u201d or \u201cpet food kefir\u201d to their animals, who can become ill, health officials said. Cats on farms with infected cows have developed brain damage and died after drinking contaminated raw milk.",
      "Bird flu virus, also known as Type A H5N1 avian influenza, was detected for the first time in U.S. dairy cows in March. The virus has been spreading rapidly, particularly in California, where nearly 500 of the more than 700 infected U.S. herds have been detected.",
      "The virus has infected 57 people in the U.S. this year, including 31 in California, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mild illnesses have been seen in dairy and poultry workers who had close contact with infected animals. In two cases, an adult in Missouri and a child in California, no known source of the illnesses have been identified. No cases of bird flu spreading between people have been detected in the U.S.",
      "Health officials have long warned against drinking raw milk because it can contain germs that cause illnesses that range from mild to life-threatening.",
      "Raw Farm\u2019s owner, Mark McAfee, has called for less raw milk regulation. In an Instagram post on Wednesday, farm officials said they were working to restore supply quickly.",
      "\u201cThere are no illnesses associated with H5N1 in our products. But rather this is a political issue,\u201d the post said. \u201cThere are no food safety issues with our products or consumer safety. We are working towards resolving this political issue while being cooperative with our government regulatory agencies.\u201d",
      "Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who has been tapped as the nation's top health official, has vowed to allow wider distribution of raw milk. McAfee told The Associated Press that Kennedy is a customer of his products. Kennedy has criticized agriculture departments for cracking down on raw milk and promised that the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s \u201c aggressive suppression \u201d of unpasteurized milk would end under President-elect Donald Trump.",

      "At least 26 states have adopted laws restricting or banning such care for minors, and most of those states face lawsuits.",
      "Here's the latest:",
      "Chase Strangio, the ACLU attorney who represented the families challenging the ban, said he was \u201chumbled and honored\u201d to appear before the court.",
      "Strangio said the arguments Tennessee used for its ban could also be used to justify a national ban. Strangio is the first transgender attorney to argue before the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cNo matter what happens, we will keep fighting,\u201d Strangio said.",

      "\u201cEach state is allowed to make its own decisions,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cToday marks a pivotal moment in Tennessee and our country\u2019s history. The Supreme Court of the United States heard oral arguments for a first-of-its-kind case that shows every state in the country what it really looks like to stand up for children,\u201d Tennessee state Sen. Jack Johnson said in a statement.",
      "Listen in full here.",
      "Arguments begin at 1:12:38.",
      "She pointed out that the arguments in favor of Tennessee\u2019s law could also potentially support nationwide restrictions on transgender health care for minors.",
      "The issue could remain at the center of the political conversation after the inauguration next month of President-elect Donald Trump, who made opposition to transgender rights central to his campaign\u2019s closing message.",
      "The arguments in front of the justices wrapped up after more than two hours.",
      "\u201cOur fundamental point is there is no sex-based line here,\u201d Rice said.",
      "Rice argued that the Tennessee law is instead aimed at the purpose of the treatment.",
      "Children can get puberty blockers to treat early onset puberty, but not as a treatment for gender dysphoria.",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked Tennessee Solicitor General Matt Rice about the possible impact of both laws restricting women and girls from women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports competitions \u2014 and those that keep them out of women\u2019s and girls\u2019 bathrooms in schools or other public buildings.",
      "At least 24 states have sports laws. At least 11 have bathroom laws.",

      "Strangio cited laws against cross-dressing and previous bans on military service by transgender people.",
      "President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed a Trump-era policy that largely barred transgender people from serving in the military. Trump has indicated he plans to reinstate that ban when he takes office in January.",
      "\u201cThe Constitution leaves that question to the people\u2019s representatives, rather than to 9 people, none of whom is a doctor,\u201d Roberts said in questioning Strangio.",

      "Transgender youth in the United States have been flooding crisis hotlines since the election of Donald Trump, who made anti-transgender themes central to his campaign.",
      "ACLU attorney Chase Strangio has begun his arguments against Tennessee's ban. He follows U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who finished answering questions after spending more than an hour at the podium.",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said she saw some parallels between the case and a 1967 landmark decision that legalized interracial marriage.",

      "Barrett wasn\u2019t on the court when the 2020 case was decided so this is her first time diving into the issue as a justice.",
      "She sounded skeptical of the administration\u2019s argument that the law discriminates because of sex. She was equally skeptical that the court should for the first time declare that discrimination against transgender people should be viewed as similar to bias based on race, sex and national origin, all of which have a special legal status.",
      "Barrett said transgender people have not experienced the same long history of discrimination written into the law in the same way those other groups faced.",
      "\u201cAll other suspect classes do have that long de jure history of discrimination,\u201d Barrett said, using the Latin phrase for \u201caccording to law.\u201d",

      "\u201cIf you prevail here on the standard of review, what would that mean for women and girls sports?\u201d he asked. \u201cWould transgender athletes have a constitutional right to participate in girls\u2019 sports?\u201d",
      "At least 24 states have adopted restrictions on transgender women and girls in women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports competitions. There have also been legal challenges to those laws, with mixed verdicts so far.",

      "She pointed to West Virginia\u2019s as one that might fare better because it gives a path for treatment for teens who are considered by medical providers to be at risk for self-harm or suicide.",
      "During questioning by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Prelogar noted that every major medical organization has supported gender-affirming care for transgender youth, and many have filed briefs supporting the challenge to Tennessee\u2019s law.",

      "Tennessee\u2019s law bars puberty blockers and hormone treatment only for transgender minors.",
      "The votes of Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Amy Coney Barrett probably will decide this case.",

      "Roberts and Gorsuch joined the court\u2019s liberal justices (Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson) in the 2020 workplace discrimination case won by LGBTQ+ plaintiffs.",
      "Three conservative justices, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas, dissented on that case.",
      "Barrett has no high court track record on transgender issues, although she votes with the other conservatives in most of the high-profile cases.",
      "If the parties challenging the Tennessee law hope to win, they need at least two conservative justices on their side, along with the three liberal members of the court.",
      "Alito, who seems likely to vote to uphold the Tennessee ban, is using his questioning of Prelogar to persuade his colleagues that this case is different from the one four years ago where the court sided with LGBTQ+ people.",
      "The Bostock decision in 2020 found that the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 banned discrimination against LGBTQ+ people in the workplace.",
      "That \u201cinvolved the interpretation of particular language in a particular statute,\u201d Alito said.",
      "This case involves the Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause, a key provision of the 14th Amendment.",
      "Alito focused on where European countries stand on gender-affirming care for minors, noting that Finland, Norway and Sweden have policies discouraging it from being available routinely to minors.",
      "Prelogar noted that those countries don\u2019t go as far as Tennessee\u2019s outright ban on the treatments for transgender minors.",
      "The report asserts there is \u201cno good evidence on the long-term outcomes of interventions to manage gender-related distress.\u201d",
      "But advocates for transgender people have a lot of questions about the report.",
      "\u25b6The AP delved into it here",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts, who is one of the most closely watched justices in this case and previously voted in favor of transgender rights in the workplace, is asking whether this question might be best left to state legislatures.",
      "Prelogar responds that the state does have regulatory powers, but argues Tennessee\u2019s law is too broad.",
      "Supreme Court arguments have begun over Tennessee\u2019s ban on health care for transgender minors. The first attorney to argue is U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, arguing against the ban.",
      "The Republican-controlled Statehouse and GOP Gov. Bill Lee have signed off on legislation banning transgender athletes from participating in girls\u2019 sports.",
      "Republicans have also blocked businesses from setting their own rules about bathroom access \u2014 a move that critics have warned targets transgender people.",
      "This year, they placed a ban on the spending of state money on hormone therapy or sex reassignment procedures for prisoners and required public school employees to out transgender students to their parents.",
      "Shortly after enacting the ban on gender-affirming care, the Republican-dominant Legislature also passed legislation penalizing adults who help minors receive gender-affirming care without parental consent.",
      "Supporters of the proposal couldn\u2019t point to any examples of minors leaving the state to receive gender-affirming care without their parent\u2019s consent, but said it was needed anyway to protect children.",
      "Republican Gov. Bill Lee later signed off on the first-in-the-nation proposal.",
      "Over the years, Republican-dominant Tennessee has not only been among the top states to introduce the most anti-LGBTQ+ legislation but also the top state to enact such legislation.",
      "According to the Human Rights Campaign, Tennessee has enacted more anti-LGBTQ+ laws than any other state since 2015, identifying more than 20 bills that advanced out of the Legislature earlier this year. That includes Gov. Bill Lee signing off on bills banning the spending of state money on hormone therapy or sex reassignment procedures for prisoners \u2014 though it would not apply to state inmates currently receiving hormone therapy \u2014 and requiring public school employees to out transgender students to their parents.",
      "Attorneys for the families challenging Tennessee\u2019s law have warned a ruling upholding the measure could open the door for more attempts to restrict the care for transgender adults as well as youth.",
      "Florida is the only state that has enacted a law restricting gender-affirming care for transgender adults, though similar restrictions have been attempted in at least two other states.",
      "Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine\u2019s administration earlier this year proposed and then backed off rules that advocates said would have blocked access to gender-affirming care provided by independent clinics and general practitioners.",
      "Missouri\u2019s Republican attorney general last year pushed for an emergency rule that would have placed limits on care for adults, but state officials abruptly dropped it. Missouri later this year enacted a law banning some gender-affirming care for minors.",
      "Most adults still are allowed to access gender-affirming health care under the Missouri law, but Medicaid won\u2019t cover it.",
      "Arguing for the Biden administration is U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar. She\u2019s the second woman to serve in the role in the country\u2019s history, and this could be the last major case she argues as solicitor general \u2014 essentially the federal government\u2019s top lawyer before the Supreme Court.",
      "Matt Rice, Tennessee\u2019s state solicitor general, will defend the law before the high court. He served in 2019 as a clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, who dissented from a ruling that term that a landmark civil rights law protects LGBTQ+ workers.",
      "The treatments at the heart of today\u2019s arguments are also used by minors who are not transgender, including intersex people. Tennessee and other states have not tried to ban puberty blockers or hormone treatments for those uses.",
      "Puberty blockers can be used to delay sexual development in children who go through puberty before age 8 or 9. Adolescents with delayed puberty can be treated with hormones.",
      "Thomas was famously silent during arguments for years at a time because he said he relied on written briefs and thought his colleagues interrupted too much.",
      "But when the court started hearing cases remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, the justices altered their practice and asked questions one by one, instead of the usual free-for-all. Even after they returned to the courtroom, the justices have informally agreed to allow Thomas, the longest-serving member of the court, to go first.",
      "He has asked questions at every argument session he\u2019s attended since the court\u2019s first remote arguments in May 2020.",
      "Don\u2019t be fooled by the hour the court has allotted. The session could easily go twice as long.",
      "Gone are the days when Chief Justice William Rehnquist would cut lawyers off mid-sentence when the red light went on at their podium. Chief Justice John Roberts was more lenient even before the coronavirus pandemic forced changes to the structure of the arguments.",
      "But the administration\u2019s position seems likely to change after Trump takes office.",
      "He campaigned against transgender rights, using demeaning language and misrepresentations as he pledged to remove \u201ctransgender insanity\u201d in schools and restrict participation in women\u2019s sports.",
      "Brian Williams of Nashville, Tennessee, says his transgender daughter, L.W., has to travel to another state to receive the health care that \u201cwe and her doctors know is right for her.\u201d",
      "Williams, speaking on a Zoom call arranged by the legal team representing the family and others at the Supreme Court, said L.W. approached him and his wife, Samantha, several years ago to share \u201chonestly and openly her pain\u201d over her gender identity.",
      "She began taking puberty-blocking drugs at age 13 and started hormone therapy a year later, Williams says.",
      "Today, her father says, she is a \u201c16-year-old planning for her future, making her own music and looking at colleges.\u201d",
      "Williams says he\u2019s not expecting people to understand everything about the family. But he asks others to \u201copen your hearts and listen.\u201d",
      "President-elect Trump backed a national ban on such care as part of his 2024 campaign in which he demeaned and mocked transgender people. Trump and his allies also promised to roll back protections for transgender people throughout the campaign.",
      "Meanwhile, in its waning days, the Biden administration, along with families of transgender adolescents, will appeal to the justices to strike down the Tennessee ban as unlawful sex discrimination and protect the constitutional rights of vulnerable Americans.",
      "Earlier this year, the administration and Democrat-led states extended protections for transgender people, including a new federal regulation that seeks to protect transgender students.",
      "People on both sides of the issue are gathered outside the court for demonstrations that are increasing in volume ahead of arguments.",
      "They carried signs reading \u201cChampion God\u2019s Design\u201d and \u201cKids Health Matters\u201d on one side and \u201cFight like a Mother for Trans Rights\u201d and \u201cFreedom to be Ourselves\u201d on the other.",
      "Speeches and music filled the air on the sidewalk outside the court\u2019s marble steps.",
      "Multiple bills related to transgender youth have already been filed in Texas\u2019 legislature ahead of its session next year.",
      "The proposals include a bill that would make it easier to sue providers of gender-affirming medical care for children.",
      "Other bills include restrictions on which public restrooms transgender people can use, and limits on how topics related to sexual orientation and gender identity are taught in schools.",
      "At least 26 states have adopted laws banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors. Federal judges in Arkansas and Florida have struck down the bans in those states as unconstitutional, though an appeals court has put the Florida ruling on hold. The ban in New Hampshire is to take effect on Jan. 1.",
      "Several Democratic-controlled states have policies seeking to protect access to gender-affirming care.",
      "Additionally, at least 24 states have bans barring transgender women and girls from competing in certain women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports competitions. And at least 11 have laws barring transgender women and girls from using girls\u2019 and women\u2019s bathrooms at public schools \u2014 and in some cases, in other government facilities.",
      "Most laws are reviewed and upheld under the lowest level of scrutiny, known as rational basis review. Indeed, the federal appeals court in Cincinnati that allowed the Tennessee law to be enforced held that lawmakers acted rationally in adopting the law to address the risks they perceived in gender-affirming care for minors.",
      "But when discrimination is present, judges take a closer look.",
      "Sex discrimination gets heightened scrutiny, which requires states to identify an important objective and show that the law helps accomplish it. Racial discrimination, not at issue here, is reviewed under strict scrutiny \u2014 the highest level \u2014 and laws rarely survive such a demanding examination.",
      "Roberts and Gorsuch joined the court\u2019s liberal justices in the 2020 workplace discrimination case won by LGBTQ+ plaintiffs. Three conservative justices, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas, dissented.",
      "If the parties challenging the Tennessee law hope to win, they need at least two conservative justices on their side, along with the three liberal members of the court. Barrett has no track record on transgender issues, although she votes with the other conservatives in most of the high-profile cases.",
      "The Supreme Court almost always issues its decisions by early summer, usually before the end of June. The transgender health case could be one of the last cases decided, which is typical of highly contentious issues. One additional potential cause for delay is the Trump administration could weigh in soon after he takes office. It\u2019s not clear how that might affect the case.",
      "Chase Strangio will be the first openly transgender attorney to argue before the nation\u2019s highest court, representing families who say Tennessee\u2019s ban on health care for transgender minors leaves their children terrified about the future.",
      "Strangio will bring months of intense legal preparation to the case as well as hard-won lessons from his own experience.",
      "\u201cI am able to do my job because I have had this health care that transformed and, frankly, saved my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a testament to the fact that we live among everyone.\u201d",
      "Strangio grew up outside of Boston and came out as trans when he was in law school. Now 42, he\u2019s an American Civil Liberties Union attorney whose legal career has included representing former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, challenging a ban on transgender people serving in the military and helping win an LGBTQ+ worker-discrimination case at the Supreme Court. He\u2019s also the father of a 12-year-old, the son of a father who supports Trump, and has a close relationship with his Army veteran brother.",

      "The Supreme Court\u2019s only other major case on transgender rights was in 2020 when the court ruled that workplace discrimination against LGBTQ+ people was sex discrimination in violation of the federal civil rights law commonly known as Title VII.",
      "The court concluded in separate cases involving a gay man and a transgender woman that they were discriminated against because of their sex. Justice Neil Gorsuch, an appointee of Donald Trump\u2019s in his first term in the White House, wrote the 6-3 opinion for the court. Chief Justice John Roberts was the only other conservative member of the court in the majority.",

    "summary": "Reproductive rights advocates are trying to dismantle a 15-week abortion ban in Arizona that conflicts with newly expanded access establishing a fundamental right to abortion in the state",
    "story": [
      "Reproductive rights advocates are trying to dismantle a 15-week abortion ban in Arizona that conflicts with newly expanded access establishing a fundamental right to abortion in the state",
      "PHOENIX -- Reproductive rights advocates sued Arizona on Tuesday to undo a 15-week abortion ban that conflicts with a constitutional amendment recently approved by voters to expand access up to fetal viability.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood and the Center for Reproductive Rights filed the lawsuit in Maricopa County Superior Court on behalf of the local chapter of Planned Parenthood and two physicians, arguing the law interferes with pregnant Arizonans\u2019 fundamental right to abortion and individual autonomy. It\u2019s the first step in efforts to dismantle existing laws they say are too restrictive.",
      "The Republican-controlled Arizona Legislature approved the 15-week ban months before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, but it didn't go into effect until after. Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes agreed not to enforce the 15-week ban while the lawsuit plays out, spokesperson Richie Taylor said Tuesday.",
      "Democratic Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs said in a statement Tuesday that the ban should be removed from the books.",
      "\u201cArizonans made it clear that they support reproductive freedom, and there is no question that a ban with no exceptions for rape or incest should be removed from our laws,\" she said, adding that she is \"glad Arizonans are working to finish the job and enforce the constitutional protections we now enjoy.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit also seeks to undo the ban\u2019s enforcement mechanisms, which could lead to criminal charges against providers who knowingly or intentionally perform abortions beyond 15 weeks except in medical emergencies. Physicians who violate the ban could face suspension or revocation of their medical licenses.",
      "\u201cThe amendment itself does not sort of wipe the statute books clean, you know. Further action is needed in order to take that additional step to effectuate the amendment\u2019s promise,\u201d ACLU staff attorney Rebecca Chan said. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s really what this 15-week ban challenge is.\u201d",
      "Arizona was one of five states where voters approved ballot measures in the 2024 general election to add the right to an abortion to their state constitutions. Nevada voters also approved an amendment to codify its existing abortion rights in the state constitution, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "The Arizona ballot measure gained momentum after a state Supreme Court ruling in April found that the state could enforce a near-total abortion ban adopted in 1864. Some GOP lawmakers joined with Democrats to repeal the law before it could be enforced.",
      "The measure expands access to fetal viability \u2014 the point at which a fetus can survive outside the uterus. Though there\u2019s no defined time frame for viability, doctors say it\u2019s sometime after 21 weeks. It allows abortions after viability if they are necessary to protect the physical or mental health of the mother, or to save her life.",
      "Most abortions happen early in pregnancy. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 93% of them nationally in 2022 were in the first 13 weeks, though that data does not include California and some other states where advocates believe a higher proportion of abortions are performed later in pregnancy.",
      "The Nov. 25 certification of the general election opened the door for legal challenges to laws that conflict with the ballot measure, including a law that requires patients to have an ultrasound at least 24 hours before an abortion, with the option to view the image and hear an explanation of what it shows.",
      "Reproductive rights groups signaled then that they would sue over the 15-week abortion ban.",
      "\u201cClearly Planned Parenthood and ACLU and their allies have little regard for the life of an unborn child and the development of an unborn child,\" said Cathi Herrod, president of the socially conservative Center for Arizona Policy. Herrod previosly said the group would seek to intervene where appropriate.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states have banned or restricted access to abortion, and abortion rights groups have pushed back.",
      "In Missouri, Planned Parenthood affiliates sued immediately after a ballot measure there passed seeking to have bans and other abortion-restricting laws invalidated. The circumstances are different there because that state has a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy and no clinics are providing it. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.",
      "Missouri\u2019s Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey wrote in an opinion that he will enforce some laws restricting abortion despite voter approval of a constitutional amendment widely expected to undo the state\u2019s near-total ban on the procedure."

      "A study shows blood tests that check for fetal disorders can sometimes hint at cancer in pregnant women",
      "Many moms-to-be opt for blood tests during pregnancy to check for fetal disorders such as Down syndrome. In rare instances, these tests can reveal something unexpected \u2014 hints of a hidden cancer in the woman.",
      "In a study of 107 pregnant women whose test results were unusual, 52 were ultimately diagnosed with cancer. Most of them were treated and are now in remission, although seven with advanced cancers died.",
      "\"They looked like healthy, young women and they reported themselves as being healthy,\u201d said Dr. Diana Bianchi, the senior author of the government study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "Of the discovered cancers, lymphoma blood cancers were the most common, followed by colon and breast cancers.",
      "The blood test is called cell-free DNA sequencing. It looks for fetal problems in DNA fragments shed from the placenta into the mother\u2019s bloodstream. It also can pick up DNA fragments shed by cancer cells.",
      "Of the millions of pregnant women each year who have a cell-free DNA test, 1 in 10,000 will get a result back that is unusual and difficult to interpret, neither positive or negative for a fetal abnormality. This small number of people \u2014 perhaps only 250 a year in the U.S. \u2014 may be at risk for cancer.",
      "\u201cThey and their care providers need to take the results seriously and have additional testing because in that population there is a 48% risk of cancer,\u201d said Bianchi, who leads the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.",
      "The study looked at what should be done next, and the researchers concluded that it's best to do a whole-body MRI to look for cancer. A physical exam or taking a family history is not enough, Bianchi said.",
      "About five years ago, commercial labs that do these tests and doctors started telling women with unusual results about the study. The National Institutes of Health paid for study volunteers to travel to its research hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, where the participants had their family and medical histories reviewed, a complete physical examination, whole-body MRI scans and other tests performed.",
      "The research identified a recognizable \u201cvery chaotic\u201d pattern in the DNA sequencing of the women diagnosed with cancer, Bianchi said. The study is continuing to look for more evidence to indicate who should be screened for cancer.",
      "Many medical groups now recommend offering cell-free DNA tests during pregnancy, though many expectant parents decide against the optional test. Considered reliable for detecting Down syndrome and two other disorders, the tests have come under scrutiny for too many false alarms for extremely rare fetal problems.",
      "The new finding will help educate doctors about a rare result of DNA tests in pregnancy, said Dr. Neeta Vora, director of reproductive genetics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who wrote an editorial in the journal.",
      "Doctors who care for pregnant women are not accustomed to ordering whole-body MRI tests, Vora said, and these scans, which can cost $1,000 to $2,000, may not be covered by health insurance.",

      "KINSHASA, Congo -- Public health officials in Africa urged caution Thursday as Congo\u2019s health minister said the government was on alert over a mystery flu-like disease that in recent weeks killed dozens of people.",
      "Jean Kaseya, the head of Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters that more details about the disease should be known in the next 48 hours as experts receive results from laboratory samples of infected people.",
      "\u201cFirst diagnostics are leading us to think it is a respiratory disease,\u201d Kaseya said. \u201cBut we need to wait for the laboratory results.\u201d He added that there are many things that are still unknown about the disease \u2014 including whether it is infectious and how it is transmitted.",
      "Authorities in Congo have so far confirmed 71 deaths, including 27 people who died in hospitals and 44 in the community in the southern Kwango province, health minister Roger Kamba said.",
      "\u201cThe Congolese government is on general alert regarding this disease,\" Kamba said, without providing more details.",
      "Of the victims at the hospitals, 10 died due to lack of blood transfusion and 17 as a result of respiratory problems, he said.",
      "The deaths were recorded between Nov. 10 and Nov. 25 in the Panzi health zone of Kwango province. There were around 380 cases, almost half of which were children under the age of five, according to the minister.",
      "The Africa CDC recorded slightly different numbers, with 376 cases and 79 deaths. The discrepancy was caused by problems with surveillance and case definition, Kaseya said.",
      "Authorities have said that symptoms include fever, headache, cough and anemia. Epidemiological experts are in the region to take samples and investigate the disease, the minister said.",
      "The Panzi health zone, located around 435 miles (700 kilometers) from the capital Kinshasa, is a remote area of the Kwango province, making it hard to access.",
      "The epidemiological experts took two days to arrive there, the minister said. Because of the lack of testing capacity, samples had to be taken to Kikwit, more than 500 km away, said Dieudonne Mwamba, the head of the National Institute for Public Health.",
      "\u201cThe health system is quite weak in our rural areas, but for certain types of care, the ministry has all the provisions, and we are waiting for the first results of the sample analysis to properly calibrate things,\u201d Kaseya said.",
      "Mwamba said that Panzi was already a \u201cfragile\u201d zone, with 40% of its residents experiencing malnutrition. It was also hit by an epidemic of typhoid fever two years ago, and there is currently a resurgence of seasonal flu across the country.",
      "\u201cWe need to take into account all this as context,\" Mwamba said.",
      "A Panzi resident, Claude Niongo, said his wife and seven-year-old daughter died from the disease.",
      "\u201cWe do not know the cause but I only noticed high fevers, vomiting... and then death,\u201d Niongo told The Associated Press over the phone. \"Now, the authorities are talking to us about an epidemic but in the meantime, there is a problem of care (and) people are dying,\u201d he added.",
      "Lucien Lufutu, president of the civil society consultation framework of Kwango province, who is in Panzi, said the local hospital where patients are treated is underequipped.",
      "\u201cThere is a lack of medicines and medical supplies, since the disease is not yet known, most of the population is treated by traditional practitioners,\u201d Lufutu told the AP.",
      "He also said the disease affected Katenda, another nearby health zone.",
      "When asked about a potential outbreak in other health zones, the minister said he could not tell if that was the case but that nothing was reported.",
      "Congo is already plagued by the mpox epidemic, with more than 47,000 suspected cases and over 1,000 suspected deaths from the disease in the Central African country, according to the World Health Organization.",

      "Records from the U.S. Bureau of Prisons show that Fabio Ochoa V\u00e1squez was released Tuesday after completing 25 years of a 30-year prison sentence.",
      "Ochoa, 67, and his older brothers amassed a fortune when cocaine started flooding the U.S. in the late 1970s and early 1980s, according to U.S. authorities, to the point that in 1987 they were included in the Forbes Magazine's list of billionaires. Living in Miami, Ochoa ran a distribution center for the cocaine cartel once headed by Pablo Escobar.",
      "Although somewhat faded from memory as the center of the drug trade shifted from Colombia to Mexico, he resurfaced in the hit Netflix series \u201cNarcos\u201d true to form as the youngest son of an elite Medellin family into ranching and horse breeding that cut a sharp contrast with Escobar, who came from more humble roots.",
      "Ochoa was first indicted in the U.S. for his alleged role in the 1986 killing of Drug Enforcement Administration informant Barry Seal \u2014 whose life was popularized in in the 2017 film \u201cAmerican Made\u201d starring Tom Cruise.",
      "He was initially arrested in 1990 in Colombia under a government program promising drug kingpins would not be extradited to the U.S. At the time, he was on the U.S. list of the \u201cDozen Most Wanted\u201d Colombia drug lords.",
      "Ochoa was arrested again and extradited to the U.S. in 2001 in response to an indictment in Miami naming him and more than 40 people as part of a drug smuggling conspiracy. Of those, Ochoa was the only one who opted to go to trial, resulting in his conviction and the 30-year sentence. The other defendants got much lighter prison terms because most of them cooperated with the government.",
      "Richard Gregorie, a retired Assistant U.S. Attorney who was on the prosecution team that convicted Ochoa, said authorities were never able to seize all of the the Ochoa family's illicit drug proceeds and he expects that Ochoa will have a welcome return home.",
      "\u201cHe won't be retiring a poor man, that's for sure,\u201d Gregorie told The Associated Press.",
      "Richard Klugh, a Miami-based attorney for Ochoa, declined to comment.",
      "But in years of litigation, he argued unsuccessfully that his client deserved to be released early because his sentence far exceeded what was appropriate for the amount of seized cocaine that authorities could attribute to Ochoa."

      "On Wednesday, Hasina told her supporters in New York that there had been plans to assassinate her and her sister Sheikh Rehana just like their father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, an independence leader who was assassinated in 1975 along with most of his family. Only Hasina and her younger sister survived because they were visiting Germany at that time.",
      "She said armed protesters had been instructed to head to her residence in Dhaka and she was forced to flee to India so that security guards would not have to fire at the approaching crowd.",
      "\u201cIf the security guards opened fire, many lives would have been lost,\" she said. \"I was forced to leave. I told them not to open fire, no matter what happened.\u201d",
      "Media reports said more such public speeches are planned by Hasina to address her supporters in the coming weeks.",
      "Hasina has good relations with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Tensions between India and Muslim-majority Bangladesh have grown since her departure over incidents such as the jailing of a prominent Hindu leader in Bangladesh and attacks on a diplomatic office in India by Hindus.",
      "Yunus has been meeting with political and religious leaders urging them to stay united. On Wednesday, he held a dialogue with most political parties except Hasina's Awami League party and the Jatiya Party which are facing severe challenges under the Yunus-led administration.",
      "On Thursday, Yunus met with religious leaders and said there was no division among Bangladeshis when it comes to national issues.",
      "Bangladesh has been facing crucial challenges since Hasina's ouster in August amid mob justice, rising commodity prices, errant street protests and an unstable economy. The security situation remains a major concern. About 700 inmates including many criminals and radical Islamists still remain at large after jailbreaks during the political chaos in August."

      "Mexico's president will ask President-elect Donald Trump that, if he deports migrants, to deport non-Mexicans directly to their home countries, rather than dumping them at the Mexican border",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico\u2019s president said Thursday she will ask President-elect Donald Trump to deport non-Mexican migrants directly to their home countries, rather than dumping them at the Mexican border.",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum said she hopes to reach an agreement with Trump so that \u201cthey send people who come from other countries to their countries of origin.\u201d",
      "Mexico, like any other country, is not obligated to accept non-Mexican migrants, but it has agreed to do so in the recent past, especially from countries like Cuba and Venezuela, which often refuse deportation flights from the United States, but may accept them from Mexico.",
      "Mexican officials have said they are already making preparations if Trump follows through on his pledge to carry out large-scale deportations of migrants who lack the proper documents once he takes office on Jan. 20.",
      "Mexico is obviously fearful of two things: large-scale deportations of Mexican citizens and large numbers of non-Mexicans being deported at border crossings that are ill-equipped to deal with them.",
      "Experts estimate there are about 4 million Mexicans living in the U.S. without proper documentation. Mexico is already preparing its consular services in the U.S. with additional manpower to handle deportation cases involving its own citizens.",
      "But third-country deported migrants pose a thornier challenge, and could include considerable numbers of Haitians, Cubans and Venezuelans.",
      "Between 2022 and 2023, Mexico agreed to accept up to 30,000 migrants per month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, countries that are difficult for the U.S. to deport to for diplomatic or political reasons. That agreement is currently in place.",
      "In late 2023, Venezuela said Mexico had repatriated about 300 Venezuelan migrants on two flights.",
      "Such returns pose a monetary burden for the Mexican government. Mexico had offered some of the repatriated Venezuelans a stipend of about $110 per month for six months to help them re-establish themselves in their home countries.",
      "However, the task of finding jobs, shelter and transportation for deported Mexicans would presents an even greater challenge for Mexico.",
      "Migration has long been a sensitive issue between the two countries, and has become even more urgent following Trump's threat to impose 25% tariffs on Mexican goods unless the country does more to stem the flow of migrants and drugs.",
      "In November, Trump claimed that Sheinbaum had \u201cagreed to stop migration through Mexico\u201d following a phone call between the two leaders. Sheinbaum, meanwhile, suggested Mexico was already doing its part and had no interest in closing its borders.",
      "\u201cWe reiterate that Mexico\u2019s position is not to close borders but to build bridges between governments and between peoples,\u201d Sheinbaum said at the time.",

New Zealand authorities have not named the Canadian climber at the request of his family.",
      "The men flew to a hut partway up the mountain on Saturday to begin their ascent and were reported missing on Monday when they did not arrive to meet their prearranged transport after the climb. Searchers hours later found several climbing-related items believed to belong to the men, but no sign of them, police said.",
      "A search stalled for three days due to treacherous weather conditions in the area. On Friday, drone operators spotted footprints in the snow and more items that authorities believe belong to the men.",
      "The belongings \u2014 including clothing, an ice ax and energy gels \u2014 were spotted by helicopter and have been retrieved.",
      "\u201cAfter reviewing the number of days the climbers have been missing, no communication, the items we have retrieved, and our reconnaissance today, we do not believe the men have survived,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe believe they have taken a fall.\u201d",
      "The search would resume if more evidence came to light, but the men's deaths have been referred to a coroner, Walker added.",

      "Iran says it conducted a successful space launch, the latest for its program the West alleges improves Tehran\u2019s ballistic missile program",
      "MANAMA, Bahrain -- Iran said Friday it conducted a successful space launch, the latest for its program the West alleges improves Tehran\u2019s ballistic missile program.",
      "Iran conducted the launch using its Simorgh program, a satellite-carrying rocket that had had a series of failed launches, at Iran's Imam Khomeini Spaceport in rural Semnan province. That's the site of Iran's civilian space program.",
      "The Simorgh carried what Iran described as an \u201corbital propulsion system,\u201d as well as two research systems to a 400-kilometer (250-mile) orbit above the Earth. A system that could change the orbit of a spacecraft would allow Iran to geo-synchronize the orbits of its satellites. Tehran has long sought that ability.",
      "Iran also put the payload of the Simorgh at 300 kilograms (660 pounds), heavier than its previous successful launches.",
      "There was no immediate independent confirmation the launch was successful. The U.S. military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The announcement comes as heightened tensions grip the wider Middle East over Israel\u2019s continued war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip and as an uneasy ceasefire holds in Lebanon.",
      "The United States has previously said Iran\u2019s satellite launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution and called on Tehran to undertake no activity involving ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. U.N. sanctions related to Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program expired in October 2023.",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s work on space-launch vehicles \u2014 including its Simorgh \u2014 probably would shorten the timeline to produce an intercontinental ballistic missile, if it decided to develop one, because the systems use similar technologies,\u201d a U.S. intelligence community report released in July said.",
      "Under Iran\u2019s relatively moderate former President Hassan Rouhani, the Islamic Republic slowed its space program for fear of raising tensions with the West. The late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who came to power in 2021, pushed the program forward. Raisi died in a helicopter crash in May.",
      "Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, who has been signaling he wants to negotiate with the West over sanctions, has yet to offer strategy when it comes to Iran's ambitions in space. The Simorgh launch represented the first for his administration from the country's civil space program. Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard conducted a successful launch in its parallel program in September.",
      "Intercontinental ballistic missiles can be used to deliver nuclear weapons. Iran is now producing uranium close to weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran has enough enriched uranium for \u201cseveral\u201d nuclear weapons, if it chooses to produce them, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency repeatedly has warned.",
      "Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons and says its space program, like its nuclear activities, is for purely civilian purposes. However, U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003.",

      "\u201cMr. Lavrov spoke about the sovereign right of every member-state to make their own choices,'' Blinken said. \u201dThat\u2019s exactly what this is about: the sovereign right of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people to make their own choices about the future, not to have those choices made in and by Moscow.\"",

      "One of the darkest moments in the modern history of the Arab world happened more than four decades ago, when then-Syrian President Hafez Assad launched what came to be known as the Hama Massacre",
      "BEIRUT -- It was one of the darkest moments in the modern history of the Arab world. More than four decades ago, Hafez Assad, then president of Syria, launched what came to be known as the Hama Massacre.",
      "Between 10,000 to 40,000 people were killed or disappeared in the government attack on the central Syrian city. It began on Feb. 2, 1982, and lasted for nearly a month, leaving the city in ruins.",
      "The memory of the government assault and the monthlong siege on the city, which at the time was a stronghold of Syria\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood, remains visceral in Syrian and Arab minds.",
      "Now Islamist insurgents have captured the city, tearing down a poster of Hafez Assad\u2019s son, President Bashar Assad, and swarming security and government offices \u2014 scenes unimaginable 40 years ago.",
      "The moment carried great symbolism in Syria\u2019s long-running civil war, which began 13 years ago but many say is rooted in Hama.",
      "Hama, Syria\u2019s fourth-largest city, is known for its quaint waterwheels, a landmark attraction along the banks of the Orontes River.",
      "In the early 1980s, the city's name became synonymous with killings.",
      "It was the scene of Muslim Brotherhood-led anti-government attacks that targeted military officers, state institutions and ruling party offices. In February 1982, Hafez Assad ordered an assault on the city to quell the unrest.",
      "In a matter of days, government warplanes destroyed most of the city, opening the way for ground troops.",
      "Hafez Assad\u2019s brother, Rifaat, led the artillery unit that shelled the city and killed thousands, earning him the nickname the \u201cButcher of Hama.\u201d",
      "Only this year, Rifaat Assad was indicted in Switzerland for war crimes and crimes against humanity in connection with Hama. An international arrest warrant was issued for him three years earlier.",
      "The massacre created resentment that fanned the flames of another uprising against Hafez Assad\u2019s son years later.",
      "In 2011, Hama and surrounding towns became the epicenter of some of the biggest protests against Bashar Assad, which started in 2011 during a wave of Arab uprisings.",
      "The protests forced government security forces to withdraw from the city briefly in June 2012, leaving the opposition in control and fueling a brief sense of liberation, in a place that had once been pounded by Syrian warplanes.",
      "Residents at that time painted walls around the city in red, threw red paint on the waterwheels to symbolize the Hama massacre and tried to organize local administration. About 800,000 people lived there at the start of the uprising.",
      "\u201cErhal ya Bashar,\" a protest chant that means \u201cCome on, leave, Bashar\u201d was popularized in the Hama protests.",
      "But government forces returned in August of that year, with a brutal assault that caused mass casualties in the first 24 hours. The leader of the chants was later killed, his throat slit by government forces.",
      "Aron Lund, a longtime Syria expert at Century International, a New York-based think tank, said Hama has obvious symbolic value because of the history of the massacre. He described it as a \u201chuge event in Syrian history and really formative for the opposition and the Islamist opposition in particular.\"",
      "The brutal crackdown is commerated each year.",
      "It was also formative for government forces, because many of the current military leaders were young at the time, Lund said.",
      "\u201cWhen 2011 rolled around, they all realized that, you know, we all remember, you all remember Hama. So there\u2019s no there\u2019s no compromising here,\u201d he said.",
      "In a video message Thursday, Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the de facto leader of the Syrian insurgency, announced that fighters had reached Hama \u201cto clean the wound that has bled for 40 years.\u201d One of the opposition fighters' first moves was to free prisoners from the city's central prison.",
      "Hama is a major intersection in Syria that links the country\u2019s center with the north as well as the east and the coast.",
      "It is about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the capital, Damascus, Assad\u2019s seat of power. Hama province also borders the coastal province of Latakia, a main base of popular support for Assad.",
      "The region is predominantly Sunni Muslim but also has a minority from the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam, to which Assad\u2019s family belongs.",
      "Hama\u2019s fall would have been a massive development in its own right, Lund said. But coming after the fall of Syria\u2019s largest city, Aleppo last week, which gave government forces the time to prepare their defense lines, it \u201cwill absolutely encourage Assad\u2019s enemies and discourage his supporters.\u201d",
      "Next stop for the insurgents is the central province of Homs, which analysts say would be a game-changer if it falls into rebel hands. Insurgent groups have already said they are advancing toward Homs.",
      "Homs, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Hama, is where one of Syria's two state-run oil refineries is located and is also gateway to Damascus. It connects the capital to the coast, where Assad has his base and his village of origin, and home to a Russian naval base.",
      "\u201cShould the rebels be able to seize Homs, which they now have a shot at doing after seizing Hama, then they could theoretically have grabbed\" three of Syria's largest cities and severed the capital from the coast, said Lund."

      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to emphasize that not only did the opposition err resoundingly with bitcoin, but rather, differently from other issues (where they have also been wrong), this time their opposition affected many,\u201d Bukele wrote on Facebook.",
      "Bukele drew an \"impressive\u201d comment from Elon Musk on the social media platform X Thursday.",
      "El Salvador\u2019s former Central Bank President Carlos Acevedo pointed out on Thursday that while there has been a gain, it remains an unrealized one until the government\u2019s bitcoin is sold. That said, he credited Bukele\u2019s administration with doing well on the bitcoin move, especially in light of Trump\u2019s election.",
      "Acevedo said \u201cthe markets\u2019 optimism that a Trump administration will be friendly with the markets and particularly with bitcoin\u201d explained its sustained rally over the past month.",
      "But the cryptocurrency\u2019s volatility was a persistent risk, he said.",
      "\u201cThe average Salvadoran doesn\u2019t use bitcoin, but obviously there are Salvadorans with economic resources who even before had already invested in bitcoin, but it is a small group,\u201d Acevedo said.",
      "Esteban Escamilla, a worker in a clothing store in Santa Tecla, outside the capital San Salvador, said he had cashed out the original $30 of bitcoin offered in 2021.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t use bitcoin because I don\u2019t have (money) to invest and speculate with, but I know it has gone up a lot,\u201d he said, recognizing that he would have more money now if he had kept it in bitcoin.",
      "Josefa Torres, 45, said as she was doing her grocery shopping that she didn\u2019t have any bitcoin either. \u201cI took out the money and used it for household expenses,\u201d she said.",
      "At the conclusion of meetings between the International Monetary Fund and El Salvador\u2019s government in August, the IMF issued a statement that mentioned the country\u2019s bitcoin holdings.",
      "\u201cWhile many of the risks have not yet materialized, there is joint recognition that further efforts are needed to enhance transparency and mitigate potential fiscal and financial stability risks from the Bitcoin project,\u201d the IMf said."

      "The South African government says the convicted killer of South Africa\u2019s anti-apartheid leader Chris Hani will be deported to his home country of Poland after his parole came to an end this week",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- Janusz Walus, the convicted killer of South Africa's anti-apartheid leader Chris Hani, will be deported to his home country of Poland after his parole came to an end this week, the government announced on Friday.",
      "Hani, who was the leader of the African National Congress' military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, and the general secretary of the South African Communist Party, was shot outside his home in Boksburg, east of Johannesburg, in 1993.",
      "His assassination threatened to plunge South Africa into political violence ahead of its transition from white minority rule to democracy.",
      "Walus, 71, spent over 28 years in jail after he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder. He was released on parole following a ruling of the Constitutional Court in 2022.",
      "Clive Derby-Lewis, a former politician who was sentenced together with Walus for the murder, was released on medical parole in 2015 and died from cancer in 2016. The two were initially sentenced to death but their sentences became life sentences when South Africa became a democracy and abolished the death penalty. Derby-Lewis is considered to have planned the murder, while Walus was the triggerman.",
      "News of Walus' release in 2022 was criticized among various sectors of society, sparking protests outside the prison where he was held. He had to be hospitalized after he was stabbed in prison a few days before his pending release.",
      "Minister in the Presidency Khumbudzo Ntshavheni said on Friday that Walus would be deported to Poland and that the Polish government would bear all costs of the deportation process.",
      "Ntshavheni emphasized that the decision to release Walus on parole was taken by the highest court in the country and the government has always opposed his release.",
      "\u201cSince 2011 our ministers of justice and correctional services have fought against the parole, but there is no appeal beyond the Constitutional Court, when it has made an order that decision is final,\u201d she said.",
      "Walus was granted an extension for residence in South Africa after his citizenship was revoked in 2017 while he was in prison and was allowed to serve his parole in South Africa instead of being immediately deported.",
      "The announcement of his deportation was immediately met with criticism by the South African Communist Party, which believes that Walus has never shown remorse for his action nor provided all information about Hani's death, including who ordered it.",
      "The ANC has also called for a full inquest into Hani's death.",
      "\"Today the murderer of our leader will be released from prison, if not released already, taking with him to his homeland the truth about the assassination of our leader.",
      "\u201cWe are reminded of the immense loss inflicted on our movement and our nation,\u201d said ANC secretary general Fikile Mbalula on Friday."

    "story": [
      "UNESCO has inscribed ethnic Slovak na\u00efve paintings from a village in Serbia on its list of intangible cultural heritage",
      "KOVACICA, Serbia -- Nearly a century ago, two farmers in an ethnic Slovak village in northern Serbia started painting to pass the time during the long winter months. This week, their art is being inscribed on UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage list.",
      "The farmers' paintings and those of others from the village of Kovacica are what is known as na\u00efve art \u2014 a form that depicts everyday scenes, landscapes, village life and farm surroundings with a childlike simplicity.",
      "With their bright colors and folk motives, the self-taught na\u00efve painters of Kovacica, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) northeast of Belgrade, Serbia's capital, have developed a unique tradition among the country's ethnic Slovak minority.",
      "\u201cNa\u00efve art in Kovacica began in 1939 when Martin Paluska and Jan Sokol started painting,\u201d explained Ana Zolnaj Barca, the head of the Gallery of Na\u00efve Art in the village. \u201cThey were farmers with only four grades of elementary school.\u201d",
      "Paluska and Sokol initially painted scenes they saw on postcards, such as Venetian gondolas or wild animals, explained Zolnaj Barca. But their art really bloomed over time, when they turned to their own surroundings rather than far-away lands, she said.",
      "The village's na\u00efve art gallery, established in 1955, now holds the works of nearly 50 recognized artists and hosts some 20,000 visitors each year.",
      "Among its most famous artists is Zuzana Chalupova, who often painted children and whose work was featured on millions of UNICEF postcards. Another Kovacica artist, Martin Jonas, depicted farmers with oversized hands and feet but small heads \u2014 meant to symbolize their hard-working life.",
      "And though the Kovacica style of na\u00efve paintings originated in the village, it has since spread far beyond the area.",
      "\u201cAn identifying factor, the practice is a means of transmitting the cultural heritage and history of the Slovak community in Serbia,\u201d UNESCO said in its citation.",
      "Serbia\u2019s government said Tuesday that the UNESCO decision to inscribe Kovacica's na\u00efve paintings confirms the Balkan nation\u2019s \u201cpromotion of cultural diversity.\u201d",
      "For gallerist and expert Pavel Babka, na\u00efve art represents a treasure chest of traditional ways and customs \u2014 he points to a painting in his gallery showing a girl in traditional Slovak multi-layered skirt being sent off to church alone for the first time.",
      "Another painting in Babka's gallery features a horse-drawn cart and a yellow house dating back to Austro-Hungarian times, testifying of the long presence of the ethnic Slovak community in what is today Serbia.",
      "Contemporary na\u00efve artists, Babka said, often also seek inspiration in the tales of the past and \u201cwould rather paint a horse than a tractor.\u201d",
      "Artist Stefan Varga, 65, agrees. He said he paints images based on the \u201cstories my grandmother told me from when she was a little girl.\"",
      "Those times weren't easy but they were \u201csimple and beautiful,\u201d he said.",
      "Varga\u2019s paintings feature cheerful, red-cheeked villagers in traditional clothes, bright colors, farm animals and huge pumpkins. The main characteristics of na\u00efve painting are \u201cjoy and purity, the purity of heart and colors,\" he said.",
      "\u201cNa\u00efve painters usually use simple colors,\u201d said Varga. They \u201cuse the simplest way to say what they want to say so everybody can understand them, whether they are Chinese, Japanese, English or Serb.\u201d"

      "Philippine police officials say they are checking reports that a kidnapped American died after being shot twice while resisting his Oct. 17 abduction by gunmen in the country\u2019s south",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- Philippine police officials said Thursday they are checking reports that a kidnapped American died after being shot twice while resisting his Oct. 17 abduction by gunmen in the country\u2019s south.",
      "Elliot Onil Eastman, 26, from Vermont, was shot twice with an M16 rifle while trying to fight off his four kidnappers, who posed as police officers, in the coastal town of Sibuco in Zamboanga del Norte province, police said.",
      "The kidnappers dragged him to a motorboat and sped off, according to earlier police reports.",
      "A massive search for Eastman and his abductors led to the arrest of a number of suspects, but he has not been found. Three suspects were killed in a gunbattle with police in the south last month.",
      "Regional police spokesperson Lt. Col. Ramoncelio Sawan said investigators received information from a relative of one of the suspects that Eastman died due to gunshot wounds in the thigh and abdomen while being taken away by his abductors.",
      "The kidnappers decided to throw his body into the sea after he died, the relative said. The information about Eastman\u2019s death was later corroborated by a key suspect in the kidnapping who was arrested recently, and his sworn statement has been submitted to government prosecutors, Sawan said.",
      "Criminal complaints of kidnapping have been filed against several suspects, he said.",
      "\u201cWe are constrained to believe that he has died. All of the information that we have points to that,\u201d Sawan said. But he added that without the victim's body, \u201cwe\u2019re still leaving a little bit of hope that it may not be the case\" and police would continue their investigation.",
      "Philippine police have informed Eastman\u2019s Filipino wife and the U.S. Embassy in Manila about his reported death, Sawan said.",
      "The embassy said it's aware of the police report and is coordinating with Philippine authorities, but did not comment further due to privacy considerations.",
      "Eastman traveled out of the Philippines and returned to Sibuco to attend his wife's graduation when he was kidnapped. He had been posting Facebook videos of his life in Sibuco, a poor, remote coastal town, where the suspects spotted him, police earlier said.",
      "They said the suspects appeared to be common criminals who did not belong to any Muslim rebel groups which have been accused of ransom kidnappings in the past.",
      "Security problems have long hounded the southern Philippines, the homeland of a Muslim minority in the largely Roman Catholic nation.",
      "The southern third of the Philippines has bountiful resources but has long been hamstrung by poverty, insurgencies and outlaws.",
      "A 2014 peace agreement between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the largest of several Muslim separatist groups, has considerably eased widespread fighting in the south. Relentless military offensives have weakened smaller armed groups such as the Abu Sayyaf, reducing kidnappings, bombings and other violence.",
      "The Abu Sayyaf has targeted Americans and other Western tourists and missionaries, most of whom were freed after ransoms were paid. A few were killed, including American Guillermo Sobero, who was beheaded on the southern island of Basilan, and a U.S. missionary, Martin Burnham, who was killed while Philippine army forces were trying to rescue him and his wife, Gracia Burnham, in 2002 in a rainforest near Sibuco."

      "French President Emmanuel Macron is accusing political opponents of trying to create \u201cdisorder\u201d and vows to stay in office until his term expires in 2027",
      "PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron came out fighting Thursday in his first comments following the resignation of ousted Prime Minister Michel Barnier, a day after a historic no-confidence vote at the National Assembly left France without a functioning government.",
      "Macron said he will serve as president \u201cuntil the end\u201d of his five-year term scheduled in 2027. He also said he would name a new prime minister within days, but gave no hints who that might be.",
      "Macron laid blame at the door of his opponents on the far right for bringing down the government of Michel Barnier. He said they chose \u201cNot to do but to undo.\u201d \u201cThey chose disorder,\u201d he said. The president said the far right and the far left had united in what he called \u201can anti-Republican front\u201d and stressed: \u201cI won\u2019t shoulder other people\u2019s irresponsibility.\u201d",
      "The National Assembly ousted Barnier by 331 votes, making him the shortest-serving prime minister in modern French history. Macron faces pressure to quickly name a new leader capable of navigating a fractured parliament, where no party holds a majority.",
      "Here is the the Latest:",
      "Macron noted that France\u2019s constitution prevents a new round of legislative elections so soon after the last ones, meaning the country is stuck with the current National Assembly until next July at the earliest. That reality means lawmakers have a duty \u201cto work together, at the service of France and the French.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe world, Europe, are moving ahead, and we need a government that can take decisions,\u201d Macron said.",
      "\u201cWe cannot allow ourselves neither division nor immobility. That is why I will name a prime minister in the coming days.\u201d",
      "While critical of his political opponents, Macron also acknowledged his own role in the chaos now shaking French politics and alarming financial markets. He revisited his decision in June to dissolve parliament. That precipitated the crisis, leading to new legislative elections that produced the now hung parliament, divided between three minority blocs that don\u2019t have enough seats to govern alone and are proving largely incapable of working together \u2013 except to bring down Barnier.",
      "\u201cI do recognize that this decision wasn\u2019t understood. Many people criticized me for it. I know many continue to criticize me for it. It\u2019s a fact. And it\u2019s my responsibility.\u201d",
      "Macron tore into lawmakers who backed the no-confidence vote that forced Barnier\u2019s resignation, accusing them of pursuing their own political interests. He noted that the vote came with the end of year holidays just around the corner.",
      "\u201cWhy did lawmakers act this way? They\u2019re not thinking of you, of your lives, your difficulties,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re thinking of just one thing: the presidential election \u2013 to prepare it, to provoke it, to precipitate it.\u201d",
      "But Macron said he\u2019d see out the 30 months still left in his second and last term as president.",
      "In his address, Macron came out fighting, laying blame at the door of his opponents on the far right for bringing down the government of Michel Barnier. He said they chose \u201cNot to do but to undo.\u201d \u201cThey chose disorder,\u201d he said.",

      "He said he\u2019d name a new prime minister within days but gave no hints who that might be.",
      "Macron, in his address Thursday, vowed to stay in office until his term expires in 2027.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron faces the challenge to pick a prime minister capable of leading a minority government in a parliament where no party holds a majority.",
      "The prime minister is accountable to the parliament, leads the government and introduces bills \u2013 to the risk of being ousted via a no-confidence motion.",
      "Macron previously ruled out choosing the nominee of the left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, because it includes the hard-left France Unbowed party. French media have reported a shortlist of centrist candidates who might appeal to both sides of the political spectrum.",
      "With no majority in parliament, the president is weakened at home, but still holds some extensive powers over foreign policy, European affairs and defense and is in charge of negotiating and ratifying international treaties. The president is also the commander-in-chief of the country\u2019s armed forces and holds the nuclear codes.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron was elected in 2017, before being reelected in 2022 for a five-year term.",
      "A planned protest by teachers against education budget cuts took on a new tone Thursday, as demonstrators in Paris linked their demands to the political crisis sparked by the collapse of Barnier.",
      "\u201cMacron d\u00e9mission!\u201d (\u201cQuit Macron!\u201d) read a sign held by Dylan Quenon, 28, a PE teacher at a middle school in Aubervilliers, just north of Paris. Quenon said President Emmanuel Macron bears responsibility for what he described as the dismantling of public services.",
      "\u201cHe is the one responsible for our dismay, after all he is the one in charge,\u201d Quenon said. \u201cThe only way for this to change is to have him out of office.\u201d",
      "Quenon cited examples of budget constraints in his school, where teachers are limited in making photocopies to save paper and wait months for basic sports equipment like pinnies and balls.",
      "The protest, which drew thousands of people, featured chants targeting Macron, Barnier, and their now-defunct budget bill. Demonstrators sang: \u201cMacron, Barnier et leur budget, et hop tout \u00e7a \u00e0 la poubelle\u201d (\u201cMacron, Barnier, and their budget, throw it all in the trash\u201d).",
      "Protesters also expressed little optimism that Macron\u2019s next appointee would reverse course.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad this government is falling, but it could possibly lead to something even worse,\u201d said \u00c9lise De La Gorce, a 33-year-old philosophy teacher in Stains, north of Paris. \u201cGiven the way the previous government was appointed, I don\u2019t have an ounce of hope that Macron could make the right choice for me.\u201d",
      "France is at no risk of a government shutdown that in the United States would disrupt many services and squeeze federal employees.",
      "An outgoing government could present a special law to levy taxes from Jan. 1, based on this year\u2019s rules. It would also be able to decide on renewing spending by decree in order to pay civil servants, pensions and other key government expenses.",
      "However, this would suspend any potential tax hike \u2014 like one initially expected on big companies \u2014 and freeze any new spending.",
      "In particular, an additional 3.3 billion euro ($3.5 billion) package for the French military was planned as the country supports Ukraine in its war against Russia.",
      "Later, a new government could present its own budget proposals at parliament.",
      "Macron faces the critical task of naming a replacement capable of leading a minority government in a parliament where no party holds a majority. Ya\u00ebl Braun-Pivet, president of the National Assembly and a member of Macron\u2019s party, urged the president to move quickly.",
      "\u201cI recommend he decide rapidly on a new prime minister,\u201d Braun-Pivet said Thursday on France Inter radio. \u201cThere must not be any political hesitation. We need a leader who can speak to everyone and work to pass a new budget bill.\u201d",
      "The process may prove challenging. Macron\u2019s administration has yet to confirm any names, though French media have reported a shortlist of centrist candidates who might appeal to both sides of the political spectrum.",
      "Following the June-July parliamentary elections, the National Assembly, France\u2019s powerful lower house of parliament, is divided into three major blocs: a left-wing coalition known as the New Popular Front, Macron\u2019s centrist allies, and the far-right National Rally party. None won an outright majority.",
      "In September, Macron asked Barnier, a conservative, to form a government dominated by Republicans and centrists \u2014 implicitly relying on the far right\u2019s goodwill to be able to stay in power.",
      "However, in the days before his ousting, far-right leader Marine Le Pen accused Barnier of ignoring her demands and the left-wing coalition denounced an \u201causterity budget\u201d and criticized \u201cthe absence of dialogue and disregard for parliamentary work.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can tell you that it will remain an honor for me to have served France and the French with dignity,\u201d Barnier said in his final speech before the vote.",
      "\u201cThis no-confidence motion \u2026 will make everything more serious and more difficult. That\u2019s what I\u2019m sure of,\u201d he said.",
      "France\u2019s far-right and left-wing lawmakers joined together Wednesday in a historic no-confidence vote prompted by budget disputes. It was the first successful no-confidence vote since 1962.",
      "The National Assembly, the lower house of France\u2019s parliament, approved the motion by 331 votes. A minimum of 288 were needed.",
      "Barnier, 73, was the oldest of the 26 prime ministers who have served modern France\u2019s Fifth Republic. He replaced the youngest, Gabriel Attal, who was 34 when he was appointed.",
      "He is a career politician with humble roots in France\u2019s Alpine region of Haute-Savoie. He was the European Union\u2019s chief negotiator in the difficult talks with Britain over its departure from the bloc.",
      "He also has the shortest tenure of any prime minister.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s speech is scheduled to address the nation in less than an hour and a half. He is expected to address France\u2019s economic challenges while setting a course for the future government."

      "UNICEF estimates that 2,500 ailing children need immediate evacuation from Gaza for treatment abroad",
      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- The 12-year-old Palestinian boy was lying in a hospital bed in central Gaza, wracked with leukemia, malnourished and whimpering in pain despite the morphine doctors were giving him, when Rosalia Bollen, a UNICEF official, said she saw him in late October.",
      "Islam al-Rayahen\u2019s family had asked Israeli authorities six times over the past months for permission to evacuate him from Gaza for a desperately needed stem cell transplant, Bollen said. Six times, the request was refused for unexplained security reasons, she said.",
      "Islam died three days after she saw him, Bollen said.",
      "Thousands of patients in Gaza are waiting for Israeli permission for urgently needed medical evacuation from Gaza for treatment of war wounds or chronic diseases they can\u2019t get after the destruction of much of the territory\u2019s health care system by Israel\u2019s 15-month military campaign.",
      "Among them are at least 2,500 children who UNICEF says must be transported immediately.",
      "\u201cThey cannot afford to wait. These children will die. They\u2019re dying in waiting and I find it striking that the world is letting that happen,\u201d Bollen said.",
      "The Israeli military often takes months to respond to medical evacuation requests, and the number of evacuations has plunged in recent months. In some cases, the military rejects either the patient or, in the case of children, the caregivers accompanying them on vague security grounds or with no explanation.",
      "The Israeli decisions appear to be \u201carbitrary and are not made on a criteria nor logic,\u201d said Moeen Mahmood, the Jordan country director for Doctors Without Borders.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military agency in charge of humanitarian affairs for Palestinians, said in a statement to The Associated Press that it \u201cmakes every effort to approve the departure of children and their families for medical treatments, subject to a security check.\u201d It did not respond when asked for details about Islam's case.",
      "A military official said Israel's internal intelligence service reviews whether the patient or their escort have what he called \u201ca connection to terrorism,\u201d and if one is found they are refused. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential procedures.",
      "Osaid Shaheen, who is nearly 2, now faces having his eyes removed after Israel rejected his evacuation for treatment of cancer in his retinas.",
      "The toddler was diagnosed with the cancer in April, after his mother, Sondos Abu Libda, noticed his left eyelid was droopy. The World Health Organization requested his evacuation through the Rafah border crossing in southern Gaza, but the crossing was shut down in May when Israeli troops took it over in an offensive, Abu Libda said.",
      "WHO applied again, this time for Osaid to leave through the Kerem Shalom crossing into Israel, now the only route for evacuees to travel. During the long wait, the cancer spread to the child\u2019s other eye and reached stage 4.",
      "In November, Abu Libda was told Osaid was rejected on security grounds with no further explanation.",
      "She was stunned, she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that a child could get a security rejection.\u201d",
      "Doctors have given the boy three doses of chemotherapy. But with supplies short in Gaza, they\u2019re struggling to get more. If they can\u2019t, they will have to remove Osaid's eyes or the cancer will spread to other parts of his body, Abu Libda said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s just a child. How will he live his life without seeing? How will he play? How will he see his future and how will his life turn out?\u201d Abu Libda asked, standing outside the house where her family is sheltering in the Beni Suheil district of southern Gaza.",
      "Nearby, little Osaid \u2014 who so far still has his sight \u2014 toddled around in the rubble of a building destroyed by Israeli forces, smiling as he played with chunks of rubble. When asked about his case, COGAT did not reply.",
      "WHO says 14,000 patients of all ages need medical evacuation from Gaza, the territory's Health Ministry puts the number higher, at 22,000, including 7,000 patients in extreme need who could die soon without treatment, according to Mohamed Abu Salmeya, a ministry official in charge of evacuation referrals.",
      "Since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023, 5,230 patients have been evacuated, said Margaret Harris, a WHO spokesperson.",
      "Since May, when the Rafah crossing shut down, the rate has slowed down, with only 342 patients evacuated, she said, an average of less than two a day. Before the war, when Israeli permission was also necessary, around 100 patients a day were transferred out of Gaza, according to WHO.",
      "More than 44,500 Palestinians have been killed and more than 105,000 wounded by Israel\u2019s bombardment and ground offensives, launched in retaliation for Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. The casualty toll, by Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, does not distinguish combatants from civilians \u2014 but more than half are women and children.",
      "Gaza\u2019s health system has been decimated, with only 17 of the territory\u2019s original 36 hospitals functioning \u2014 and those only partially. They struggle with the waves of war wounded on top of patients with other conditions.",
      "Carrying out specialized surgeries or treatments in Gaza is difficult or impossible, with equipment destroyed, some specialist doctors killed or arrested and medical supplies limited. Gaza\u2019s only dedicated cancer hospital was seized by Israeli troops early in the war, heavily damaged and has been shut down.",
      "Doctors without Borders said in August, it sought to evacuate 32 children along with their caregivers, but only six were allowed to leave. In November, it applied for eight others, including a 2-year-old with leg amputations, but Israeli authorities blocked evacuation, it said",
      "The military official said five of the eight requests in November were approved but the caregivers trying to travel with the children were rejected on security grounds. The official said Doctors Without Borders would have to resubmit the requests with alternate escorts. The official didn't say why the other three children weren't approved.",
      "The rejected caregivers were the children's mothers and grandmothers, said Mahmood, the Doctor's Without Borders official, who said no explanation was given for the security concern.",
      "Children long waiting for permission face dire consequences if they don\u2019t get treatment.",
      "Nima al-Askari said doctors told her that 4-year-old Qusay could become paralyzed if her son doesn\u2019t get surgery in the next two or three months for a heart defect that constricts his aorta.",
      "\u201cShould I wait until my son becomes paralyzed?\u201d al-Askari said. \u201cEveryone is telling me to wait until he gets evacuated. ... This is my only son. I can\u2019t see him in a wheelchair.\u201d",
      "Asma Saed said she has been waiting for three months to hear whether her 2-year-old son, Al-Hassan, can travel for treatment for kidney failure. In the meantime, they are living in a squalid tent camp in Khan Younis, with little clean water or food.",
      "She said her son doesn\u2019t sleep, screaming all night.",
      "\u201cI wish I could see him like any child in the world who can move, walk, and play,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a child, he can\u2019t express his pain.\u201d",

      "BERLIN -- An annual festival on a German North Sea island that had drawn criticism over a practice of men hitting women with cow's horns passed without reports of assaults this year, police said Friday.",
      "The Klaasohm festival on Borkum, the westernmost of a string of German islands, takes place on Dec. 5 ahead of St Nicholas' Day. A report by ARD public television aired late last month showed women being stopped by costumed men and hit on the buttocks with a cow's horn at the 2023 festival, and anonymous witnesses discussing aggressive behavior at the event.",
      "The association that organizes the festival said ahead of this year's festival that the practice would be scrapped and it would no longer tolerate violence against women.",
      "The island's mayor, J\u00fcrgen Akkermann, said that the violence had developed from \u201ca tradition of a kind of chastisement\u201d of people who approach the \u201cKlaasohms\u201d \u2014 men dressed up in masks, sheepskin and feathers \u2014 without permission. He said that, following earlier incidents, a rethinking had already started over the past decade, but the matter hadn't been pursued emphatically enough until now, German news agency dpa reported.",
      "For Thursday's festival, police said they raised their presence on Borkum significantly. About 500 people took part in the parade, which drew a large crowd of spectators.",
      "Police said Friday that, when the festival ended around midnight, they had received no reports of bodily harm or any assaults. Regional police chief Thomas Memering said in a statement that, if offenses from this year's or past festivals come to light after the event, they will be prosecuted.",
      "\u201cCustoms and traditions don't provide protection against prosecution,\u201d he said."

      "Syrian insurgents have swept into the central city of Hama after days of intense clashes with government forces",
      "BEIRUT -- Syrian insurgents swept into the central city of Hama on Thursday and government forces withdrew, dealing another major blow to Syrian President Bashar Assad days after insurgents captured much of Aleppo, the country\u2019s largest city.",
      "The stunning weeklong offensive appeared likely to continue, with insurgents setting their sights on Homs, the country\u2019s third-largest city. Homs, which is about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Hama, is the gate to the capital, Damascus, Assad\u2019s seat of power and the coastal region that is a base of support for him.",
      "The offensive is being led by the jihadi group HTS and an umbrella group of Turkish-backed Syrian militias called the Syrian National Army. Their sudden capture of Aleppo, an ancient business hub in the north, was a stunning prize for Assad\u2019s opponents and reignited the Syrian civil war that had been largely a stalemate for the past few years.",
      "Hama is one of the few cities that has remained mostly under government control in the conflict, which broke out in March 2011 following a popular uprising.",
      "By sunset, dozens of jubilant fighters were seen shooting in the air in celebration in live footage from Hama's Assi Square. The square was the scene of massive anti-government protests in the early days of the uprising in 2011, before security forces stormed it and got the city under control.",
      "The Syrian army on Thursday said it redeployed from Hama and took positions outside the city to protect civilians.",
      "Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the de facto leader of the Syrian insurgency, announced in a video message that fighters had reached Hama in a \u201cconquering that is not vengeful, but one of mercy and compassion.\u201d",
      "Al-Golani is the leader of the most powerful insurgent group in Syria, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which previously served as al-Qaida\u2019s branch in Syria and is considered a terrorist group by the United Nations as well as countries including the U.S. The group that was known as the Nusra Front in the early years of Syria's conflict changed its name and said in recent years that it cut ties with al-Qaida.",
      "Al-Golani publicly toured Aleppo on Wednesday and spoke about Hama on Thursday from an undisclosed location in what appeared to be a video filmed with a mobile phone.",
      "\u201cThis is a massive win for the rebels and a strategic blow for the (Syrian) regime,\u201d Dareen Khalifa, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group and an expert on Syrian groups. She said the question is whether the opposition will be able to reach Homs and take over the area, which she said would be a game-changer.",
      "\"I think then we are going to have to pause and consider whether or not this regime can actually survive this war,\u201d she added.",
      "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose country supports the opposition fighters, reiterated during a telephone call with the U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres that the Syrian government should urgently engage with its people \u201cfor a comprehensive political solution.\u201d",
      "Guterres said in a statement later that after 14 years of war in Syria, \u201cit is high time\u201d for all parties to engage seriously in talks to resolve the conflict in line with Security Council Resolution 2254.\u201d",
      "That resolution, which was adopted unanimously in December 2015, endorsed a road map to peace in Syria. The measure called for a Syrian-led political process, starting with the establishment of a transitional governing body, followed by the drafting of a new constitution and ending with U.N.-supervised elections.",
      "The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights \u2014 an opposition war monitor \u2014 said after fierce battles inside Hama, opposition gunmen now control the police headquarters in the city as well as the sprawling air base and the central prison from where hundreds of detainees were set free.",
      "\u201cThe process leading to the fall of the regime has started,\" the Observatory\u2019s chief, Rami Abdurrahman, told The Associated Press.",
      "Aleppo's takeover marked the first opposition attack on the city since 2016, when a brutal Russian air campaign retook it for Assad after rebel forces had initially seized it. Military intervention by Russia, Iran and Iranian-allied Hezbollah, and other militant groups has allowed Assad to remain in power.",
      "The latest flare-up in Syria\u2019s long civil war comes as Assad\u2019s main regional and international backers, Russia and Iran, are preoccupied with their own wars in Gaza, Lebanon and Ukraine. This time, there appeared to be little to no help from his allies.",
      "Tens of thousands of people have been displaced by the renewed fighting, which began with the surprise opposition offensive Nov. 27.",
      "Hama is a major intersection in Syria that links that country\u2019s center with the north as well as the east and west. It is about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the capital. Hama province also borders the coastal province of Latakia, a main base of popular support for Assad.",
      "The city is known for the 1982 massacre of Hama, one of the most notorious in the modern Middle East, when security forces under Assad's late father, Hafez Assad, killed thousands to crush a Muslim Brotherhood uprising.",

      "European Union regulators have ordered TikTok to retain any information related to Romania\u2019s presidential election",
      "LONDON -- European Union regulators ordered TikTok on Thursday to retain any information related to Romania's presidential election, after the country\u2019s top defense body released declassified intelligence alleging that Moscow arranged an online campaign to support a candidate who emerged as a surprise front-runner.",

The order also applies to any national election in the EU until March 31.",
      "TikTok has \u201calready been cooperating with the Commission and will continue to do so,\" the company said in a statement. \"We look forward to establishing the facts in light of some of the speculation and inaccurate reports we have seen.\u201d",

      "On Thursday morning, hours after bitcoin surpassed the $100,000 mark, Trump congratulated \u201cBITCOINERS\u201d on his social media platform Truth Social. He also appeared to take credit for the recent rally, writing, \u201cYOU\u2019RE WELCOME!!!\u201d",
      "Top crypto players welcomed Trump\u2019s election victory last month, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they\u2019ve long lobbied for \u2014 which, generally speaking, aim for an increased sense of legitimacy without too much red tape. And the industry has made sizeable investments along the way. Back in August, Public Citizen, a left-leaning consumer rights advocacy nonprofit, reported finding that crypto-sector corporations spent more than $119 million in 2024 to back pro-crypto candidates across federal elections.",
      "Trump made his latest pro-crypto move when he announced his plans Wednesday to nominate Atkins to chair the SEC. Atkins was an SEC commissioner during the presidency of George W. Bush. In the years since leaving the agency, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation. He joined the Token Alliance, a cryptocurrency advocacy organization, in 2017.",
      "Under current chair Gary Gensler, who will step down when Trump takes office, the SEC has cracked down on the crypto industry \u2014 penalizing a number of companies for violating securities laws. Gensler has also faced ample criticism from industry players in the process.",
      "One crypto-friendly move the SEC did make under Gensler was the approval in January of spot bitcoin ETFs, or exchange trade funds, which allow investors to have a stake in bitcoin without directly buying it. The spot ETFs were the dominant driver of bitcoin's price before Trump's win \u2014 but, like much of the crypto\u2019s recent momentum, saw record inflows postelection.",
      "Bitcoin surpassing the coveted $100,000 mark has left much of the crypto world buzzing.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing isn\u2019t just a rally \u2014 it\u2019s a fundamental transformation of bitcoin\u2019s place in the financial system,\u201d Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder of crypto custodian Anchorage Digital, said in a statement \u2014 while pointing to the growth of who's entering the market, particularly with rising institutional adoption.",
      "Still, others note that the new heights of bitcoin's price don't necessarily mean the asset is going mainstream. The $100,000 level is \u201cmerely a psychological factor and ultimately just a number,\u201d Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at British investment company AJ Bell, wrote in a Thursday commentary.",
      "That being said, bitcoin could keep climbing to more and more all-time highs, particularly if Trump makes good on his promises for more crypto-friendly regulation once in office. If Trump actually makes a bitcoin reserve, for example, supply changes could also propel the price forward.",
      "\u201cIt is hard to overstate the magnitude of the change in Washington\u2019s attitude towards crypto post-election,\u201d Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, said via email Thursday, reiterating that prices could keep rising if trends persist. \u201cThere is a lot more demand than there is supply, and that\u2019s usually a pretty good recipe for success.\u201d",
      "Still, as with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is never promised. Worldwide regulatory uncertainties and environmental concerns around bitcoin \u201cmining\" \u2014 the creation of new bitcoin, which consumes a lot of energy \u2014 are among factors that analysts like Coatsworth note could hamper future growth. And, as still a relatively young asset with a history of volatility, longer-term adoption has yet to be seen through.",
      "Today\u2019s excitement around bitcoin may make many who aren\u2019t already in the space want to get in on the action. For those in a position to invest, Hougan says it's not too late \u2014 noting that bitcoin is still early in its development and most institutional investors \u201cstill have zero exposure.\u201d",
      "At the same time, Hougan and others maintain that it's important to tread cautiously and not bite off more than you can chew. Experts continue to stress caution around getting carried away with crypto \u201cFOMO,\u201d or the fear of missing out, especially for small-pocketed investors.",
      "\u201cA lot of people have got rich from the cryptocurrency soaring in value this year, but this high-risk asset isn\u2019t suitable for everyone,\u201d Coatsworth noted Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s volatile, unpredictable and is driven by speculation, none of which makes for a sleep-at-night investment.\u201d",
      "In short, history shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you\u2019ve made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.",
      "Coatsworth points to recent research from the Bank for International Settlements, a Switzerland-based global organization of central banks, which found that about three-quarters of retail buyers on crypto exchange apps likely lost money on their bitcoin investments between 2015 and 2022.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, during high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. And the late-2022 collapse of FTX significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall, with bitcoin falling below $17,000.",
      "Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs, and again, now the post-election frenzy. But lighter regulation from the coming Trump administration could also mean less guardrails.",

      "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield says it won't tie payments to the length of time a patient went under anesthesia",
      "One of the country\u2019s largest health insurers reversed a change in policy Thursday after widespread outcry, saying it would not tie payments in some states to the length of time a patient went under anesthesia.",
      "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield said in a statement that its decision to backpedal resulted from \u201csignificant widespread misinformation\u201d about the policy.",
      "\u201cTo be clear, it never was and never will be the policy of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to not pay for medically necessary anesthesia services,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe proposed update to the policy was only designed to clarify the appropriateness of anesthesia consistent with well-established clinical guidelines.\u201d",
      "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield would have used \"physician work time values,\" which is published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as the metric for anesthesia limits; maternity patients and patients under the age of 22 were exempt. But Dr. Jonathan Gal, economics committee chair of the American Society for Anesthesiologists, said it's unclear how CMS derives those values.",
      "In mid-November, the American Society for Anesthesiologists called on Anthem to \u201creverse the proposal immediately,\u201d saying in a news release that the policy would have taken effect in February in New York, Connecticut and Missouri. It's not clear how many states in total would have been affected, as notices also were posted in Virginia and Colorado.",
      "People across the country registered their concerns and complaints on social media, and encouraged people in affected states to call their legislators. Some people noted that the policy could prevent patients from getting overcharged.",
      "Gal said the policy change would have been unprecedented, ignored the \u201cnuanced, unpredictable human element\u201d of surgery and was a clear \u201cmoney grab.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incomprehensible how a health insurance company could so blatantly continue to prioritize their profits over safe patient care,\u201d he said. \"If Anthem is, in fact, rescinding the policy, we\u2019re delighted that they came to their senses.\u201d",
      "Prior to Anthem's announcement Thursday, Connecticut comptroller Sean Scanlon said the \u201cconcerning\u201d policy wouldn't affect the state after conversations with the insurance company. And New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in an emailed statement Thursday that her office had also successfully intervened.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. severely lags behind China in shipbuilding capacity, lawmakers and experts have warned, as the Biden administration tries to build up the country's ability to develop and produce weapons and other defense supplies to fend off war.",
      "Speaking at a congressional hearing Thursday, Rep. John Moolenaar, the Republican chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said the country lacks the capacity to \u201cdeter and win a fight\u201d with China and called for action.",
      "\u201cBold policy changes and significant resources are now needed to restore deterrence and prevent a fight\u201d with China, Moolenaar said.",
      "China\u2019s navy is already the world\u2019s largest, and its shipbuilding capacity, estimated to be 230 times larger, dwarfs that of the U.S.",
      "Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking Democratic member of the committee, told Fox News last week that \u201cfor every one oceangoing vessel that we can produce, China can produce 359 in one single year.\"",
      "The U.S. government has come to see China as its \u201cpacing challenge,\" and officials have warned that Beijing is pursuing the largest peacetime military buildup in history, raising concerns about how the U.S. would respond and ensure victory in case of a conflict in the Indo-Pacific, where tensions are high in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.",
      "Krishnamoorthi on Thursday warned that a weak military industrial base could invite aggression and argued that strengthening it is necessary to avoid war with China.",
      "\u201cHistory tells us we need a healthy defense industrial base now to deter aggression and make sure the world\u2019s dictators think again before dragging the U.S. and the world into yet another disastrous conflict,\u201d Krishnamoorthi said.",
      "National security adviser Jake Sullivan called it a \u201cgenerational project\u201d to fix the problem after the American shipbuilding industry had its \u201cbottom fell out\u201d in the early 1980s.",
      "\u201cPart of it is we don't have the backbone of a healthy commercial shipbuilding base to rest our naval shipbuilding on top of,\u201d Sullivan said Wednesday at the Aspen Security Forum in Washington. \u201cAnd that's part of the fragility of what we're contending with and why this is going to be such a generational project to fix.\u201d",
      "The challenge in shipbuilding has been \u201cespecially immense,\u201d stemming from the hollowing-out of the U.S. manufacturing base where its workforce shrank and suppliers left, Sullivan said.",
      "And it is part of the broader problem of a weakened U.S. military industrial base, as manifested in the weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, Sullivan said, when Kyiv in eight weeks \u201cburned through a year's worth of U.S. 155-millimeter artillery production.\"",
      "\u201cDecades of underinvestments and consolidation had seriously eroded our defense industrial base, and there was no way around it,\u201d Sullivan said.",
      "The head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, Adm. Samuel Paparo, warned last month that the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East were eating away at critical U.S. weapons stockpiles and could hamper the military\u2019s ability to respond to China should a conflict arise.",
      "He said providing or selling billions of dollars worth of air defenses to both Ukraine and Israel were hampering U.S. ability to respond to threats in the Indo-Pacific.",

      "BANGKOK -- China has banned exports of key materials used to make a wide range of products, including smartphones, electric vehicles, radar systems and CT scanners, swiping back at Washington after it expanded export controls to include dozens of Chinese companies that make equipment used to produce advanced computer chips.",
      "Both sides say their controls are justified by national security concerns and both accuse the other of \u201cweaponizing\u201d trade. Analysts say the latest restrictions could have a wide impact on manufacturing in many industries and supply chains.",
      "\u201cCritical mineral security is now intrinsically linked to the escalating tech trade war,\u201d Gracelin Baskaran and Meredith Schwartz of the Center for Strategic International Studies, wrote in a report on Beijing's decision.",
      "The full impact will depend partly on whether U.S. industries can compensate for any loss of access to the strategically important materials, equipment and components.",
      "Here\u2019s why this could be a tipping point in trade conflict between the two biggest economies, coming at a time when antagonisms already were expected to heat up once President-elect Donald Trump takes office, given his vows to hike tariffs on imports of Chinese-made products.",
      "China has banned, in principle, exports to the United States of gallium, germanium and antimony \u2014 critical minerals needed to make advanced semiconductors, among many other types of equipment. Beijing also tightened controls on exports of graphite, which is used in EV and grid-storage batteries. China is the largest source for most of these materials and also dominates refining of those materials, which are used both for consumer goods and for military purposes.",
      "The limits announced Tuesday also include exports of super-hard materials, such as diamonds and other synthetic materials that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective coatings.",
      "Next on the list of potential bans, experts say: tungsten, magnesium and aluminum alloys.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced its measures after the U.S. government ordered a slew of new measures meant to prevent sales to China of certain types of advanced semiconductors and the tools and software needed to make them. Washington also expanded its \u201centity list\u201d of companies facing strict export controls to include 140 more companies, nearly all of them based in China or Chinese-owned.",
      "Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the revised rules were intended to impair China\u2019s ability to use advanced technologies that \u201cpose a risk to our national security.\u201d The updated regulations also limit exports to China of high-bandwidth memory chips that are needed to process massive amounts of data in advanced applications such as artificial intelligence.",
      "Export licenses will likely be denied for any U.S. company trying to do business with the 140 companies newly added to the \u201centity list,\u201d as well as the dozens of others already on the list. The aim, officials said, is to stop Chinese companies from leveraging U.S. technology to make their own semiconductors.",
      "The Biden administration has been expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls while encouraging an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of semiconductors in the U.S. and other Western countries.",
      "Washington also extended the restrictions on exports of advanced semiconductor technology to companies in other countries, though it excluded companies in key allies like Japan, South Korea and the Netherlands that are thought to have adequate export controls of their own.",
      "In a word: very. For the U.S., Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and other producers of advanced technology and components, access to materials with such properties as high conductivity is crucial: gallium and germanium increasingly are used in advanced semiconductors in place of silicon.",
      "The materials subject to Chinese export controls are among 50 the United States Geologic Survey has designated as \u201ccritical minerals\u201d \u2014 non-fuel minerals essential to U.S. economic or national security that have supply chains vulnerable to disruption.",
      "Gallium topped that list. It is needed to make the same high-bandwidth memory chips the U.S. wants to avoid allowing China to access for use in artificial intelligence and defense applications. It's used to make LEDs, lasers and magnets used in many products. Germanium is used for optical fiber and solar panels, among other uses.",
      "A USGS study recently estimated the likely total cost to the U.S. economy from disruptions to supplies of gallium and germanium alone at more than $3 billion. But the situation is complicated. China imposed licensing requirements on exports of both metals in July 2023. It has not exported either to the U.S. this year, according to Chinese customs data. Antimony exports also have plunged.",
      "China produces the lion's share of most critical minerals, but there are alternatives. Japan also imports nearly all of its gallium, for example, but it also extracts it by recycling scrap metal.",
      "Washington has been moving to tap sources other than China, forming a \"Minerals Security Partnership\" with the EU and 15 other countries. President Joe Biden's visit to Africa this week highlighted that effort. Potential supply disruptions also have spurred efforts to tap U.S. deposits of rare earths and other critical materials in southeastern Wyoming, Montana, Nevada, Minnesota and parts of the American Southwest.",
      "Germanium has been extracted from zinc mined in Alaska and Tennessee and the U.S. government has a stockpile. The Department of Defense has a recycling program that can extract scrap germanium from night vision lenses and tank turret windows.",
      "But China's dominance as a supplier gives it an overwhelming cost advantage, and U.S. resource companies face strong pressures over the potential environmental impact of mines and refineries.",
      "Since then-President Trump launched a trade war against Beijing that has ramped up over time, China has adopted a relatively constrained and cautious approach in responding to the U.S. limits on access to advanced technology.",
      "Much depends on the future course of overall relations. It is unclear if Trump will follow through on his vows to push tariffs sharply higher once he takes office or if such declarations are the opening gambits in future trade negotiations.",
      "China hit back with its own tariff hikes, but excluded many items crucial for its own economy. It sanctioned certain companies, especially defense contractors doing business with Taiwan, but refrained from outright bans on exports of vital materials to the U.S.",
      "This time may be different.",
      "Just after China's Commerce Ministry announced its export ban, various Chinese industry associations including automakers and the China Semiconductor Association issued statements denouncing Washington's moves to curb access to strategically sensitive technologies and declaring that U.S. computer chips are unreliable.",
      "Beijing's announcement also extends its ban on exporting Chinese-produced gallium and other critical minerals to the U.S. to apply to all countries, entities and individuals, saying violators will \u201cbe held accountable according to law.\u201d"

      "Although Waymo is still piling up substantial losses under its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., the service now provides more than 150,000 weekly trips without any history of catastrophic traffic accidents. That track record has increased confidence that Waymo will be able to continue to steer its robotaxis into more markets and eventually produce a steady stream of profits \u2014 an expectation that helped it recently raise $5.6 billion from Alphabet and a list of other major investors.",

      "Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is backing a bill designed to protect reproductive health data including data logged on menstrual cycle tracking apps. Similar legislation that has passed in other states is aimed at keeping the data from being used to target people seeking abortions.",
      "\u201cThis feels like a very urgent need for us to get this done while we have a window in Michigan with the Democratic majority for the next few weeks,\u201d said state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, sponsor of the digital privacy bill.",
      "The rush is a reaction to expectations that it will be harder to pass the reproductive health care policies Democrats favor after Republicans take control of the state House in January. Democrats kept control of the state Senate in the November election.",
      "Republicans have opposed the digital privacy bill over a section they say will stifle anti-abortion advertising.",
      "Other reproductive health bills to be considered during the December session that began Tuesday include a package on Black maternal health and an expansion of access to birth control.",
      "After the overturn of Roe v. Wade, some women in states with strict abortion bans began to worry that their health information could be used to track their reproductive status. Apps that track menstrual cycles became a major focus point.",

      "Smartmatic does not need to give Fox News any information about U.S. federal charges against the voting machine company\u2019s co-founder over alleged bribery in the Philippines",
      "NEW YORK -- Smartmatic won't be required to give Fox News a trove of information about U.S. federal charges against the voting machine company's co-founder over alleged bribery in the Philippines, a judge ruled Thursday.",
      "Fox News and parent Fox Corp. sought the information to help fight Smartmatic's $2.7 billion defamation suit over broadcasts about the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Smartmatic says its business was gutted when Fox aired false claims that the election-tech company helped rig the voting.",
      "Fox says it was simply reporting on newsworthy allegations made by then-President Donald Trump and his allies.",
      "At the same hearing, Judge David B. Cohen also turned down Smartmatic's request to question two Fox Corp. board members. The company has already questioned others.",
      "The Aug. 8 indictment of Smartmatic co-founder Roger Pi\u00f1ate and two other executives concerns a geographically distant matter: Smartmatic's efforts to get work in the Philippines between 2015 and 2018.",
      "But Fox maintains the criminal case is pertinent to Smartmatic's business prospects, and therefore to the election-tech company's claims about what it lost and stands to lose because of Fox's 2020 coverage.",
      "\u201cAs of Aug 8, governments will have to take into account the risks of doing business with a company (where some executives have been) accused of serious corruption by the U.S. Department of Justice,\" Fox lawyer Brad Masters told a New York court Thursday.",
      "He asked the court to order Smartmatic to provide any documents that it has given to the DOJ for the bribery investigation; any customer inquiries about the criminal charges; and any staff communications about the matter and its impact on the company.",
      "The indictment accuses Pi\u00f1ate and two other Smartmatic executives of scheming to pay over $1 million in bribes to a Filipino election official to deploy the company's machines and pay promptly for them. Federal prosecutors say the payments were made through sham loan agreements and via a slush fund created by overcharging for the machines.",
      "Pi\u00f1ate, who has served as Smartmatic\u2019s president, and at least one of the other executives have pleaded not guilty to conspiring to violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and to money laundering. It\u2019s unclear from court records whether the third executive has entered a plea or has an attorney who can comment on the charges.",
      "Boca Raton, Florida-based Smartmatic itself isn\u2019t charged in the criminal case. The company put the executives on leave and sought to reassure voters that elections are \u201cconducted with the utmost integrity and transparency.\u201d",
      "Smartmatic's lawyers contend the indictment is irrelevant to the defamation suit, which is about election-fraud claims that Trump's attorneys made on Fox News programs.",
      "The indictment is \u201cmerely an allegation,\u201d Smartmatic attorney Caitlin Kovacs argued Thursday. She suggested Fox wanted to \u201cplay prosecutor to the jury\u201d and \u201caccuse Smartmatic of a crime that they didn\u2019t commit.\u201d",
      "Cohen denied two similar requests from Fox while the federal investigation was ongoing. He said Thursday that the indictment didn't change his mind.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a mere accusation. It raises no presumption of guilt,\u201d he said.",
      "Smartmatic is suing over shows in which Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell portrayed the company as part of a broad conspiracy to steal the 2020 vote from Trump, a Republican and the winner of this year's election.",
      "Federal and state election officials, exhaustive reviews in battleground states and Trump\u2019s own then-attorney general found no widespread fraud that could have changed the outcome of the 2020 election. Nor did they uncover any credible evidence that the vote was tainted. Dozens of judges, including some whom Trump appointed, rejected his fraud claims.",
      "Fox News ultimately aired an interview with an election technology expert who refuted the allegations against Smartmatic.",
      "As is normal in the run-up to a civil trial, various players connected to both parties have been questioned under oath by the other side's lawyers. These out-of-court sessions are called depositions.",
      "Smartmatic wanted Thursday to get depositions ordered for Fox Corp. board members Chase Carey and Roland Hernandez. The two attended meetings where critical decisions were made, Smartmatic argues.",
      "Fox lawyer Devin Anderson said there's no indication that Carey and Hernandez \u201chave any relevant information\u201d to add. Smartmatic already has questioned other board members, including Executive Chair and CEO Lachlan Murdoch and former House Speaker Paul Ryan, as well as Fox founder Rupert Murdoch, the attorney said.",
      "Depositions generally aren't made public at this stage of a case.",
      "Smartmatic lawyer Erik Connolly said after court that the company was pursuing other information to show \u201cthat Fox Corp. controlled the disinformation spread by Fox News.\u201d",
      "A message seeking comment was sent to Fox. The news network is countersuing Smartmatic, claiming the defamation case violates a New York law against baseless suits aimed at squelching reporting or criticism on public issues.",
      "Smartmatic recently settled defamation suits against One America News Network and Newsmax. Fox News settled for $787 million last year with another voting-technology company, Dominion Voting Systems."

      "LONDON -- British Prime Minister Keir Starmer vowed Thursday to take on the \u201calliance of naysayers\u201d and the bureaucratic \u201cnonsense\u201d that have hampered construction projects in the U.K., as he outlined a series of new pledges that he hopes will change the narrative on his five-month-old government following a slide in its approval ratings.",
      "In a speech at Pinewood Film Studios west of London, Starmer said his \u201cPlan for Change\u201d represented the next phase of his center-left Labour government, which was elected in a landslide victory in July on a promise to get Britain\u2019s sluggish economy growing and restore frayed public services such as the state-funded National Health Service.",
      "While Starmer's office insisted that the speech was not a relaunch, Kemi Badenoch, leader of the main opposition Conservative Party said it was an \u201cemergency reset\u201d by a floundering administration that \"doesn\u2019t know what it is doing.\u201d",
      "Starmer set out six \u201cmilestones\u201d by which his government can be assessed by the time of the next election, which has to take place by summer 2029. They include raising living standards, building 1.5 million homes in England. clearing hospital backlogs, bolstering community policing, improving early years education and securing home-grown energy.",
      "\u201cWe face an almighty challenge to hit these milestones by the end of this Parliament,\" he said. \u201cOur plan for change that is the most ambitious and credible program for government in a generation and we embrace the risk that comes with that.\u201d",
      "Critics said the government had scaled back its ambitions and sidelined the need to get migration levels down, an omission pounced upon by the Conservatives and anti-immigration party, Reform U.K.",
      "Many of the aspirations for the economy and housing will depend hugely on reforming the planning process so the government can override local concerns to get something built. Highlighting how a tunnel full of bats has caused a costly delay in the construction of a high-speed rail line between London and Birmingham, Starmer said things have to change.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t built a reservoir for over 30 years, and even the projects we do approve are fought tooth and nail, nail and tooth, until you end up with the absurd spectacle of a 100 million-pound bat tunnel holding up the country\u2019s single biggest infrastructure project, driving up taxes and the cost of living beyond belief,\" he said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you now, this government will not accept this nonsense any more.\u201d",
      "Starmer will hope the speech can turn the tide for a government that has struggled to maintain momentum since the election after a row over freebies, the removal from millions of retirees a payment that helps cover winter heating costs and opposition from many businesses and farmers over October\u2019s big tax-hiking budget.",
      "Starmer has insisted that the early months in power have been all about \u201cfixing the foundations\" because the previous Conservative government, which had been in power for 14 years, left a 22 billion-pound ($28 billion) \u201cblack hole\u201d in the public finances, a charge vigorously denied by the Conservatives.",
      "The government\u2019s first budget in late October included billions in new money for the health system, but also hiked a tax paid by employers to the alarm of many businesses, and imposed inheritance tax on farmers for the first time in decades.",
      "Starmer\u2019s poll ratings have plunged deep into negative territory \u2013 though the opposition Conservatives are no more popular. With the two main parties struggling, voters are increasingly looking at alternatives, such as the centrist Liberal Democrats and Reform U.K., which took votes from the Conservatives at the last election and is now targeting Labour heartland areas such as the north of England and Wales.",
      "The challenge for the Labour government is to make sure that voters see a visible improvement by the time of the next election, and Starmer knows that.",
      "\u201cNow, populism isn\u2019t the answer to Britain\u2019s challenges,\" he said. \u201cEasy answers won\u2019t make our country strong.\u201d",
      "Much of Starmer's time as prime minister has been focused overseas. In Europe, he is trying to reset Britain\u2019s relations with the European Union following years of acrimony over Brexit. But efforts to move closer to the bloc risk angering incoming President Donald Trump, who is hostile to the EU and has threatened to impose tariffs on European goods.",

      "Trump has said that child care is \u201csomething you have to have in this country\" and suggested that his plans to tax imports from foreign nations at higher levels would cover the cost of child care reform, although his campaign website does not mention the issue among the administration's priorities. Vice President-elect JD Vance has criticized efforts by the Biden administration to control rising costs in child care centers, arguing that doing so encourages parents to go back to work and neglects those who prefer to care for their children at home.",
      "Regarding prohibitively high child care costs \u2014- which can exceed the cost of rent for some families, according to a Department of Labor report published last month \u2014 Vance suggested parents should lean more on family members for care.",

      "Organizations can take action by establishing informed policies, programs and resources, positioning managers to be the support system employees need, and prioritizing a culture of well-being, explained Kristin Barry, director of hiring analytics at Gallup.",

      "The Biden administration has only seven weeks left in office, but officials are still trying to enact consumer-protection regulations on airlines",

      "Such a rule would go far beyond the current requirement for airlines to pay ticket refunds. It would make U.S. policy more closely resemble airline consumer protections in Europe.",
      "But with less than seven weeks until President Joe Biden leaves office, the fate of additional regulations on airlines will be left in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump's administration.",
      "The industry trade group Airlines for America said the Biden administration's proposal would drive up ticket prices.",
      "\u201cIn this highly competitive industry, carriers don\u2019t need further incentive to provide quality service,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cThis proposal is simply one in a long string of ill-conceived and rushed rules from an administration intent on reregulating the U.S. airline industry.\u201d",

      "The department said it is considering cash compensation that could go as high as $775 for delays of nine hours or more. The agency is considering letting small airlines pay less compensation than large ones.",
      "The proposal will likely include free rebooking on the next available flight, possibly on another airline, and meals and lodging when passengers are stranded overnight. Many of the largest U.S. airlines already promise that kind of help when a delay or cancellation is their fault.",

They say Mercosur producers would be allowed to flood the market with produce than do not have to meet the strict EU environmental and animal protection standards they have to abide by, thus unfairly undercutting the market. On top of that, they say South American producers benefit from lower labor costs and larger farms.",

      "NEW YORK -- The huge rally for U.S. stocks lost momentum on Thursday as Wall Street counted down to a big jobs report that\u2019s coming on Friday. The crypto market had more action, and bitcoin briefly burst to a record  above $103,000 before pulling back.",
      "The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% from the all-time high it had set the day before, its 56th of the year so far,  to shave a bit off what\u2019s set to be one of its best years of the millennium. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 248 points, or 0.6%, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2% from its own record set the day before.",
      "Bitcoin powered above $100,000 for the first time the night before, after President-elect Donald Trump  chose Paul Atkins, who's seen as a crypto advocate, as his nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. The cryptocurrency has climbed dramatically from less than $70,000 on Election Day, but it fell back as Thursday progressed toward $99,000, according to CoinDesk.",
      "Sharp swings for bitcoin  are nothing new, and they took stocks of companies enmeshed in the crypto world on a similar ride. After rising as much as 9% in early trading, MicroStrategy, a company that\u2019s been raising cash just to buy bitcoin, swung to a loss of 4.8%. Crypto exchange Coinbase Global fell 3.1% after likewise erasing a big early gain.",

      "American Airlines Group soared 16.8% after saying it\u2019s making more in revenue during the last three months of 2024 than it expected, and it will likely make a bigger profit than it had earlier forecast. The airline also chose Citi to be its exclusive partner for credit cards that give miles in its loyalty program. That should help its cash coming in from co-branded credit card and other partners grow by about 10% annually.",
      "Southwest Airlines climbed 2% after saying it\u2019s seeing stronger demand from leisure travelers than it expected. It also raised its forecast for revenue for the holiday traveling season.",
      "On the losing end of Wall Street was Synposys, which tumbled 12.4%. The supplier for the semiconductor industry reported better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, but it also warned of \u201ccontinued macro uncertainties\u201d and gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that fell short of some analysts\u2019 estimates.",
      "American Eagle Outfitters fell even more, 14.3%, after the retailer said it\u2019s preparing for \u201cpotential choppiness\u201d outside of peak selling periods. It was reminiscent of a warning from Foot Locker earlier in the week and raised more concerns about how resilient U.S. shoppers can remain.",
      "Solid spending by U.S. consumers has been one of the main reasons the U.S. economy has avoided a recession  that earlier seemed inevitable  after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to crush inflation. But shoppers are now contending with still-high prices and a slowing job market.",
      "This week\u2019s highlight for Wall Street will be Friday\u2019s jobs report from the U.S. government, which will show how many people employers hired and fired last month. A report on Thursday said the number of U.S. workers applying for unemployment benefits  rose last week but remains at historically healthy levels.",
      "Expectations are high that the Fed will cut its main interest rate again when it meets in two weeks. The Fed began easing its main interest rate  from a two-decade high in September, hoping to offer more support for the job market.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has rejected a deal that would have let Boeing to plead guilty to a felony conspiracy charge and pay a fine for misleading U.S. regulators about the 737 Max jetliner before two of the planes crashed and 346 people died",
      "DALLAS -- A federal judge on Thursday rejected a deal that would have let Boeing plead guilty to a felony conspiracy charge and pay a fine for misleading U.S. regulators about the 737 Max jetliner before two of the planes crashed, killing 346 people.",
      "U.S. District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor in Texas said that diversity, inclusion and equity or DEI policies in the government and at Boeing could result in race being a factor in picking an official to oversee Boeing's compliance with the agreement.",
      "The ruling creates uncertainty around criminal prosecution of the aerospace giant in connection with the development of its bestselling airline plane.",
      "The judge gave Boeing and the Justice Department 30 days to tell him how they plan to proceed. They could negotiate a new plea agreement, or prosecutors could move to put the company on trial.",
      "The Justice Department said it was reviewing the ruling. Boeing did not comment immediately.",
      "Paul Cassell, an attorney for families of passengers who died in the crashes, called the decision an important victory for the rights of crime victims.",
      "\u201cNo longer can federal prosecutors and high-powered defense attorney craft backroom deals and just expect judges to approve them,\u201d Cassell said. \u201cJudge O\u2019Connor has recognized that this was a cozy deal between the government and Boeing that failed to focus on the overriding concerns -- holding Boeing accountable for its deadly crime and ensuring that nothing like this happens again in the future.\u201d",
      "Many relatives of the passengers who died in the crashes, which took place off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019, have spent years pushing for a public trial, the prosecution of former company officials, and more severe financial punishment for Boeing.",
      "The deal the judge rejected was reached in July and would have let Boeing plead guilty to defrauding regulators who approved pilot-training requirements for the 737 Max nearly a decade ago. Prosecutors said they did not have evidence to argue that Boeing\u2019s deception played a role in the crashes.",
      "In his ruling, O\u2019Connor focused on part of the agreement that called for an independent monitor to oversee Boeing\u2019s steps to prevent violation of anti-fraud laws during three years of probation.",
      "O\u2019Connor expressed particular concern that the agreement \u201crequires the parties to consider race when hiring the independent monitor \u2026 \u2018in keeping with the (Justice) Department\u2019s commitment to diversity and inclusion.\u2019\u201d",
      "O\u2019Connor, a conservative appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush, questioned Justice Department and Boeing lawyers in October about the role of DEI in selection of the monitor. Department lawyers said selection would be open to all qualified candidates and based on merit.",
      "The judge wrote in Thursday\u2019s ruling that he was \u201cnot convinced \u2026 the Government will not choose a monitor without race-based considerations.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn a case of this magnitude, it is in the utmost interest of justice that the public is confident this monitor selection is done based solely on competency. The parties\u2019 DEI efforts only serve to undermine this confidence in the government and Boeing\u2019s ethics and anti-fraud efforts,\u201d he wrote.",
      "O\u2019Connor also objected that the plea deal called for the government to pick the monitor and for the appointee to report to the Justice Department, not the court. The judge also noted that Boeing would have been able to veto one of six candidates chosen by the government.",
      "Todd Haugh, a business law and ethics expert at Indiana University, could not recall any previous corporate plea deals that were rejected over DEI. He said the larger issue was how the deal took sentencing power away from the court.",
      "\u201cThat is a legitimate argument from which to reject a plea agreement, but this particular judge has really stood on this DEI issue,\u201d Haugh said. \u201cIt comes through loud and clear in the order.\"",
      "The ruling leaves prosecutors in a bind because they can't simply ignore a government DEI policy that goes back to 2018, he said.",
      "Prosecutors also must weigh the risks and uncertain outcome before pushing for a trial.",
      "Boeing negotiated the plea deal only after the Justice Department determined this year that Boeing violated a 2021 agreement that had protected it against criminal prosecution on the same fraud-conspiracy charge.",
      "Boeing lawyers have said that if the plea deal was rejected, the company would challenge the finding that it violated the earlier agreement. Without the finding, the government has no case.",
      "The judge helped Boeing\u2019s position on Thursday, writing that it was not clear what the company did to violate the 2021 deal.",
      "The Justice Department accused Boeing of defrauding Federal Aviation Administration regulators who approved pilot-training requirements for the 737 Max.",
      "Acting on Boeing\u2019s incomplete disclosures, the FAA approved minimal, computer-based training instead of more intensive training in flight simulators. Simulator training would have increased the cost for airlines to operate the Max and might have pushed some to buy planes from rival Airbus instead.",
      "When the Justice Department announced in 2021 that it had reached a settlement and would not prosecute Boeing for fraud, families of the victims were outraged. Judge O\u2019Connor ruled last year that the Justice Department broke a victims-rights law by not telling relatives that it was negotiating with Boeing, but said he had no power to overturn the deal.",
      "The 2021 deferred-prosecution agreement was due to expire in January, and it was widely expected that prosecutors would seek to permanently drop the matter. Just days before that, however, a door plug blew off a 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight over Oregon.",
      "That incident renewed concerns about manufacturing quality and safety at Boeing, and put the company under intense scrutiny by regulators and lawmakers.",
      "The case is just one of many challenges facing Boeing, which has lost more than $23 billion since 2019 and fallen behind Airbus in selling and delivering new planes.",
      "The company went through a strike by factory workers that shut down most airplane production for seven weeks this fall, and announced that it will lay off 10% of its workers, about 17,000 people. Its shares have plunged about 40% in less than a year."

      "Hiring in the United States likely rebounded last month from a dismal October, when hurricanes and strikes reduced job growth to its lowest level in nearly four years",
      "WASHINGTON -- Hiring in the United States likely rebounded last month from a dismal October, when hurricanes and strikes reduced job growth to its lowest level in nearly four years.",
      "Friday's jobs report from the Labor Department is expected to show that employers added roughly 208,000 jobs in November, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet. That would mark a sharp bounce-back from October\u2019s gain of just 12,000 jobs, the fewest in any month since December 2020.",
      "The job market has cooled from the dizzying heights of 2021-2023, when the economy was delivering a robust recovery from the pandemic recession of 2020 and many employers were hiring aggressively. Still, October\u2019s slump was exaggerated by the temporary effects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton and by strikes at Boeing and elsewhere.",
      "Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, has estimated that the hurricanes reduced hiring in October by 75,000 but that by November, 60,000 of those workers were back on payrolls. Likewise, the end of strikes at Boeing and Textron Aviation is thought to have increased payrolls last month by up to 38,000 jobs.",
      "Overall, Vanden Houten wrote in a commentary, the November jobs report will probably show that hiring remains \u201crelatively strong.\u2019\u2019",
      "The unemployment rate is thought to have remained at a low 4.1% in November, a sign that Americans as a whole are enjoying unusual job security. This week, the government reported that layoffs fell to just 1.6 million in October, below the lowest levels in the two decades that preceded the pandemic. At the same time, the number of job openings rebounded from a 3 1/2 year low, a sign that businesses are still seeking workers even though hiring has cooled.",
      "The American economy, the world\u2019s largest, has demonstrated its resilience under the continued pressure of high interest rates. To fight the worst bout of inflation in four decades, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. The much higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses that resulted were expected to tip the economy into a recession. Instead, it kept growing as consumers continued to spend and employers continued to hire.",
      "The economy grew at a 2.8% annual pace from July through September on healthy spending by consumers. Annual economic growth has topped a decent 2% in eight of the past nine quarters. And inflation has dropped from a 9.1% peak in June 2022 to 2.6% last month. Even so, Americans were deeply frustrated by still-high prices under the Biden-Harris administration, and partly for that reason chose last month to return Donald Trump to the White House.",
      "As the job market has slowed this year, employers have added an average of 170,000 jobs a month. That is a solid figure, though down significantly from an average of 251,000 last year, 377,000 in 2022 and a record 604,000 in 2021, when the economy was roaring out of the COVID recession.",
      "Diane Swonk, chief economist at the tax and consulting firm KPMG, cautions that the job market \u201ccould be weaker than it appears.\u2019\u2019 So far this year, the Labor Department has revised down its initial estimate of job growth for each of seven months, Oxford\u2019s Vanden Houten noted.",
      "And while comparatively few Americans are losing jobs, those who do are finding it harder to land a new one: The average unemployed American in October had been out of work for 22.9 weeks, the longest such stretch in 2 1/2 years.",
      "The progress against inflation and the slowdown in hiring, which eases pressure on companies to raise wages and prices, led the Fed to cut its key rate in September and again last month. Another rate cut is expected to be announced when the Fed meets Dec. 17-18.",
      "Forecasters have estimated that average hourly wages rose 3.9% last month from a year earlier. Vanden Houten said she thinks year-over-year wage gains of 3.5% to 4% are consistent with the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation target."

      "Creighton has played eight No. 1 teams in its program\u2019s history, and the first six of those games weren\u2019t close",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Creighton has played eight No. 1 teams in its basketball history, and the first six of those games weren't close. All were losses.",
      "The last two? Bluejays blowouts at the CHI Health Center.",
      "Creighton took down top-ranked Kansas 76-63 on Wednesday night in a game the unranked Bluejays never trailed and led by 17 points.",
      "Ten months ago, they knocked off a No. 1 Connecticut 85-66. That was UConn's last loss before winning 13 in a row the way to its second straight national championship.",
      "Five of the Creighton players on the court against the Jayhawks also played against the Huskies, including 7-foot-1 center Ryan Kalkbrenner. The Big East preseason player of the year came back from injury to score 17 points and outperform Kansas big man Hunter Dickinson. Kalkbrenner had 15 points against UConn last February.",
      "\u201cBoth feel great, obviously,\" Kalkbrenner said. \"Both those teams, UConn and Kansas, are elite, high-level programs. We were able to execute the game plan in both games and played at a high level. You feel good about those wins.\u201d",
      "A raucous crowd was involved from the opening tip against KU, the noise level increasing every time Pop Isaacs swished one of his six 3-pointers and Kalkbrenner flushed lob passes for dunks. At the final buzzer, students poured out of the end zone seats onto the court as flames shot out of the goal standards.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t quite had a moment like that in college,\u201d Isaacs said. \u201cI haven't played against the No. 1 team in the country. I've played against No. 2 and No. 3. It was hyped. The students showed up and it was electric out there. That wasn't the first court storming I've been in. It was the biggest one.\"",
      "Isaacs was well familiar with the way Kansas plays defense from the two seasons he played at Texas Tech, and he said that was an advantage. He scored a season-high 27 points.",
      "\u201cI saw the ball go through the basket,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst shot went in. It felt good coming off my hands. I felt I had some really good looks tonight. Like Coach says, I'm a really good shooter when I take the right shots, and I took the right shots tonight for the most part.\u201d",
      "Isaacs and point guard Steven Ashworth missed practice time with illness this week, Ashworth was still dealing with soreness from an ankle sprain two weeks ago, and Kalkbrenner had missed the Bluejays' win against Notre Dame on Saturday with a lower-body injury.",
      "Asked if he thought his team would be up to the task against the Jayhawks, coach Greg McDermott mentioned that he had called his 90-year-old father before the game for some words of wisdom.",
      "\u201cHe said pack your bags and go home,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cHe wasn't very confident having watched us play and having watched Kansas play.\"",
      "McDermott indicated that beating Kansas meant a little more to him than beating UConn even though the Huskies are a Big East opponent. McDermott grew up in Iowa paying attention to the Jayhawks, and he coached four seasons at Iowa State and never could beat Bill Self and the Jayhawks. In fact, he was 0-10 against KU before Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI've been watching Kansas basketball forever,\" McDermott said. \"Back to coach Williams and then coach Self, they're one of the best. We had some close calls at Hilton when I was at Iowa State where we walked out of Hilton (Coliseum) disappointed we couldn't get the job done against a good Kansas team. To finally beat them when they had a great team and they're ranked No. 1 in the country, it's great for our guys and great for our fans.\u201d",

      "The Chicago Blackhawks have fired coach Luke Richardson, signaling their frustration with the state of the franchise\u2019s rebuilding project",
      "CHICAGO -- The Chicago Blackhawks fired coach Luke Richardson on Thursday, signaling their frustration with the state of the franchise's rebuilding project.",
      "Chicago has dropped four in a row to fall to an NHL-worst 8-16-2 on the season. It was outscored 41-27 while going 3-9-1 in its last 13 games.",
      "Anders Sorensen was elevated to interim coach. Sorensen had been coaching the team's top minor league affiliate in Rockford.",
      "\u201cToday I made the difficult decision to move on from Luke as our head coach,\u201d general manager Kyle Davidson said in a statement. \u201cWe thank him for his efforts and contributions to the organization and our community. As we have begun to take steps forward in our rebuilding process, we felt that the results did not match our expectations for a higher level of execution this season and ultimately came to the decision that a change was necessary.\u201d",
      "Chicago had expected to be more competitive in Richardson's third season. It signed Tyler Bertuzzi, Teuvo Teravainen, Alec Martinez and Craig Smith on a busy first day of free agency this summer. It also had Connor Bedard coming back for his second season after winning the Calder Memorial Trophy as NHL rookie of the year.",
      "But Bertuzzi and Teravainen have struggled, and Martinez has been hampered by injuries. Bertuzzi has five goals and five assists in 26 games going into Saturday's matchup with Winnipeg. Teravainen has three goals and two assists in his last 21 games.",
      "Of course, the most important player for Chicago is the 19-year-old Bedard \u2014 and it's his lack of production that likely led to Richardson's dismissal.",
      "While the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 draft has shown some positive developmental signs, the young center has struggled offensively. Bedard stopped a 12-game drought when he scored in a 6-2 victory against Dallas on Nov. 27. He has five goals and 14 assists in 26 games after he had 11 goals and 10 assists at the same point last season.",
      "\u201cWe're not happy with the record, for sure,\u201d Richardson said after his last game, a 4-2 loss to Boston on Wednesday night. \"The guys are trying to work within the system and the right way and unfortunately, like I said before, we don't seem to have one kind of Achilles' heel. There's not one problem with our team.",
      "\u201cIt's like one night there's one area \u2014 maybe our defense or our forward or one player \u2014 and the next night it's another area, like a different player.\u201d",
      "While Chicago has been plagued by a variety of problems, it's clear that offense is its biggest issue. It is averaging 2.42 goals per game, ranked No. 31 in the NHL ahead of only Nashville going into Thursday night's games. The Blackhawks finished with a league-low 178 goals last season.",
      "Richardson, 55, had a 57-118-15 record in Chicago. The former NHL defenseman was an assistant on Montreal\u2019s coaching staff when he was hired by the Blackhawks in June 2022. When Dominique Ducharme was diagnosed with COVID-19 during the 2021 playoffs, Richardson took over as coach for six games and helped lead the Canadiens to their first Stanley Cup Final since 1993.",
      "The move comes with Chicago set to host the Winter Classic on Dec. 31 against the St. Louis Blues at Wrigley Field. Shortly before the coaching change was announced, the NHL released a rendering of what the rink will look like at the home of baseball's Chicago Cubs.",
      "Sorensen, 49, is a familiar face for many of the Blackhawks. He was originally hired by the organization as a development coach ahead of the 2013-14 season. He has a 117-89-16-7 record in 229 career AHL games as a head coach, all with Rockford.",

    "story": [
      "The NBA is returning to China next season",
      "The NBA is returning to China next season, striking a deal to play preseason games there more than five years after the league was effectively banned over Commissioner Adam Silver not punishing Daryl Morey for tweeting support of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong.",
      "The Brooklyn Nets and the Phoenix Suns will play in China\u2019s gambling hub of Macao on Oct. 10, 2025, and again two days later, the NBA announced on Friday. A person with knowledge of the matter told The Associated Press that there are plans for two more preseason games in China in 2026.",
      "The Nets and Suns will play at Macao\u2019s Venetian Arena, which is owned by the Las Vegas Sands Corp. \u2014 which is a casino operator there as well. Sands president and chief operating officer Patrick Dumont became governor of the Dallas Mavericks late last year after his family acquired the team.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re incredibly excited to be partnering with Sands to bring NBA games back to Macao beginning next year,\" NBA deputy commissioner Mark Tatum said in Macao, adding that the agreement is \"a significant milestone in the continued global growth of basketball.\u201d",
      "The Nets are owned by Joe Tsai, the chairman of Chinese tech giant Alibaba.",
      "To essentially kick off the return of NBA games to China, there will be a celebrity game in Macao on Saturday. Basketball Hall of Famers Tony Parker, Ray Allen and Tracy McGrady, along with former NBA standouts Stephon Marbury, DeMarcus Cousins and Cuttino Mobley are the headline attractions. All took part in Friday's event to announce the Suns-Nets games.",
      "Friday's announcement caps a long series of moves toward some sort of return to normalcy between China and the league. The NBA, on some level, has been welcomed back for a while: Miami's Jimmy Butler, who has an endorsement deal with Chinese apparel company Li-Ning, has toured the country and drawn large crowds in each of the last two offseasons, while Golden State's Stephen Curry and Sacramento's De\u2019Aaron Fox drew enormous crowds when they visited in September.",
      "Then in October, Silver said he thought the league would \u201cbring games back to China at some point.\u201d",
      "\u201cNBA basketball is a global sport that attracts people of different ages, backgrounds and cultures. It creates exciting experiences that connect people while playing a positive role in communities,\u201d Dumont said. \u201cSands is honored to bring The NBA China Games to Macao so that the most elite level of basketball can be experienced directly by the fans who are so passionate about it.\u201d",
      "The geopolitical rift between China and the league started in October 2019 when Morey, then the general manager of the Houston Rockets and now GM of the Philadelphia 76ers, tweeted support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. The tweet was deleted quickly, but the fallout lasted years and Beijing was clearly displeased by Silver supporting Morey\u2019s right to speak out on the issue.",
      "\u201cIf that\u2019s the consequences of us adhering to our values, we still feel it\u2019s critically important we adhere to those values,\u201d Silver said at the time.",
      "The timing of the tweet was particularly awkward, given that the Nets and Los Angeles Lakers were in China at the time for two games. The games were played \u2014 largely in silence with fans in attendance, many taping over the NBA logos on the jerseys they wore \u2014 and even without customary pregame and postgame news conferences.",
      "The NBA was criticized by both Republican and Democratic lawmakers in the U.S. for playing and for not saying more about China\u2019s human rights record.",
      "In large part because Silver did not sanction Morey to China\u2019s liking, no NBA games were shown on CCTV, China\u2019s state broadcaster, for one year after that tweet. The end of the 2020 NBA Finals was shown on CCTV, which began showing games in earnest again in 2022. NBA games were available to Chinese fans on the streaming service Tencent, another of the league\u2019s broadcast partners.",
      "The league said the rift cost up to $400 million in lost revenue in the year that followed, and that figure surely continued rising. But there were steps toward a reconciliation along the way; NBA legend and Yao Ming went to the U.S. for the memorial service for commissioner emeritus David Stern in January 2020, a move viewed at the time as a mutual sign that the league and China wanted to mend fences. That was followed by China publicly thanking the NBA in February 2020 \u2014 when what became the COVID-19 pandemic was in its earliest days \u2014 for sending more than $1 million in medical supplies to assist coronavirus relief efforts there.",
      "The league has played a preseason game in Macao once before, with Orlando beating Cleveland there in 2007. The Magic, on that same trip, also played a Chinese all-star team in Macao. And in 2008, USA Basketball played exhibitions in Macao before the Beijing Olympics.",
      "\u201cThe game of basketball around here, the fans respect the game so much,\u201d then-Cavaliers star LeBron James said after playing in Macao in 2007. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see that.\u201d",
      "Macao \u2014 a former Portuguese colony that was returned to Chinese rule in 1999 \u2014 is the only place in China where casino gambling is legal. Beijing has called for the city to diversify its gambling-reliant economy, with hopes that it can grow tourism and be a bridge for trade between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.",

      "Aaron Rodgers figures his football resume speaks for itself.",
      "So the New York Jets' quarterback doesn't feel the need to use the final stretch of this season to prove his value to the team and that he should be back next season. In fact, it's a notion the four-time NFL MVP finds \u201cridiculous.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf they want me to stay, fantastic,\u201d Rodgers said Wednesday. \"If it takes these five games, maybe they don\u2019t know what I bring to the table.",
      "\u201cBut that being said I\u2019d love to play really friggin' well the last five games.\u201d",
      "Rodgers, who turned 41 on Monday, has struggled with his production and health while the Jets have limped to a 3-9 start.",
      "He has dealt with leg injuries \u2014 a sprained ankle, a sore knee and a tweaked hamstring \u2014 for much of the season. But he came out of the bye-week break feeling the healthiest he had in weeks. Still, he was inconsistent in a 26-21 loss to Seattle and couldn't lead New York on a winning drive on its final possession.",
      "That had some speculating that the Jets could bench Rodgers in favor of Tyrod Taylor to perhaps spark the offense. Instead, interim coach Jeff Ulbrich said he was sticking with Rodgers as the starter as long as he's healthy, and the quarterback said during his weekly appearance on \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show\u201d on Tuesday his goal is to finish the season on the field \u2014 despite the team's woeful record.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what you do when you\u2019re a professional and the most important ability you can have is availability, which I wasn\u2019t available last year,\u201d Rodgers said Wednesday, referring to going down with a torn Achilles tendon four snaps into his Jets debut. \u201cSo I\u2019d love to play the games and I love playing football. I\u2019m hyper-competitive and I love to be out there with the guys.\u201d",
      "He refused to use the injuries as an excuse for his subpar performance this season, saying he feels good enough to play if he's on the field. While Rodgers has thrown for 2,627 yards and 19 touchdowns with eight interceptions, his 6.3 yards-per-pass attempt is the lowest of his career as a starter.",
      "Rodgers said a few weeks ago that he thought he'd like to play next year, but recently amended that to say he wasn't sure. He said health would be a major factor \u2014 and if he did decide to play in 2025, the Jets would be his first choice.",
      "There's doubt as to whether the Jets will want him back as they rebuild with a new general manager and coach next season after the firings of Joe Douglas and Robert Saleh. Rodgers said some people have told him they hope he'll return, but \u201cnot the people who are making those decisions.\u201d",
      "That drew some laughs, but Rodgers said there will certainly be conversations \u2014 eventually \u2014 to determine his next move.",
      "\u201cI just redid my house here in Jersey,\u201d Rodgers said. \"My goal was to play a few more years here, but we\u2019ll see. I\u2019d like to be healthy, I\u2019d like to end on my feet and then I\u2019d like to play well and I\u2019d like to feel like I\u2019m wanted back. If not, again, I will not be offended. I won\u2019t be upset. I\u2019ll be so thankful, either way whatever happens here.",
      "\u201cBut I've got to be healthy mentally, physically, and then there\u2019s got to be interest on both sides. And if that\u2019s not the case, then I\u2019ll look at other options. But first, I\u2019ll think about whether I\u2019d actually want to play or not, but it usually takes a good month to get away from it, which I\u2019ll do the first month and then we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d",
      "During his appearance on \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show,\u201d Rodgers highlighted the Detroit Lions \u2014 who were 3-13-1 in Dan Campbell's first year as coach in 2021 and are now tied with Kansas City for the best record in the NFL at 11-1 \u2014 as a team that benefited from patient and supportive ownership.",
      "After practice Wednesday, Rodgers was asked about those comments and whether he thinks the Jets have been similarly supportive.",
      "\"Is that a rhetorical question?\u201d he responded before explaining he was just citing an example. He added that he also saw support and a lack thereof at times during his 18 years in Green Bay.",
      "When asked if he felt there was support from Jets ownership, Rodgers said: \u201cI\u2019d have to look. I don\u2019t follow a lot of stuff. I\u2019d have to ask you guys: Has there been a lot of public, supportive comments?\u201d",
      "A reporter responded by pointing out the Jets' coach and GM firings.",
      "\u201cYeah,\" Rodgers said, \"so there's your answer.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Texas officials say their investigation into the bottle-throwing incident that disrupted the Texas-Georgia game in October could not identify anyone responsible and that no one has been caught or punished",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- The University of Texas investigation into the bottle-throwing incident that disrupted the Texas-Georgia game in October \u2014 and drew a harsh rebuke and fine from the Southeastern Conference \u2014 resulted in no one being caught or punished.",
      "In a report to the league sent last month, Texas officials said a video review did not identify any of the culprits.",
      "Texas and Georgia meet again Saturday in the SEC championship game in Atlanta. Their first meeting in Austin, a 30-15 Georgia win, produced one of the most chaotic and controversial scenes of the college football season. Longhorns fans upset about a pass interference penalty pelted the field with debris and briefly stopped the game, giving the officials time to huddle and reverse the call.",
      "The incident drew a $250,000 fine from the SEC, which also threatened to ban alcohol sales at future games. The SEC ordered the school to find those responsible and ban them from all athletic events the rest of the school year.",
      "In a Nov. 7 report to SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey, Texas athletic director Chris Del Conte said the school \u201creviewed all available video and other sources of information\u201d to try to find the disruptive fans.",
      "\u201cDespite our best effort, we have not been able to identify the individuals at issue. We will take action if new identifying information comes to light,\u201d Del Conte wrote.",
      "The school's report was provided to The Associated Press this week. A university spokesman said he was unaware of any new information or punishments since it was sent to the SEC.",
      "Del Conte declined further comment Thursday.",
      "Del Conte told the SEC that Texas has added additional security cameras and personnel to watch the student section, updated its sportsmanship and fan code of conduct policies, and created digital messaging to encourage good behavior.",
      "\u201cRespect, sportsmanship and fairness are values that drive us,\" Del Conte wrote. \u201cWe expect fans to uphold these standards as well.\u201d",
      "Sankey declined comment on the investigation report and his conversations with Texas officials. But he praised Del Conte, school President Jay Hartzell and Board of Regents Chairman Kevin Eltife \u201cfor being very clear immediately that that conduct failed to meet their own expectations.\u201d",
      "Then-No. 1 Texas trailed No. 5 Georgia 23-7 when a pass interference call negated a Longhorns interception. Angry fans in or near the student section lobbed bottles and debris on the field and the game was halted for several minutes.",
      "Texas coach Steve Sarkisian, who at first was angry about the penalty, crossed the field to plead with the fans to stop throwing things while stadium crews cleaned up the mess.",
      "The break gave the game officials time to reconsider and reverse the penalty, a decision that infuriated Georgia coach Kirby Smart. Texas then cut the Georgia lead to 23-15, before the Bulldogs later put together the game-clinching drive.",
      "\u201cI will say that now we\u2019ve set a precedent that if you throw a bunch of stuff on the field and endanger athletes that you\u2019ve got a chance to get your call reversed,\u201d Smart said after the game \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate because to me that\u2019s dangerous.\"",
      "Texas officials were embarrassed and the SEC was angry.",
      "The league issued a statement that reversing the penalty was the correct decision, but condemned the bottle throwing. Critics wondered if similar scenes could happen again in the SEC or elsewhere, sarcastically noting the Texas slogan, \"What starts here changes the world.\u201d",
      "The SEC ordered Texas to investigate using \"all available resources, including security, stadium and television video, to identify individuals who threw objects onto the playing field or at the opposing team.\u201d It told the school to report its findings to the league.",
      "Hartzell warned students the probe was coming. He said the incident had \u201cembarrassed Longhorn Nation,\" and agreed with the SEC's demands to find those responsible.",
      "\u201cThose involved will have ramifications for their actions,\u201d Del Conte wrote in an Oct. 22 message to students.",
      "The Texas football stadium has long had an emergency operations room where staff monitor live feeds from security cameras. In 2009, Texas invited the AP into the room where a reporter observed staff watching feeds from 43 cameras. They could see if fans were drinking alcohol (which was prohibited at the time) or disruptive, or take note of unattended bags.",
      "Fifteen years later, the report to the SEC said Texas could not identify anyone responsible for throwing debris.",
      "The 10-page report includes a review of stadium policies and the administration's statements to students. It includes only a single paragraph about the investigation efforts, which were led by Derek Trabon, director of the campus Office of Emergency Management. The probe included help from game operations staff and campus police.",
      "The report offers no investigation details, such as how much video was reviewed, whether cameras actually caught fans throwing things, or if the school considered using facial recognition technology. The brief mention of the investigation does not explain why it was inconclusive.",
      "Sankey said Thursday that the SEC will have offseason talks with schools about fan behavior, from bottle throwing to multiple instances of fans rushing the field.",
      "\u201cOne of the learning experiences we\u2019ve had, and this isn\u2019t the only bottle throwing experience, we don\u2019t always have cameras where there needs to be cameras,\" Sankey said. \"We will work to see how our stadiums may adjust.\u201d",

      "Scottie Scheffler has a new putting grip, and it helped him shoot a 5-under 67 in the first round of the Hero World Challenge",
      "NASSAU, Bahamas -- Scottie Scheffler brought a new putting grip to the Hero World Challenge and felt enough improvement to be satisfied with the result, a 5-under 67 that left him three shots behind Cameron Young on Thursday.",
      "Young was playing for the first time since the BMW Championship more than three months ago and found great success on and around the greens of Albany Golf Club, chipping beautifully and holing four birdie putts from 15 feet or longer for his 64.",
      "He led by two shots over Justin Thomas in his first competition since his daughter was born a few weeks ago. Thomas ran off four straight birdies late in his round and was a fraction of an inch away with a fifth.",
      "The big surprise was Scheffler, the No. 1 player in golf who looked as good as he has all year in compiling eight victories, including an Olympic gold medal. His iron play has no equal. His putting at times has kept him from winning more or winning bigger. He decided to try to a \u201csaw\u201d putting grip from about 20 feet or closer \u2014 the putter rests between his right thumb and his fingers, with his left index finger pointed down the shaft.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always looking for ways to improve,\u201d Scheffler said.",
      "Scheffler last year began working with renowned putting instructor Phil Kenyon, and he says Kenyon mentioned the alternative putting grip back then.",
      "\u201cBut it was really our first time working together and it\u2019s something that\u2019s different than what I\u2019ve done in the past,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cThis year I had thought about it from time to time, and it was something that we had just said let\u2019s table that for the end of the season, take a look at it.",
      "\u201cFigured this is a good week to try stuff.\u201d",
      "He opened with a wedge to 2 feet and he missed a 7-foot birdie putt on the par-5 third. But he holed a birdie from about the same distance at the next par 5, No. 6, and holed a sliding 6-footer on the ninth to save par.",
      "His longest putt was his last hole, from 12 feet for a closing birdie.",
      "\u201cI really enjoyed the way it felt,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like I\u2019m seeing some improvements in my stroke.\u201d",
      "Young, regarded as the best active player without a PGA Tour victory, is treating this holiday tournament as the start of a new season. He worked on getting stronger and got back to the basics in his powerful golf swing.",
      "And on this day, he was dialed in with his short game. He only struggled to save par twice and kept piling up birdies in his bogey-free round on an ideal day in the Bahamas.",
      "\u201cThe wind wasn\u2019t blowing much so it was relatively stress-free,\u201d Young said.",
      "Patrick Cantlay, along with Scheffler playing for the first time since the Presidents Cup, also was at 67 with Ludvig Aberg, Akshay Bhatia and Sahith Theegala.",
      "Thomas also took this occasion to do a little experimenting against a 20-man field. He has using a 46-inch driver at home \u2014 a little more than an inch longer than his regular driver \u2014 in a bid to gain more speed. On a day with little wind, on a golf course with some room off the tee, he decided to put it in play.",
      "\u201cJust with it being a little bit longer, I just kind of have to get the club out in front of me and get on top of it a little bit more,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI drove the hell out of it on the back, so that was nice to try something different and have it go a little bit better on the back.\u201d",
      "Thomas said the longer driver gives him 2 or 3 mph in ball speed and 10 extra yards in the air.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very specific for courses, but gave it a try,\u201d he said.",
      "Conditions were easy enough that only four players in field failed to break par, with Jason Day bringing up the rear with a 75.",

      "This was Spurs' sixth defeat of the campaign. They now have as many wins as losses, highlighting the inconsistency blighting their season, and their seven away results so far make remarkable reading: aside from a 3-0 win at Manchester United and a 4-0 thrashing of Man City, Tottenham has lost four and drawn the other at relegation candidate Leicester.",
      "\u201cWe've got to get out of this space we're in at the moment where we're just not able to get a real grip on our season,\u201d Postecoglou said.",
      "An inability to defend set plays continues to hurt Postecoglou\u2019s team. A week after Roma scored twice from them in a 2-2 draw in the Europa League, Huijsen roamed free in the area at a corner and headed home unmarked.",
      "Postecoglou said in May said he \u201cwasn\u2019t interested\u201d about his side\u2019s fallibility while defending set pieces, and said after losing 1-0 to Arsenal in September \u2014 after a goal from Gabriel at a corner \u2014 that \u201cit\u2019s my burden to carry and I\u2019m happy to do that.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe started well and conceded a really poor goal,\" Postecoglou said after the Bournemouth game. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult place to come when giving the opposition the opportunity to play in the manner they want.\u201d",

      "Bitcoin has topped the $100,000 mark, extending a rally in the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency sparked by the election of Donald Trump",

      "The cryptocurrency officially to rose six figures Wednesday night, just hours after the president-elect said he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to be the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Bitcoin has soared since Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5. The asset climbed from $69,374 on Election Day, hitting as high as $103,713 Wednesday, according to CoinDesk. And the latest all-time high arrives just two years after bitcoin dropped below $17,000 following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.",
      "Bitcoin fell back below the $100,000 by Thursday afternoon, sitting above $99,000 by 4 p.m. ET. Even amid a massive rally that has more than doubled the value of bitcoin this year, some experts continue to warn of investment risks around the asset, which has quite a volatile history.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now. But chances are you\u2019ve heard about it more and more over the last few years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it\u2019s typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like ethereum, XRP, tether and dogecoin have also gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \u201cdigital alternative\u201d to traditional money, but most daily financial transactions are still conducted using fiat currencies such as the dollar. Also, bitcoin can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.",
      "Trump, who was once a crypto skeptic, has pledged to make the U.S. \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "On Thursday morning, hours after bitcoin surpassed the $100,000 mark, Trump congratulated \u201cBITCOINERS\u201d on his social media platform Truth Social. He also appeared to take credit for the recent rally, writing, \u201cYOU\u2019RE WELCOME!!!\u201d",
      "Top crypto players welcomed Trump\u2019s election victory last month, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they\u2019ve long lobbied for \u2014 which, generally speaking, aim for an increased sense of legitimacy without too much red tape. And the industry has made sizeable investments along the way. Back in August, Public Citizen, a left-leaning consumer rights advocacy nonprofit, reported finding that crypto-sector corporations spent more than $119 million in 2024 to back pro-crypto candidates across federal elections.",
      "Trump made his latest pro-crypto move when he announced his plans Wednesday to nominate Atkins to chair the SEC. Atkins was an SEC commissioner during the presidency of George W. Bush. In the years since leaving the agency, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation. He joined the Token Alliance, a cryptocurrency advocacy organization, in 2017.",
      "Under current chair Gary Gensler, who will step down when Trump takes office, the SEC has cracked down on the crypto industry \u2014 penalizing a number of companies for violating securities laws. Gensler has also faced ample criticism from industry players in the process.",
      "One crypto-friendly move the SEC did make under Gensler was the approval in January of spot bitcoin ETFs, or exchange trade funds, which allow investors to have a stake in bitcoin without directly buying it. The spot ETFs were the dominant driver of bitcoin's price before Trump's win \u2014 but, like much of the crypto\u2019s recent momentum, saw record inflows postelection.",
      "Bitcoin surpassing the coveted $100,000 mark has left much of the crypto world buzzing.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing isn\u2019t just a rally \u2014 it\u2019s a fundamental transformation of bitcoin\u2019s place in the financial system,\u201d Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder of crypto custodian Anchorage Digital, said in a statement \u2014 while pointing to the growth of who's entering the market, particularly with rising institutional adoption.",
      "Still, others note that the new heights of bitcoin's price don't necessarily mean the asset is going mainstream. The $100,000 level is \u201cmerely a psychological factor and ultimately just a number,\u201d Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at British investment company AJ Bell, wrote in a Thursday commentary.",
      "That being said, bitcoin could keep climbing to more and more all-time highs, particularly if Trump makes good on his promises for more crypto-friendly regulation once in office. If Trump actually makes a bitcoin reserve, for example, supply changes could also propel the price forward.",
      "\u201cIt is hard to overstate the magnitude of the change in Washington\u2019s attitude towards crypto post-election,\u201d Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, said via email Thursday, reiterating that prices could keep rising if trends persist. \u201cThere is a lot more demand than there is supply, and that\u2019s usually a pretty good recipe for success.\u201d",
      "Still, as with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is never promised. Worldwide regulatory uncertainties and environmental concerns around bitcoin \u201cmining\" \u2014 the creation of new bitcoin, which consumes a lot of energy \u2014 are among factors that analysts like Coatsworth note could hamper future growth. And, as still a relatively young asset with a history of volatility, longer-term adoption has yet to be seen through.",
      "Today\u2019s excitement around bitcoin may make many who aren\u2019t already in the space want to get in on the action. For those in a position to invest, Hougan says it's not too late \u2014 noting that bitcoin is still early in its development and most institutional investors \u201cstill have zero exposure.\u201d",
      "At the same time, Hougan and others maintain that it's important to tread cautiously and not bite off more than you can chew. Experts continue to stress caution around getting carried away with crypto \u201cFOMO,\u201d or the fear of missing out, especially for small-pocketed investors.",
      "\u201cA lot of people have got rich from the cryptocurrency soaring in value this year, but this high-risk asset isn\u2019t suitable for everyone,\u201d Coatsworth noted Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s volatile, unpredictable and is driven by speculation, none of which makes for a sleep-at-night investment.\u201d",
      "In short, history shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you\u2019ve made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.",
      "Coatsworth points to recent research from the Bank for International Settlements, a Switzerland-based global organization of central banks, which found that about three-quarters of retail buyers on crypto exchange apps likely lost money on their bitcoin investments between 2015 and 2022.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, during high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. And the late-2022 collapse of FTX significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall, with bitcoin falling below $17,000.",
      "Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs, and again, now the post-election frenzy. But lighter regulation from the coming Trump administration could also mean less guardrails.",

      "As part of the road map unfurled Thursday, Waymo plans to begin testing its driverless Jaguars in Miami next year, giving the robotaxis time to learn their way around Florida's biggest city before they start charging for rides in 2026. The move comes less than a month after Waymo opened up its robotaxi service to anyone looking for a ride in an 80-square-mile (129-square-kilometer) expanse in Los Angeles, extending its reach beyond its two major markets in Phoenix and San Francisco.",
      "Waymo also has plans to launch fleets in Atlanta and Austin next year as part of a partnership with the ride-hailing leader Uber.",
      "The growth spurred Waymo to team up with fleet management service Moove to oversee maintenance of its robotaxis in Phoenix, where it now operates about 200 vehicles. Moove also will help manage the company's robotaxis in Miami.",
      "The steady expansion into new markets is starting to fulfill what once seemed like a fantastical dream when Google began a secret self-driving car project dubbed \"Chauffeur\u201d in 2009 that ultimately spun off as Waymo in 2016.",
      "Although Waymo is still piling up substantial losses under its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., the service now provides more than 150,000 weekly trips without any history of catastrophic traffic accidents. That track record has increased confidence that Waymo will be able to continue to steer its robotaxis into more markets and eventually produce a steady stream of profits \u2014 an expectation that helped it recently raise $5.6 billion from Alphabet and a list of other major investors.",
      "Meanwhile, robotaxi rival Cruise is still trying to recover from a grisly accident last year that culminated in one of its driverless cars in San Francisco dragging a jaywalking pedestrian who had been struck by a different car driven by a human. California regulators suspended Cruise's license in the aftermath and its once-ambitious expansion plans have been scaled back by its corporate parent, automaker General Motors.",

      "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos says he is \u201coptimistic\u201d about President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second term and expressed some excitement about potential regulatory cutbacks in the coming years",
      "NEW YORK -- Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said Wednesday he is \u201coptimistic\u201d about President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second term and expressed some excitement about potential regulatory cutbacks in the coming years.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m actually very optimistic this time around,\u201d Bezos said on stage during a wide-ranging interview at The New York Times\u2019 DealBook Summit in New York. \u201cHe seems to have a lot of energy around reducing regulation. If I can help do that, I\u2019m going to help him.\"",
      "\u201cWe do have too many regulations in this country,\u201d Bezos added.",
      "The comments follow Bezos' October decision to prohibit The Washington Post, which he owns, from endorsing a presidential candidate, a move that led to tens of thousands of people canceling their subscriptions and protests from journalists with a deep history at the newspaper.",
      "At the time, Bezos wrote in an op-ed in the newspaper saying editorial endorsements create a perception of bias at a time when many Americans don\u2019t believe the media, and do nothing to tip the scales of an election.",
      "On Wednesday, he said he would try to talk Trump \"out of the idea\u201d that the press is the enemy.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve probably grown in the last eight years,\u201d he said to journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin. \u201cHe has, too. This is not the case. The press is not the enemy.\u201d",
      "Trump had railed against Bezos and his companies, including Amazon and The Washington Post, during his first term. In 2019, Amazon argued in a court case that Trump\u2019s bias against the company harmed its chances of winning a $10 billion Pentagon contract. The Biden administration later pursued a contract with both Amazon and Microsoft.",
      "In another part of the interview, Bezos said he doesn't expect Elon Musk, who has been tasked with cutting regulations in the upcoming Trump term, to use his power to hurt his business competitors. Bezos owns Blue Origin, a rival to Musk's SpaceX."

      "BANGKOK -- China has banned exports of key materials used to make a wide range of products, including smartphones, electric vehicles, radar systems and CT scanners, swiping back at Washington after it expanded export controls to include dozens of Chinese companies that make equipment used to produce advanced computer chips.",
      "Both sides say their controls are justified by national security concerns and both accuse the other of \u201cweaponizing\u201d trade. Analysts say the latest restrictions could have a wide impact on manufacturing in many industries and supply chains.",
      "\u201cCritical mineral security is now intrinsically linked to the escalating tech trade war,\u201d Gracelin Baskaran and Meredith Schwartz of the Center for Strategic International Studies, wrote in a report on Beijing's decision.",
      "The full impact will depend partly on whether U.S. industries can compensate for any loss of access to the strategically important materials, equipment and components.",
      "Here\u2019s why this could be a tipping point in trade conflict between the two biggest economies, coming at a time when antagonisms already were expected to heat up once President-elect Donald Trump takes office, given his vows to hike tariffs on imports of Chinese-made products.",
      "China has banned, in principle, exports to the United States of gallium, germanium and antimony \u2014 critical minerals needed to make advanced semiconductors, among many other types of equipment. Beijing also tightened controls on exports of graphite, which is used in EV and grid-storage batteries. China is the largest source for most of these materials and also dominates refining of those materials, which are used both for consumer goods and for military purposes.",
      "The limits announced Tuesday also include exports of super-hard materials, such as diamonds and other synthetic materials that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective coatings.",
      "Next on the list of potential bans, experts say: tungsten, magnesium and aluminum alloys.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced its measures after the U.S. government ordered a slew of new measures meant to prevent sales to China of certain types of advanced semiconductors and the tools and software needed to make them. Washington also expanded its \u201centity list\u201d of companies facing strict export controls to include 140 more companies, nearly all of them based in China or Chinese-owned.",
      "Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the revised rules were intended to impair China\u2019s ability to use advanced technologies that \u201cpose a risk to our national security.\u201d The updated regulations also limit exports to China of high-bandwidth memory chips that are needed to process massive amounts of data in advanced applications such as artificial intelligence.",
      "Export licenses will likely be denied for any U.S. company trying to do business with the 140 companies newly added to the \u201centity list,\u201d as well as the dozens of others already on the list. The aim, officials said, is to stop Chinese companies from leveraging U.S. technology to make their own semiconductors.",
      "The Biden administration has been expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls while encouraging an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of semiconductors in the U.S. and other Western countries.",
      "Washington also extended the restrictions on exports of advanced semiconductor technology to companies in other countries, though it excluded companies in key allies like Japan, South Korea and the Netherlands that are thought to have adequate export controls of their own.",
      "In a word: very. For the U.S., Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and other producers of advanced technology and components, access to materials with such properties as high conductivity is crucial: gallium and germanium increasingly are used in advanced semiconductors in place of silicon.",
      "The materials subject to Chinese export controls are among 50 the United States Geologic Survey has designated as \u201ccritical minerals\u201d \u2014 non-fuel minerals essential to U.S. economic or national security that have supply chains vulnerable to disruption.",
      "Gallium topped that list. It is needed to make the same high-bandwidth memory chips the U.S. wants to avoid allowing China to access for use in artificial intelligence and defense applications. It's used to make LEDs, lasers and magnets used in many products. Germanium is used for optical fiber and solar panels, among other uses.",
      "A USGS study recently estimated the likely total cost to the U.S. economy from disruptions to supplies of gallium and germanium alone at more than $3 billion. But the situation is complicated. China imposed licensing requirements on exports of both metals in July 2023. It has not exported either to the U.S. this year, according to Chinese customs data. Antimony exports also have plunged.",
      "China produces the lion's share of most critical minerals, but there are alternatives. Japan also imports nearly all of its gallium, for example, but it also extracts it by recycling scrap metal.",
      "Washington has been moving to tap sources other than China, forming a \"Minerals Security Partnership\" with the EU and 15 other countries. President Joe Biden's visit to Africa this week highlighted that effort. Potential supply disruptions also have spurred efforts to tap U.S. deposits of rare earths and other critical materials in southeastern Wyoming, Montana, Nevada, Minnesota and parts of the American Southwest.",
      "Germanium has been extracted from zinc mined in Alaska and Tennessee and the U.S. government has a stockpile. The Department of Defense has a recycling program that can extract scrap germanium from night vision lenses and tank turret windows.",
      "But China's dominance as a supplier gives it an overwhelming cost advantage, and U.S. resource companies face strong pressures over the potential environmental impact of mines and refineries.",
      "Since then-President Trump launched a trade war against Beijing that has ramped up over time, China has adopted a relatively constrained and cautious approach in responding to the U.S. limits on access to advanced technology.",
      "Much depends on the future course of overall relations. It is unclear if Trump will follow through on his vows to push tariffs sharply higher once he takes office or if such declarations are the opening gambits in future trade negotiations.",
      "China hit back with its own tariff hikes, but excluded many items crucial for its own economy. It sanctioned certain companies, especially defense contractors doing business with Taiwan, but refrained from outright bans on exports of vital materials to the U.S.",
      "This time may be different.",
      "Just after China's Commerce Ministry announced its export ban, various Chinese industry associations including automakers and the China Semiconductor Association issued statements denouncing Washington's moves to curb access to strategically sensitive technologies and declaring that U.S. computer chips are unreliable.",
      "Beijing's announcement also extends its ban on exporting Chinese-produced gallium and other critical minerals to the U.S. to apply to all countries, entities and individuals, saying violators will \u201cbe held accountable according to law.\u201d",

      "Iran conducted the launch using its Simorgh program, a satellite-carrying rocket that had had a series of failed launches, at Iran's Imam Khomeini Spaceport in rural Semnan province. That's the site of Iran's civilian space program.",
      "The Simorgh carried what Iran described as an \u201corbital propulsion system,\u201d as well as two research systems to a 400-kilometer (250-mile) orbit above the Earth. A system that could change the orbit of a spacecraft would allow Iran to geo-synchronize the orbits of its satellites. Tehran has long sought that ability.",
      "Iran also put the payload of the Simorgh at 300 kilograms (660 pounds), heavier than its previous successful launches.",
      "There was no immediate independent confirmation the launch was successful. The U.S. military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The announcement comes as heightened tensions grip the wider Middle East over Israel\u2019s continued war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip and as an uneasy ceasefire holds in Lebanon.",
      "The United States has previously said Iran\u2019s satellite launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution and called on Tehran to undertake no activity involving ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. U.N. sanctions related to Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program expired in October 2023.",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s work on space-launch vehicles \u2014 including its Simorgh \u2014 probably would shorten the timeline to produce an intercontinental ballistic missile, if it decided to develop one, because the systems use similar technologies,\u201d a U.S. intelligence community report released in July said.",
      "Under Iran\u2019s relatively moderate former President Hassan Rouhani, the Islamic Republic slowed its space program for fear of raising tensions with the West. The late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who came to power in 2021, pushed the program forward. Raisi died in a helicopter crash in May.",
      "Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, who has been signaling he wants to negotiate with the West over sanctions, has yet to offer strategy when it comes to Iran's ambitions in space. The Simorgh launch represented the first for his administration from the country's civil space program. Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard conducted a successful launch in its parallel program in September.",
      "Intercontinental ballistic missiles can be used to deliver nuclear weapons. Iran is now producing uranium close to weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran has enough enriched uranium for \u201cseveral\u201d nuclear weapons, if it chooses to produce them, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency repeatedly has warned.",
      "Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons and says its space program, like its nuclear activities, is for purely civilian purposes. However, U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Known across the globe as the stuck astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams hit the six-month mark in space Thursday with two more to go.",
      "The pair rocketed into orbit on June 5, the first to ride Boeing\u2019s new Starliner crew capsule on what was supposed to be a weeklong test flight. They arrived at the International Space Station the next day, only after overcoming a cascade of thruster failures and helium leaks. NASA deemed the capsule too risky for a return flight, so it will be February before their long and trying mission comes to a close.",
      "While NASA managers bristle at calling them stuck or stranded, the two retired Navy captains shrug off the description of their plight. They insist they\u2019re fine and accepting of their fate. Wilmore views it as a detour of sorts: \u201cWe\u2019re just on a different path.\u201d",
      "\u201cI like everything about being up here,\u201d Williams told students Wednesday from an elementary school named for her in Needham, Massachusetts, her hometown. \"Just living in space is super fun.\u201d",
      "Both astronauts have lived up there before so they quickly became full-fledged members of the crew, helping with science experiments and chores like fixing a broken toilet, vacuuming the air vents and watering the plants. Williams took over as station commander in September.",
      "\u201cMindset does go a long way,\u201d Wilmore said in response to a question from Nashville first-graders in October. He\u2019s from Mount Juliet, Tennessee. \u201cI don\u2019t look at these situations in life as being downers.\u201d",
      "Boeing flew its Starliner capsule home empty in September, and NASA moved Wilmore and Williams to a SpaceX flight not due back until late February. Two other astronauts were bumped to make room and to keep to a six-month schedule for crew rotations.",
      "Like other station crews, Wilmore and Williams trained for spacewalks and any unexpected situations that might arise.",
      "\u201cWhen the crews go up, they know they could be there for up to a year,\u201d said NASA Associate Administrator Jim Free.",
      "NASA astronaut Frank Rubio found that out the hard way when the Russian Space Agency had to rush up a replacement capsule for him and two cosmonauts in 2023, pushing their six-month mission to just past a year.",
      "Boeing said this week that input from Wilmore and Williams has been \u201cinvaluable\" in the ongoing inquiry of what went wrong. The company said in a statement that it is preparing for Starliner's next flight but declined comment on when it might launch again.",
      "NASA also has high praise for the pair.",
      "\u201cWhether it was luck or whether it was selection, they were great folks to have for this mission,\u201d NASA's chief health and medical officer, Dr. JD Polk, said during an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "On top of everything else, Williams, 59, has had to deal with \u201crumors,\u201d as she calls them, of serious weight loss. She insists her weight is the same as it was on launch day, which Polk confirms.",
      "During Wednesday's student chat, Williams said she didn't have much of an appetite when she first arrived in space. But now she's \u201csuper hungry\u201d and eating three meals a day plus snacks, while logging the required two hours of daily exercise.",
      "Williams, a distance runner, uses the space station treadmill to support races in her home state. She competed in Cape Cod\u2019s 7-mile Falmouth Road Race in August. She ran the 2007 Boston Marathon up there as well.",
      "She has a New England Patriots shirt with her for game days, as well as a Red Sox spring training shirt.",
      "\u201cHopefully I\u2019ll be home before that happens -- but you never know,\u201d she said in November. Husband Michael Williams, a retired federal marshal and former Navy aviator, is caring for their dogs back home in Houston.",
      "As for Wilmore, 61, he's missing his younger daughter's senior year in high school and his older daughter's theater productions in college.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t deny that being unexpectedly separated, especially during the holidays when the entire family gets together, brings increased yearnings to share the time and events together,\u201d his wife, Deanna Wilmore, told the AP in a text this week. Her husband \u201chas it worse than us\u201d since he's confined to the space station and can only connect via video for short periods.",

      "\u201cWe are better today at collecting signals. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re any better at making sense of the signals we collect,\u201d says Fred Burton of Ontic, a provider of threat management software for companies.",
      "After Thompson's shooting, Burton said, \u201cI\u2019ve been on the phone all day with some organizations asking for consultation, saying, \u2019Am I doing enough?\u201d",
      "Some of the biggest U.S. companies, particularly those in the tech sector, spend heavily on personal and residential security for their top executives.",
      "Meta, whose businesses include Facebook and Instagram, reported the highest spending on personal security for top executives last year, filings culled by research firm Equilar show.",
      "Zuckerberg \u201cis synonymous with Meta and, as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,\u201d the Menlo Park, California, company explained earlier this year in an annual shareholder disclosure.",
      "At Apple, the world\u2019s largest tech company by stock valuation, CEO Tim Cook was tormented by a stalker  who sent him sexually provocative emails and even showed up outside his Silicon Valley home at one point before the company\u2019s security team successfully took legal action against her in 2022.",
      "Cook is regularly accompanied by security personnel when he appears in public. Still, the company\u2019s $820,000 allotted last year to protect top executives is a fraction of what other tech giants spent for CEO security.",
      "Just over a quarter of the companies in the Fortune 500 reported spending money to protect their CEOs and other top executives. Of those that did, the median payment for personal security doubled over the last three years to about $98,000.",
      "In many companies, investor meetings like the one UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Thompson was walking to when he was shot are viewed as very risky because details on the location and who will be speaking are highly publicized.",
      "\u201cIt gives people an opportunity to arrive well in advance and take a look at the room, take a look at how people would probably come and go out of a location,\u201d said Dave Komendat, president of DSKomendat Risk Management Services, which is based in the greater Seattle area.",
      "Some firms respond by beefing up security. For example, tech companies routinely require everyone attending a major event, such as Apple\u2019s annual unveiling of the next iPhone or a shareholder meeting, to go through airport-style security checkpoints before entering.",
      "Others forgo in-person meetings with shareholders, including Amazon, which holds its annual shareholder meetings virtually.",
      "\u201cBut there are also company cultures that really frown on that and want their leaders to be accessible to people, accessible to shareholders, employees,\u201d Komendat said.",
      "Depending on the company, such an approach may make sense. Many top executives are little known to the public, operating in industries and locations that make them far less prone to public exposure and to threats.",
      "\u201cDetermining the need for and appropriate level of an executive-level protection program is specific to each organization,\u201d says David Johnston, vice president of asset protection and retail operations at the National Retail Federation. \u201cThese safeguards should also include the constant monitoring of potential threats and the ability to adapt to maintain the appropriate level of security and safety.\u201d",
      "Some organizations have a protective intelligence group that uses digital tools such as machine learning or artificial intelligence to comb through online comments to detect threats not only on social media platforms such as X but also on the dark web, says Komendat. They look for what\u2019s being said about the company, its employees and its leadership to uncover risks.",
      "\u201cThere are always threats directed towards senior leaders at companies. Many of them are not credible,\u201d Komendat said. \u201cThe question always is trying to determine what is a real threat versus what is someone just venting with no intent to take any additional action.\u201d",
      "Burton, a former special agent with the U.S. Diplomatic Security Service, points out that despite the current climate, there is little in the way of organized groups that target companies.",
      "Today, one of the primary worries are loners whose rantings online are fed by others who are like-minded. It\u2019s up to corporate security analysts to zero in on such dialogue and decide whether or not it represents a real threat.",
      "And CEOs aren\u2019t the only targets of disgruntled customers. In the U.S., there were 525 workplace fatalities due to assault in 2022, according to the National Safety Council. Industries including healthcare, education and service providers are more prone to violence than others, and taxi drivers are more than 20 times more likely to be murdered on the job than other workers, the group said.",
      "But the ambush of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Thompson this week is bound to get some CEOs second-guessing.",
      "\u201cWhat invariably happen at moments like this in time is you will get additional ears listening\u201d to security professionals seeking money to beef up executive protection, Burton says.",
      "\u201cBecause I can guarantee you there\u2019s not a CEO in America who\u2019s not aware of this incident.\u201d",

      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- Richard Andre Newman thought he would live the rest of his life in his quiet, leafy neighborhood in suburban Virginia. He was born and raised in Bren Mar Park, where children ride their bikes and neighbors wave hello.",
      "But now, as he\u2019s approaching 60, he\u2019s considering selling his Fairfax County home and moving away. That\u2019s because he\u2019s getting a new neighbor: Plaza 500, a 466,000-square-foot data center and an adjacent electrical substation to be built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds and a community center.",
      "Newman feels helpless to stop it.",

      "The sprawling, windowless warehouses that hold rows of high-speed servers powering almost everything the world does on phones and computers are increasingly becoming fixtures of the American landscape, popping up in towns, cities and suburbs across the United States.",
      "Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and local governments are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies. But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas, abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents are pushing back against the world\u2019s most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.",
      "Tyler Ray, a vocal critic of data centers and leader in the fight against the Virginia project, said the incentives offered are not enough to counteract the consequences of building a facility so close to homes.",
      "\u201cAll that we are asking for is, as the county is trying to bring in this data center income, that they are doing it in a way that doesn\u2019t run residents away from their homes,\u201d he said.",
      "In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling hills of the area\u2019s westernmost counties. Cyclists who ride the popular Washington & Old Dominion trail are at times flanked by data centers, and the thousands of commuters who head into the nation\u2019s capital each day can see them in the distance from the Metro.",
      "Plaza 500, one of the latest proposals in the area, is encroaching on neighborhoods like never before, said Newman, who heads a homeowners association in the community.",
      "The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials promised a significant property tax boost and, in addition to permanent positions in the data center itself, hundreds of temporary construction and electrical jobs to build the facility.",
      "Tyler Ray and his husband moved to the Bren Pointe community in 2022, hoping to balance proximity to Washington with a desire for green space.",
      "But shortly after the couple moved in, Starwood Capital began scoping out a commercial property near their new home as a possible location for the Plaza 500 project.",
      "When Ray and his neighbors learned of the proposal, they held protests, attended regular county meetings and drew media attention to their concerns to try and stop the development. But their efforts were largely unsuccessful: the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project would be grandfathered in under the old rules.",
      "Ray worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by 2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help power the data centers\u2019 hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere.",
      "A spokesman for the firm declined to respond to questions for this story.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how a general resident, even someone who has been engaging intently on an issue,\u201d Ray said, \u201chas any chance to go up against the data center industry.\u201d",
      "For local governments, attracting data centers to their municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in 2024 that Virginia\u2019s existing data centers brought in $1 billion in tax revenue, more than the $750 million in tax breaks given to the tech companies that own them in 2023.",
      "For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of direct jobs \u2014 often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently that its two data centers in Loudoun County, which has about 440,000 residents, created only around 150 direct jobs. But data center advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction, technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730 indirect jobs.",
      "Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax County should reap the benefits.",
      "\u201cI have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the big picture,\u201d Smith said. \u201cData centers are not going away.\u201d",
      "On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the 4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia river.",
      "Last year, AWS, which is owned by Amazon, paid roughly $34 million in property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a $66 million tax break. The company also paid out $10 million total in two, one-time payments to a community development fund and spent another $1.7 million in charitable donations in the community in 2023.",
      "That money has been instrumental in updating infrastructure and bolstering services for the roughly 12,000-person county, going toward a new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer, police body cameras, and $5,000 grants for homebuyers among other things.",
      "Still, some residents are skeptical of the scale of tax break deals. Suspicions started years ago, when three formerly elected officials allegedly helped approve data center deals while owning a stake in a company that contracted with AWS to provide fiber optic cables for the data centers. In June, they each paid $2,000 to settle an ethics complaint against them.",
      "Those officials are no longer in office. But some remain wary of the relationships between the company and local officials, and raised eyebrows at one of the latest data center deals which gives AWS an estimated $1 billion in tax breaks spread over the 15 years to build five new data centers.",
      "Former county commissioner Jim Doherty described a meeting with AWS officials soon after he was elected to office at an upscale restaurant in Boardman, where large windows opened onto the Columbia River.",
      "The AWS representatives asked what Doherty wanted to accomplish as a commissioner. \u201cThey said, \u2018Tell us what your dreams are. Tell us what you need. Tell us what we can do for you,\u2019\u201d Doherty recalled. Other former officials have described similar interactions. Doherty said AWS didn\u2019t ask for anything in return, but the exchange left him uneasy.",
      "\u201cWe engage with stakeholders in every community where we operate around the world, and part of that outreach is to better understand a community\u2019s goals,\u201d said Kevin Miller, AWS' Vice President of global data centers. \u201cThis helps AWS be a catalyst for communities to achieve those goals, and reflects our ongoing commitment to being good neighbors.\u201d",
      "Doherty and another former county commissioner Melissa Lindsay said they pushed unsuccessfully in 2022 for AWS to pay more in taxes in new data center negotiations. They also lobbied to hire outside counsel to negotiate on their behalf, feeling outgunned by the phalanx of AWS-suited lawyers.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to blow it up. We didn\u2019t want to run them off,\" said Lindsay. \u201cBut there were better deals to be made.\u201d",
      "Boardman Mayor Paul Keefer and Police Chief Rick Stokoe say their direct line to AWS allows them to get the most out of the company.",
      "\u201cThis road right here? Wouldn\u2019t happen if it wasn\u2019t for AWS,\u201d said Keefer, riding in the passenger seat of Stokoe\u2019s cruiser, pointing out the window at construction workers shifting dirt and laying pavement. Both Keefer and Stokoe have been in positions to vote on whether to authorize tax breaks for AWS.",
      "\u201cThese companies would not be here if they weren\u2019t getting some kind of incentive,\u201d Stokoe said. \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t be any money to talk about.\u201d",

      "Bitcoin burst on the scene after trust had withered in the financial system and Washington\u2019s ability to protect people from it",
      "NEW YORK -- Born from the ashes of the 2008 global financial crisis, bitcoin arrived after trust had withered in the financial system and in Washington's ability to protect those who must participate in it. Now, it's Washington's very embrace of bitcoin that's helping to send its price to records and lining the pockets of its believers.",
      "Bitcoin briefly surged above $103,000 after President-elect Donald Trump said he intends to nominate Paul Atkins, a former regulator who's seen as friendly to crypto, as the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He would replace Gary Gensler, who critics say has been overly aggressive in his oversight of crypto.",
      "It's the latest leg in an astonishing run for bitcoin, whose swings in price are already notoriously extreme.",
      "Bitcoin has more than doubled this year, with a particularly big jump coming after Election Day, when its price was sitting below $70,000. During his campaign, Trump called for making the United States \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet.\"",
      "The crypto industry, meanwhile, did its part to bring politicians friendly to digital currencies into Washington. Crypto corporations poured over $119 million into influencing federal elections in 2024, primarily into a political action committee dedicated to electing pro-crypto candidates and defeating crypto skeptics, according to a recent review by Public Citizen.",
      "It's a large amount. Crypto companies accounted for 44% of all the corporate money contributed during this year\u2019s elections, according to the consumer advocacy organization.",
      "Such a tight embrace marks an interesting twist from bitcoin's early days, when someone or a group of someones under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto created a kind of electronic cash that wouldn't be beholden to any government or financial institution.",
      "In the white paper announcing bitcoin, Namakoto said the traditional way of doing business on the internet \u201cworks well enough for most transactions.\u201d But, Nakamoto said, it \u201cstill suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model,\u201d where a third party like a bank needs to process payments.",
      "Instead, Nakamoto suggested harnessing computing power around the world as a way to create a digital currency that can\u2019t be double-spent. \u201cWhat is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.\u201d That is what became the bitcoin network.",
      "Since then, bitcoin has moved from the financial fringes toward the mainstream, in jagged fits and starts. While it hasn't taken off as a way to pay for groceries, it found popularity as a kind of \u201cdigital gold,\u201d or a way to store value in something that's not subject to the direct influence of a federal government or a central bank.",
      "In its early days, it had a reputation for use by drug dealers, scammers, crypto enthusiasts, libertarians and others who were looking to move money without oversight by the government. Now, it's also found its way into more investor portfolios. Earlier this year, the SEC approved exchange-traded funds that track the spot price of bitcoin. Such ETFs give investors a relatively easy way to buy bitcoin directly in their existing trading accounts.",
      "Through its life, bitcoin has soared through a series of manic bull runs as well as \u201ccrypto winters\u201d that brought extreme declines. It went from just over $5,000 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to nearly $69,000 by late 2021, before crashing below $17,000 following hikes to interest rates by the Federal Reserve and the 2022 collapse of crypto exchange FTX.",
      "With bitcoin in its latest bull run, the man who's about to roll into the White House seemed to take at least some credit.",
      "\u201cCONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!!\u201d Trump said in a post on his Truth Social network. \u201c$100,000!!! YOU\u2019RE WELCOME!!!\u201d"

      "Smartmatic does not need to give Fox News any information about U.S. federal charges against the voting machine company\u2019s co-founder over alleged bribery in the Philippines",
      "NEW YORK -- Smartmatic won't be required to give Fox News a trove of information about U.S. federal charges against the voting machine company's co-founder over alleged bribery in the Philippines, a judge ruled Thursday.",
      "Fox News and parent Fox Corp. sought the information to help fight Smartmatic's $2.7 billion defamation suit over broadcasts about the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Smartmatic says its business was gutted when Fox aired false claims that the election-tech company helped rig the voting.",
      "Fox says it was simply reporting on newsworthy allegations made by then-President Donald Trump and his allies.",
      "At the same hearing, Judge David B. Cohen also turned down Smartmatic's request to question two Fox Corp. board members. The company has already questioned others.",
      "The Aug. 8 indictment of Smartmatic co-founder Roger Pi\u00f1ate and two other executives concerns a geographically distant matter: Smartmatic's efforts to get work in the Philippines between 2015 and 2018.",
      "But Fox maintains the criminal case is pertinent to Smartmatic's business prospects, and therefore to the election-tech company's claims about what it lost and stands to lose because of Fox's 2020 coverage.",
      "\u201cAs of Aug 8, governments will have to take into account the risks of doing business with a company (where some executives have been) accused of serious corruption by the U.S. Department of Justice,\" Fox lawyer Brad Masters told a New York court Thursday.",
      "He asked the court to order Smartmatic to provide any documents that it has given to the DOJ for the bribery investigation; any customer inquiries about the criminal charges; and any staff communications about the matter and its impact on the company.",
      "The indictment accuses Pi\u00f1ate and two other Smartmatic executives of scheming to pay over $1 million in bribes to a Filipino election official to deploy the company's machines and pay promptly for them. Federal prosecutors say the payments were made through sham loan agreements and via a slush fund created by overcharging for the machines.",
      "Pi\u00f1ate, who has served as Smartmatic\u2019s president, and at least one of the other executives have pleaded not guilty to conspiring to violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and to money laundering. It\u2019s unclear from court records whether the third executive has entered a plea or has an attorney who can comment on the charges.",
      "Boca Raton, Florida-based Smartmatic itself isn\u2019t charged in the criminal case. The company put the executives on leave and sought to reassure voters that elections are \u201cconducted with the utmost integrity and transparency.\u201d",
      "Smartmatic's lawyers contend the indictment is irrelevant to the defamation suit, which is about election-fraud claims that Trump's attorneys made on Fox News programs.",
      "The indictment is \u201cmerely an allegation,\u201d Smartmatic attorney Caitlin Kovacs argued Thursday. She suggested Fox wanted to \u201cplay prosecutor to the jury\u201d and \u201caccuse Smartmatic of a crime that they didn\u2019t commit.\u201d",
      "Cohen denied two similar requests from Fox while the federal investigation was ongoing. He said Thursday that the indictment didn't change his mind.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a mere accusation. It raises no presumption of guilt,\u201d he said.",
      "Smartmatic is suing over shows in which Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell portrayed the company as part of a broad conspiracy to steal the 2020 vote from Trump, a Republican and the winner of this year's election.",
      "Federal and state election officials, exhaustive reviews in battleground states and Trump\u2019s own then-attorney general found no widespread fraud that could have changed the outcome of the 2020 election. Nor did they uncover any credible evidence that the vote was tainted. Dozens of judges, including some whom Trump appointed, rejected his fraud claims.",
      "Fox News ultimately aired an interview with an election technology expert who refuted the allegations against Smartmatic.",
      "As is normal in the run-up to a civil trial, various players connected to both parties have been questioned under oath by the other side's lawyers. These out-of-court sessions are called depositions.",
      "Smartmatic wanted Thursday to get depositions ordered for Fox Corp. board members Chase Carey and Roland Hernandez. The two attended meetings where critical decisions were made, Smartmatic argues.",
      "Fox lawyer Devin Anderson said there's no indication that Carey and Hernandez \u201chave any relevant information\u201d to add. Smartmatic already has questioned other board members, including Executive Chair and CEO Lachlan Murdoch and former House Speaker Paul Ryan, as well as Fox founder Rupert Murdoch, the attorney said.",
      "Depositions generally aren't made public at this stage of a case.",
      "Smartmatic lawyer Erik Connolly said after court that the company was pursuing other information to show \u201cthat Fox Corp. controlled the disinformation spread by Fox News.\u201d",
      "A message seeking comment was sent to Fox. The news network is countersuing Smartmatic, claiming the defamation case violates a New York law against baseless suits aimed at squelching reporting or criticism on public issues.",
      "Smartmatic recently settled defamation suits against One America News Network and Newsmax. Fox News settled for $787 million last year with another voting-technology company, Dominion Voting Systems."

      "HANOI, Vietnam -- Vietnam has suspended the operations of Chinese online retailer Temu after it failed to meet a government deadline to register the company by the end of November.",
      "It is unclear if Temu, a unit of Chinese e-commerce giant Pinduoduo, will be allowed to resume its business once it registers. The suspension comes after the ministry had raised concerns about the authenticity of Temu\u2019s extremely cheap products and their impact on Vietnamese manufacturers.",
      "Temu said Thursday it was working with the Vietnam E-commerce and Digital Economy Agency and the Ministry of Industry and Trade to register its e-commerce services and had submitted required documents.",
      "Temu began selling goods in Vietnam in October with aggressive discounts and free shipping. The government had warned the company that its app and website would be blocked if it did not register before an end-of-November deadline, official Vietnam News Agency cited the Ministry of Industry and Trade as saying.",
      "On Thursday, Vietnamese language options were removed from Temu's website. A notification on the site said that Temu was working \"with the Vietnam E-commerce and Digital Economy Agency and the Ministry of Industry and Trade to register its provision of e-commerce services in Vietnam.\u201d",
      "Temu is being investigated in Europe over suspicions it was failing to prevent the sale of illegal products."

      "A pair of European satellites has rocketed into orbit on a mission to create artificial solar eclipses",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A pair of European satellites rocketed into orbit Thursday on the first mission to create artificial solar eclipses through fancy formation flying in space.",
      "Each fake eclipse should last six hours once operations begin next year. That's considerably longer than the few minutes of totality offered by a natural eclipse here on Earth, allowing for prolonged study of the sun's corona, or outer atmosphere.",
      "The launch took place from India.",
      "\u201cWe are a very happy science team here\u201d in India, the European Space Agency's mission scientist Joe Zender said via email.",
      "Billed as a tech demo, the two satellites will separate in a month or so and fly 492 feet (150 meters) apart once reaching their destination high above Earth, lining up with the sun so that one spacecraft casts a shadow on the other.",
      "This will require extreme precision, within just one millimeter, equivalent to a fingernail's thickness, according to the European Space Agency. To maintain their position, the satellites will rely on GPS, star trackers, lasers and radio links, flying autonomously.",
      "Each cube-shaped spacecraft is less than 5 feet (1.5 meters) across. The shadow-casting satellite holds a disk to block the sun from the telescope on the other satellite. This disk will mimic the moon in a natural total solar eclipse, with the darkened satellite posing as Earth.",
      "\u201cThis has a huge scientific relevance\u201d in addition to testing high-precision formation flying,\u201d said the European Space Agency\u2019s technology and engineering director Dietmar Pilz.",
      "Scientists need the glaring face of the sun completely blocked in order to scrutinize the wispy crown-like corona encircling it, getting an especially good look close to the solar rim on this mission. They're particularly interested to learn why the corona is hotter than the surface of the sun, and also want to better understand coronal mass ejections, eruptions of billions of tons of plasma with magnetic fields out into space.",
      "The resulting geomagnetic storms can disrupt power and communication on Earth and in orbit. Such outbursts can also produce stunning auroras in unexpected places.",
      "With a lopsided orbit stretching from 370 miles (600 kilometers) to 37,000 miles (60,000 kilometers) away, the satellites will take nearly 20 hours to circle the world. Six of those hours \u2014 at the farther end of certain orbits \u2014 will be spent generating an eclipse. Other orbits will be strictly for formation flying experiments, according to the European Space Agency.",
      "The first eclipse results should be available in March, following checkout of both craft.",
      "Zender said eclipses will be created at least twice a week, with six hours of totality each time for corona observations. The frequency will depend on solar activity, he noted, and prove a boon for scientists who now must travel across the world for a mere three to five minutes of totality during the occasional eclipse.",
      "The $210 million mission, dubbed Proba-3, is aiming for at least 1,000 hours of \u201con demand\u201d totality during its two-year operation. Once their job is done, both satellites will gradually drop lower until they burn up in the atmosphere, likely within five years.",
      "Liftoff was delayed a day by a last-minute issue with the backup propulsion system of one of the satellites, crucial for precision formation flying. The European Space Agency said engineers relied on a computer software fix.",

      "This bumps the third Artemis mission \u2014 a moon landing by two other astronauts \u2014 to at least 2027. NASA had been aiming for 2026.",
      "NASA\u2019s Artemis program, a follow-up to the Apollo moonshots of the late 1960s and early 1970s, has completed only one mission. An empty Orion capsule circled the moon in 2022 after blasting off on NASA\u2019s new Space Launch System rocket.",
      "Although the launch and lunar laps went well, the capsule returned with an excessively charred and eroded bottom heat shield, damaged from the heat of reentry. It took until recently for engineers to pinpoint the cause and come up with a plan.",
      "NASA will use the Orion capsule with its original heat shield for the next flight with four astronauts, according to Nelson, but make changes to the reentry path at flight's end. To rip off and replace the heat shield would have meant at least a full year's delay and stalled the moon landing even further, officials said.",
      "During the flight test, NASA had the capsule dip in and out of the atmosphere during reentry, and gases built up in the heat shield's outer layer, officials said. That resulted in cracking and uneven shedding of the outer material.",
      "The commander of the lunar fly-around, astronaut Reid Wiseman, took part in Thursday\u2019s news conference at NASA headquarters in Washington. His crew includes NASA astronauts Victor Glover and Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen.",
      "\u201cDelays are agonizing and slowing down is agonizing and it\u2019s not what we like to do,\u201d Wiseman said. But he said he and his crew wanted the heat shield damage from the first flight to be fully understood, regardless of how long it took. Now they can focus with this \u201clarge decision behind us.\"",
      "Twenty-four astronauts flew to the moon during NASA's vaulted Apollo program, with 12 landing on it. The final bootprints in the lunar dust were made during Apollo 17 in December 1972.",
      "Nelson said the revised schedule should still have the United States getting astronauts back on the lunar surface before China, which has indicated 2030 for a crew moon landing.",
      "The space agency has put all the Artemis contractors, including Elon Musk's SpaceX, on notice to \u201cdouble-down\u201d to meet the schedule deadlines, according to Nelson. SpaceX's mega rocket Starship \u2014 making test flights from Texas with increasing frequency \u2014 is how astronauts will get from the Orion capsule in lunar orbit down to the surface on the first two Artemis moon landings.",
      "Nelson said he's already called Jared Isaacman, the SpaceX-flying billionaire nominated this week by Trump to lead NASA, and invited him to NASA headquarters in Washington.",

      "The most expensive dinosaur fossil ever discovered will be on view in New York starting this weekend",
      "NEW YORK -- The most expensive dinosaur fossil ever discovered will be on view in New York starting this weekend, American Museum of Natural History officials announced Wednesday.",
      "The giant stegosaurus fossil, dubbed \u201cApex,\u201d is 11 feet (3.3 meters) tall and 27 feet (8.2 meters) nose to tail. The display will start in a giant atrium at the museum\u2019s entrance before being moved to the museum's existing fossil halls next year.",
      "The museum also confirmed the identity of the philanthropist who purchased Apex. Billionaire hedge fund manager and longtime museum donor Ken Griffin bought it at an auction in July for $45 million, the most ever paid for dinosaur remains. Sean Decatur, president of the American Museum of Natural History, said that Griffin approved a long-term loan of Apex, as well as allowing scientists to take samples from the fossil for analysis.",
      "\u201cThis partnership allows Apex to have pride of place at a museum world-renowned for its dinosaur collection and for its longstanding leadership in paleontology and, even more exciting, enables us to pursue specialized Stegosaurus research centered around this extraordinary and scientifically important specimen,\u201d Decatur said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Of the more than 80 stegosauri made available to scientific institutions, very few are substantially complete, the statement said. Apex is the most complete specimen ever found, Decatur said. With about 80% of its 320 bones preserved, it is miraculous for creature that has been dead for 150 million years. The specimen is also prized by scientists because it is estimated to have died at a relatively old age, and it could reveal insights into stegosaurus metabolism and bone growth.",
      "Scientists will make CT scans of the internal structures of the dinosaur's skull and analyze a small sample extracted from one of its giant thigh bones, the statement said.",
      "\u201cAs exciting as is it is to have this dinosaur on display, it is even more exciting to have the opportunity to study it and make important scientific data available for research,\u201d said Roger Benson, who curates the American Museum of Natural History's fossil amphibians, reptiles, birds and plants.",
      "The museum\u2019s paleontologists have a long record of breaking ground in dinosaur research, including identifying the first dinosaur eggs and early evidence of dinosaur feathers, the statement said.",
      "Commercial paleontologist Jason Cooper discovered in Apex on his land near Dinosaur, Colorado, on the Utah border near Dinosaur National Monument.",
      "Griffin's successful $44.6 million bid for Apex over the summer set a record for dinosaur remains, beating out the $31.8 million paid for \u201cStan,\u201d the remains of a Tyrannosaurus rex sold in 2020. Like Apex, the Stan fossils were purchased by a private individual with plans to make it available to the public. The T. rex has been slated to be on display in Abu Dhabi, in United Arab Emirates, at a museum that opens in late 2025.",

Here are some things to know about tsunamis:",
      "A tsunami, a word that comes from the Japanese characters for harbor and wave, is a series of extremely long waves caused by the sudden displacement of the ocean, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "\u201cMost tsunamis, and the largest, result from earthquakes on reverse faults. These tsunami-generating earthquakes originate mainly in subduction zones, where tectonic plates collide and one is forced under the other,\u201d the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.",
      "If this is large enough and closer to the ocean floor, the energy from the earthquake can cause the ocean floor to suddenly rise or fall. \u201cThis sudden vertical displacement of the ocean floor is what typically sets a tsunami in motion,\u201d NOAA said.",
      "\u201cTsunamis radiate outward in all directions from the point of origin and can move across entire ocean basins,\u201d the service says.",
      "When the waves reach land, they can cause coastal flooding, and the powerful currents can last several hours or days.",
      "The weather service calls a tsunami as \u201cone of the most powerful and destructive natural forces.\u201d",
      "Tsunamis that cause damage or death near earthquakes occur about two times a year, according to the Global Historical Tsunami Database.",
      "A tsunami racing across an ocean and causing damage or deaths more than 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) away happens about twice a decade.",
      "Tsunamis can occur in any ocean, sea or large body of water. But certain areas are prone to tsunamis because of their proximity to the source and other factors, such as depth and the shape of the ocean floor.",
      "The database says between 1900 and 2015, there were 754 confirmed events. Of those, 78% were in the Pacific Ocean. According to the database, Japan has had the most tsunamis since 1900, followed by Russia and Indonesia.",

      "LANSING, Mich. -- Michigan Democrats are pushing this month to pass legislation they say will improve reproductive health care, in particular the safety of digital health data, ahead of Republicans taking over the state House in 2025.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is backing a bill designed to protect reproductive health data including data logged on menstrual cycle tracking apps. Similar legislation that has passed in other states is aimed at keeping the data from being used to target people seeking abortions.",
      "\u201cThis feels like a very urgent need for us to get this done while we have a window in Michigan with the Democratic majority for the next few weeks,\u201d said state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, sponsor of the digital privacy bill.",
      "The rush is a reaction to expectations that it will be harder to pass the reproductive health care policies Democrats favor after Republicans take control of the state House in January. Democrats kept control of the state Senate in the November election.",
      "Republicans have opposed the digital privacy bill over a section they say will stifle anti-abortion advertising.",
      "Other reproductive health bills to be considered during the December session that began Tuesday include a package on Black maternal health and an expansion of access to birth control.",
      "After the overturn of Roe v. Wade, some women in states with strict abortion bans began to worry that their health information could be used to track their reproductive status. Apps that track menstrual cycles became a major focus point.",
      "Abortion is constitutionally protected in Michigan. But McMorrow does not trust President-elect Donald Trump's campaign promise to veto any possible national abortion ban nor his campaign's efforts to distance itself from Project 2025, which proposed a rollback on abortion and contraception access.",
      "Period tracking apps allow women to take detailed day-by-day notes about their health, from how heavy their period flow is to additional symptoms such as cramping. They can log pregnancies and miscarriages.",
      "\u201cThese tools are really valuable,\u201d McMorrow said. \u201cI just want to make sure that the guardrails are there when indications from the incoming federal administration is they would potentially weaponize the data in a way that is very dangerous.\u201d",
      "Federal law bars medical providers from sharing health data without a patient\u2019s consent but doesn\u2019t prevent digital tech companies from tracking menstrual cycles or an individual\u2019s location and selling it to data brokers. Legislation for federal bans have never gained momentum, largely because of opposition from the tech industry.",
      "How the legislation works varies from state to state. Washington state has digital privacy law that broadly covers all health-related data while Virginia has a law that explicitly prohibits the issuance of search warrants, subpoenas or court orders for electronic or digital menstrual health data.",
      "Michigan\u2019s proposal would require businesses or organizations to use reproductive health data only for the services it provides, and consumers must be informed of how the data is being used. In order to sell that data, an entity would need explicit, signed consent from the consumer. Consumers would also have the option to opt out from their data being sold at any time.",
      "It would also regulate retailers, who often compile data to target consumers with advertisements, and the use of geofencing, which allows marketers to target consumers with ads based on their location.",
      "The bill would prohibit identifying who is receiving reproductive health care by using location information and targeting them with advertisements. This would apply to people visiting fertility or abortion clinics.",
      "The geofencing provision of the bill has drawn objection from anti-abortion advocates. Genevieve Marnon, legislative director for Right to Life of Michigan, said in committee testimony Tuesday that the bill would prevent women visiting an abortion clinic from being reached by anti-abortion ads.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t safeguarding women\u2019s reproductive health data,\" she said. \u201cIt is limiting the options presented to women.\u201d",
      "Republican Sen. John Damoose, who voted against the bill in committee, believes the geofencing provision encroaches on freedom of speech and religion by preventing anti-abortion advertising.",
      "The bill was voted out of committee Tuesday on party lines and advanced Thursday toward a final vote in the Senate chamber.",
      "Kimya Forouzan, principal state policy director at the Guttmacher Institute, expects the topic to be taken up by other state legislatures next year. Guttmacher, which supports abortion rights, tracks reproductive health trends.",
      "Over the past two years, Michigan Democrats have passed bills repealing a number of anti-abortion laws, including the state\u2019s 1931 ban, and adding surrogacy protections to state law. Lawmakers are considering a number of others related to reproductive health this month.",
      "A group of bills focused on improving maternal health for Black women would create a doula scholarship, among other measures. The Senate voted its package on the topic through to the House on Tuesday.",
      "Rep. Jaime Churches, a Democrat from the downriver area of Detroit who lost her seat in November, is trying to gain traction for two bills that would require insurance to cover fertility treatments, including in vitro fertilization and intrauterine insemination.",
      "Three bills seeking to expand access to birth control through insurance have passed the state House. McMorrow also introduced a series of bills aimed at providing long-lasting reversible contraception, such an implants or intrauterine devices, to patients who have given birth before they are discharged from a hospital.",

Advocates for economic development, infrastructure and gun control measures are among the many looking to push through bills in the month that is left. Major contention over new paid sick leave and minimum wage requirements is likely to garner attention.

      "China said in July 2023 it would require exporters to apply for licenses to send to the U.S. the strategically important materials such as gallium and germanium. In August, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it would restrict exports of antimony, which is used in a wide range of products from batteries to weapons, and impose tighter controls on exports of graphite.",
      "Such minerals are considered critical for national security. China is a major producer of antimony, which is used in flame retardants, batteries, night-vision goggles and nuclear weapon production, according to a 2021 U.S. International Trade Commission report.",
      "The limits announced by Beijing on Tuesday also include exports of super-hard materials, such as diamonds and other synthetic materials that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective coatings. The licensing requirements that China announced in August also covered smelting and separation technology and machinery and other items related to such super-hard materials.",
      "China is the biggest global source of gallium and germanium, which are produced in small amounts but are needed to make computer chips for mobile phones, cars and other products, as well as solar panels and military technology.",

      "Both governments say their respective export controls are needed for national security.",
      "China's government has been frustrated by U.S. curbs on access to advanced processor chips and other technology on security grounds but had been cautious in retaliating, possibly to avoid disrupting China\u2019s fledgling developers of chips, artificial intelligence and other technology.",
      "Various Chinese industry associations issued statements protesting the U.S. move to limit access to advanced chip-making technology.",
      "The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said it opposed using national security as a grounds for export controls, \u201cabuse of export control measures, and the malicious blockade and suppression of China.\u201d",
      "\u201cSuch behavior seriously violates the laws of the market economy and the principle of fair competition, undermines the international economic and trade order, disrupts the stability of the global industrial chain, and ultimately harms the interests of all countries,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "The China Semiconductor Industry Association issued a similar statement, adding that such restrictions were disrupting supply chains and inflating costs for American companies.",
      "\u201cU.S. chip products are no longer safe and reliable. China\u2019s related industries will have to be cautious in purchasing U.S. chips,\u201d it said.",

    "summary": "U.S. officials are urging telecommunication companies to boost network security following a Chinese hacking operation that gave officials in Beijing access to the private texts and phone conversations of Americans",
    "story": [
      "U.S. officials are urging telecommunication companies to boost network security following a Chinese hacking operation that gave officials in Beijing access to the private texts and phone conversations of Americans",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal authorities on Tuesday urged telecommunication companies to boost network security following a sprawling Chinese hacking campaign that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans.",
      "The guidance issued by the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is intended to help root out the hackers and prevent similar cyberespionage in the future. Officials who briefed reporters on the recommendations said the U.S. still doesn't know the true scope of China's attack or the extent to which Chinese hackers still have access to U.S. networks.",
      "In one sign of the global reach of China's hacking efforts, the government's warning was issued jointly with security agencies in New Zealand, Australia and Canada, members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, which also includes the U.S. and Britain.",
      "Dubbed Salt Typhoon by analysts, the wide-ranging cyberespionage campaign emerged earlier this year after hackers sought to penetrate the networks of multiple telecommunications companies.",
      "The hackers used their access to telecom networks to target the metadata of a large number of customers, including information on the dates, times and recipients of calls and texts.",
      "The hackers succeeded in retrieving the actual audio files of calls and content from texts from a much smaller number of victims. The FBI has contacted victims in this group, many of whom work in government or politics, but officials said it is up to telecom companies to notify customers included in the first, larger group.",
      "Despite months of investigation, the true scale of China\u2019s operation, including the total number of victims or whether the hackers still have some access to information, is currently unknown.",
      "The FBI has said some of the information targeted by the hackers relates to U.S. law enforcement investigations and court orders, suggesting the hackers may have been trying to access programs subject to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. The law grants American spy agencies sweeping powers to surveil the communications of people suspected of being agents of a foreign power.",
      "But on Tuesday, officials said they think the hackers were more broadly motivated, hoping to burrow deeply into the nation's telecommunications systems to gain wide access to Americans' information.",
      "The suggestions for telecom companies released Tuesday are largely technical in nature, urging encryption, centralization and consistent monitoring to deter cyber intrusions. If implemented, the security precautions could help disrupt the Salt Typhoon operation and make it harder for China or any other nation to mount a similar attack in the future, said Jeff Greene, CISA's executive assistant director for cybersecurity and one of the officials who briefed reporters Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have any illusion that once we kick off these actors they\u2019re not going to come back,\u201d Greene said.",
      "Several recent high-profile hacking incidents have been linked to China and what officials say is Beijing's effort to steal technical and government secrets while also gaining access to critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid.",
      "In September, the FBI announced that it had disrupted a vast Chinese hacking operation that involved the installation of malicious software on more than 200,000 consumer devices, including cameras, video recorders and home and office routers. The devices were then used to create a massive network of infected computers, or botnet, that could then be used to carry out other cyber crimes.",
      "In October, officials said hackers linked to China targeted the phones of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, along with people associated with Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "China has rejected accusations from U.S. officials that it engages in cyberespionage directed against Americans.",
      "On Tuesday, a spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington called the U.S. allegations \u201cdisinformation.\"",
      "China's government \u201cfirmly opposes and combats all kinds of cyber attacks,\u201d spokesperson Liu Pengyu wrote in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. \u201cThe US needs to stop its own cyberattacks against other countries and refrain from using cyber security to smear and slander China.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump says he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission",
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Trump said Atkins, the CEO of Patomak Partners and a former SEC commissioner, was a \u201cproven leader for common sense regulations.\u201d In the years since leaving the SEC, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation.",
      "\u201cHe believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The commission oversees U.S. securities markets and investments and is currently led by Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government\u2019s crackdown on the crypto industry. Gensler, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, announced last month that he would be stepping down from his post on the day that Trump is inaugurated \u2014 Jan. 20, 2025.",
      "Trump, once a crypto skeptic, had pledged to make the U.S. \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. Money has poured into crypto assets since he won. The value of bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, passed $100,000 Wednesday. And shares in crypto platform Coinbase have surged more than 70% since the election.",
      "Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of Coinbase, congratulated Atkins in a post on X.",
      "\u201cWe appreciate his commitment to balance in regulating U.S. securities markets and look forward to his fresh leadership at (the SEC),\u201d Grewal wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s sorely needed and cannot come a day too soon.\u201d",
      "Congressman Brad Sherman, a California Democrat and a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, said he worries Atkins would not sufficiently regulate cryptocurrencies as SEC chair.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019d probably take the position that no cryptocurrency is a security, and hence no exchange that deals with crypto is a securities exchange,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cThe opportunity to defraud investors would be there in a very significant way.\u201d",
      "Atkins began his career as a lawyer and has a long history working in the financial markets sector, both in government and private practice. In the 1990s, he worked on the staffs of two former SEC chairmen, Richard C. Breeden and Arthur Levitt.",
      "His work as an SEC commissioner started in 2002, a time when the fallout from corporate scandals at Enron and WorldCom had turned up the heat on Wall Street and its government regulators.",
      "Atkins was widely considered the most conservative member of the SEC during his tenure at the agency and known to have a strong free-market bent. As a commissioner, he called for greater transparency in and analysis of the costs and benefits of new SEC rules.",
      "He also emphasized investor education and increased enforcement efforts against those who steal from investors over the internet, manipulate markets, engage in Ponzi schemes and other types of fraud.",
      "At the same time, Atkins objected to stiff penalties imposed on companies accused of fraudulent conduct, contending that they did not deter crime. He caused a stir in the summer of 2006 when he said the practice of granting stock options to executives before the disclosure of news that was certain to increase the share price did not constitute insider trading.",
      "U.S. Rep. Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said Atkins has the experience needed to \u201crestore faith in the SEC.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m confident his leadership will lead to clarity for the digital asset ecosystem and ensure U.S. capital markets remain the envy of the world,\u201d McHenry posted on X.",
      "Atkins already has some experience working for Trump. During Trump's first term, Atkins was a member of the President\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum, an advisory group of more than a dozen CEOs and business leaders who offered input on how to create jobs and speed economic growth.",
      "In 2017, Atkins joined the Token Alliance, a cryptocurrency advocacy organization.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump\u2019s victory in the hopes that he would push through legislative and regulatory changes that they\u2019ve long lobbied for.",
      "Trump himself has launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies."

      "The price of bitcoin has soared nearly 50% since Election Day.",
      "The price of bitcoin topped $100,000 for the first time ever late Wednesday, and soared to a fresh high in early trading on Thursday.",
      "The new gains extended a rally set off by the election of former President Donald Trump, who is viewed as friendly toward cryptocurrency.",
      "In a post on Truth Social on Thursday, Trump took credit for the gains: \u201cCONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU'RE WELCOME!!!.\u201d",
      "Since Election Day, the price of bitcoin has climbed nearly 50%. That performance far outpaces the S&P 500, which has risen about 5% over the same period.",
      "But the breakneck pace of bitcoin\u2019s growth poses a quandary for investors: Is it too late to buy into the rally, or will the good times continue to roll?",
      "Investment analysts who spoke with ABC News gave reason to be optimistic about further gains, citing expectations of a friendly regulatory environment under Trump and continued interest rate cuts at the Federal Reserve.",
      "The surge of momentum alone may pull investors from the sidelines, propelling the price of bitcoin higher, they added.",
      "Analysts, however, warned that bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset, making it all but impossible to predict where its price will go next.",
      "\u201cBitcoin clearly has some things going in its favor,\u201d said Mark Hamrick, Washington bureau chief and senior economic analyst for Bankrate.com.",
      "\u201cThe problem with bitcoin is that it\u2019s unclear what drives the underlying fundamentals of the asset,\u201d Hamrick added. \u201cIf somebody were to ask me where bitcoin is going in the next week, month or year, I have no idea.\u201d",
      "At least for now, bitcoin is on a tear. The latest surge coincided with a piece of good news for the crypto industry: Trump\u2019s nomination on Wednesday of Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Atkins, the CEO of consulting firm Patomak Partners, serves as co-chair of the Token Alliance, a cryptocurrency advocacy organization.",
      "Once a crypto critic, Trump has vowed to bolster the cryptocurrency sector and ease regulations enforced by the Biden administration. Trump has also promised to establish the federal government's first National Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.",
      "The positive developments for crypto extend well beyond Trump. In recent months, the Fed has cut interest rates and forecasted additional rate cuts to come. In theory, lower rates could ease consumer borrowing costs and drive more investment in bitcoin.",
      "Strong performance this year has also been driven by U.S. approval in January of bitcoin ETFs, or exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin ETFs allow investors to buy into an asset that tracks the price movement of bitcoin, while avoiding the inconvenience and risk of purchasing the crypto coin itself.",
      "Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at eToro, said those favorable conditions for bitcoin are likely to persist.",
      "\u201cThose same catalysts have the longer-term picture still looking bright for bitcoin,\u201d Kenwell told ABC News in a statement.",
      "Still, experts offered up warnings about the volatility of bitcoin. Even amid its meteoric rise this year, bitcoin experienced a temporary downswing that slashed one-third of its value, Kenwell noted.",
      "As recently as 2021, bitcoin suffered a downturn that cut its value in half. The same thing happened a year earlier, when the initial outset of the pandemic triggered a panic among investors.",
      "Bitcoin has proven sensitive to negative developments for crypto and the wider market in part because it is difficult to peg the value of the asset, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told ABC News.",
      "Stock investors typically assess the value of a company\u2019s shares by evaluating its service or product. Since bitcoin isn\u2019t currently used as anything besides a store of value, the lack of a clear utility leaves little basis for assessing bitcoin\u2019s value, which contributes to its volatile price movements, Sosnick added.",
      "\u201cBitcoin isn\u2019t really used in the real world,\u201d Sosnick said, noting the asset could still move higher nevertheless.",
      "\u201cRight now, the public is very enamored with bitcoin,\u201d Sosnick said. \u201cIt\u2019s foolish to say that any number \u2013 whether it\u2019s $75,000 or $100,000 or anything \u2013 is the end of the rise.\u201d",

      "Behind the scenes, Trump's political team was focused on figuring out where female Republican senators stand on Hegseth, according to two people involved in the conversations. Trump's advisers are fully aware that with such a thin GOP Senate majority, Hegseth's fate could all come down to the women in the conference.",
      "But Trump himself has not been working the phones for Hegseth -- as he did for Matt Gaetz, his original pick for attorney general who withdrew his name from consideration amid sexual assault allegations.",

      "Still, Hegseth insisted he had the president's support.",
      "\"He is behind us all the way. I spoke to him this morning,\" Hegseth told ABC News' Jay O'Brien.",
      "There are nine Republican women serving in the Senate. Only one, so far, has thrown their weight behind Hegseth when pressed by ABC News on where they stand.",
      "Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., was publicly supportive of Hegseth on Fox News. She called him a \"perfect fit to come in and reorganize\" the Department of Defense.",
      "The rest have reservations or are holding off on offering a formal stance until they learn more about the nominee. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said she was \"undecided.\" Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., only said she had a \"good conversation\" with him this week and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she was \"obviously\" concerned about some of the allegations against him.",
      "Sen. Joni Ernst, a key Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee that will hold his confirmation hearings, notably declined to voice support for Hegseth after meeting with him on Wednesday and then again on Thursday on Fox News, which Trump is known to watch.",
      "Ernst told Fox News host Bill Hemmer she had a \"very frank\" and \"productive\" discussion with Hegseth. When pressed by Hemmer that that didn't sound as if she had gotten to a yes on his confirmation, she replied, \"I think you are right.\"",
      "The Iowa Republican is the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate and a sexual assault survivor herself. Hegseth has faced allegations of sexual assault (which he's denied) and previously said that women should not serve in ground combat roles in the military.",
      "Ernst is said to be on a list of possible candidates to replace Hegseth, ABC News previously reported.",
      "Hegseth has told senators his mother has been making calls to senators on his behalf, according to sources familiar with the matter. He has also told senators he is open to a background check, according to multiple sources.",
      "During Wednesday's meetings with GOP senators, Hegseth promised some he would not drink alcohol if confirmed.",

Roger Wicker, current ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and expected to take over the chairmanship in January -- presiding over Hegseth's confirmation hearings.",
      "Hegseth on Thursday sat down with Republican Sens. Rick Scott of Florida, Mike Rounds of South Dakota, Jim Banks of Indiana, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.",

      "\"I am a different man than I was years ago and that's a redemption story that I think a lot of Americans appreciate,\" Hegseth said. He said he thinks veterans appreciate that as well.",
      "Hegseth said he's faced policy and personal questions from senators over the past four days.",
      "\"The conversations have been robust, candid at times. There's great questions on policy, personality, everything, so we are going to earn those votes, fighting all the way through the tape,\" Hegseth said.",
      "He continued, \"I am grateful to have the president's support, because his vision for this department of defense is to bring it back to its core capacity of deterring our enemies and, if necessary, defeating those enemies. And that means ultimately putting war-fighting at the middle of what the Pentagon does, no more social justice, politically correct approaches to how we fight and conduct wars.\"",

    "story": [
      "The billionaire and Ramaswamy met with Congress members on the Hill.",
      "Work-from-home policies came under fire from X and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, as he and Republican businessman Vivek Ramaswamy took their plans to reduce government waste to the floors of Congress Thursday.",
      "The businessmen, who President-elect Donald Trump selected to lead an outside advisory board called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), attended several closed-door meetings with GOP senators and House members to sell their plans to cut as much as $2 trillion from the federal budget of what they called waste.",
      "\"I think we should make sure we spend the public's money well,\" Musk told reporters between the meetings.",
      "Musk posted on his social media platform X from inside the Capitol about what he and Ramaswamy say is a key issue for DOGE: The number of federal employees working from home.",
      "The Federal Office of Management and Budget released a report in August that found \"as of May 2024, approximately 50% of federal workers worked every day in roles that are not eligible for telework, including those who work onsite providing healthcare to our veterans, inspecting our food supply, and managing Federal natural resources.\"",
      "Musk shared a new report from Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, the chair of the Senate DOGE caucus, which claimed only 6% of federal workers show up in person to work on a full-time basis. Many others work from home part-time, and roughly one-third work from home full-time, according to the report.",
      "\"If you exclude security guards & maintenance personnel, the number of government workers who show up in person and do 40 hours of work a week is closer to 1%! Almost no one,\" Musk posted in response to the report.",
      "Ernst's report includes several anecdotes and alleged social media posts about federal employees who worked from home, including a Department of Veterans Affairs manager who posted a photo of himself working from a bathtub. Ernst's team included the photo in their report.",
      "The OMB report found that \"telework-eligible personnel spent approximately 60% of regular, working hours inperson, at agency-assigned job sites.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said he agreed with Musk's stance on work-from-home policies for federal workers and floated a claim, without any citation, that only 1% of federal workers were in their office.",
      "\"You will see a demand...that federal workers return to their desks. That's just common sense,\" he said at a news conference in between the meetings.",
      "Musk, who brought his son X to the proceedings, and Ramaswamy walked past reporters before the news conference began with Musk carrying his son on his shoulders.",
      "Musk has been a staunch opponent of work-from-home policies and removed such policies from his businesses, including X. He threatened layoffs for X employees who did not comply with his policy, which instructed any special requests for remote work needed to be reviewed by him before approval.",
      "Johnson praised DOGE's goals and said Thursday's meetings were the first of many among Washington lawmakers.",
      "The speaker dodged questions about pushback from federal workers' unions and possible cuts to social services and said he would not disclose more details about the proposed changes to the budget but stressed that the nation needed a \"leaner government.\"",
      "\"Government is too big and it does almost nothing well,\" he said.",
      "However, when it came to more specifics, Musk and Ramaswamy didn't appear to give lawmakers more concrete details.",
      "\"We don't live in a democracy; we live in a bureaucracy,\" Musk told members of the House and Senate in the town hall-style meeting, according to sources with knowledge of the meeting.",
      "In an \"open mic\" session, lawmakers then pitched Musk and Ramaswamy on a wide variety of places they'd like to see spending cuts, but there was little clear consensus.",
      "\"The suggestions have been all over the board. I wouldn't say that there's been a single common narrative yet,\" Rep Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., told reporters.",
      "Republicans were adamant the proposed sweeping cuts wouldn't impact entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, despite the fact they're by far the largest aspects of the federal budget.",
      "Some Republicans said they were skeptical Musk and Ramaswamy could achieve everything they've pitched, but they wanted cuts to begin no matter what.",
      "\"The way you eat an elephant is you do it one bite at a time, right? And we have to start. And so I don't know if it's going to be $2 trillion that they're going to be able to cut out of the federal budget, but we need to start cutting waste, inefficiency, bloated bureaucracy from the federal government, it's time that we do it,\" Rep Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., told ABC News.",
      "Rep Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., told ABC News there are challenges ahead for their proposals.",
      "\"But the problem is in that room, you could have a great plan but not have the votes to do it,\" he said.",

    "summary": "ABC News\u2019 Linsey Davis spoke with Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz about President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s picks for his administrative Cabinet",
    "story": [
      "Texas senator predicts border numbers will plummet in January and February.",
      "Texas Sen. Ted Cruz discussed with ABC News President-elect Donald Trump's selections for his administration's Cabinet, the ongoing border crisis and President Biden's decision to pardon his son, Hunter.",
      "Cruz, a Republican, stated on Tuesday that following a conference with his fellow Senate Republicans, all of Trump's nominees for federal government positions will be confirmed.",
      "ABC News spoke with Cruz about Trump's controversial Cabinet picks.",
      "ABC NEWS: We're joined now by Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz. He's also the incoming chair of the Commerce Committee. Senator, thank you so much for your time tonight.",
      "CRUZ: Linsey, great to be with you. Thank you for having me.",
      "ABC NEWS: You've said that you expect all of President-elect Trump's picks to get confirmed. With regard to Pete Hegseth, in particular, the nominee for secretary of defense. Just today, as you know, multiple sources told ABC News that Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis spoke about the secretary of defense job amid the allegations swirling around him. Does that give you pause that Hegseth may not ultimately be confirmed?",
      "CRUZ: Well, listen, that'll be a decision ultimately that President Trump has to make. I will say Pete Hegseth, he's a decorated combat veteran. He served our nation. He's been deployed multiple times. He spent a lifetime fighting for our servicemen and women, fighting to defend our veterans.",
      "And I do think he has a clear vision for bringing the Defense Department back to its core mission, for bringing it back to supporting the war fighters, for focusing on preparing and being ready to defeat the enemy if necessary, and for moving in a way from a political agenda that detracts from its core mission.",
      "I think all of that is critical. I think that's, all of that is a priority for President Trump, and I think it's a priority for this country. Ultimately, President Trump's going to make the decision as to which nominees he puts forward.",
      "ABC NEWS: Let's talk about Kash Patel, of course, Trump's pick for FBI director. You've called him a very strong nominee. When Trump talked about making him deputy director in 2020, then-Attorney General Bill Barr opposed the move so much he said it would only happen, quote, \"over my dead body.\"",
      "Patel has talked positively about the QAnon conspiracy theory. In the past, you said that he would shut down FBI headquarters. In his book, you made a list of members of the Deep State he wants to go after. Do any of these things concern you at all?",
      "CRUZ: Well, listen, I'll say a couple of things. No. 1, if you look at Kash Patel's background, he's been a senior intelligence staffer on Capitol Hill. He's been a senior intelligence staffer in the White House. He has been the chief of staff at the Department of Defense. He's been the deputy director of national intelligence. He's someone with deep background, in addition to being a federal public defender and also a prosecutor.",
      "So he brings a deep background to the job. But secondly, I will say the world and, in particular, the FBI and the Department of Justice are very, very different today than they were back in 2020 when Bill Barr was attorney general. And what we've seen for four years, tragically, has been the politicization and the weaponization of the Department of Justice and the FBI.",
      "And much of the criticism that is being directed at Kash Patel, it is not that he's not qualified for the job, but rather exactly the opposite, is that his detractors are afraid he will actually do what he is committed to doing, which is to clean out the political corruption that sadly has done real damage to the FBI.",
      "ABC NEWS: On your podcast, \"The Verdict with Ted Cruz,\" you called the Hunter Biden pardon an absolute abuse of power. [President Joe] Biden, of course, had repeatedly said that he would not pardon Hunter Biden. Then he did exactly that. On the other hand, Trump pardoned his son-in-law's father, Charles Kushner, his former chief of staff, Steve Bannon, among others.",
      "He's also implied he may pardon Jan. 6 defendants. Of course, presidents have long had this right. But in your estimation, at what point does a pardon become an absolute abuse of power, as you call it?",
      "CRUZ: Well, listen, one of the clear ways it becomes an abuse of power where as here Joe Biden and the White House lied about it for a year. Joe Biden repeatedly looked in TV cameras and said, I will not pardon Hunter Biden. No, no, no. Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, repeatedly said, no, no, no, zero chance of this happening. And as you noted on my podcast, \"Verdict with Ted Cruz,\" I predicted a year ago, in January of this year, I said in December of 2024, Joe Biden is going to pardon Hunter Biden.",
      "I put the odds of that happening at 100%. And I said then and I still believe now Joe Biden was lying when he said that, Karine Jean-Pierre was lying when they said that. They knew they were lying and everyone listening to them knew they were lying. And I think that is a real problem when you are lying to the American people.",
      "In my view, this pardon for Hunter Biden, of course, it is a father caring for his son. But I think at its heart it is about Joe Biden protecting Joe Biden and not wanting investigation into influence peddling and selling favors that that Joe Biden and his family have made tens of millions of dollars over the years doing exactly that.",
      "ABC NEWS: Let's turn to an issue that many have called a crisis at the southern border. You yourself are from an immigrant family. You spent a lot of time looking at this issue, which, as you know, has plagued our country for decades. Americans have spoken loud and clear. They want the current system to be fixed. Why do we have so many people trying to enter the southern border? And what's your solution on Day One to help solve this crisis?",
      "CRUZ: Well, I think you're exactly right that this election, I don't think there was a single issue that was more important in this election than securing our border. Should we have a mandate from the voters to secure the border? Now, you asked, how do we do that? Here's the good news: We know how to do it because we did it before. When President Trump was president before I worked hand in hand with him to secure the border.",
      "And we achieved incredible successes in the final year of Trump's presidency. We achieved the lowest rate of illegal immigration in 45 years. We have done it before. We'll do it again. How did this crisis happen? This crisis was deliberate. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris caused the border crisis by three decisions they made the very first week in office.",
      "No. 1, they immediately halted construction of the border wall. No. 2, they reinstated the disastrous policy of catch and release. And No. 3, they pulled out of the incredibly successful Remain in Mexico agreement. And the result was we instantly went from the lowest rate of illegal immigration in 45 years to the highest rate in the history of our country.",
      "Twelve million people have come in illegally under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Here's the good news, Linsey. Everything done through unilateral executive action can be undone through unilateral executive action. So I believe on Day One, on Jan. 20 of next year, President Trump will reverse those three decisions. He will resume construction of the border wall. He will end catch and release. And he will move to reinstate the Remain in Mexico agreement.",
      "And here's my prediction: We will see the numbers plummet and it won't take a year. It won't take six months. The numbers will plummet by January and February of next year. And then Congress will follow it up by legislating and providing serious funding to secure the border and to keep our community safe.",
      "ABC NEWS: Sen. Ted Cruz, have a lot more questions for you, but we're out of time. I hope you come back on the show with us.",
      "CRUZ: I look forward to it.",
      "ABC NEWS: Thank you.",

      "The acting director of the Secret Service Director told a House panel investigating the assassination attempt against President-elect Donald Trump said the agency has already made changes to ensure the assassination attempt doesn't happen again amid a heightened threat environment.",
      "\"We are operating in a heightened threat environment with expanding protection requirements, and this requires a shift in the Secret Service's levels of protection, readiness and sustainability,\" acting Director Ronald Rowe told Congress. \"A paradigm shift focuses on elevating protection, prioritizing training, strengthening our workforce and increasing accountability.\"",
      "Rowe said he is creating the Office of Field Operations \"to reset our thinking, thinking and perspective about the role field offices play in protection and to enhance our operational effectiveness by better leveraging field offices to support, enable and inform protection and protective activities.\"",
      "\"The world is a dangerous place. Responsibilities of the Secret Service are critical to the national security of the United States, it is important that decision makers fully recognize and appreciate the vital role and significance of the Secret Service in our nation's security,\u201d he said.",
      "The hearing was disrupted when Rowe got into a screaming match with Republican Rep. Pat Fallon of Texas over Rowe's attendance at the 9/11 memorial. Fallon accused Rowe of putting the president's Secret Service detail out of position so he could sit behind him during the ceremony.",
      "Before the exchange, Rowe said that the agency will use GPS blue force trackers -- a military asset that uses GPS to show where friendly and hostile assets are.",
      "He also asked Congress for more money to make sure the agency will have the preventive resources it needs and that it has already put the supplemental money to good use.",
      "\"We've also started moving money out to acquire more materials that we needed as we started to put more assets out on the road, classified assets, ballistic assets, now the wear and tear on that is going to increase,\" Rowe said. \"So now we have to make sure that we can acquire more and put more money down on contracts so that, as we are going to now go through the service life of these materials, we have to be able to replenish them and replenish them quickly. So some of these are long, lean items, so that money has been very, very helpful to us in making sure that we can address our immediate needs.\"",
      "He said the agency has about 500 agents in \"various statutes of training between now and March.\"",
      "The agency \"is on pace\" to hire 650 special agents and 350 uniformed division agents.",
      "Rowe said he is standing up an \"auditing capacity\" to regularly send feedback to agents to ensure they are doing the best job possible.",
      "\"We're not here to take punitive action against people, just to, you know, just to get you for something,\" he said. \"No, we want to make the mission better.\"",
      "Rowe also said that he stood up a drone unit that is actively hiring, and that if there had been a counter-drone mechanism on the ground in Butler, the attempt might have been stopped.",
      "\"My goal is to get more drone operators and people with this expertise downrange in the field, so that they can go out and do this and are there on the ground, and that's going to help us fly drones and identify line of sight vulnerabilities, get that \u2018eye in the sky\u2019 perspective as we're doing our advance,\" he said.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 08:37:58 -0500",
    "summary": "Former aides of Tulsi Gabbard, Donald Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, say her views on Russia may have been shaped by consuming Kremlin propaganda.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. intelligence has deemed the Russian news site RT to be a propaganda outlet.",
      "Since becoming President-elect Donald Trump's choice for director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard's rosy posture toward Moscow has prompted some Democratic critics to suggest that she could be \"compromised,\" or perhaps even a \"Russian asset\" -- claims the ex-Hawaii representative and Army officer has forcefully denied.",
      "But former advisers to Gabbard suggest that her views on Russia and its polarizing leader, Vladimir Putin, have been shaped not by some covert intelligence recruitment as far as they know -- but instead by her unorthodox media consumption habits.",
      "Three former aides said Gabbard, who left the Democratic Party in 2022, regularly read and shared articles from the Russian news site RT -- formerly known as Russia Today -- which the U.S. intelligence community characterized in 2017 as \"the Kremlin's principal international propaganda outlet.\"",
      "While it was not clear to those former staffers whether or when she stopped frequenting the site, one former aide said Gabbard continued to circulate articles from RT \"long after\" she was advised that the outlet was not a credible source of information.",
      "Doug London, a retired 34-year veteran intelligence officer, said Gabbard's alleged penchant to rely at least in part on outlets like RT to shape her view of the world reflects poorly on her suitability to fulfill the responsibilities of a director of national intelligence.",
      "\"That Gabbard's views mirror Russia's narrative and disinformation themes can but suggest na\u00efvet\u00e9, collusion, or politically opportunistic sycophancy to echo whatever she believes Trump wants to hear,\" London said, adding, \"none of which bodes well for the president's principal intelligence adviser responsible for enabling the [U.S. intelligence community] to inform decision-making by telling it like it is.\"",
      "Alexa Henning, a spokesperson for the Trump transition team, said in a statement to ABC News that \"this is false and nothing but a few former, conveniently anonymous, disgruntled staffers.\"",
      "\"Lt. Col. Gabbard's views on foreign policy have been shaped by her military service and multiple deployments to war zones where she's seen the cost of war and who ultimately pays the price,\" Henning said.",
      "Former congressional and campaign advisers said it was unclear to what extent Gabbard's views were shaped by what she read in RT -- and they emphasized that she would consume news from a wide range of outlets, including left-wing and right-wing blogs.",
      "But over the past decade, Gabbard's views on Russian aggression in Europe have evolved in a particularly dramatic fashion.",
      "In 2014, when Russian troops annexed Crimea, Gabbard -- then a first-term Democratic U.S. representative from Hawaii -- released a statement advocating for \"meaningful American military assistance for Ukrainian forces\" and for the U.S. to invoke \"stiffer, more painful economic sanctions for Russia.\"",
      "\"The consequences of standing idly by while Russia continues to degrade the territorial integrity of Ukraine are clear,\" she wrote at the time. \"We have to act in a way that takes seriously the threat of Russian aggression against its peaceful, sovereign neighbor.\"",
      "By 2017, however, her tune had changed. In a lengthy memo to campaign staff laying out her views on foreign policy, a copy of which was obtained by ABC News, Gabbard blamed the U.S. and NATO for provoking Russian aggression and bemoaned the United States' \"hostility toward Putin.\"",
      "\"There certainly isn't any guarantee to Putin that we won't try to overthrow Russia's government,\" she wrote in the memo from May 2017, titled \"fodder for fundraising emails / social media.\"",
      "\"In fact, I'm pretty sure there are American politicians who would love to do that,\" she wrote.",
      "She also condemned the very sanctions she had previously supported, writing that, \"historically, the U.S. has always wanted Russia to be a poor country.\"",
      "\"It's a matter of respect,\" she wrote. \"The Russian people are a proud people and they don't want the U.S. and our allies trying to control them and their government.\"",
      "Gabbard's sentiment in the 2017 memo is \"basically the Russian playbook,\" said Ivo Daalder, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO during the Obama administration.",
      "\"It's dangerous,\" said Daalder. \"That strain of thinking is not unique to Tulsi Gabbard, but it is certainly not where you would think a major figure in any administration would like to be, intellectually.\"",
      "By 2022, at the outset of the latest Russia-Ukraine conflict, Gabbard suggested on X that Russia's invasion was justified by Ukraine's potential bid to join NATO, \"which would mean US/NATO forces right on Russia's border\" -- a narrative perpetuated by Russian propaganda channels, including RT, and denounced by the U.S. and NATO as \"false.\"",
      "Gabbard's messaging has at times aligned so closely with Kremlin talking points that at least one commentator on Kremlin state media has referred to her as \"Russia's girlfriend.\"",
      "The U.S. government first called out RT as a propaganda mouthpiece for the Kremlin in the wake of the 2016 presidential election, three years after Gabbard was elected to Congress.",
      "This past September, the State Department wrote that it had evidence that \"RT moved beyond being simply a media outlet and has been an entity with cyber capabilities.\" The U.S. also issued fresh sanctions against executives at RT, including its editor-in-chief, who the U.S. accused of engaging in a \"nefarious effort to covertly recruit unwitting American influencers in support of their malign influence campaign.\"",
      "The Justice Department also indicted two RT employees in September for their alleged role in what the DOJ called a scheme to pay right-wing social media influencers nearly $10 million to \u201cdisseminate content deemed favorable to the Russian government.\"",
      "In the decade since Gabbard arrived in Washington, experts say she has regularly promoted views consistent with those espoused in RT and other Russian propaganda channels.",
      "In its 2017 assessment, for example, the U.S. intelligence community wrote that RT \"has actively collaborated with WikiLeaks\" and \"routinely gives [WikiLeaks founder Julian] Assange sympathetic coverage and provides him a platform to denounce the United States.\"",
      "Gabbard has long been an outspoken supporter of Assange, arguing in a June 2024 appearance on \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" that \"[Assange's] prosecution, the charges against him, are one of the biggest attacks on freedom of the press, that we've seen, and freedom of speech.\"",
      "In Congress, Gabbard also co-sponsored a resolution calling on the federal government to \"drop all charges against Edward Snowden,\" the former contractor for the National Security Agency who supplied WikiLeaks with secret documents in order to expose what he called \"horrifying\" U.S. government surveillance capabilities.",
      "RT frequently reports glowingly on Snowden, who has for more than a decade lived under asylum in Russia.",
      "But it is Gabbard's framing of the Russian invasion of Ukraine that has most galvanized her critics in the national security sphere.",
      "In March 2022, Gabbard posted a video to Twitter -- now X -- sharing what she said were \"undeniable facts\" about U.S.-funded biolabs in the war-torn country, claiming that \"even in the best of circumstances\" they \"could easily be compromised\" -- a debunked theory regularly promoted by RT and other Kremlin propaganda channels.",
      "Experts say RT and other Russian state-controlled news agencies have frequently capitalized on Gabbard's public comments to support the biolab conspiracy theory and other disinformation, recirculating clips in which she repeats the Kremlin propaganda as evidence backing the false claims -- effectively engineering an echo-chamber to magnify their propaganda machine.",
      "Even so, Brian O'Neill, a former senior intelligence official with experience in senior policymaker briefing, expressed confidence that career intelligence officials can support Gabbard with \"a constant barrage of new information\" that will help shape her understanding of emerging world events.",
      "\"New appointees in such roles always bring preconceptions, but like her predecessors, she will be subject to comprehensive briefings grounded in solid evidence provided by individuals of high integrity and expertise,\" O'Neill said.",
      "\"That said,\" O'Neill cautioned, \"Trump's well-documented hostility and skepticism toward the [intelligence community] will shape the environment she steps into. If she adopts a similar posture, there's a risk she might deprioritize intelligence community input or dismiss inconvenient truths presented to her.\"",

    "story": [
      "A U.S. Senate subcommittee has held a hearing to question the growing use of airline fees to charge passengers for things like early boarding and better seats",
      "Members of a U.S. Senate subcommittee took aim at airline executives Wednesday for using an expanding menu of fees to charge customers for early boarding, better seats and other comforts that used to be part of the ticket price.",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said he thinks the federal government should review and perhaps fine the airlines for their use of what he called junk fees.",
      "Blumenthal, the chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said seat fees were pure profit for the airlines because they don't have to create new seats or incur other expenses by allowing customers to pick where to sit.",
      "Some senators expressed frustration during Wednesday's hearing when airline executives could not explain how they set the amount of various fees. They said the vagaries of airline pricing make it hard for consumers to budget for trips.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all captives on your airplanes at a certain point. You just say, \u2018You want to pick seat? We\u2019re just going to charge you some random amount more,\u2019\u201d Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., said. \u201cIt would be good if you guys could be transparent about what you do and why.\u201d",
      "The fees don't seem to be discouraging anybody. Americans are flying more than ever.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration reported screening nearly 3.1 million travelers at airports around the country on Sunday, a new single-day record. The 15 busiest days in TSA history have all occurred this year, with traffic at airport checkpoints up 5% over 2023.",
      "Airline executives bristle at the term \u201cjunk fees,\u201d and argue they are merely giving consumers what they want: choices.",
      "\u201cOur customers who prioritize affordability have the option to choose a lower-fare product and, in doing so, opt out of paying for additional services that they do not want,\u201d Andrew Nocella, the chief commercial officer of United Airlines, said in testimony prepared for the panel's hearing. \u201cBut we also have customers who seek more services, and they retain the ability to choose the services they value, for an incremental fee, like a seat with extra legroom or checked bags.\u201d",
      "Airlines have been adding fees on desirable seats to take advantage of increasing demand.",
      "The airline executives took offense at the charge that they are gouging travelers.",
      "\u201cIt has never been more affordable to fly,\" said Steve Johnson, chief strategy officer for American Airlines.",
      "Transportation Department figures indicate that airfares have fallen by about one-third since 2000 when taking inflation into account. However, those figures do not include fees.",
      "Senators said fees should be described clearly during the ticket-buying process. The executives said their airlines do that.",
      "Some subcommittee members also criticized airlines for the way they enforce fees.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., sparred with executives of Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines, which paid employees $26 million in bonuses for spotting customers whose carry-on bags were too big to fit under a seat. The passengers were forced to pay a fee \u2014 up to $77 on Spirit and $99 on Frontier \u2014 to use an overhead bin.",
      "\u201cIf people want to know why it\u2019s such a terrible experience to fly, this is news for them today,\u201d Hawley told the airlines executives Wednesday. \u201cYour airlines are paying millions of dollars to your employees to harass people who have already paid!\u201d",
      "Frontier Chief Commercial Officer Robert Schroeter and his counterpart at Spirit, Matthew Klein, said ensuring that people follow the rules was a matter of fairness to all passengers.",
      "When Hawley asked why bag fees may vary from one customer to another, Schroeter said Frontier must cover its costs.",
      "\u201cOverall, our job is to generate the most revenue we can so we can keep profitable as an airline,\u201d he said.",
      "U.S. airlines raised more than $7 billion from fees on checked bags last year, with American Airlines and United Airlines leading the pack. They scooped up another $1 billion in ticket-change and cancellation fees, although that was about one-third of what they raised before the coronavirus pandemic, when the biggest airlines dropped change fees.",
      "Exact figures on other types of fees are hard to determine, but the Senate panel reported last week that United, American, Delta Air Lines, Frontier and Spirit collected a combined total of more than $12 billion in seat fees between 2018 and 2023. That included charges for things such as more legroom or an aisle seat near the front of the plane.",
      "Airline fees have been a frequent target of criticism by the Biden administration, all the way up to President Joe Biden.",
      "A Transportation Department rule that took effect in October requires airlines to make automatic cash refunds for tickets and fees when flights are canceled.",
      "The airline industry is suing to block another regulation requiring more prominent disclosure of baggage and cancellation fees. An appeals court has blocked that rule, and its fate is uncertain under President-elect Donald Trump. Blumenthal asked the five executives to drop the lawsuit. None agreed to do so.",
      "The airline industry and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg have continued to fight over fees and other regulations, even after the November election."

      "NEW YORK -- The huge rally for U.S. stocks lost momentum on Thursday as Wall Street counted down to a big jobs report that\u2019s coming on Friday. The crypto market had more action, and bitcoin briefly burst to a record  above $103,000 before pulling back.",
      "The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% from the all-time high it had set the day before, its 56th of the year so far,  to shave a bit off what\u2019s set to be one of its best years of the millennium. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 248 points, or 0.6%, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2% from its own record set the day before.",

The cryptocurrency has climbed dramatically from less than $70,000 on Election Day, but it fell back as Thursday progressed toward $99,000, according to CoinDesk.",
      "Sharp swings for bitcoin  are nothing new, and they took stocks of companies enmeshed in the crypto world on a similar ride. After rising as much as 9% in early trading, MicroStrategy, a company that\u2019s been raising cash just to buy bitcoin, swung to a loss of 4.8%. Crypto exchange Coinbase Global fell 3.1% after likewise erasing a big early gain.",

      "American Eagle Outfitters fell even more, 14.3%, after the retailer said it\u2019s preparing for \u201cpotential choppiness\u201d outside of peak selling periods. It was reminiscent of a warning from Foot Locker earlier in the week and raised more concerns about how resilient U.S. shoppers can remain.",

A report on Thursday said the number of U.S. workers applying for unemployment benefits  rose last week but remains at historically healthy levels.",

She missed the lighting this year because she was in Doha, Qatar, where she was discussing her initiative on women\u2019s health.",
      "So Biden did the honors himself, counting down from five before the tree light up a cheery bright green from the tip-top to the bottom of the trunk. He wished the crowd a Merry Christmas before stepping down to take his seat for musical performances.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Valerie Starkey was driving through Northern California to visit relatives when she suddenly felt shaking and feared her car had broken down, only to realize later that it was an earthquake so powerful that it triggered a tsunami warning for hundreds of miles of the U.S. West Coast.",
      "The epicenter of Thursday's 7.0 magnitude shaker occurred in California\u2019s so-called \u201cearthquake country\u201d because it\u2019s where three tectonic plates meet. The temblor was the most powerful to rattle the state since a 7.1-magnitude quake hit Ridgecrest in 2019.",
      "Its intensity shocked Starkey and many of the 5.3 million other people along nearly 500 miles (805 km) of the California and Oregon coasts who were under the tsunami warning for about an hour. It was lifted after no major waves arrived.",
      "\u201cI thought my axles had fallen apart,\u201d said Starkey, a Del Norte County supervisor representing Crescent City, a town of fewer than 6,000 near the Oregon border. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was feeling ... \u2018My axles are broken now.\u2019 I did not realize it was an earthquake.\u201d",
      "The quake struck at 10:44 a.m. west of Ferndale, a small city in coastal Humboldt County, about 130 miles (209 km) from the Oregon border, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The shaking knocked items off grocery store shelves and sent children scrambling under desks at schools.",
      "It was felt as far south as San Francisco, some 270 miles (435 km) away, where residents described a rolling motion for several seconds. It was followed by multiple smaller aftershocks. There were no immediate reports of major damage or injuries from the quake.",
      "The tsunami warning issued shortly after the quake struck spanned from the edge of California\u2019s Monterey Bay north into Oregon.",
      "\u201cIt was a strong quake. Our building shook. We\u2019re fine, but I have a mess to clean up right now,\u201d said Julie Kreitzer, owner of Golden Gait Mercantile, a store packed with food, wares and souvenirs that is a main attraction in Ferndale.",

The northwest corner of California is the most seismically active part of the state because it\u2019s where three tectonic plates meet, seismologist Lucy Jones said on the social media platform BlueSky.",
      "Shortly after the quake, phones in Northern California buzzed with the tsunami warning from the National Weather Service that said: \u201cA series of powerful waves and strong currents may impact coasts near you. You are in danger. Get away from coastal waters. Move to high ground or inland now. Keep away from the coast until local officials say it is safe to return.\u201d",
      "Numerous cities urged people to evacuate to higher ground as a precaution.",
      "In Santa Cruz, authorities cleared the main beach, taping off entrances with police tape. Aerial footage showed cars bumper-to-bumper heading to higher ground on California highways 1 and 92 in the Half Moon Bay area south of San Francisco.",
      "Cindy Vosburg, the executive director for the Crescent City-Del Norte County Chamber of Commerce, said she heard alarms sound just before shaking began, and the city's cultural center downtown started to creak.",
      "\u201cJust as it would start to subside, the building would roll again,\" Vosburg said.",
      "White House spokesperson Jeremy Edwards said President Joe Biden was briefed on the earthquake and that FEMA officials are in touch with their state and local counterparts in California and Oregon.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom signed off on a state of emergency declaration to quickly move state resources to impacted areas along the coast. State officials were concerned about damage in the northern part of the state, Newsom said.",
      "Crews in Eureka, the biggest city in the region, were assessing if there was any damage. Eureka Mayor Kim Bergel, who works at a middle school, said lights were swaying and everyone got under desks.",
      "\u201cThe kids were so great and terrified. It seemed to go back and forth for quite a long time,\u201d she said. Some children asked, \u201cCan I call my mom?\"",
      "The students were later sent home.",
      "Humboldt County Sheriff William Honsal said residents experienced cracks in their homes\u2019 foundations, as well as broken glass and windows, but nothing severe.",
      "Honsal said he was in his office in the 75-year-old courthouse in downtown Eureka when he felt the quake.",

      "About half of working women reported feeling stressed \u201ca lot of the day,\u201d compared to about 4 in 10 men, according to a Gallup report published Wednesday",
      "NEW YORK -- About half of working women reported feeling stressed \u201ca lot of the day,\" compared to about 4 in 10 men, according to a Gallup report published this week.",
      "The report suggests that competing demands of work and home comprise part of the problem: working women who are parents or guardians are more likely than men who are parents to say they have declined or delayed a promotion at work because of personal or family obligations, and mothers are more likely than fathers to \u201cstrongly agree\u201d that they are the default responders for unexpected child care issues.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s been much attention and discussion about promoting women\u2019s well-being and helping women succeed as leaders in the workplace. But at the same time, we\u2019re seeing record levels of stress, of worry, of burnout for women,\u201d said Gallup managing director Ilana Ron Levey at an event on Wednesday presenting the research findings, which were based on four separate surveys of nearly 20,000 adults working full time or part time, conducted between February 2023 and October 2024.",
      "But changing workplace culture and prioritizing well-being can improve the problem, according to Karen Guggenheim, creator of the World Happiness Summit and CEO of WOHASU, the organizing body behind the event and other well-being initiatives.",
      "\u201cWhy do we have to choose? Why are we creating environments where people have to make a choice between being the most amazing parent, partner, friend, daughter, sister, whatever, and also thriving at work?\u201d she said, adding: \u201cInvesting in women well-being isn\u2019t just good business - it\u2019s a blueprint for societal progress.\u201d",
      "The survey, which also found that working mothers are nearly twice as likely to say they have considered reducing their hours or leaving their job altogether because of child care issues compared to working fathers, also highlights the fallout of the country's child care crisis weeks ahead of the start of President-elect Donald Trump's second administration.",
      "Trump has said that child care is \u201csomething you have to have in this country\" and suggested that his plans to tax imports from foreign nations at higher levels would cover the cost of child care reform, although his campaign website does not mention the issue among the administration's priorities. Vice President-elect JD Vance has criticized efforts by the Biden administration to control rising costs in child care centers, arguing that doing so encourages parents to go back to work and neglects those who prefer to care for their children at home.",
      "Regarding prohibitively high child care costs \u2014- which can exceed the cost of rent for some families, according to a Department of Labor report published last month \u2014 Vance suggested parents should lean more on family members for care.",
      "But juggling work and family responsibilities can be draining for both men and women, who are about as likely to report thinking about work during personal time, the Gallup report found.",
      "Yet researchers also found that employers can significantly improve well-being by supporting work-life balance: Women who say they are able to maintain a healthy balance between work and personal commitments are more likely to be engaged at work, and less likely to be actively looking for a new job, the report says.",
      "Organizations can take action by establishing informed policies, programs and resources, positioning managers to be the support system employees need, and prioritizing a culture of well-being, explained Kristin Barry, director of hiring analytics at Gallup.",
      "And with women comprising nearly half of the workforce and the narrowest workforce participation gender gap in U.S. history, \u201cturning a blind eye to this challenge women are facing means we are not going to accomplish our goals,\u201d Barry said.",

      "The three words were written on the ammunition a masked gunman used to kill UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, according to two law enforcement officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Thursday. They're similar to the phrase \u201cdelay, deny, defend\u201d \u2014 the way some attorneys describe how insurers deny services and payment, and the title of a 2010 book that was highly critical of the industry.",
      "Police haven't officially commented on the wording or any connection between them and the common phrase. But Thompson's shooting and the messages on the ammunition have sparked outrage on social media and elsewhere, reflecting a deepening frustration Americans have over the cost and complexity of getting care.",
      "\u201cDelay, deny, defend\u201d has become something of a rallying cry for insurance critics. The terms refer to insurers delaying payment on claims, denying claims and defending their actions.",

      "Frustrations extend beyond the coverage of care. Expensive breakthrough medications to slow Alzheimer\u2019s disease or help with obesity are frequently not covered or have coverage limits.",
      "\u201cMany Americans view these companies as driven by profit rather than a commitment to serve their customers,\u201d said Mario Macis, a Johns Hopkins economist who studies trust in the health care system. \u201cAnd this creates a big disconnect.\u201d",

      "\u201cWith preparations for the 2026 elections beginning late next year, we want and need a state appellate court to weigh in expeditiously,\" Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement.",
      "Michael Gates, Huntington Beach's city attorney, said he supports the court's ruling and noted that the voting public supported the local measure.",
      "\u201cVoter ID in Huntington Beach is the law of our land here, it\u2019s our Constitutional right, and, it\u2019s here to stay \u2013 I will make sure of that,\u201d Gates wrote in an email.",
      "The Huntington Beach measure also lets the city increase in-person voting sites and monitor ballot drop boxes in local elections.",
      "The state sued, saying the measure violates state law and could disenfranchise poor, non-white, elderly and disabled voters, and Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom later signed into a law a state measure banning local governments from establishing laws requiring residents to provide identification to vote.",
      "Huntington Beach, which has been dubbed \u201cSurf City USA\u201d and is known for its scenic shoreline dotted with surfers, has a history of sparring with state officials over the measures it can take under its city charter on issues ranging from immigration to housing. The city is led by a politically conservative city council, and the GOP is dominant in Huntington Beach with nearly 57,000 registered voters versus 42,000 Democrats, county data shows."

      "An imprisoned far-right extremist group leader who was the top target of the federal investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol has balked at answering a prosecutor\u2019s questions about the attack",
      "WASHINGTON -- An imprisoned far-right extremist group leader who was the top target of the federal investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol balked at answering a prosecutor's questions about the attack when he testified on Thursday at the trial of a police officer accused of leaking him confidential information.",
      "A federal judge warned former Proud Boys national chairman Enrique Tarrio that he could face consequences, including an order holding him in contempt of court, if he continued to refuse to answer the prosecutor's questions. Tarrio completed his testimony without incurring any sanctions from the judge.",
      "Tarrio, who is serving a 22-year prison sentence for a plot to keep Donald Trump in the White House after the 2020 election, waived his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when he agreed to testify as a defense witness at the bench trial of retired Metropolitan Police Department Lt. Shane Lamond.",
      "\u201cWhat that means is you have to answer all the questions. You don't get to pick and choose,\u201d U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson told Tarrio after he initially refused to answer whether Proud Boys were at the Capitol on Jan. 6.",
      "Dozens of Proud Boys, including Tarrio, are among the 1,500 people who have been charged with federal crimes related to the Capitol siege. A jury convicted Tarrio and three lieutenants of seditious conspiracy and other crimes last year after a months-long trial in the same courthouse where Lamond is on trial this week.",
      "Tarrio complained that the prosecutor, Rebecca Ross, shouldn't have \u201cfree reign\u201d to ask him questions about Jan. 6. Lamond is on trial for charges that he lied about providing Tarrio with confidential information about a police investigation of Proud Boys who burned a Black Lives Matter banner in December 2020.",

      "\u201cThere is not a half of a Fifth Amendment privilege,\u201d the judge responded.",
      "When Tarrio told her, \u201cWe'll agree to disagree,\u201d the judge chuckled and replied, \u201cWell, I'll just say, \u2018You\u2019re not in charge.'\u201d",
      "Tarrio was the first witness to testify for Lamond's defense against charges that he obstructed justice and made false statements about his communications with Tarrio. The judge will decide the case against Lamond after hearing testimony without a jury.",
      "On Monday, the judge said Tarrio was waiting for the outcome of last month\u2019s presidential election before deciding whether to testify at Lamond\u2019s trial. President-elect Trump, who repeatedly has vowed to pardon people convicted of Capitol riot charges, suggested he would consider pardoning Tarrio.",
      "Tarrio was sentenced to more than five months in jail for burning the banner that was stolen in December 2020 from a historic Black church in downtown Washington, and for bringing two high-capacity firearm magazines into the district.",
      "Tarrio was arrested in Washington two days before the Jan. 6 siege. The Miami resident wasn\u2019t at the Capitol when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the building and interrupted the congressional certification of Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral victory.",
      "During the trial's opening statements on Monday, a prosecutor said Lamond was a \u201cProud Boys sympathizer\u201d who warned Tarrio about his impending arrest for the banner\u2019s destruction and later lied to investigators about their communications.",
      "Police officers who investigated the banner\u2019s destruction testified that it would have helped them to know that Tarrio had privately confessed to Lamond that he burned the banner. The Proud Boys leader also publicly admitted on social media and on a podcast that he had burned the banner.",
      "Tarrio testified on Thursday that he didn\u2019t confess to Lamond or receive any confidential information from him. Tarrio said he came to Washington two days before Jan. 6 because he wanted to be arrested for the banner burning but released in time to attend then-President Trump\u2019s Jan. 6 \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally.",
      "\u201cI wanted to get this over with,\u201d Tarrio said.",

      "\u201cI wanted to show what the Department of Justice was, and I was dedicated to that cause with everything in me,\u201d he said.",
      "Lamond, who met Tarrio in 2019, had supervised the intelligence branch of the police department\u2019s Homeland Security Bureau. He was responsible for monitoring groups like the Proud Boys when they came to Washington.",
      "Lamond\u2019s indictment accuses him of lying to and misleading federal investigators when they questioned him in June 2021 about his contacts with Tarrio.",

The challenge brought by the conservation group Apalachicola Riverkeeper against the state\u2019s environmental protection agency comes as the department has faced a wave of pushback from advocates who argue the state is inadequately protecting public lands and waters.",
      "Apalachicola Riverkeeper is challenging a decision by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to grant initial approval for exploratory oil and gas drilling in the Apalachicola River watershed, approximately 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of Tallahassee in the rural Panhandle region. The ecosystem is recognized as a global hotspot of biodiversity, with the highest species density of amphibians and reptiles in North America, according to UNESCO.",
      "In April, DEP issued a formal notice of its intent to grant an exploratory drilling permit to Clearwater Land & Minerals FLA, LLC.",
      "Apalachicola Riverkeeper filed a legal challenge over the draft permit, arguing that allowing oil production in the area \u201crisks catastrophic damage to the river system.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's mindboggling,\u201d said Susan Anderson, executive director of Apalachicola Riverkeeper.",
      "\u201cHow can they justify allowing an activity that is by any land use definition incompatible with (...) one of the most significant environmental areas in the world?\u201d",
      "In the notice announcing its plan to issue a permit, DEP staff wrote the company\u2019s proposal met the requirements set out in state law, which bans drilling within a mile of a freshwater stream, unless the department is satisfied that the state\u2019s natural resources \u201cwill be adequately protected in the event of accident or blowout.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe applicant has submitted all information required (...) and adequately demonstrated that the activities will be conducted in conformance with the applicable rules,\u201d the department's notice reads.",
      "Representatives for the drilling company did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "The state agency told AP, \u201cSince this matter is in active litigation, DEP is limited in its ability to comment further.\u201d",
      "The challenge is scheduled to go before an administrative law judge in Tallahassee on Monday, kicking off what's expected to be a week of hearings on the issue.",
      "For years, advocates have fought to protect the Apalachicola River basin and its wild stretch of salt marshes, moss-laden cypress trees and towering limestone bluffs. The region is also known for its once bustling commercial fishing industry, which at one time produced 10% of the oysters sold in the U.S. In recent years, advocates and government officials have invested millions in efforts to restore the ecosystem, which has been imperiled by drought and overfishing.",
      "The legal challenge comes as the state agency has faced widespread public criticism for what environmentalists contend is its inability to adequately protect Florida's beloved natural heritage.",
      "In August, the department faced overwhelming and bipartisan opposition for a proposal to build pickleball courts, hotels and golf courses in state parks. The plan was later scrapped, following a series of protests and pushback from Republican elected officials. Two months later, the agency\u2019s head stepped down.",
      "DEP also faces a separate lawsuit filed by advocates who argue the department isn\u2019t sufficiently protecting the state\u2019s freshwater springs, which are prized for their crystal-clear waters but have seen their flows siphoned off by commercial water bottling companies.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy spent several hours Thursday swapping ideas with lawmakers about President-elect Donald Trump'sDOGE initiative to dismantle parts of the federal government.",
      "Meeting behind closed doors at the Capitol, Musk told the mostly Republican lawmakers they would be keeping a \u201cnaughty and nice\u201d list of those who join in the budget slashing proposals and those who don\u2019t, according to lawmakers who attended.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to see a lot of change around here in Washington,\u201d said House Speaker Mike Johnson, as Musk, with his young son on his shoulders, breezed by and into the private meeting.",
      "Trump tapped the two business titans to head his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a nongovernmental task force assigned to find ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations \u2014 all part of what he calls his \"Save America\" agenda for a second term in the White House.",
      "Washington has seen this before, with ambitious efforts to reduce the size and scope of the federal government that historically have run into resistance when the public is confronted with cuts to trusted programs that millions of Americans depend on for jobs, health care, military security and everyday needs.",
      "But this time Trump is staffing his administration with battle-tested architects of sweeping proposals, some outlined in Project 2025, to severely reduce and reshape the government. Musk and Ramaswamy have said they plan to work alongside the White House's Office of Management and Budget, headed by Trump's nominee Russ Vought, a mastermind of past cuts.",
      "\u201cDOGE has a historic opportunity for structural reductions in the federal government,\u201d Musk and Ramaswamy wrote in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal. \u201cWe are prepared for the onslaught.\u201d",
      "Trump said Thursday that he would also name venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks to be the \u201cWhite House A.I. & Crypto Czar\u201d and lead the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology. Trump said in a social media post that Sacks would help \u201csteer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship.\u201d Trump\u2019s transition team didn\u2019t say whether Sacks would be a government employee or a temporary government worker who would not be bound by the same ethics and disclosure rules.",
      "Sacks visited Mar-a-Lago earlier Thursday, according to an investor who held an event at Trump's Florida club. The longtime conservative was key to introducing Vice President-elect JD Vance to donors, helping him prove he could raise money. Sacks hosted a fundraiser for Trump and Vance at his San Francisco home.",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy faced a first test as they sat on a auditorium stage in the Capitol basement, as House and Senate lawmakers, almost exclusively Republicans, lined up at the microphones to share ideas for ways to address the nation's budget imbalances.",
      "Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., the chair of the Education and Workforce Committee, brought up the Department of Education as a good place to cut. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., said to look at office space and how little of it is being used. Others talked about the need for workers to return to their offices.",
      "Afterward, Johnson declined to say if Medicare, Social Security or other popular programs were off limits for cuts, describing this first meeting as a \u201cbrainstorming\u201d session with more to come.",
      "\u201cThey said everything has to be looked at,\u201d said Rep. Aaron Bean, R-Fla., who joined with Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, in launching what they are calling the DOGE caucus in the House, with more than 50 Republicans and two Democratic members.",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy appeared to be taking it all in, Musk at times even taking notes, lawmakers said \u2014 experiencing a day in the life of congressional leadership, as the meeting went on and on, with lawmakers lined up 20-deep for their chance to speak.",
      "\u201cIt was just what I\u2019d hoped for, where it was a question and answer session, so that members could come up, express their ideas, concerns, ask questions,\" said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who will chair a House Oversight subcommittee in the new year on DOGE.",
      "To be sure, it wasn't the full Congress participating, as most Democrats did not join.",
      "New York Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi said when he heard Musk mention that he was open to hearing from Democrats, he dashed over to join toward the end of the session.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s do some things to try and make government more efficient \u2014 without hurting people,\u201d Suozzi said.",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy left lawmakers with the impression they would be back for more, holding regular meetings and starting a podcast or some other way to share information with Americans to gauge public support \u2014 or opposition \u2014 to the proposals.",
      "While neither Musk nor Ramaswamy have much public service experience, they bring track records in private business \u2014 Musk's operations have vast government contracts \u2014 and enthusiasm for Trump's agenda, having campaigned alongside him in the final stretch of the election.",
      "The world's richest man, Musk poured millions into a get-out-the-vote effort to help the former president return to the White House. He is known politically for having transformed the popular social media site formerly known as Twitter into X, a platform embraced by Trump's \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d enthusiasts.",
      "Despite its name, the Department of Government Efficiency is neither a department nor part of the government, which frees Musk and Ramaswamy from having to go through the typical ethics and background checks required for federal employment. They said they will not be paid for their work.",
      "One good-government group has said that DOGE, as a presidential advisory panel, should be expected to adhere to traditional practices of transparency, equal representation and public input \u2014 as happened with similar advisory entities from the Reagan to the Obama administrations.",

      "\"If the government is going to turn to unelected and politically unaccountable persons to make recommendations as grand as $2 trillion in budget cuts, it must ensure those recommendations come from a balanced and transparent process not rigged to benefit insiders.\u201d",
      "The nation's $6 trillion federal budget routinely runs a deficit, which this year ran $1.8 trillion, a historic high, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It has not been balanced since the Clinton administration more than two decades ago.",
      "Republicans generally blame what they see as exorbitant spending for the deficit, while Democrats point to tax cuts enacted under Republican presidents Trump and George W. Bush as the major driver.",
      "Receipts last year as a percentage of gross domestic product came in just below the average for the past 50 years, while outlays were equal to 23.4% of GDP, compared to the 50-year average of 21.1%.",
      "Some of the biggest increases in spending last year occurred with politically popular programs that lawmakers will be reticent to touch. For example, spending on Social Security benefits went up 8%, Medicare outlays increased 9%, spending on defense went up 7% and spending on veterans health care rose 14%, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., said the significance of the meeting was that it was even taking place, \"that there\u2019s honest dialogue between Congress and two, like, rock star administration guys.\u201d",
      "Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said he would like to see Musk testify before the House Armed Services Committee on the \u201cbloated defense budget.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to see Elon recommend some cuts. Let\u2019s have him testify,\u201d Khanna said."

      "Russia is spreading disinformation to American audiences in an effort to erode U.S. support for Ukraine as Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House",
      "WASHINGTON -- As President Joe Biden uses his final days in office to boost Ukraine's defenses, Russia is playing a different game: spreading disinformation aimed at eroding U.S. support for Ukraine before Donald Trump's return to the White House next month.",
      "Since the U.S. election on Nov. 5, the Kremlin has used state-run media and its networks of fake news sites and social media accounts to push divisive narratives about the war and America's Republican president-elect. Analysts say the content, translated into English for American audiences, is intended to turn sentiment against Ukraine at a pivotal time, with the hope of reducing U.S. military assistance and ensuring a Russian victory.",
      "Recent examples include fake videos supposedly showing Ukrainian soldiers burning effigies of Trump or his supporters. One clip depicts soldiers saying Trump must not be allowed to take office and should \"never be president again.\u201d Multiple researchers have debunked the video, noting telltale signs of digital manipulation.",
      "A different video claims to show Ukrainian soldiers firing at a mannequin wearing a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and a Trump campaign shirt. That video was analyzed and determined to be fake by private analysts and Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation, a government agency that tracks Kremlin propaganda.",
      "Other versions \u2014 just as fake \u2014 depict Ukrainian soldiers burning Trump's books or calling him a coward. In the weeks after the election, the clips spread far beyond Ukraine and Russia, circulating among Trump supporters and believers in QAnon, the conspiracy theory that claims Trump is fighting a war against a Satanic cabal of powerful world leaders.",
      "It's part of Russia's continued push to divide Americans over the nearly 3-year war in Ukraine and paint Ukrainians as unreliable, dishonest allies, according to analysts who have tracked Russian disinformation and propaganda since the war began. By discouraging American support for Ukraine, the Kremlin is hoping to cut off the most vital source of military assistance that has kept Ukrainian hopes alive since Russia invaded in February 2022.",
      "Early in the war, Russian propagandists portrayed Ukrainian leaders as corrupt and self-serving. Russian state media claimed Ukraine\u2019s leaders held Nazi sympathies \u2014 even though President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish \u2014 or were involved in clandestine bioweapons research that Moscow sought to tie to the COVID-19 pandemic. Each false claim was used to justify Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s planted by the Russians, this idea that \u2018Ukraine is so corrupt it shouldn\u2019t even be a state, and we are the right people to be running this place,\u2019\u201d said Rupert Smith, a retired British general and former NATO deputy supreme commander who now leads a Brussels-based consulting firm called Solvo Partners. \"Now this is being used as an excuse for not supporting Ukraine.\u201d",
      "The fake video claiming to show Ukrainian soldiers firing on the Trump mannequin spread on platforms such as X, Telegram and YouTube, getting an early boost from pro-Kremlin news sites before migrating to ones popular with Americans, according to an analysis by researchers at NewsGuard, a firm that tracks disinformation.",
      "Some versions of the video were created long before the election but were passed off as more recent. Within days, the video was receiving hundreds of thousands of views and had been translated into several languages besides Russian and English, including German, Chinese and Polish, NewsGuard found.",
      "According to U.S. intelligence, Russia sought to support Trump in the presidential election, believing he would reduce American backing for Ukraine and perhaps the NATO alliance. The incoming president has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, criticized U.S. military aid to Ukraine and NATO and promised to end the war in 24 hours, comments that appear to suggest he would press Ukraine to surrender territory now occupied by Russia.",
      "In response to questions about Russia\u2019s role in spreading disinformation about Ukraine, a spokesperson for the Russian Embassy in Washington referred to past statements rejecting any involvement.",
      "In the time it has left, the Biden administration has urged Ukraine to quickly increase the size of its military by drafting more troops and has stepped upweapons shipments while forgiving billions in loans provided to Kyiv. So far, the White House has pushed more than $56 billion in security assistance to Ukraine and expects to send billions more before Biden leaves office on Jan. 20, 2025.",
      "It\u2019s easy to understand Russia\u2019s motives in trying to cut off that supply of aid, said Joshua Tucker, a New York University professor and Russia expert who studies online disinformation. What\u2019s harder to gauge, he said, is the effectiveness of Russian disinformation, especially on social media platforms already crowded with false, bizarre and debunked claims.",
      "One reason that Russia may persist with disinformation targeting Americans is the relative ease and affordability of such operations compared with diplomatic or military alternatives.",
      "Russia likely sees disinformation as part of a long-term effort to undermine America's global leadership by dividing its people and undermining support for its institutions, Tucker said. Whether the topic is immigration, the government, the U.S. economy or the war in Ukraine, he said, the goal remains the same and goes beyond one election cycle or one candidate.",
      "\u201cI think what they were really hoping for is a contested result with lots of people out in the streets, arguing the election wasn\u2019t legitimate,\u201d Tucker said.",
      "If they couldn't have that, however, Russia's disinformation agencies will keep pushing narratives that they believe will inflame Americans and boost their chances in Ukraine, Tucker said."

      "NEW YORK -- Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said Wednesday he is \u201coptimistic\u201d about President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second term and expressed some excitement about potential regulatory cutbacks in the coming years.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m actually very optimistic this time around,\u201d Bezos said on stage during a wide-ranging interview at The New York Times\u2019 DealBook Summit in New York. \u201cHe seems to have a lot of energy around reducing regulation. If I can help do that, I\u2019m going to help him.\"",
      "\u201cWe do have too many regulations in this country,\u201d Bezos added.",
      "The comments follow Bezos' October decision to prohibit The Washington Post, which he owns, from endorsing a presidential candidate, a move that led to tens of thousands of people canceling their subscriptions and protests from journalists with a deep history at the newspaper.",
      "At the time, Bezos wrote in an op-ed in the newspaper saying editorial endorsements create a perception of bias at a time when many Americans don\u2019t believe the media, and do nothing to tip the scales of an election.",
      "On Wednesday, he said he would try to talk Trump \"out of the idea\u201d that the press is the enemy.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve probably grown in the last eight years,\u201d he said to journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin. \u201cHe has, too. This is not the case. The press is not the enemy.\u201d",
      "Trump had railed against Bezos and his companies, including Amazon and The Washington Post, during his first term. In 2019, Amazon argued in a court case that Trump\u2019s bias against the company harmed its chances of winning a $10 billion Pentagon contract. The Biden administration later pursued a contract with both Amazon and Microsoft.",
      "In another part of the interview, Bezos said he doesn't expect Elon Musk, who has been tasked with cutting regulations in the upcoming Trump term, to use his power to hurt his business competitors. Bezos owns Blue Origin, a rival to Musk's SpaceX."

      "Waymo is gearing up to bring its robotaxi service to Miami which will accelerate an expansion that's been happening while its hobbled rivals remain in its rearview mirror.",
      "As part of the road map unfurled Thursday, Waymo plans to begin testing its driverless Jaguars in Miami next year, giving the robotaxis time to learn their way around Florida's biggest city before they start charging for rides in 2026. The move comes less than a month after Waymo opened up its robotaxi service to anyone looking for a ride in an 80-square-mile (129-square-kilometer) expanse in Los Angeles, extending its reach beyond its two major markets in Phoenix and San Francisco.",
      "Waymo also has plans to launch fleets in Atlanta and Austin next year as part of a partnership with the ride-hailing leader Uber.",
      "The growth spurred Waymo to team up with fleet management service Moove to oversee maintenance of its robotaxis in Phoenix, where it now operates about 200 vehicles. Moove also will help manage the company's robotaxis in Miami.",
      "The steady expansion into new markets is starting to fulfill what once seemed like a fantastical dream when Google began a secret self-driving car project dubbed \"Chauffeur\u201d in 2009 that ultimately spun off as Waymo in 2016.",
      "Although Waymo is still piling up substantial losses under its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., the service now provides more than 150,000 weekly trips without any history of catastrophic traffic accidents. That track record has increased confidence that Waymo will be able to continue to steer its robotaxis into more markets and eventually produce a steady stream of profits \u2014 an expectation that helped it recently raise $5.6 billion from Alphabet and a list of other major investors.",
      "Meanwhile, robotaxi rival Cruise is still trying to recover from a grisly accident last year that culminated in one of its driverless cars in San Francisco dragging a jaywalking pedestrian who had been struck by a different car driven by a human. California regulators suspended Cruise's license in the aftermath and its once-ambitious expansion plans have been scaled back by its corporate parent, automaker General Motors.",
      "Having periodically promised a fleet of Tesla robotaxis for nearly a decade, Tesla CEO Elon Musk renewed the pledge again in October when he predicted the electric carmaker's \"Cybercabs\" will be on U.S. roads in 2026."

      "Bitcoin burst on the scene after trust had withered in the financial system and Washington\u2019s ability to protect people from it",
      "NEW YORK -- Born from the ashes of the 2008 global financial crisis, bitcoin arrived after trust had withered in the financial system and in Washington's ability to protect those who must participate in it. Now, it's Washington's very embrace of bitcoin that's helping to send its price to records and lining the pockets of its believers.",
      "Bitcoin briefly surged above $103,000 after President-elect Donald Trump said he intends to nominate Paul Atkins, a former regulator who's seen as friendly to crypto, as the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He would replace Gary Gensler, who critics say has been overly aggressive in his oversight of crypto.",
      "It's the latest leg in an astonishing run for bitcoin, whose swings in price are already notoriously extreme.",
      "Bitcoin has more than doubled this year, with a particularly big jump coming after Election Day, when its price was sitting below $70,000. During his campaign, Trump called for making the United States \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet.\"",
      "The crypto industry, meanwhile, did its part to bring politicians friendly to digital currencies into Washington. Crypto corporations poured over $119 million into influencing federal elections in 2024, primarily into a political action committee dedicated to electing pro-crypto candidates and defeating crypto skeptics, according to a recent review by Public Citizen.",
      "It's a large amount. Crypto companies accounted for 44% of all the corporate money contributed during this year\u2019s elections, according to the consumer advocacy organization.",
      "Such a tight embrace marks an interesting twist from bitcoin's early days, when someone or a group of someones under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto created a kind of electronic cash that wouldn't be beholden to any government or financial institution.",
      "In the white paper announcing bitcoin, Namakoto said the traditional way of doing business on the internet \u201cworks well enough for most transactions.\u201d But, Nakamoto said, it \u201cstill suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model,\u201d where a third party like a bank needs to process payments.",
      "Instead, Nakamoto suggested harnessing computing power around the world as a way to create a digital currency that can\u2019t be double-spent. \u201cWhat is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.\u201d That is what became the bitcoin network.",
      "Since then, bitcoin has moved from the financial fringes toward the mainstream, in jagged fits and starts. While it hasn't taken off as a way to pay for groceries, it found popularity as a kind of \u201cdigital gold,\u201d or a way to store value in something that's not subject to the direct influence of a federal government or a central bank.",
      "In its early days, it had a reputation for use by drug dealers, scammers, crypto enthusiasts, libertarians and others who were looking to move money without oversight by the government. Now, it's also found its way into more investor portfolios. Earlier this year, the SEC approved exchange-traded funds that track the spot price of bitcoin. Such ETFs give investors a relatively easy way to buy bitcoin directly in their existing trading accounts.",
      "Through its life, bitcoin has soared through a series of manic bull runs as well as \u201ccrypto winters\u201d that brought extreme declines. It went from just over $5,000 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to nearly $69,000 by late 2021, before crashing below $17,000 following hikes to interest rates by the Federal Reserve and the 2022 collapse of crypto exchange FTX.",
      "With bitcoin in its latest bull run, the man who's about to roll into the White House seemed to take at least some credit.",
      "\u201cCONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!!\u201d Trump said in a post on his Truth Social network. \u201c$100,000!!! YOU\u2019RE WELCOME!!!\u201d"

      "\u201cOur city lost one of its champions,\u201d Vaughan said. A cause of death wasn\u2019t provided, but Vaughan had said Tuesday that Johnson was absent from the council meeting that evening because of illness, the News & Record of Greensboro reported.",
      "Johnson spent nearly 30 years on the council -- first from 1993 to 2009, of which the last two years she served as mayor following a 2007 election victory. She lost her mayoral reelection bid in 2009 but returned to the council in 2011, serving until her death.",

      "Johnson was long involved in civil rights. She recalled in a 2023 interview with a publication of the North Carolina League of Municipalities about taking part in the 1963 March on Washington and in the sit-in movement while a student at Bennett College in Greensboro.",

      "Hiring in the United States likely rebounded last month from a dismal October, when hurricanes and strikes reduced job growth to its lowest level in nearly four years",
      "WASHINGTON -- Hiring in the United States likely rebounded last month from a dismal October, when hurricanes and strikes reduced job growth to its lowest level in nearly four years.",
      "Friday's jobs report from the Labor Department is expected to show that employers added roughly 208,000 jobs in November, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet. That would mark a sharp bounce-back from October\u2019s gain of just 12,000 jobs, the fewest in any month since December 2020.",
      "The job market has cooled from the dizzying heights of 2021-2023, when the economy was delivering a robust recovery from the pandemic recession of 2020 and many employers were hiring aggressively. Still, October\u2019s slump was exaggerated by the temporary effects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton and by strikes at Boeing and elsewhere.",
      "Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, has estimated that the hurricanes reduced hiring in October by 75,000 but that by November, 60,000 of those workers were back on payrolls. Likewise, the end of strikes at Boeing and Textron Aviation is thought to have increased payrolls last month by up to 38,000 jobs.",
      "Overall, Vanden Houten wrote in a commentary, the November jobs report will probably show that hiring remains \u201crelatively strong.\u2019\u2019",
      "The unemployment rate is thought to have remained at a low 4.1% in November, a sign that Americans as a whole are enjoying unusual job security. This week, the government reported that layoffs fell to just 1.6 million in October, below the lowest levels in the two decades that preceded the pandemic. At the same time, the number of job openings rebounded from a 3 1/2 year low, a sign that businesses are still seeking workers even though hiring has cooled.",
      "The American economy, the world\u2019s largest, has demonstrated its resilience under the continued pressure of high interest rates. To fight the worst bout of inflation in four decades, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. The much higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses that resulted were expected to tip the economy into a recession. Instead, it kept growing as consumers continued to spend and employers continued to hire.",
      "The economy grew at a 2.8% annual pace from July through September on healthy spending by consumers. Annual economic growth has topped a decent 2% in eight of the past nine quarters. And inflation has dropped from a 9.1% peak in June 2022 to 2.6% last month. Even so, Americans were deeply frustrated by still-high prices under the Biden-Harris administration, and partly for that reason chose last month to return Donald Trump to the White House.",
      "As the job market has slowed this year, employers have added an average of 170,000 jobs a month. That is a solid figure, though down significantly from an average of 251,000 last year, 377,000 in 2022 and a record 604,000 in 2021, when the economy was roaring out of the COVID recession.",
      "Diane Swonk, chief economist at the tax and consulting firm KPMG, cautions that the job market \u201ccould be weaker than it appears.\u2019\u2019 So far this year, the Labor Department has revised down its initial estimate of job growth for each of seven months, Oxford\u2019s Vanden Houten noted.",
      "And while comparatively few Americans are losing jobs, those who do are finding it harder to land a new one: The average unemployed American in October had been out of work for 22.9 weeks, the longest such stretch in 2 1/2 years.",
      "The progress against inflation and the slowdown in hiring, which eases pressure on companies to raise wages and prices, led the Fed to cut its key rate in September and again last month. Another rate cut is expected to be announced when the Fed meets Dec. 17-18.",
      "Forecasters have estimated that average hourly wages rose 3.9% last month from a year earlier. Vanden Houten said she thinks year-over-year wage gains of 3.5% to 4% are consistent with the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation target."

      "NEW YORK -- As the investigation into a masked gunman who stalked and killed the head of one of the largest U.S. health insurers moved into its third day Friday, possible leads emerged about his travel before the shooting and a message scrawled on ammunition found at the crime scene.",
      "UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was killed in a dawn ambush Wednesday as he walked from his midtown hotel to the company\u2019s annual investor conference across the street, blocks from tourist draws such as Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center.",
      "But days later, the gunman was still at large and the reason for the killing remained unknown, with New York City police saying evidence firmly points to it being a targeted attack.",
      "Investigators worked to piece together more of the timeline of the gunman\u2019s whereabouts before the shooting, examine security camera footage and even test a discarded water bottle and protein bar wrapper in a hunt for his DNA.",
      "The words \u201cdeny,\u201d \u201cdefend\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were found emblazoned on the ammunition, echoing a phrase used by insurance industry critics, two law enforcement officials said Thursday, speaking to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation.",
      "The messages mimic the phrase \u201cdelay, deny, defend,\u201d which is commonly used by lawyers and insurance industry critics to describe tactics used to avoid paying claims. It refers to insurers delaying payment, denying a claim and then defending their actions. Health insurers like UnitedHealthcare have become frequent targets of criticism from doctors and patients for denying claims or complicating access to care.",
      "Investigators also now believe the suspect may have traveled to New York last month on a bus that originated in Atlanta, one of the law enforcement officials said.",
      "Police and federal agents have been collecting information from Greyhound in an attempt to identify the suspect and are working to determine whether he purchased the ticket to New York in late November, the official said.",
      "Investigators were also trying to obtain additional information from a cellphone recovered from a pedestrian plaza through which the shooter fled.",
      "A tip that the shooter may have stayed at a hostel brought police Thursday morning to at least two such establishments on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side, according to one of the law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation. The photos made public Thursday were taken in the lobby of the HI New York City hostel.",
      "\u201cWe are fully cooperating with the NYPD and, as this is an active investigation, can not comment at this time,\u201d hostel spokesperson Danielle Brumfitt said in an emailed statement.",
      "Police released new photos Thursday of a person wanted for questioning in connection with Thompson\u2019s killing.",
      "The images, showing an unmasked man smiling in the lobby of a Manhattan hostel, add to a collection of photos and video that have circulated since the shooting \u2014 including footage of the attack itself, as well as still frames of the suspected gunman stopping at a Starbucks beforehand.",
      "Investigators believe the suspect used a fake New Jersey identification card when he checked in at the hostel, said one of the officials who spoke with the AP.",
      "Employees who work at the hostel told investigators they remembered a man who almost always wore a mask when interacting with them or passing by the front desk. That person wore a jacket that looked like the one worn by the man pictured in surveillance images released after the shooting, the official said.",
      "After the shooting, police said the gunman fled on a bicycle and was last seen riding into Central Park.",
      "Based on surveillance video and evidence from the scene, investigators believe the shooter had at least some firearms training and experience with guns and that the weapon was equipped with a silencer, one of the law enforcement officials told the AP.",
      "Investigators were also looking into whether the suspect had pre-positioned a bike as part of an escape plan, the official said.",
      "Security video shows the killer approaching Thompson from behind, leveling his pistol and firing several shots, barely pausing to clear a gun jam while the executive tumbled to the sidewalk. Cameras showed him fleeing the block across a pedestrian plaza before getting on the bicycle.",
      "Police released several images of the man wearing a hooded jacket and a mask that concealed most of his face \u2014 a look that would not have attracted attention on a chilly morning.",
      "Thompson, a father of two sons who lived in a Minneapolis suburb, had been with Minnetonka, Minnesota-based UnitedHealthcare since 2004 and served as CEO for more than three years.",
      "His wife, Paulette, told NBC News on Wednesday that he told her \u201cthere were some people that had been threatening him.\u201d She didn\u2019t have details but suggested the threats may have involved issues with insurance coverage.",
      "The insurer\u2019s parent company, UnitedHealth Group Inc., was holding its annual meeting in New York to update investors on its direction and expectations for the coming year. The company ended the conference after Thompson\u2019s death.",
      "UnitedHealthcare provides coverage for more than 49 million Americans and brought in more than $281 billion in revenue last year. It is the largest provider of Medicare Advantage plans in the U.S. and manages health insurance coverage for employers and state and federally funded Medicaid programs.",

      "CCTV footage appears to show the gunman had fitted a suppressor, also known as a silencer, to his pistol, BBC Verify has established.",
      "New York City Mayor Eric Adams - a veteran of the NYPD - told MSNBC that the use of a silencer was unprecedented in his career.",

      "The words \"deny,\" \"defend\" and \"depose\" were discovered on the casings, two law enforcement sources told CBS.",

      "The value of the world's biggest cryptocurrency has been boosted by hopes US President-elect Donald Trump will adopt crypto-friendly policies.",
      "The milestone was reached hours after Trump said he would nominate former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Paul Atkins to run the Wall Street regulator.",
      "Mr Atkins is seen as being far more pro-cryptocurrency than the current head of the SEC, Gary Gensler.",
      "The $100,000 milestone prompted celebrations from cryptocurrency fans around the world.",
      "Bitcoin's wildly fluctuating value has always attracted interest, with its backers reacting with delight when it has passed previous price thresholds - and defiance during its slumps.",
      "But this particular landmark has been especially keenly anticipated. For weeks charts, memes and predictions have swirled around social media about when the price would hit the figure thought to be one of the holy grails of the crypto world.",
      "Millions of viewers even tuned in to online watch parties as the price hovered close to $100k.",
      "The value of a single bitcoin is one of the barometers of optimism in the cryptocurrency industry which is now estimated to be worth $3.3tn, according to analysis firm Coin Market Cap.",
      "Trump's election victory last month was the catalyst for the latest surge.",
      "The president-elect has vowed to make the US \"the crypto capital of the planet\" - a remarkable turnaround given as recently as 2021 he was calling Bitcoin a \"scam.\"",
      "Also remarkable is just how Bitcoin's price has rocketed. A valuation of $100k represents a 40% increase on election day in the U.S. and more than double the price it started the year at.",
      "But there's lots more to Bitcoin than the dizzying changes in its value.",
      "From its enigmatic inventor to the bringing down of the so-called Crypto King, it's a story with many twists and turns, which has seen the making - and losing - of huge fortunes.",
      "So here's the BBC's list of the seven wildest moments - so far - in Bitcoin's tumultuous history.",
      "1. The mysterious creator of Bitcoin",
      "Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto.",
      "They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email.",
      "Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers.",
      "But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out.",
      "In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be a false lead caused by some mistranslated information.",
      "Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi.",
      "Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him.",
      "2. Making history... with pizza",
      "Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza.",
      "On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas.",
      "A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day.",
      "A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online.",
      "Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin.",
      "The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars!",
      "3. Becoming legal tender",
      "In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender.",
      "Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar.",
      "Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country.",
      "While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped.",
      "He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country.",
      "As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years.",
      "The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country.",
      "It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value.",
      "A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value.",
      "4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust",
      "In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions.",
      "These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part.",
      "Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves.",
      "At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment.",
      "But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts.",
      "Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth.",
      "Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact.",
      "5. Bitcoins in the rubbish dump",
      "Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (\u00a378m) - and then  accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details.",
      "That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him",
      "The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline.",
      "Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling.\"",
      "6. Crypto King fraudster",
      "No-one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community.",
      "FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days.",
      "Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research.",
      "Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: \"I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.\"",
      "After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years.",
      "7. Investment bank boom",
      "Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies.",
      "In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any.",
      "Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs.",
      "It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined.",
      "Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold."

    "title": "Five things we learned from the Scottish Budget",
    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 18:52:29 GMT",
    "summary": "Scrapping the two-child cap and changes to tax thresholds are among plans for the next financial year.",
    "story": [
      "A vow to scrap the two-child benefit cap and changes to basic and intermediate tax thresholds are among the plans for the Scottish government for the next financial year.",
      "The announcements were made by Finance Secretary Shona Robison as she revealed her tax and spending plans for 2025/26.",
      "Other talking points included an extra \u00a32bn for the NHS and a \u00a3768m investment in affordable homes.",
      "Here are five key takeaways from this year's Scottish Budget.",
      "1. Two-child benefits cap",
      "The biggest announcement in the budget actually isn\u2019t part of the tax or spending plans for next year.",
      "It was Shona Robison\u2019s \u201crabbit out of the hat\u201d moment of announcing that the Scottish government would move to scrap - or offset, or mitigate - the two-child benefits cap.",
      "That\u2019s a UK-wide policy, imposed by the Department of Work and Pensions on welfare payments such as universal credit and child tax credits - so it will take some time, and will need some help from the UK government.",
      "It\u2019s not yet clear what the mechanism will be, how it will work, or how much it will cost.",
      "The Scottish Fiscal Commission says it was only sent the proposal last week, and that it hasn\u2019t had time to cost it; they call it a \u201cfiscal risk\u201d.",
      "But be in no doubt that this is a big challenge to Labour.",
      "It comes days after an announcement on the winter fuel payment also designed to outflank Anas Sarwar\u2019s party and embarrass the UK administration.",
      "If all goes to plan then the SNP government will start sending out payments to families of the 15,000 children affected in April 2026. One month before the next Holyrood election.",
      "Labour says it's willing to listen to ideas, but points out that there is not a penny in the coming year\u2019s budget to support it.",
      "They will surely need to come up with a more substantial response before that election comes much closer.",
      "2. Taxes",
      "There were no big changes to the devolved income tax system in this budget.",
      "There was some tinkering with thresholds, which will have a political impact if not a big financial one.",
      "Robison is increasing the thresholds for the basic and intermediate rates - two of the lower rungs in Scotland\u2019s six-band ladder of taxes.",
      "Because Chancellor Rachel Reeves has frozen those thresholds in the rest of the UK, it means Scots earning less than \u00a330,300 will pay less tax than if they lived in England or Wales.",
      "The difference is less than \u00a330 a year, but it allows Robison to say that 51% of Scottish taxpayers pay less.",
      "One bill that will almost certainly be going up is council tax. But with last year\u2019s one-off freeze on local rates coming to an end, it will be down to your local representatives to decide.",
      "Rather than wielding a stick by imposing any sort of cap, Robison instead sought to guilt local authorities into holding down increases, saying that \u201cwith record funding there is no reason for big increases in council tax next year\u201d.",
      "She says there\u2019s an extra \u00a31bn for local government - but it remains to be seen how much of that councillors will be free to allocate, and how much will fall into ring-fenced areas.",
      "Every year the government says it has increased funding for councils, then councils hit back that it\u2019s not enough, and there\u2019s a row over exactly how much money is enough money.",
      "We will no doubt go around in circles on that until budgets at a local and national level are finalised next year.",
      "3. Spending priorities",
      "The budget totalled more than \u00a363bn, and previously ubiquitous talk of tough decisions and austerity was notably absent. There was a positive tone - like Robison suddenly had some cash to splash on the government\u2019s favourite policies.",
      "John Swinney has made the eradication of child poverty as his top priority, and as ever there is cash in the budget for the flagship Scottish Child Payment.",
      "The cash to mitigate the two-child cap doesn\u2019t feature in this budget - only some money to set up that system, whatever it turns out to look like.",
      "In total, spending on social security is up by \u00a3800m - highlighting a key feature of devolved government, in the SNP\u2019s appetite for big state interventions and welfare safety nets.",
      "You can include in that last week\u2019s announcement about winter fuel payments, which are being partially reinstated from next year.",
      "This week Mr Swinney has also (unsurprisingly) earmarked the NHS as a core priority, and as expected it has a record funding settlement - \u00a321bn, or a third of the total budget.",
      "That includes almost \u00a3200m to cut waiting times and cash for local hospital projects in Edinburgh, Fort William and Airdrie.",
      "There were also billions of pounds for net zero and climate policies - including money from the ScotWind fund, a pot of cash raised by auctioning off plots of the seabed for offshore wind, which Robison had previously feared she might need to use for day-to-day funding.",
      "And there is \u00a3768m for affordable housing, which chiefly goes to reverse a cut made under Humza Yousaf\u2019s administration last year, but does ultimately leave spending higher and will apparently create 8,000 new homes in the coming year.",
      "4. Growing the economy",
      "A big focus of governments across the UK has been economic growth. Rachel Reeves has put it at the core of everything she is doing as chancellor, as Robison said a thriving economy was \u201can essential requirement\u201d.",
      "The finance secretary had been challenged to match the chancellor\u2019s support for firms in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors - a 40% relief on business rates.",
      "Scotland has a slightly different system of \u201cnon-domestic rates\u201d, but ultimately Robison said there would be a similar 40% relief for the vast majority of hospitality premises.",
      "Retail and leisure were notably absent (although there is some support for music venues), and we will see how far this shakes out in terms of who does and doesn\u2019t qualify for funding.",
      "The Scottish Hospitality Group has said it is a \u201csignificantly more restricted\u201d offer than that down south, calling it a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d.",
      "A motif of Ms Robison\u2019s speech was name-checking her cabinet colleagues as she spoke to each of their portfolio areas.",
      "That felt particularly notable in the case of Kate Forbes - an influential figure as the woman John Swinney brought into government in part to mend fences with business.",
      "She has highlighted more money for town centre regeneration as well as a tripling of investment in the offshore wind supply chain, which it is said will leverage ten times that figure in private investment.",
      "This approach of public cash opening the door to huge flows of private funds is a favourite tactic of Ms Reeves - and indeed is the core purpose of GB Energy.",
      "That UK energy firm is set to have some company when it sets up in Aberdeen, with Ms Robison pledging to establish a hub or offshore wind in the North East.",
      "5. Politics",
      "The SNP does not have a majority in the Scottish Parliament, and thus needs the help of other parties to pass a budget.",
      "John Swinney has talked about wanting to reach out to opponents and run a collaborative administration.",
      "But there is no chance of a deal with the Conservatives, who want a billion pounds of tax cuts, or Labour, who really just want an election.",
      "That leaves the Greens and the Lib Dems as the most likely dance partners.",
      "Robison quite deliberately nodded to the key asks of both parties. There was funding for ferries, mental health and dentistry for the Lib Dems. The Greens demanded \u00a34.7bn for green policies - and she pledged \u00a34.9bn.",
      "The Greens welcomed some of the measures, but said \u201csignificant further changes\u201d were needed. They are particularly suspicious of the sums on offer for councils.",
      "The Lib Dems welcomed even more of Robison\u2019s announcements, with leader Alex Cole-Hamilton reeling off a whole series of measures where he said it was right the government had listened to him.",
      "The draft budget is really the starting point for talks, which won\u2019t come to a head until the first votes at Holyrood in February.",
      "But the fevered talk of snap elections which followed the collapse of the Bute House Agreement has faded. A deal with someone still feels the most likely outcome.",

      "But some have criticised the plans, arguing that public ownership will not make much difference unless it is paired with fresh investment in the railways.",
      "What does nationalise mean?",
      "The move is part of Labour's wider plans to renationalise rail services as operators' contracts either end or reach a break.",
      "Under the existing system, Britain's railway lines are run by train operating companies as franchises for a fixed length of time.",

      "Sweden has a global reputation for championing gender equality, so why are young women embracing a social media trend that celebrates quitting work?",
      "Vilma Larsson, 25, previously had jobs in a grocery store, a care home and a factory. But she quit work a year ago to become a stay-at-home-girlfriend, and says she\u2019s never been happier.",
      "\u201cMy life is softer. I am not struggling. I am not very stressed.\u201d",
      "Her boyfriend works remotely in finance, and while he spends his days on his laptop, she\u2019s at the gym, out for coffee, or cooking. The couple grew up in small towns in central Sweden, but now travel a lot, and are spending the winter in Cyprus.",
      "\u201cEvery month he gives me a salary from his money that he made. But if I need more, I'll ask him. Or if I need less, I don't - I just save the rest,\u201d explains Ms Larsson.",
      "She shares her lifestyle on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok, where she\u2019s amassed 11,000 followers. Some of her posts have had almost 400,000 likes, although she says she\u2019s not making an income from her content.",
      "She uses the hashtags \u201chemmaflickv\u00e4n\u201d and \u201chemmafru\u201d (Swedish for stay-at-home girlfriend and housewife) and describes herself as a \u201csoft girl\u201d \u2013 an identity that embraces a softer, more feminine way of living rather than focussing on a career.",
      "The soft girl lifestyle has been a microtrend on social media in different parts of the world since the late 2010s. But in Sweden \u2013 with five decades of policies designed to promote dual income households behind it \u2013 the concept\u2019s recent popularity has sparked both surprise and division.",
      "Ungdomsbarometern \u2013  Sweden\u2019s largest annual survey of young people \u2013 first put the national spotlight on Swedes embracing the soft girl trend a year ago, after it became a popular choice when 15 to 24-year-olds were asked to predict trends for 2024.",
      "Another study released by Ungdomsbaromatern this August suggested it was even becoming an aspiration among younger schoolgirls, with 14% of seven to 14-year-olds identifying as soft girls.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about leaning away from this \u2018girl boss\u2019 ideal that we've seen for a lot of years, where there are very, very high demands for success in every aspect of life,\u201d explains Johanna G\u00f6ransson, a researcher for Ungdomsbarometern.",
      "There is no official data on the number of young \u201csoft girls\u201d quitting work altogether and living off their partners like Ms Larsson, and Ms G\u00f6ransson says it is likely to be a small proportion.",
      "But it\u2019s nevertheless become a major talking point in Sweden, from opinion pieces in broadsheet newspapers, to panel discussions at Almedalen \u2013 a huge annual cross-party political event \u2013 and on Swedish public service television.",
      "Gudrun Schyman \u2013 the co-founder and former leader of Sweden\u2019s feminist party Feministiskt initiativ - says she\u2019s taken part in recent debates on the issue. She believes women living off their partners wealth is \u201cvery dangerous\u201d, and \u201ca step backwards\u201d for gender equality.",
      "Ms Schyman argues that young Swedes have been influenced by the country\u2019s right-wing coalition government, which collaborates with the nationalist Sweden Democrats party, as well as the \u201cbroader development\u201d of populism in Europe and the United States.",
      "She also thinks there\u2019s a lack of awareness about life in Sweden before it embraced policies designed to promote gender equality, such as heavily subsidised childcare and shared parental leave. \u201cYoung women today don't carry the history of how women had to fight for their rights - the right to work, the right to have a salary, and the right to economic independence.\u201d",
      "At the other end of the political spectrum, the Sweden Democrats party has been positive towards the soft girls trend.",
      "\u201cI think that people should get to decide over their own life,\u201d says Denice Westerberg, national spokesperson for the party\u2019s youth wing. \u201cAnd if you have that economic possibility to do that [live off a partner] then good for you.",
      "\u201cWe still live in a country with all the opportunities to have a career. We still have all the rights, but we have the right to choose to live more traditionally.\u201d",
      "Aside from ideological debates, discussions have focussed on the social and cultural factors that could be influencing young women to quit work - or at least aspire to a softer lifestyle.",
      "Sweden has a reputation for work life balance - most employees get six-weeks holiday a year, and less than 1% work more than 50 hours a week.",
      "Still, Ungdomsbaromatern\u2019s research suggests rising stress levels amongst young people, and Ms G\u00f6ransson believes soft girls trend may be an extension of recent global work trends such as \u201cquiet quitting\u201d, which encourages employees not to overextend themselves.",
      "Meanwhile, the Generation Z age group (the cohort born between 1997 and 2012) are making, and being influenced by, social media content that celebrates leisure time rather than career goals.",
      "Business Daily: Sweden\u2019s #softgirls trend",
      "\u201cWork doesn't really feature that much if you look at lifestyle content on social media today, it's much more about exercise and wellness,\u201d explains Ms G\u00f6ransson. \u201cAnd if that's the picture young people have of what a normal life looks like, then, of course, maybe you're not so excited about spending eight hours in an office a day.\u201d",
      "But perhaps the biggest talking point is whether the trend is a response to the limitations of Sweden\u2019s pioneering gender equality policies.",
      "Alongside Slovenia, Sweden has the highest proportion of working mothers in Europe, yet government statistics suggest women in heterosexual couples still do a larger share of housework and childcare than men.",
      "They also take 70% of state-funded parental leave, and are more likely to go on sick leave for stress. Meanwhile, although the income gap between men and women remains lower than the EU average of 12.7%, it has stalled at around 10%  since 2019.",
      "Ms Larsson \u2013 who wants to have children in the future \u2013 says her decision to become a stay-at-home girlfriend is partly due to watching older women struggle to juggle a career and homelife.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of women feel burned out from their work,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I just think of my mother and her mother, my grandma, and my sister, everyone. They're always so stressed.\u201d",
      "At Sweden\u2019s state-funded Gender Equality Agency, Peter Wickstr\u00f6m, head of the department for policy analysis and monitoring, also believes the soft girl trend can be viewed as a \u201crational reaction\u201d to the perceived \u201cdemands\u201d experienced by young women.",
      "Shoka \u00c5hrman, an economist at one of Sweden\u2019s largest pension funds, SPP, says she does not believe enough Swedish girlfriends or wives will quit work for it to have an impact on the country\u2019s economy.",

      "Many premium products claim to accurately track exercise routines, body temperature, heart rate, menstrual cycle and sleep patterns, among others.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting has talked about a proposal to give wearables to millions of NHS patients in England, enabling them to track symptoms such as reactions to cancer treatments, from home.",
      "But many doctors \u2013 and tech experts \u2013 remain cautious about using health data captured by wearables.",
      "I\u2019m currently trying out a smart ring from the firm Ultrahuman \u2013 and it seemed to know that I was getting sick before I did.",
      "It alerted me one weekend that my temperature was slightly elevated, and my sleep had been restless. It warned me that this could be a sign I was coming down with something.",
      "I tutted something about the symptoms of perimenopause and ignored it - but two days later I was laid up in bed with gastric flu.",
      "I didn\u2019t need medical assistance, but if I had \u2013 would the data from my wearable have helped healthcare professionals with my treatment? Many wearable brands actively encourage this.",
      "The Oura smart ring, for example, offers a service where patients can download their data in the form of a report to share with their doctor.",
      "Dr Jake Deutsch, a US-based clinician who also advises Oura, says wearable data enables him to \u201cassess overall health more precisely\u201d \u2013 but not all doctors agree that it\u2019s genuinely useful all of the time.",
      "Dr Helen Salisbury is a GP at a busy practice in Oxford. She says not many patients come in brandishing their wearables, but she\u2019s noticed it has increased, and it concerns her.",
      "\u201cI think for the number of times when it\u2019s useful there\u2019s probably more times that it\u2019s not terribly useful, and I worry that we are building a society of hypochondria and over-monitoring of our bodies,\u201d she says.",
      "Dr Salisbury says there can be a large number of reasons why we might temporarily get abnormal data such as an increased heart rate, whether it\u2019s a blip in our bodies or a device malfunction - and many of them do not require further investigation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we will be encouraging people to monitor everything all the time, and see their doctor every time the machine thinks they\u2019re ill, rather than when they think they\u2019re ill.\u201d",
      "And she makes a further point about the psychological use of this data as a kind of insurance policy against shock health diagnoses. A nasty cancerous tumour for example, is not necessarily going to be flagged by a watch or an app, she says.",
      "What wearables do is encourage good habits - but the best message you can take from them is the same advice doctors have been giving us for years. Dr Salisbury adds: \u201cThe thing you can actually do is walk more, don\u2019t drink too much alcohol, try and maintain a healthy weight. That never changes.\u201d",
      "The Apple Watch is reported to be the world\u2019s best-selling smart watch, although sales have slowed lately.",
      "Apple didn't comment, but the tech giant uses true stories of people whose lives have been saved because of the heart tracking function of the device in its marketing, and anecdotally I have heard plenty of those too. What I haven\u2019t heard however, is how many cases of false positives there are.",
      "In many cases when patients present their data to healthcare professionals, clinicians prefer to try to recreate it using their own equipment, rather than simply trust what the wearable has captured.",
      "There are several reasons for this, says Dr Yang Wei, associate professor in wearable technologies at Nottingham Trent University  \u2013 and they\u2019re all very practical.",
      "\u201cWhen you go to hospital, and you measure your ECG [electrocardiogram, a test that checks the activity of your heart], you don\u2019t worry about power consumption because the machine is plugged into the wall,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cOn your watch, you\u2019re not going to measure your ECG continuously because you drain your battery straight away.\u201d",
      "In addition, movement \u2013 both of the wearable itself on a wrist, for example, and general movement of the person wearing it - can \u201ccreate noise\u201d in the data it collects, he adds, making it less reliable.",
      "Dr Wei points to the ring on my finger.",
      "\u201cThe gold standard to measure the heart rate is from the wrist or direct from the heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you measure from the finger, you\u2019re sacrificing accuracy.\"",
      "It is the role of software to fill in such data gaps, he says - but there\u2019s no international standard for wearables here - for either the sensors and software that power wearable devices, or for the data itself, and even what format it is gathered in.",
      "The more consistently a device is worn, the more accurate its data is likely to be. But here\u2019s a cautionary tale.",
      "Ben Wood was out for the day when his wife received a series of alarming notifications from his Apple Watch, telling her he had been in a car crash. It advised her to text him rather than call because he may need to keep the line clear for the emergency services.",
      "The alerts were genuine, and sent to her as his emergency contact \u2013 but in this case unnecessary. Ben was out at a race track driving some fast cars. He admitted that he \u201cwasn\u2019t very gifted\u201d at it \u2013 but said he felt safe at all times.",
      "\u201cThe boundaries between incident and alert need to be managed carefully,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see how device-makers, emergency services, first responders and individuals think about this technology in the future.\u201d",
      "Pritesh Mistry, digital technologies fellow at the Kings Fund, agrees that there are significant challenges around folding current patient-generated data into our healthcare systems, and adds that the discussion has already been going on for several years in the UK without any clear resolution.",

    "story": [
      "Yasmin - not her real name - came from Iran to study for a master\u2019s degree at a new university in the UK, but she was \"shocked\" to find many of her fellow students had limited English, and only one or two were British.",
      "\"How is it possible to continue this coursework without understanding a British accent or English properly?\" she tells BBC File on 4.",
      "Most students paid other people to do their coursework, she explains, and some would pay people to register their attendance at lectures for them.",
      "Yasmin's experience reflects a growing concern. The University and College Union (UCU) says some institutions are overlooking language skills to receive high fees from overseas students, and one professor tells us 70% of his recent master\u2019s students had inadequate English.",

      "Jo Grady from the UCU, which represents 120,000 lecturers and university staff, says it is an open secret that students who lack English skills find ways to come to the UK to study.",

      "About seven out of 10 students studying on master\u2019s courses in England are now from overseas, far higher than on other types of higher education course, says Rose Stephenson from the Higher Education Policy Institute, an independent think tank.",
      "In England, university tuition fees for undergraduate domestic students are capped at \u00a39,250, rising to \u00a39,535 per year in 2025-26. Each of the other UK nations set their own fees. But fees for overseas students studying in England have no upper limit.",

      "\"You can charge a foreign student as much as they're willing to pay,\" says Ms Stephenson.",
      "Post-graduate fees are not capped either, so a master\u2019s degree at an elite university could cost \u00a350,000.",
      "Because undergraduate tuition fees for domestic students in England have not kept up with inflation, there has been a real-terms cut in university funding, says Ms Stephenson - with international students, in effect, subsidising the below-cost fees of home students.",
      "One whistleblower who worked at an education provider that prepares international students for university, told us agents would target families abroad who had the money to pay.",
      "The whistleblower - who has previously also spoken to the Sunday Times - said: \"We knew that those universities are increasingly desperate and would go along with our plans without much scrutiny into how those students were being found.",
      "\"No independent party is looking at the grades or the examinations. It's the Wild West, in a way.\"",
      "The whistleblower worked for Study Group, one of dozens of providers feeding the UK university system, and taking fees from students in the process.",
      "Based in the UK, Study Group is a registered provider which says it works for more than 50 universities with a network of 3,500 agents in 99 countries.",
      "Study Group strongly disputes the whistleblower's claims, saying overseas students earn their places on merit. It adds that any decision to admit a student on to a course is taken by the university, not Study Group, and rejects the claim that entry criteria are waived for any reason.",
      "It says courses it runs are robustly \"scrutinised by partner universities\".",
      "Yasmin paid \u00a316,000 for her course in international finance at a university in southern England. She later found out that of the 100 students on most of her modules, \"maybe 80 or 90 of them bought assignments\" from so-called \"essay mills\" based overseas. In England it is a criminal offence to complete work for a student which they can pass off as their own.",
      "When Yasmin told her tutor what was happening, he took no action. Yasmin says she now feels her master\u2019s degree has been \"devalued\".",
      "A Russell Group university professor, who has taught at several universities and wants to remain anonymous, echoes Yasmin's concerns. He tells File on 4 that 70% of his students at master\u2019s degree level over the past five years did not have sufficient English language skills to be on the course.",
      "\"There have certainly been occasions when very simple questions have not been able to be understood by students who I am teaching,\" he says.",
      "The professor told us he has had to adapt his teaching technique, and says students even use translation apps in class. But he insists fault does not lie with international students themselves, who are mostly trying their best, and says the situation varies from subject to subject.",
      "They pass, he says, because courses are often assessed through assignments, rather than exams. Some students use essay mills and pay for others to write their work or, increasingly, use artificial intelligence (AI). Both methods, he says, can defeat current anti-plagiarism software.",
      "UCU\u2019s Jo Grady says it is hardly surprising some students with poor English skills feel they need help from other people, or even use AI to do their work, as an \"act of desperation\".",
      "She says her members tell their managers that enrolling students without good English \"is a bad idea\u2026 they will struggle, and we will also struggle to teach them\". However, she says \"university managers and leaders pursue it regardless, because of the money and income it will bring in\".",
      "Some universities are in financial crisis, says Ms Grady, and have become dependent on high-fee paying overseas students who \"pay eye-watering sums of money\".",
      "\"Institutions are chasing money. They're not necessarily chasing the best candidates. And it's a corruption of what higher education should be.\"",
      "University cash crisis to get worse despite tuition fee rise, BBC told",
      "Drop in foreign student visas worrying for UK universities",
      "Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, rejects the suggestion some overseas students are being allowed on courses with poor English language skills as a way of boosting income.",
      "She says universities carry out strict checks on those they enrol - including minimum language levels, as set by the UK government.",
      "\"Students will need to be able to afford the fee to study in the UK, but beyond that it\u2019s a question of taking students who apply, and applying a merit-based criteria,\" she says. \"It is absolutely central that this is a system that people trust.\"",
      "Ms Stern says international students are attracted by the quality of the UK's universities and says it would be \"unwise\" to rely on international income to fund domestic education and research, because overseas student numbers could be affected by geopolitics or shifts in exchange rates.",
      "Meanwhile, international student numbers are falling. Data on UK student visa applications from the first half of this year shows there has been a 16% decline in applications, resulting in a loss of income for some institutions. This drop is, in part, being attributed to changes in UK student visa rules preventing most postgraduate students from bringing dependents.",
      "It is contributing to the worst financial crisis for universities since fees were first introduced. Last month, the government regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), estimated that by 2025-26, 72% of universities could be spending more money than they have coming in, and warned that \"rapid and decisive action is necessary\".",
      "The Department for Education told the BBC a reliance on overseas students has been identified as a risk, and many universities will have to change their business models, adding that the government is committed to managing migration carefully."

      "The prime minister highlighted an existing target for the NHS in England that 92% of patients waiting for planned treatment should be seen within 18 weeks of being referred.",
      "It was a manifesto pledge and the government has pledged to achieve it by 2029.",
      "The latest NHS data shows that in September 2024 only 58.5% of operations, or other procedures people were waiting for, occurred within 18 weeks.",
      "When Labour took power in July, the share was 58.8%, so it has barely changed.",
      "The last time the 92% target was hit was in November 2015.",
      "In order to meet this goal, the government has said it wants the NHS in England to get through an additional 40,000 appointments and operations each week.",
      "To help fund this, Chancellor Rachel Reeves increased the inflation-adjusted day-to-day cash resources of the health department by 3.8% in both 2024-25 and 2025-26 in her Autumn Budget.",
      "However, Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents managers, has warned that achieving the 40,000 appointments and operations target will not be enough, on its own, to hit the broader 92% waiting list target.",
      "\u201cThe NHS needs reform, not just ever more activity,\u201d Mr Taylor said.",
      "Is Starmer speech a \u2018plan for change\u2019 or \u2018emergency relaunch\u2019?",
      "The economy",
      "Starmer made a new pledge to increase the amount of money that households have.",
      "The government will use two measures to track this.",
      "The first is real household disposable income (RHDI) per person. This is what people have left of their pay and benefits once they have paid tax.",
      "In October, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which does the government's forecasts, predicted that RHDI per person would rise by around 0.5% per year over this Parliament.",
      "According to calculations by the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focused on living standards, that would be a slightly better performance than the 0.3% average growth in RHDI per person in the previous Parliament.",
      "But it would be worse than just about every other Parliament for decades.",
      "The second measure is GDP (a measure of the size of the economy) divided by the size of the population, which the prime minister says will rise for every region of the UK.",
      "In the last Parliament, overall GDP per capita fell in the UK.",
      "Starmer also mentioned the manifesto pledge to deliver the highest sustained growth in the G7, which would mean having stronger growth than the US, Canada, Italy, France, Japan and Germany.",
      "The latest forecasts from the IMF from October suggest that Canada and the US will have stronger average growth than the UK between 2024 and 2029.",
      "However, it should be stressed that these are only forecasts - and forecasts related to economic growth and incomes are subject to considerable uncertainty.",
      "Crime",
      "The government has re-committed to its manifesto pledge to hire 13,000 additional neighbourhood police officers, volunteer special constables and Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs), who work with officers but do not have all the same powers.",
      "BBC Verify has asked the Home Office for the breakdown of these 13,000 officers - and how many will be new - but they have not yet responded and the government document does not set it out.",
      "Tiff Lynch, the acting national chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, the staff association for officers, has welcomed the government\u2019s recruitment drive.",
      "But she also warned that morale in the force is low due to real terms pay cuts in recent years and pointed out that in the federation's last survey 22% of respondents said they were planning to leave within the next two years.",
      "Education",
      "The government pledged to raise the proportion of children in England who are \u201cready for school\u201d at the age of five, to 75%.",
      "Official data from the Department for Education suggests that in 2023-24, 67.7% of children in England had a \u201cgood level of development\u201d.",
      "This is based on teacher assessments of children\u2019s development at age five.",
      "This was up slightly from 67.2% in the previous year.",
      "The government is in the middle of a major expansion of state-funded childcare.",
      "From September 2025, the government is pledging to deliver 30 hours of government funded childcare a week for under-fives in England, taking on the commitment of the previous government.",
      "However, the Early Years Alliance, which represents nurseries in England, estimates that the increase in employer National Insurance Contributions announced in the Budget will result in additional annual costs averaging more than \u00a318,600 per provider. That is based on a survey of its members.",
      "The childcare sector warns that, without extra funding to make up for the tax rise, nurseries might withdraw from the free childcare scheme, or some could go out of business.",
      "Housebuilding",
      "Also in line with Labour\u2019s manifesto, Starmer has recommitted to building 1.5 million net additional dwellings in England over the course of the Parliament.",
      "At a constant annual rate, that would equate to 300,000 per year,",
      "The most recent official data shows that 221,070 net additional dwellings were delivered in 2023-24, a decline of 6% on the previous year.",
      "The government is bringing in new housing targets for local councils in England, which the previous administration dropped and is reforming planning laws to try to accelerate building.",
      "But many housing experts remain sceptical about the feasibility of Labour\u2019s target given the lack of affordability of new housing, which has put off many buyers and deterred private developers from investing.",
      "Official data also shows that the number of housing projects given the go-ahead by councils in England reached a record low in the final months of the last government, mainly because of a decline in applications from builders.",
      "Clean power",
      "In November 2023, a Labour press release talked about \"leading the world with 100% clean power by 2030\".",
      "The party's election manifesto pledged \"zero-carbon electricity by 2030\".",
      "Starmer now says the government will achieve at least 95% clean power by 2030.",
      "The prime minister was questioned repeatedly about whether this represented a change in the target but denied this.",
      "The National Energy System Operator (NESO), the government\u2019s independent system planner and operator for the energy transition, last month defined clean power as including less than 5% of generation from gas in a typical year.",
      "It recently concluded that \u201cit is possible to build, connect and operate a clean power system for Great Britain by 2030, while maintaining security of supply\".",
      "However, it added that achieving this would be \u201cat the limit of what is feasible\u201d.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 00:37:07 GMT",
    "summary": "The Chvrches singer on going solo, and the loneliness of being the only woman in a touring band.",
    "story": [
      "Lauren Mayberry is a peacemaker.",
      "Since 2011, she's been frontwoman of the Glaswegian band Chvrches, topping festival bills and the album charts with a trademark barrage of distorted synths and razor-sharp melodies.",
      "Mayberry was the baby of the band - just 23 when she joined, and years younger than her bandmates, Iain Cook and Martin Doherty.",
      "But their chemistry was instant. Chvrches' debut single, The Mother We Share, was written and recorded in 48 hours, using the only three synths they owned - but it became a word of mouth hit, earning them airplay on BBC Radio 1 and support slots with Passion Pit and Depeche Mode.",
      "In the press, they carefully presented themselves as a band, with each member receiving equal billing. But Mayberry says she worried about being the junior partner.",
      "\"I was always conscious that I was younger than the other guys, and they had a lot more experience,\" she says.",
      "\"They\u2019d been to music school, and I hadn't. So I always felt like I was on the back foot, in terms of where I sat in the hierarchy.\"",
      "That feeling was amplified during a 2019 tour of Australia.",
      "The itinerary gave the band a four-day break in Melbourne, and Mayberry was looking forward to spending the downtime with her bandmates and the crew - until she discovered they'd made separate plans and she was stranded in her hotel room.",
      "\"I remember being very upset and hurt by that because I was always worrying about everyone else and taking care of everybody, and it was a humbling moment,\" she says.",
      "\"In the end, I hired a little car and drove to an Australian spa town and had a wee cry listening to Taylor Swift\u2019s Cruel Summer.\"",
      "Looking back, she thinks that being the only woman in the touring party left her carrying the \"emotional labour\" of keeping the show on the road.",
      "\"I feel like I twisted myself into a pretzel sometimes to make everyone happy.",
      "\"Then I\u2019d look back and think, \u2018And were you happy?'",
      "\"Not really, but I was keeping the peace.\"",
      "She considered leaving the band after that Australian incident. Then Covid struck, and Chvrches ended up making a fourth album, 2021's Screen Violence, remotely.",
      "She finally took the plunge a year later, but not before signing a new record deal with her bandmates, assuring the future of the project.",
      "\"I was conscious it would give people a sense of security, that I\u2019d made a commitment,\" she says.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s how it actually works, but that was my hope.\"",
      "She\u2019s keen to stress there\u2019s no bad blood: Martin and Doherty have given her their full support. Still, it\u2019s natural for someone leaving a band to define themselves in opposition to that music - otherwise what\u2019s the point?",
      "As Mayberry succinctly puts it: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make a crap knock-off Chvrches record.\u201d",
      "In recording sessions, she'd flinch when anyone pulled out a vintage synth. Instead, she pursued a more organic, lyrics-first approach.",
      "But after a decade in a trio, the instinct to compromise was hard-wired.",
      "\u201cI'm very used to arguing my point, then trying to see other people's point of view,\" she says.",
      "\"So it was a real learning curve to be like, \u2018No, this is my opinion, and if I don't think it's right, then it's not right, and that's the end of the conversation'.\u201d",
      "Crying wolf",
      "The result is Vicious Creature, an album that showcases new depths to Mayberry\u2018s voice, which fluctuates between vulnerability and venom, while paying homage to her pop heroines.",
      "She channels the spirit of All Saints on the album opener Something In The Air; and borrows the choppy, sampled strings of Annie Lennox's Walking On Broken Glass to power the single Crocodile Tears.",
      "The latter is a furious riposte to an emotionally manipulative man, where Mayberry snarls: \u201cWhat a man will say just to get his way / Always crying wolf, so I\u2019m sad to say / I don\u2019t really wanna hear it from you, babe\".",
      "The singer says she's role-playing in that song, inspired by the dark, subversive femininity of Velma Kelly in the musical Chicago, or Cabaret's Sally Bowles.",
      "It's one of several songs that survived the first incarnation of the album - tentatively titled Fiction - that would be \"dark, theatrical and character driven\".",
      "Slowly, over time, more personal songs started to creep into the mix.",
      "The syncopated pulse of Change Shapes is a condemnation of music industry sexism (\"I'm a doll inside a box, with a ball and a chain\"). Sorry, Etc tells a similar story over a chaotic hybrid of garage rock and drum & bass.",
      "\"There were definitely a few songs where it was at best expressing frustrations and at worst [feeling] kind of hurt,\" about her life in music, Mayberry says.",
      "The album's most intimate moment is a muted piano ballad called Oh, Mother.",
      "Over three verses, Mayberry documents the shifting relationship with her mother - from the unquestioning love of childhood to adolescent disgust and, finally, the realisation that their time together is limited.",
      "\"It kills me to know you won't be around,\" she sings gently. \"Oh mother, what will I do without you?\"",
      "The last song written for the record, the words poured out after Mayberry's friend and co-writer Dan McDougall sketched out the chords in the studio.",
      "Discussing the lyrics, which were inspired by a family illness, the singer becomes a little emotional.",
      "\"When you're living in the shadow of things like that, it's on your mind all the time,\" she says.",
      "\"I think about it all the time. When I go away on tour, I always think, \u2018Oh, is this the tour where I'm gone and I miss it\u2019.",
      "\"So that last afternoon in the studio was quite a weepy one... But then we went to Nando's. So it's all about balance.\"",
      "Oh, Mother is the sort of song she could never have written in Chvrches, Mayberry says.",
      "\"It's not a place that we would go emotionally or sonically,\" she says.",
      "\"I think the best songs happen when the lyrics and the meaning and the sonics interlink but [with Chvrches] I was writing things in my notebooks and thinking, \u2018This is never going to fit with what the band have built\u2019.\"",
      "Change is never easy, though. While some reviews have called the album a \"masterclass in pop alchemy\", others have said Mayberry \"still sounds like someone finding their feet\".",
      "Fans of Chvrches' industrial sound have expressed disappointment too, but the singer has learned to distance herself from criticism.",
      "\"When people are like, \u2018Screw you\u2019, I rationalise it like this: You\u2019re mad at me, but you're mad at me because life is hard, and our music made your life a bit easier for a minute. And now you're like, \u2018Please don't take that away.\u2019",
      "\"When I was 24, that was overwhelming, but it made sense once I could compartmentalise it.",
      "\"You are the representative of something that means so much to this person - so when you do something else, it threatens the idea of that existing.\"",
      "The flipside of that equation comes in concert. When Mayberry plays a song like Asking For A Friend, with its reassuring mantra, \"you still matter\", she often sees \"someone in the audience having a wee dance-cry\".",
      "\"And when people cry, I cry. Everyone's like, 'Are you ok?' but I'm just caught up in the moment.",
      "\"But I hope that\u2019s why I\u2019m good at my job, because I have some kind of empathy.",
      "\"It\u2019s inconvenient for my life, but hopefully good for the crowd.\""

      "Wintour admits that \u201cfor someone who goes to so many shows, you get a little, not jaded, but you get used to the experience\".",
      "Since most visitors to the exhibition will not have had the chance to attend such events, she says they were keen to make sure it felt as though they were actually there.",
      "As the reigning queen of the fashion world, Wintour has had a real front-row seat for decades - often on a delicate gold chair, the kind of furniture that is ubiquitous at the high end catwalk viewings where her invitation is always a dead cert.",
      "In the blurb to the exhibition, Wintour writes that she has \u201cprobably spent a year of my life waiting for fashion shows, which are famously tardy, to begin\u201d.",
      "She tells me the American designer Marc Jacobs once held a runway show that was an hour and a half late, but \u201cwe all yelled at him so much after that, the next season, he not only started the show on time, he actually started five minutes early\u201d.",
      "The Italian designer Gianni Versace, though, was \u201calways on time\u201d,",
      "\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter who wasn\u2019t there, it could have been the Pope, he didn\u2019t care\u201d.",
      "That would have suited Wintour, who is \u201chorribly punctual, usually early\u201d.",
      "She arrives early for our interview. Fortunately, I\u2019d been warned it was a character trait and we were ready.",
      "The Vogue show offers audiences a series of vibrant chapters, narrated by Cate Blanchett, which tell the story of fashion and the runway.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite nostalgic to sit in the space and look at the incredible changes that have happened in fashion,\" Wintour tells me.",
      "We\u2019re treated to a series of the magazine's front covers from the early days, black and white footage of the first catwalk shows and images of the couture salons of the early twentieth century.",
      "Fashion then was \u201cvery elitist - you had to be invited and it was a very tight little world,\u201d says Wintour.",
      "Contrast that with the debut show by the musician and entrepreneur Pharrell Williams for Louis Vuitton in 2023. A pop-culture event, it was held on the Pont Neuf in Paris, with the likes of Beyonce, Rihanna and of course Wintour in attendance, and got one billion views online.",
      "The democratisation of fashion means, as Wintour puts it, \u201cnow everyone can come to the party, which is as it should be\u201d.",
      "The exhibition also takes us back to 2017 when Karl Lagerfeld devised a space-station inspired runway set, complete with a rocket blasting off as models stood beside it decked in Chanel. Wintour told me it was \u201cextraordinary\u2026 and you couldn't wait to see what he was going to come up with next\u201d.",
      "Lagerfeld had form. Ten years earlier for Fendi, he had broken new ground, using the Great Wall of China as a catwalk, his models parading along the stone. Fashion designers of his stature clearly don\u2019t do things by halves.",
      "To insiders, Wintour has been one of the most significant players in fashion for the best part of 40 years - a maker of careers, an advocate for the power of fashion to meld with the A-list of entertainment.",
      "She\u2019s the driving force behind the annual Met Gala in New York, which sees the worlds of fashion and fame collide and go viral in a spectacle of outrageous outfits and celebrity appearances on the first Monday of every May.",
      "Those not on the inside are more likely to wonder just how closely Wintour resembles Miranda Priestly, the fictional tyrannical magazine boss from the film The Devil Wears Prada, whose portrayal by Meryl Streep is seared into the memories of fans.",
      "\u201cIs there some reason that my coffee isn\u2019t here? Has she died or something?\u201d Priestly inquires dismissively about her assistant.",
      "\u201cDetails of your incompetence do not interest me,\u201d she later tells her.",
      "On Wintour\u2019s trip to London, she leant in to the comparison, attending the gala performance of the new musical version of the film. There, she told the BBC that it was \"for the audience and for the people I work with to decide if there are any similarities between me and Miranda Priestly\u201d.",
      "When we spoke, I wanted to know if she finds the public persona of Anna Wintour - the sharp, bobbed hair, the meticulous outfits, the glasses - a role she feels she has to perform.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really think about it,\" she says. \"What I\u2019m really interested in is the creative aspect of my job.\"",
      "Wintour tells me she only brought one or two suitcases with her to London and she won\u2019t be drawn on whether she dresses down when she\u2019s at home in the US. \"It\u2019s really about respect in how you present yourself.\"",
      "More than one person has told me that nobody ever says 'no' to Wintour. Donatella Versace says the same in the recent Disney documentary, In Vogue: The 90s.",
      "Wintour demurs. \u201cThat is absolutely untrue. They often say no, but that\u2019s a good thing. No is a wonderful word\u201d.",
      "Do you think people are frightened of you, I ask her. \u201cI hope not,\u201d she replies.",
      "Under her leadership, through talent, force of personality and an eye for what sells, Wintour has tried to future proof Vogue, turning it into a global brand. She is also global content advisor for Conde Nast, the magazine's publisher.",
      "In the modern era, when influencers can take photos of fashion moments and pump them out immediately, Wintour has successfully positioned Vogue as an arbiter of taste and style.",
      "Fashion and advertising are entwined in Vogue's content but Wintour doesn\u2019t accept my premise that fashion journalism can be sycophantic.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s simply not true and it\u2019s sometimes, I think, frustrating to us that work in fashion, that there is an outside perception fashion is frivolous and superficial.",
      "\"In fact, it\u2019s a huge business. We give employment to millions of people around the world.\"",
      "I take that answer to mean that Wintour, the daughter of a former editor of the Evening Standard newspaper, sees herself more as a fashion ambassador than a journalist.",
      "But of course she is also a journalist, arguably one of the most famous journalistic faces on the planet - and one that has no obvious successor.",
      "I ask her, at 75, how much longer she plans to stay in her role.",
      "\u201cI have no plans to leave my job,\u201d she says, adding: \u201cCurrently.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 13:14:06 GMT",
    "summary": "Culture editor Katie Razzall explores what the allegations against the MasterChef host mean for the corporation.",
    "story": [
      "Presenter Gregg Wallace is a national figure, who has been in people\u2019s living rooms several times a week for 20 years.",
      "His programmes, most prominently MasterChef, are made by independent production companies.",
      "But his name and face are associated with the BBC, and, as allegations continue to emerge, the corporation is under fire.",
      "It\u2019s the last thing it needs, so soon after other high profile scandals including the disgraced BBC News presenter Huw Edwards.",
      "The BBC has questions to answer about the allegations over what it knew about Wallace\u2019s behaviour on and off set, and - if it was alerted to these types of allegations - what it did about them.",
      "BBC News has been made aware of two occasions when complaints were made. One, by the radio host Aasmah Mir, related to Celebrity MasterChef in 2017.",
      "She says she complained to the production company behind the show and later spoke to the BBC\u2019s Kate Phillips who was then controller for entertainment commissioning. I understand Phillips was later assured that the issue had been addressed.",
      "Another complaint, just a year afterwards, concerned Impossible Celebrities, made by a different production company.",
      "In a letter from 2018 seen by BBC News, Phillips wrote that she had spoken to Wallace for 90 minutes to make clear what the BBC expected of him. She also confirmed in the letter that many aspects of his behaviour were unacceptable and unprofessional.",
      "Six years on, the emerging allegations about Wallace\u2019s conduct raise questions about whether executives - at the production company Banijay and the BBC - reacted appropriately.",
      "But BBC News has not been told whether the BBC executives involved in Wallace\u2019s shows were made aware of any complaints about him after 2018 and the conversation between him and Phillips. If they weren\u2019t, there is some plausible deniability that they thought the issues raised had been sorted.",
      "Then again, that defence may only go so far. There are wider questions about how much a TV executive should probe, if they are aware that rumours have begun to swirl.",
      "Popbitch, the weekly celebrity newsletter that makes its way into the inboxes of most media executives, had run stories involving allegations about Wallace\u2019s language and behaviour in the past, for example. When does the odd gossipy claim about talent misbehaviour become an issue bosses should take a look at?",
      "Should more questions have been asked by the BBC after 2018?",
      "Some have made the point that these types of scandals involving high profile TV presenters only seem to emerge when the media shines a light on them.",
      "It\u2019s only then, it is argued, that executives take action and launch an investigation. The claim is that before journalists get involved, the executives are more concerned with protecting the star, the show and their bottom line.",
      "In light of Huw Edwards, the BBC launched a workplace review into preventing abuses of power. At the time, the BBC chair Samir Shah said there \"continues to be a sense that powerful people 'get away with it'.\"",
      "But for me, how the Wallace claims may have been handled isn\u2019t entirely comparable to the Edwards scandal.",
      "Huw Edwards was employed directly by the BBC, Wallace is contracted by production companies that make his shows and sell them to the BBC.",
      "To put this in context, 326 independent companies made programmes for the BBC in the year 2023/4, accounting for 55% of the BBC\u2019s TV hours.",
      "I have picked up some frustration on the corporate side of the BBC that the corporation is taking criticism for a programme that it doesn't make.",
      "A BBC insider told me it essentially bought a product from a third party and is now being held to account for the actions of staff in a different organisation.",
      "My assessment is that if there were complaints - or claims of bad behaviour on set - the first port of call would have been the production company.",
      "But that defence - that the BBC is at arm's length on this one - only goes so far. Audiences don\u2019t make that distinction. In the end, they associate Wallace with the BBC, not a production company.",
      "The damage rests at the BBC\u2019s door.",

      "The workplace review will aim to look at how to ensure that junior people with less power feel able to speak up, when a presenter is behaving badly. The director general Tim Davie has already said he\u2019d like to ban the word \"talent\" for the BBC\u2019s stars, to help end the hierarchies that can be a part of programme making when powerful, highly paid people with audience recognition are involved.",
      "But, understandably, the review won\u2019t have oversight of the independent sector. These are independent companies responsible for their own codes.",
      "It would however be useful for the review to lay out what BBC processes are triggered when rumours begin to emerge about a particular star and what the BBC expects from its executives and indeed the production companies it buys programmes from.",
      "Philippa Childs, the head of union Bectu, told Radio 4 on Wednesday \"the time has come for the whole industry to come together and accept that there does need to be some independent scrutiny of how broadcasters [and] production companies work, to try and address this endemic problem\".",

      "\"You have to be open if you're a public figure and if you're telling people to vote for you, you have to tell them who you are and what you're about,\" he says. \"And, of course, I thought it would be fun.\"",
      "In his 14 years as an MP, the former minister came to be viewed as one of the most controversial politicians of recent times thanks to some of his hardline views. These include total opposition to abortion (even in cases of incest and rape) and a belief that there should be no climate change legislation.",
      "In the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 72 people, Sir Jacob said it would have been \"common sense\"  for residents to flee the building, ignoring fire brigade advice. A survivors group described the comments as \"extremely painful and insulting\". Sir Jacob later said he \"profoundly apologised\".",

      "It is not known how much he is being paid by Discovery+ for the documentary, but as his wife is the heiress to a reported \u00a345 million fortune, money doesn't seem to be a motive.",
      "So, what other motivation could there be for the former banker to take part in the show? Is it part of a plan to re-enter politics in the next election after he lost his seat in July?",

    "story": [
      "Families of children operated on by a disgraced surgeon have labelled independent reports into their care as a \"whitewash\" and a \"final insult\".",
      "Yaser Jabbar, a former surgeon at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), carried out procedures including leg lengthening and straightening. He also operated on children with complicated disorders.",
      "But some cases linked to him resulted in harm, including life-long injuries and amputation.",
      "Mr Jabbar left the hospital in 2023 after a report by the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) found some of the surgery had been \"inappropriate\" and \"incorrect\".",
      "Families criticise redacted report into disgraced surgeon",
      "Great Ormond Street reviews 700 children treated by ex-surgeon",
      "Following the RCS report, GOSH said each of Mr Jabbar's 723 patients would receive an independent report to conclude what level of harm they had suffered.",
      "The reviews, which are being carried out by specialist surgeons who did not work at GOSH, are based on patient notes provided by the hospital.",
      "Families have started receiving reports about the care their children received. BBC News has now spoken to four families - and had indirect contact with 12 more - who say the reports do not reflect their children's experiences and often raise more questions than they answer.",
      "Many of the reports were concluded without any interviews or interaction with the family or patient, they say.",
      "Parents describe the reports as part of a \"culture of cover-up\", telling the BBC that GOSH has \"failed their children\", leaving them physically and mentally damaged.",
      "One mother told us: \"Mr Jabbar was known for not writing up records or keeping notes correctly, but these reviews have been based on hospital notes. My daughter's report doesn't reflect her journey at all.\"",
      "A GOSH spokesperson said the hospital was deeply sorry and wanted \"every patient and family who comes to our hospital to feel safe and cared for\".",
      "\"We commissioned an independent review of patient care, which is in line with the NHS England guidelines,\" they added.",
      "Dean Stalham's daughter, Bunty, was born with a rare bone disease. Over a 15-month period, Bunty underwent a number of operations which all failed, leaving her in agony and taking strong pain relief for months.",
      "In Bunty's report, the physical impact on her was deemed \"moderate\" - but her father says it is \"simply wrong\".",
      "\"It says she had six procedures. I can count 10,\" Mr Stalham says.",
      "\"Not a single one of Bunty's surgeries worked, and none of them were of any benefit to her whatsoever. When they were trying to lengthen her leg they ended up shortening it by about eight inches.\"",
      "Other parents are angry the reports graded their child's psychological harm as \"none\" or \"mild\".",
      "\"How can it say she has no psychological harm when they haven't even spoken to the child?\" Claire Osborne says of her daughter, Ella.",
      "Ella has Shwachman Diamond Syndrome II, causing her knees to bend inwards and causing severe pain.",
      "Ella was referred for psychological support in 2022, after a failed operation to realign her knees was carried out by Mr Jabbar.",
      "\"She cried herself to sleep each night,\" her mother says. \"She was in a wheelchair and constant agony for years. She has nervous ticks now. She didn't have them before Jabbar.\"",
      "When Mansur's mother Hindiya Omar first met Mr Jabbar in 2018 at GOSH, she says she was reassured, describing him as charismatic and attentive. She felt certain her son was in safe hands.",
      "\"I felt lucky my boy was being seen by the best in the world,\" Ms Omar says. \"I didn't question what was being recommended because I trusted them entirely.\"",
      "At the time, Mansur was complaining of a sore knee. After two operations carried out by Mr Jabbar, Mansur suffered nerve damage resulting in foot drop, which can cause difficulty lifting or moving your foot and can affect the way you walk.",
      "Mansur's knee is now deformed and he is unable to bend it, while his leg growth has been stunted.",
      "\"They have destroyed his leg, he complains of being in agonising pain every day,\" Ms Omar says. \"I can't trust anyone now \u2013 especially not the hospital for letting this happen.\"",
      "She says the last time she saw Mr Jabbar was in 2022. After that, she says she was told the surgeon was away, but at no stage did the hospital say Mr Jabbar was being investigated.",
      "Ms Omar says this meant Mansur's care was further delayed and three appointments with Mr Jabbar were booked, then cancelled and rearranged.",
      "A GOSH spokesperson says families were told in August 2022 that Mr Jabbar was on sabbatical leave.",
      "A GOSH spokesperson says: \"Assessing psychological harm is, however, complex due to many factors, and so we will always discuss concerns families may have and will do our best to ensure patients get the care and support they need going forward.\"",
      "In February, Ms Omar received a phone call telling her that Mansur's years of pain and life-altering surgeries were being investigated.",
      "The independent review into Mansur's care concluded that he suffered \"moderate harm\" through his treatment from Mr Jabbar.",
      "Mansur was five years old when he first saw Mr Jabbar. He is now 12 years old and awaiting more surgery. He will never bend his knee, can only walk short distances and now uses a wheelchair.",
      "\"To say that a boy who has lost his childhood to this man has suffered 'moderate harm' is just the final insult for me,\" Ms Omar says.",
      "In a statement GOSH said: \"We are deeply sorry to the patients of this surgeon who we have let down\", adding: \"Patient safety is our core purpose and we have a range of measures to ensure all our services are safe.\"",
      "Mr Jabbar worked at four other London hospitals, including three in the private sector - St John and St Elizabeth, the Cromwell and the Portland.",
      "St John and St Elizabeth says Mr Jabbar carried out three adult procedures there between October 2020 and January 2023. It said no concerns had been raised about his practice.",
      "Cromwell Hospital said Mr Jabbar had operated on 12 adults and six children when he worked there and it has not received complaints.",
      "\"Since the concerns around Mr Jabbar came to light, we have proactively contacted all patients directly and are continuing to stay in close contact while this investigation proceeds.\"",
      "The HCA group, of which the Portland is part, confirmed 43 surgeries were carried out at its sites by Mr Jabbar.",

      "Many premium products claim to accurately track exercise routines, body temperature, heart rate, menstrual cycle and sleep patterns, among others.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting has talked about a proposal to give wearables to millions of NHS patients in England, enabling them to track symptoms such as reactions to cancer treatments, from home.",
      "But many doctors \u2013 and tech experts \u2013 remain cautious about using health data captured by wearables.",
      "I\u2019m currently trying out a smart ring from the firm Ultrahuman \u2013 and it seemed to know that I was getting sick before I did.",
      "It alerted me one weekend that my temperature was slightly elevated, and my sleep had been restless. It warned me that this could be a sign I was coming down with something.",
      "I tutted something about the symptoms of perimenopause and ignored it - but two days later I was laid up in bed with gastric flu.",
      "I didn\u2019t need medical assistance, but if I had \u2013 would the data from my wearable have helped healthcare professionals with my treatment? Many wearable brands actively encourage this.",
      "The Oura smart ring, for example, offers a service where patients can download their data in the form of a report to share with their doctor.",
      "Dr Jake Deutsch, a US-based clinician who also advises Oura, says wearable data enables him to \u201cassess overall health more precisely\u201d \u2013 but not all doctors agree that it\u2019s genuinely useful all of the time.",
      "Dr Helen Salisbury is a GP at a busy practice in Oxford. She says not many patients come in brandishing their wearables, but she\u2019s noticed it has increased, and it concerns her.",
      "\u201cI think for the number of times when it\u2019s useful there\u2019s probably more times that it\u2019s not terribly useful, and I worry that we are building a society of hypochondria and over-monitoring of our bodies,\u201d she says.",
      "Dr Salisbury says there can be a large number of reasons why we might temporarily get abnormal data such as an increased heart rate, whether it\u2019s a blip in our bodies or a device malfunction - and many of them do not require further investigation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we will be encouraging people to monitor everything all the time, and see their doctor every time the machine thinks they\u2019re ill, rather than when they think they\u2019re ill.\u201d",
      "And she makes a further point about the psychological use of this data as a kind of insurance policy against shock health diagnoses. A nasty cancerous tumour for example, is not necessarily going to be flagged by a watch or an app, she says.",
      "What wearables do is encourage good habits - but the best message you can take from them is the same advice doctors have been giving us for years. Dr Salisbury adds: \u201cThe thing you can actually do is walk more, don\u2019t drink too much alcohol, try and maintain a healthy weight. That never changes.\u201d",
      "The Apple Watch is reported to be the world\u2019s best-selling smart watch, although sales have slowed lately.",
      "Apple didn't comment, but the tech giant uses true stories of people whose lives have been saved because of the heart tracking function of the device in its marketing, and anecdotally I have heard plenty of those too. What I haven\u2019t heard however, is how many cases of false positives there are.",
      "In many cases when patients present their data to healthcare professionals, clinicians prefer to try to recreate it using their own equipment, rather than simply trust what the wearable has captured.",
      "There are several reasons for this, says Dr Yang Wei, associate professor in wearable technologies at Nottingham Trent University  \u2013 and they\u2019re all very practical.",
      "\u201cWhen you go to hospital, and you measure your ECG [electrocardiogram, a test that checks the activity of your heart], you don\u2019t worry about power consumption because the machine is plugged into the wall,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cOn your watch, you\u2019re not going to measure your ECG continuously because you drain your battery straight away.\u201d",
      "In addition, movement \u2013 both of the wearable itself on a wrist, for example, and general movement of the person wearing it - can \u201ccreate noise\u201d in the data it collects, he adds, making it less reliable.",
      "Dr Wei points to the ring on my finger.",
      "\u201cThe gold standard to measure the heart rate is from the wrist or direct from the heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you measure from the finger, you\u2019re sacrificing accuracy.\"",
      "It is the role of software to fill in such data gaps, he says - but there\u2019s no international standard for wearables here - for either the sensors and software that power wearable devices, or for the data itself, and even what format it is gathered in.",
      "The more consistently a device is worn, the more accurate its data is likely to be. But here\u2019s a cautionary tale.",
      "Ben Wood was out for the day when his wife received a series of alarming notifications from his Apple Watch, telling her he had been in a car crash. It advised her to text him rather than call because he may need to keep the line clear for the emergency services.",
      "The alerts were genuine, and sent to her as his emergency contact \u2013 but in this case unnecessary. Ben was out at a race track driving some fast cars. He admitted that he \u201cwasn\u2019t very gifted\u201d at it \u2013 but said he felt safe at all times.",
      "\u201cThe boundaries between incident and alert need to be managed carefully,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see how device-makers, emergency services, first responders and individuals think about this technology in the future.\u201d",
      "Pritesh Mistry, digital technologies fellow at the Kings Fund, agrees that there are significant challenges around folding current patient-generated data into our healthcare systems, and adds that the discussion has already been going on for several years in the UK without any clear resolution.",
      "He says there\u2019s \u201ca good case to be made\u201d for the use of wearables in the UK government\u2019s current drive to push care out of hospitals and into community settings.",
      "\u201cBut without that underpinning foundation of technology enablement in terms of the infrastructure, and supporting the workforce to have the skills, knowledge, capacity and confidence, I think it\u2019s going to be a challenge,\u201d he adds.",

      "Stocktaking",
      "But the principal way in which the prime minister will seek to drive his agenda is via \u201cstock takes\u201d. These are meetings where Sir Keir brings those responsible for each mission into Downing Street to hold them accountable for what the data is showing in their area and asking them how they propose to improve. It\u2019s an idea which was pioneered by Sir Tony Blair on the advice of Michael Barber, his delivery adviser, who recently returned to government.",
      "The frequency of these stocktakes will soon increase, a senior government source said, adding: \u201cIf we are saying that this is the mission of the government and this is how people should judge its success and failure then it is clearly something you need the PM driving through.\u201d",

      "Both he and Sir Keir are said to be seized of the need to bring more outside expertise into government and to make better use of data and artificial intelligence.",
      "The government\u2019s stated aims here are bold. Announcing the appointment of Sir Chris Wormald this week as the new cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, Sir Keir charged him with \u201cnothing less than the complete re-wiring of the British state\u201d.",
      "There was no shortage of people in Whitehall questioning whether the longest-serving head of a government department  - Sir Chris has run the health department for eight years and education for four before that  - is the right person to transform Whitehall. Sir Chris's supporters say that within the current system he is one of those most open to reform.",
      "The appointment was received with open contempt by Cummings, who sarcastically described it as a \u201ctruly beautiful, artistic\u201d decision which should serve as a \u201cwake up call\u201d that \u201cthe Westminster system is totally determined to resist any change\u201d.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 18:52:29 GMT",
    "summary": "Scrapping the two-child cap and changes to tax thresholds are among plans for the next financial year.",
    "story": [
      "A vow to scrap the two-child benefit cap and changes to basic and intermediate tax thresholds are among the plans for the Scottish government for the next financial year.",
      "The announcements were made by Finance Secretary Shona Robison as she revealed her tax and spending plans for 2025/26.",
      "Other talking points included an extra \u00a32bn for the NHS and a \u00a3768m investment in affordable homes.",
      "Here are five key takeaways from this year's Scottish Budget.",
      "1. Two-child benefits cap",
      "The biggest announcement in the budget actually isn\u2019t part of the tax or spending plans for next year.",
      "It was Shona Robison\u2019s \u201crabbit out of the hat\u201d moment of announcing that the Scottish government would move to scrap - or offset, or mitigate - the two-child benefits cap.",
      "That\u2019s a UK-wide policy, imposed by the Department of Work and Pensions on welfare payments such as universal credit and child tax credits - so it will take some time, and will need some help from the UK government.",
      "It\u2019s not yet clear what the mechanism will be, how it will work, or how much it will cost.",
      "The Scottish Fiscal Commission says it was only sent the proposal last week, and that it hasn\u2019t had time to cost it; they call it a \u201cfiscal risk\u201d.",
      "But be in no doubt that this is a big challenge to Labour.",
      "It comes days after an announcement on the winter fuel payment also designed to outflank Anas Sarwar\u2019s party and embarrass the UK administration.",
      "If all goes to plan then the SNP government will start sending out payments to families of the 15,000 children affected in April 2026. One month before the next Holyrood election.",
      "Labour says it's willing to listen to ideas, but points out that there is not a penny in the coming year\u2019s budget to support it.",
      "They will surely need to come up with a more substantial response before that election comes much closer.",
      "2. Taxes",
      "There were no big changes to the devolved income tax system in this budget.",
      "There was some tinkering with thresholds, which will have a political impact if not a big financial one.",
      "Robison is increasing the thresholds for the basic and intermediate rates - two of the lower rungs in Scotland\u2019s six-band ladder of taxes.",
      "Because Chancellor Rachel Reeves has frozen those thresholds in the rest of the UK, it means Scots earning less than \u00a330,300 will pay less tax than if they lived in England or Wales.",
      "The difference is less than \u00a330 a year, but it allows Robison to say that 51% of Scottish taxpayers pay less.",
      "One bill that will almost certainly be going up is council tax. But with last year\u2019s one-off freeze on local rates coming to an end, it will be down to your local representatives to decide.",
      "Rather than wielding a stick by imposing any sort of cap, Robison instead sought to guilt local authorities into holding down increases, saying that \u201cwith record funding there is no reason for big increases in council tax next year\u201d.",
      "She says there\u2019s an extra \u00a31bn for local government - but it remains to be seen how much of that councillors will be free to allocate, and how much will fall into ring-fenced areas.",
      "Every year the government says it has increased funding for councils, then councils hit back that it\u2019s not enough, and there\u2019s a row over exactly how much money is enough money.",
      "We will no doubt go around in circles on that until budgets at a local and national level are finalised next year.",
      "3. Spending priorities",
      "The budget totalled more than \u00a363bn, and previously ubiquitous talk of tough decisions and austerity was notably absent. There was a positive tone - like Robison suddenly had some cash to splash on the government\u2019s favourite policies.",
      "John Swinney has made the eradication of child poverty as his top priority, and as ever there is cash in the budget for the flagship Scottish Child Payment.",
      "The cash to mitigate the two-child cap doesn\u2019t feature in this budget - only some money to set up that system, whatever it turns out to look like.",
      "In total, spending on social security is up by \u00a3800m - highlighting a key feature of devolved government, in the SNP\u2019s appetite for big state interventions and welfare safety nets.",
      "You can include in that last week\u2019s announcement about winter fuel payments, which are being partially reinstated from next year.",
      "This week Mr Swinney has also (unsurprisingly) earmarked the NHS as a core priority, and as expected it has a record funding settlement - \u00a321bn, or a third of the total budget.",
      "That includes almost \u00a3200m to cut waiting times and cash for local hospital projects in Edinburgh, Fort William and Airdrie.",
      "There were also billions of pounds for net zero and climate policies - including money from the ScotWind fund, a pot of cash raised by auctioning off plots of the seabed for offshore wind, which Robison had previously feared she might need to use for day-to-day funding.",
      "And there is \u00a3768m for affordable housing, which chiefly goes to reverse a cut made under Humza Yousaf\u2019s administration last year, but does ultimately leave spending higher and will apparently create 8,000 new homes in the coming year.",
      "4. Growing the economy",
      "A big focus of governments across the UK has been economic growth. Rachel Reeves has put it at the core of everything she is doing as chancellor, as Robison said a thriving economy was \u201can essential requirement\u201d.",
      "The finance secretary had been challenged to match the chancellor\u2019s support for firms in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors - a 40% relief on business rates.",
      "Scotland has a slightly different system of \u201cnon-domestic rates\u201d, but ultimately Robison said there would be a similar 40% relief for the vast majority of hospitality premises.",
      "Retail and leisure were notably absent (although there is some support for music venues), and we will see how far this shakes out in terms of who does and doesn\u2019t qualify for funding.",
      "The Scottish Hospitality Group has said it is a \u201csignificantly more restricted\u201d offer than that down south, calling it a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d.",
      "A motif of Ms Robison\u2019s speech was name-checking her cabinet colleagues as she spoke to each of their portfolio areas.",
      "That felt particularly notable in the case of Kate Forbes - an influential figure as the woman John Swinney brought into government in part to mend fences with business.",
      "She has highlighted more money for town centre regeneration as well as a tripling of investment in the offshore wind supply chain, which it is said will leverage ten times that figure in private investment.",
      "This approach of public cash opening the door to huge flows of private funds is a favourite tactic of Ms Reeves - and indeed is the core purpose of GB Energy.",
      "That UK energy firm is set to have some company when it sets up in Aberdeen, with Ms Robison pledging to establish a hub or offshore wind in the North East.",
      "5. Politics",
      "The SNP does not have a majority in the Scottish Parliament, and thus needs the help of other parties to pass a budget.",
      "John Swinney has talked about wanting to reach out to opponents and run a collaborative administration.",
      "But there is no chance of a deal with the Conservatives, who want a billion pounds of tax cuts, or Labour, who really just want an election.",
      "That leaves the Greens and the Lib Dems as the most likely dance partners.",
      "Robison quite deliberately nodded to the key asks of both parties. There was funding for ferries, mental health and dentistry for the Lib Dems. The Greens demanded \u00a34.7bn for green policies - and she pledged \u00a34.9bn.",
      "The Greens welcomed some of the measures, but said \u201csignificant further changes\u201d were needed. They are particularly suspicious of the sums on offer for councils.",
      "The Lib Dems welcomed even more of Robison\u2019s announcements, with leader Alex Cole-Hamilton reeling off a whole series of measures where he said it was right the government had listened to him.",
      "The draft budget is really the starting point for talks, which won\u2019t come to a head until the first votes at Holyrood in February.",
      "But the fevered talk of snap elections which followed the collapse of the Bute House Agreement has faded. A deal with someone still feels the most likely outcome.",

      "She received a conditional discharge six months before becoming an MP in the 2015 general election.",

      "But the cross-party Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils across England, says a 2011 decision to freeze the amount they can claim back has cost them almost \u00a3740m in the last five years.",
      "The LGA says that money would otherwise have been spent on areas such as adult social care, children\u2019s services and preventing homelessness.",
      "It wants the Labour government to update the system to reflect 2024 costs.",

      "Cost of housing homeless people in London \u00a34m a day",
      "The LGA says the increasing number of people needing to be housed in temporary accommodation, combined with the rise in costs per person, has resulted in a funding gap of \u00a3737.3m over the last five years.",
      "\u201cYou've seen the dramatic increase in the cost of rents since 2011,\" Adam Hug, the LGA\u2019s housing spokesperson, told the BBC.",
      "\"So it's getting increasingly expensive in a constrained market to find places that are suitable for people to live at costs that councils can afford.\"",
      "That lack of available accommodation options has meant many councils have had to use more expensive options, such as hotels and bed and breakfasts, to house those in need.",
      "Official government data released last week showed a record 123,100 households were in temporary accommodation at the end of June, a 16% rise on last year.",
      "Matt Downie, chief executive of homelessness charity Crisis, told the BBC: \u201cAs more and more people are pushed into homelessness due to rising living costs and sky-high rents, they have nowhere else to go but to their local council, who too often have nowhere to put them but into expensive temporary accommodation that is often unfit for their needs.\u201d",
      "If someone meets the conditions for receiving temporary accommodation, it is often up to their local council to find them somewhere to stay.",
      "The council is then usually reimbursed by the Department for Work and Pensions, using the individual\u2019s benefits.",
      "Historically, the amount a council could claim back was capped at 90% of Local Housing Allowance, which is used to work out how much in benefits people are entitled to.",
      "But the coalition government froze that cap based on 2011 rates and no government has since unfrozen it.",
      "\u201c[Then-Chancellor] George Osborne and his gang decided to pass the buck to local authorities, and try and bear down on the benefits bill at the cost of many other things,\u201d said Hug, who is also the Labour leader of Westminster City Council.",
      "'Fair burden-sharing'",
      "The LGA says the funding gap, the difference between what councils have paid out in housing benefit to households living in temporary accommodation and the amount they have been reimbursed for by central government, has doubled from \u00a3104.5m in 2018/19 to \u00a3204.5m in 2022/23.",
      "London and other large cities have generally been worst hit, with Manchester, Newham and Westminster councils registering the largest funding gaps.",
      "\u201cWe absolutely recognise the pressures in the government's finances,\u201d said Hug, but he urged ministers to ensure there was \"fair burden-sharing between local authorities and national government\u201d when it came to funding temporary accommodation.",
      "Labour\u2019s general election manifesto promised \u201ca new cross-government strategy, working with mayors and councils across the country, to put Britain back on track to ending homelessness\u201d.",
      "While the chancellor did commit an extra \u00a3230m to combat homelessness in the Budget, no such strategy has yet been launched.",
      "The LGA has called on the government to \u201curgently\u201d introduce that plan, which it says must tackle the \u201clack of genuinely affordable homes\u201d.",
      "Labour has pledged to build an additional 1.5m homes over the next five years to tackle the housing crisis, but a BBC investigation earlier this week revealed the vast majority of councils have cast doubt on how achievable that goal is.",
      "The total cost for councils funding temporary accommodation in 2022/23 was \u00a31.75bn.",
      "That is on top of the millions of pounds a day being spent by central government housing others such as asylum seekers.",

      "Significantly he has also appointed a man who has sat at the top Conservative table before -  former Welsh secretary David TC Davies is his most senior adviser.",
      "First impressions on day one are that Millar means business.",
      "Reaction",
      "A Welsh Labour spokesperson said: \"Voters have already rejected Darren Millar and his colleagues at the general election. Instead of trying to understand why, they are papering over the cracks.\"",
      "Reform UK Wales spokesman, Oliver Lewis, said: \"The simple fact is, Darren Millar has been an MS since 2007 and has been nothing but ineffective in opposition, just like every other Welsh Tory.\"",
      "Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth congratulated Millar but said he takes the job \"at a time of chaos and infighting in his party, and with the Tories having failed to offer any credible solutions to the challenges facing Wales\".",
      "A Welsh Liberal Democrat spokesperson added: \"In July Welsh voters delivered their devastating verdict on the Conservatives, booting out every single Tory MP in Wales. Re-arranging the deckchairs in their Senedd group isn't going to make anyone forget their record of incompetence, sleaze, and failure.\""

      "The 95% clean power figure follows advice from the National Energy Systems Operator (NESO), which recently said a clean power system is one where demand is met by \u201cmainly renewables, with gas-fired generation used rarely to ensure security of supply\u201d.",

      "Of all of this new government\u2019s big promises, getting economic growth up and immigration down are the two biggies \u2013 and their early months in office show just how hard achieving either, let alone both, will be.",
      "Economic growth has been stuttery and half-hearted for ages.",
      "And immigration, both legal and illegal, via small boat crossings, has ballooned in recent years.",
      "Now, Sir Keir Starmer and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper have reached a milestone with a big number attached.",
      "Over the weekend, the number of people who have arrived on small boats since the general election in July exceeded 20,000.",
      "Privately, ministers acknowledge that successfully tackling irregular, illegal migration is absolutely key to how competent or otherwise the government is perceived to be; however fair or otherwise that might be, given the scale of the challenge.",
      "Small boat crossings hit 20,000 under Labour",
      "How many people cross the Channel in small boats?",
      "Could Labour 'stop the boats'?",
      "Those pictures of dinghies bobbing around in the Channel are hugely powerful: they represent a geopolitical, diplomatic, humanitarian, economic and political issue all rolled into one.",
      "For some it can be described more bluntly: people breaking into the country, with those with the job of stopping it failing.",
      "As Nick Robinson sets out here after a week of reporting on this for the Today Programme on Radio 4, the huge amount of people desperate to reach the UK and other countries like it is not likely to shrink significantly.",
      "And so the political argument revolves around what can be done to put people off trying.",
      "One thing that does put people off, but politicians have no control over, is the weather.",
      "The boats that are used are incredibly flimsy for a sea journey. I have seen and touched them, when visiting Border Force in Dover. They are made of the same stuff as a bouncy castle.",
      "So it is not surprising that when the weather isn\u2019t great, and in particular when there are plenty of waves, fewer crossings are attempted.",
      "The Home Office classifies each day according to the weather, with those judged to have the most benign conditions on the water called 'red days'.",
      "Between mid October and mid November this year, there was the highest concentration of so-called red days in any month since the big uptick in small boat crossings in 2021.",
      "Of the 31 days between those dates, 26 fell into that category and 6,288 people crossed the  Channel.",
      "In the same period last year there were three red days and 768 arrivals.",
      "But expect to see the Conservatives brand this as a \u2018dog ate my homework excuse\u2019 or words to that effect.",
      "They will argue that the abandonment of the previous government\u2019s plan to send some migrants to Rwanda has meant the removal of a crucial deterrent to potential crossings.",
      "When Yvette Cooper and the shadow home secretary Chris Philp debate this in the Commons on Monday afternoon, we can expect the Rwanda policy to be a big part of the conversation.",
      "Cooper will attempt to, at least, partially itemise where the \u00a3700m spent on the idea went.",
      "She will claim that the cost of the four people who volunteered to go to Rwanda was the equivalent of the total cost of the state education of a single child in England.",
      "The home secretary will instead claim that focused on what is described as the \u2018upstream problem\u2019 \u2013 where smuggling gangs initially recruit people to make the long journeys to the West \u2013 is key.",
      "Last week she was in the Kurdistan region of Iraq to sign a deal to try to tackle the gangs and ensure the speedy return of failed Iraqi asylum seekers.",
      "Philp is expected to argue this deal is thin and the financial commitment is comparable with resurfacing a local road rather than the basis for a game-changing solution.",
      "Many of the arguments will be familiar as will the grapple for plausible, workable solutions - which were out of the grasp of the last government and, while it is early days, appear out of the grasp of the new one too."

    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer has appointed Sir Chris Wormald as his Cabinet Secretary - the head of the civil service and one of the most powerful jobs in government.",
      "Announcing the appointment, the prime minister said he wanted a \"complete re-wiring of the British state\" and that there was \"no-one better placed\" to do that than Sir Chris.",
      "As someone who has worked for the civil service since the early 1990s, Sir Chris has plenty of civil service experience.",
      "Depending on your perspective that either makes him an ideal candidate who understands how to fix the system's problems or an establishment figure, wedded to the status quo.",
      "His appointment was greeted with delight by Lord Jim Bethell, a former health minister who worked with Sir Chris during the Covid pandemic.",
      "\"When the killer zombies invade, I'd like Chris Wormald at my back,\" he posted on social media.",
      "Ex-health secretary Sajid Javid described Sir Chris as \"brilliant and dedicated\" while another former health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he was a \"natural reformer\" who knew \"where the bear-traps are\".",
      "However, another former colleague has been less complimentary.",
      "Dominic Cummings, a senior No 10 adviser during the pandemic, said: \"Today should be a wake-up call to all investors in UK and young talent.",
      "\"The Westminster system is totally determined to resist any change and will continue all the things of the past 20 years that have driven us into crisis.\"",
      "Chris Wormald to become new civil service head",
      "Cabinet Secretary to step down on health grounds",
      "What is the UK Covid inquiry and how does it work?",
      "In May 2016, Sir Chris became the most senior civil servant in the Department of Health and over the next eight years worked with no fewer than seven different secretaries of state from Conservative Jeremy Hunt through to Labour\u2019s Wes Streeting.",
      "In that role, he oversaw important policies and decisions made after Covid emerged. And also \u2013 crucially \u2013 in the years before the virus started spreading, when planning for a pandemic was meant to be taking place.",
      "He has already given evidence on three separate occasions to the public inquiry into the government\u2019s handling of the crisis.",
      "Following one of his evidence sessions, one lawyer for the Covid Bereaved Families for Justice group accused him of providing \"an object lesson in obfuscation, a word salad, so many, many words, so very little substance\".",
      "In November 2023, the Covid inquiry published text messages he exchanged with his then-boss, Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill.",
      "These were sent on 12 March 2020, less than two weeks before the country entered its first national lockdown.",
      "In the messages, Lord Sedwill wrote: \u201cPresumably like chickenpox we want people to get it and develop herd immunity before the next wave. We just want them not to get it all at once and preferably when it\u2019s warm and dry.\u201d",
      "Sir Chris replied: \u201cExactly right. We make the point every meeting, they don\u2019t quite get it.\"",
      "Around that time, the government was forced to deny it had a plan to develop so-called herd immunity by accepting that younger, fitter people would catch the virus.",
      "Asked about this at the time, Sir Chris accepted he had been \u201cvery, very loose\u201d in his language but was, in reality, following scientific advice.",
      "Writing on X following Sir Chris's appointment on Monday, Cummings was fiercely critical of his role at the time.",
      "\u201cMany officials came to me in panic when they realised the cabinet secretary and permanent secretary of the health department in charge of pandemic planning truly believed that the faster everyone got Covid, the better,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cHe is now in charge of the entire system. Plan accordingly!\u201d",
      "Cummings also accused Sir Chris of being \u201cembedded deeply\u201d in the infected blood scandal and repeatedly telling ministers \u201cuntruths about the documents\u201d.",
      "In 2018 Sir Chris did write letters of apology after it emerged two former health ministers were incorrectly told all documents linked to infected blood had been placed in the National Archives, when campaigners later established that was not the case.",
      "Three years later, in 2021, Sir Chris then recused himself from any decisions related to the scandal.",
      "It later emerged that his father Peter, who was himself a Department of Health official from 1978 to 1981, was involved in meetings and decisions related to Britain\u2019s Blood Products Laboratory and had provided written evidence to the infected blood inquiry.",
      "Sir Chris was born in London in 1968 and went to Rutlish School in Merton, the same school former Prime Minister Sir John Major had gone to over 20 years earlier.",
      "He studied at St John's College, Oxford and on graduating almost immediately joined the civil service, starting out as a fast stream trainee in the Department for Education.",
      "Over the next 20 years he rose through the ranks, serving across Whitehall including at the Department for Communities and Local Government and in the office of the then-Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.",
      "Now at the pinnacle of his career, it had been widely-known that Sir Chris was on the final shortlist to be the prime minister's new cabinet secretary, alongside Antonia Romeo, who leads the Ministry of Justice, and Tamara Finkelstein, the top civil servant at the environment department.",
      "Nevertheless his appointment came as a bit of a surprise in Westminster, where there was a feeling that Sir Chris's time had been and gone.",
      "While some civil servants privately share Cummings' assessment of their new boss, those in the health department may welcome the fact that the top job has been given to someone who understands the NHS.",
      "Getting down NHS waiting lists is one of the prime minister's priorities and he may have had this in mind when picking Sir Chris.",
      "Another factor in the selection could be Sir Chris's relatively low media profile.",
      "Bruised by the brief tenure of his well-known chief of staff Sue Gray, the prime minister will hope that Sir Chris largely continues to go under the radar of the wider public's consciousness."

      "US space agency Nasa has announced a further delay to its plans to send astronauts back to the Moon.",
      "The agency's chief, Bill Nelson, said the second mission in the Artemis programme was now due for launch in April 2026.",
      "The plan had been to send astronauts around the Moon but not land in September 2025. The date had already slipped once before, from November of this year.",
      "That will mean that a Moon landing will not take place until at least 2027, a year later than originally planned.",
      "The delay is needed to fix an issue with the capsule's heat shield, which returned from the previous test flight excessively charred and eroded, with cracks and some fragments broken off.",
      "Mr Nelson told a news conference that \"the safety of our astronauts is our North Star\".",
      "\"We do not fly until we are ready. We need to do the next test flight, and we need to do it right. And that's how the Artemis programme proceeds.\"",
      "Mr Nelson said that engineers had got to the root of the problem and believed that it could be fixed by changing the trajectory of the capsule's re-entry \u2013 but it would take time to carry out a thorough assessment.",
      "Nasa is in a race with the Chinese space agency, which has its own plans to send astronauts to the Moon. Mr Nelson said he was confident that the Artemis programme would reach the lunar surface first, but he called on Nasa's commercial and international partners to \"double down to meet and improve this schedule\".",
      "\"We plan to launch Artemis 3 in mid-2027. That will be well ahead of the Chinese government's announced intention that they have already publicly stated is 2030.\"",

      "\"SLS is an old-school rocket. It is not reusable like Starship, hence very expensive, and it has taken a long time to get it operational. And slow and expensive is a precarious position to be in when the incoming president, we expect, is looking to save costs.",
      "\"Isaacman is going to bring a new pair of eyes over how Nasa operates. And it's hard to predict what this combination of Isaacman, Musk and Trump might mean for Nasa as we know it.\""

    "story": [
      "For about two months each year, fisherman Faustino Mauloko da Cunha transforms his home along the South Pacific coast into a whale monitoring station.",
      "From the morning, villagers and student volunteers gather at the house in Subaun,  a village in the north of Timor-Leste. Armed with binoculars and telephoto cameras, they watch the cobalt waters for one of its great treasures - pygmy blue whales.",
      "When there is a sighting, it\u2019s all systems go.",
      "Faustino's son, Zacarias, dispatches a drone. Then the team\u2019s leader, Australian marine ecologist Karen Edyvane, guides him to take the best photographs. When the drone returns, the team reviews the pictures, taking notes on a white board.",
      "It's a small and thrifty operation in Timor-Leste, which is part of an archipelago that lies between South East Asia and the South Pacific. But it has generated a wealth of information about pygmy blue whales - one of the largest animals on earth, whose vast habitats and elusive nature make them challenging to study.",
      "These citizen science researchers, all of them locals, have spotted nearly 3,000 pygmy blue whales over the past 10 years - Prof Edyvane considers that a \u201ctruly extraordinary\u201d number.",
      "Timor-Leste has one of the world\u2019s highest concentrations of marine mammals.",
      "During the migration season - October and November - hundreds of pygmy blue whales pass through the country\u2019s waters as they make the epic journey spanning thousands of kilometres from the Banda Sea, which lies to the north of Timor-Leste, to southern Australia.",
      "But the area has been under-researched, says Prof Edyvane, who started the citizen science monitoring programme in 2014.",
      "During the last two whale seasons, she has based herself in Subaun, about 50km (31 miles) from the capital Dili, working with fishermen, students and dive tour operators to document the cetaceans.",
      "They have documented \"some of the lesser known, intimate reproductive behaviours of blue whales, some for the very first time,\" says Prof Edyvane, a researcher at Charles Darwin University and Australian National University.",
      "In 2022, for instance, tourists with a local tour operator invovlved in the programme captured underwater footage of a mother nursing her calf, offering a glimpse into the species\u2019 reproductive behaviours, which have remained largely unknown.",
      "\"It\u2019s very, very exciting,\u201d she adds.",
      "The programme started as a Facebook group, inviting local tour operators, fishermen and residents to share sightings of cetaceans.",
      "Prof Edyvane trained them on surveying methods and taught them how to use telephoto cameras and drones so that they could conduct aerial and boat surveys.",
      "\u201cWhen locals see the whales swimming by, they will post pictures on Facebook and WhatsApp. Updates come on a real-time basis and when someone shares something, everyone gets very excited,\u201d Prof Edyvane says.",
      "In 2016, the team worked with a dive tour operator to launch the first whale-watching tour.",
      "It was only last year that they set up a \u201cresearch station\u201d outside the da Cunha\u2019s village home - photos show a simple hut overlooking the bay. Outside are two tables, plastic chairs and white boards mounted on the hut's walls.",
      "During this year's whale season, undergraduates from the National University of East Timor and University Oriental Timor-Leste gathered at the research station to help with the sightings.",
      "Even such a basic structure has made the task easier.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re able to monitor all day and all night,\" Prof Edyvane says. \"We\u2019ve also been able to get the most incredible footage. The whales come in so close sometimes we can actually hear their blows.\"",
      "Citizen researchers like these have become powerful eyes and ears on the ground for marine scientists, says wildlife scientist Vanessa Pirotta.",
      "\u201cThe combination of people having access to tools like drones and social media means we have insights into things that are happening while we may be behind the desk writing grants to fund our work,\u201d she said.",
      "The increase in research activity in Subaun has also led to a rise in tourism.",
      "The demand for whale-watching tours has increased, diving instructor Cassio Schumacher tells the BBC, adding that these tours are \u201cbooked up years in advance\u201d.",
      "Local non-profits have warned of the risks of unregulated whale tourism and the government has said it intends to use Prof Edyvane's research  to \u201cfully protect and conserve\" the marine life that pass through Timor-Leste\u2019s waters.",
      "Prof Edyvane believes that with regulation, whale tourism has the potential to create jobs and grow Timor-Leste\u2019s economy.",
      "The country is one of the poorest in the world, where average annual incomes in cities hover around $1,500, according to the International Monetary Fund. In Subaun, most villagers work as subsistence fishermen and farmers, earning just about $600 to $900 a year.",
      "The da Cunha family has now started preparing meals from local produce and the day\u2019s catch for the students and tourists - an additional source of income.",

      "Wildlife campaigners have argued that improved protection methods, including trained sheep dogs, would be a better solution than removing safeguards.

      "Another argument against shooting wolves is that they hunt in packs of five to eight, usually a pair and their offspring. If the older wolves are shot, the pack fragments, making it harder for them to catch deer and wild boar.",
      "\u201cIndividual wolves are more likely to attack sheep and other domesticated animals,\u201d Mr Haring explains.",

      "On Monday, the government promised \"to ban the use of neonicotinoid pesticides that threaten bees and other vital pollinators.\u201d",
      "The Office for Environmental Protection is currently investigating Defra's emergency authorisation for the use of a type of neonicotinoid on sugar beet seeds in 2023 and 2024.",
      "The watchdog is exploring whether the government failed to comply with environmental laws when it previously granted the use of the banned pesticide.",
      "Neonicotinoids are a group of insecticides used in agriculture, horticulture and veterinary medicine to control pests - but they also harm bees and other beneficial insects.",

      "But environmental charities are calling on the government \"enforce and extend\" the ban on the use of Neonicotinoid to protect plant and animal health. The charities are also calling for better river monitoring by the agency.",
      "Dr Richard Gill, principle researcher at Imperial College, said that while high concentrations of neonicotinoids can kill bees, smaller quantities can also have \"cumulative, sub-lethal\" effects on the pollinators, changing their behaviour and even impacting their genes.",
      "Under the influence of neonicotinoids, bees can struggle to fly, and \"seem to bring back less pollen\" to their hives, Dr Gill said.",
      "The latest analysis of Environment Agency figures comes against a backdrop of declining bee populations across the country.",
      "A number of factors - including changes in the use of agricultural land, urbanisation, the impact of climate change, pesticide use and emerging pathogens - means many bee species are \"not doing very well\", Dr Gill said.",

      "1. The mysterious creator of Bitcoin",
      "Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto.",
      "They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email.",
      "Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers.",
      "But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out.",
      "In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be a false lead caused by some mistranslated information.",
      "Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi.",
      "Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him.",
      "2. Making history... with pizza",
      "Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza.",
      "On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas.",
      "A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day.",
      "A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online.",
      "Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin.",
      "The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars!",
      "3. Becoming legal tender",
      "In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender.",
      "Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar.",
      "Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country.",
      "While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped.",
      "He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country.",
      "As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years.",
      "The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country.",
      "It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value.",
      "A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value.",
      "4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust",
      "In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions.",
      "These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part.",
      "Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves.",
      "At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment.",
      "But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts.",
      "Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth.",
      "Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact.",
      "5. Bitcoins in the rubbish dump",
      "Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (\u00a378m) - and then  accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details.",
      "That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him",
      "The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline.",
      "Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling.\"",
      "6. Crypto King fraudster",
      "No-one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community.",
      "FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days.",
      "Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research.",
      "Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: \"I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.\"",
      "After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years.",
      "7. Investment bank boom",
      "Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies.",
      "In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any.",
      "Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs.",
      "It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined.",

      "Many premium products claim to accurately track exercise routines, body temperature, heart rate, menstrual cycle and sleep patterns, among others.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting has talked about a proposal to give wearables to millions of NHS patients in England, enabling them to track symptoms such as reactions to cancer treatments, from home.",
      "But many doctors \u2013 and tech experts \u2013 remain cautious about using health data captured by wearables.",
      "I\u2019m currently trying out a smart ring from the firm Ultrahuman \u2013 and it seemed to know that I was getting sick before I did.",
      "It alerted me one weekend that my temperature was slightly elevated, and my sleep had been restless. It warned me that this could be a sign I was coming down with something.",
      "I tutted something about the symptoms of perimenopause and ignored it - but two days later I was laid up in bed with gastric flu.",
      "I didn\u2019t need medical assistance, but if I had \u2013 would the data from my wearable have helped healthcare professionals with my treatment? Many wearable brands actively encourage this.",
      "The Oura smart ring, for example, offers a service where patients can download their data in the form of a report to share with their doctor.",
      "Dr Jake Deutsch, a US-based clinician who also advises Oura, says wearable data enables him to \u201cassess overall health more precisely\u201d \u2013 but not all doctors agree that it\u2019s genuinely useful all of the time.",
      "Dr Helen Salisbury is a GP at a busy practice in Oxford. She says not many patients come in brandishing their wearables, but she\u2019s noticed it has increased, and it concerns her.",
      "\u201cI think for the number of times when it\u2019s useful there\u2019s probably more times that it\u2019s not terribly useful, and I worry that we are building a society of hypochondria and over-monitoring of our bodies,\u201d she says.",
      "Dr Salisbury says there can be a large number of reasons why we might temporarily get abnormal data such as an increased heart rate, whether it\u2019s a blip in our bodies or a device malfunction - and many of them do not require further investigation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we will be encouraging people to monitor everything all the time, and see their doctor every time the machine thinks they\u2019re ill, rather than when they think they\u2019re ill.\u201d",
      "And she makes a further point about the psychological use of this data as a kind of insurance policy against shock health diagnoses. A nasty cancerous tumour for example, is not necessarily going to be flagged by a watch or an app, she says.",
      "What wearables do is encourage good habits - but the best message you can take from them is the same advice doctors have been giving us for years. Dr Salisbury adds: \u201cThe thing you can actually do is walk more, don\u2019t drink too much alcohol, try and maintain a healthy weight. That never changes.\u201d",
      "The Apple Watch is reported to be the world\u2019s best-selling smart watch, although sales have slowed lately.",
      "Apple didn't comment, but the tech giant uses true stories of people whose lives have been saved because of the heart tracking function of the device in its marketing, and anecdotally I have heard plenty of those too. What I haven\u2019t heard however, is how many cases of false positives there are.",
      "In many cases when patients present their data to healthcare professionals, clinicians prefer to try to recreate it using their own equipment, rather than simply trust what the wearable has captured.",
      "There are several reasons for this, says Dr Yang Wei, associate professor in wearable technologies at Nottingham Trent University  \u2013 and they\u2019re all very practical.",
      "\u201cWhen you go to hospital, and you measure your ECG [electrocardiogram, a test that checks the activity of your heart], you don\u2019t worry about power consumption because the machine is plugged into the wall,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cOn your watch, you\u2019re not going to measure your ECG continuously because you drain your battery straight away.\u201d",
      "In addition, movement \u2013 both of the wearable itself on a wrist, for example, and general movement of the person wearing it - can \u201ccreate noise\u201d in the data it collects, he adds, making it less reliable.",
      "Dr Wei points to the ring on my finger.",
      "\u201cThe gold standard to measure the heart rate is from the wrist or direct from the heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you measure from the finger, you\u2019re sacrificing accuracy.\"",
      "It is the role of software to fill in such data gaps, he says - but there\u2019s no international standard for wearables here - for either the sensors and software that power wearable devices, or for the data itself, and even what format it is gathered in.",
      "The more consistently a device is worn, the more accurate its data is likely to be. But here\u2019s a cautionary tale.",
      "Ben Wood was out for the day when his wife received a series of alarming notifications from his Apple Watch, telling her he had been in a car crash. It advised her to text him rather than call because he may need to keep the line clear for the emergency services.",
      "The alerts were genuine, and sent to her as his emergency contact \u2013 but in this case unnecessary. Ben was out at a race track driving some fast cars. He admitted that he \u201cwasn\u2019t very gifted\u201d at it \u2013 but said he felt safe at all times.",
      "\u201cThe boundaries between incident and alert need to be managed carefully,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see how device-makers, emergency services, first responders and individuals think about this technology in the future.\u201d",
      "Pritesh Mistry, digital technologies fellow at the Kings Fund, agrees that there are significant challenges around folding current patient-generated data into our healthcare systems, and adds that the discussion has already been going on for several years in the UK without any clear resolution.",
      "He says there\u2019s \u201ca good case to be made\u201d for the use of wearables in the UK government\u2019s current drive to push care out of hospitals and into community settings.",
      "\u201cBut without that underpinning foundation of technology enablement in terms of the infrastructure, and supporting the workforce to have the skills, knowledge, capacity and confidence, I think it\u2019s going to be a challenge,\u201d he adds.",

      "Blanchett, 55, was promoting her new film Rumours - an apocalyptic comedy about a group of world leaders trapped in a forest.",
      "\"Our film looks like a sweet little documentary compared to what's going on in the world,\" she said.",

      "The film's director, Guy Maddin, added that he intentionally does not reveal the ideologies or allegories of the characters because \"there's an attempt when making sense of a movie for an audience to project on to it a message, a lesson, to find themselves in it\".",
      "Maddin explained that he started creating the characters \"from a point of sheer contempt\", but as the film progresses and more ludicrous things start to happen \"you feel for them a little bit\".",

      "She asked ChatGPT for suggestions for a gift for a nine-year old who loves the outdoors.",
      "\u201cIt recommended a slackline \u2013 like a tight rope - as well as a fishing kit and survival kit. He lives in a woodland area, and I was really impressed, I hadn\u2019t thought of those gifts.",
      "\"I find it hard to trawl the internet; I don\u2019t want the faff. This saves you a lot of time. It\u2019s better for suggestions than just asking Google.\"",
      "As a result, she\u2019ll be wrapping a slackline for him this Christmas.",
      "This year, Brits are expected are expected to spend \u00a328.6bn on Christmas gifts, up from \u00a327.6bn last year, according to research from comparison platform Finder, with an average spend of \u00a3596 per person.",
      "And now gen AI is becoming part of the shopping process, with an increasing number of people using it for inspiration for Christmas presents this season.",
      "A recent global survey by Accenture found that the vast majority (95%) of consumers agree that gen AI could help them find better gifts, while 90% value the recommendations that gen AI tools provide.",
      "While many people will be turning to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google's Gemini to source ideas, there are also dedicated AI gift generators attracting Christmas shoppers needing a helping hand this Christmas.",

      "The company launched the AI gift chatbot a year ago, but have since improved it to make it more of a conversational experience.",
      "\u201cBefore it would give you five ideas, it wasn\u2019t something you could go back and forth with. We found people wanted that,\" says the firm's chief executive Jon Jaklitsch.",

      "In a way, services like those replicate how shopping used to be, says Linda Ellett, UK head of consumer and retail at accountancy firm KPMG.",
      "\u201cThis is how it used to be with retailers. You used to go into a store and ask them for advice if you are looking for something, like a birthday present for a niece. Online never had that aspect and this gives them a chance to do that.\u201d",
      "She says gen AI platforms have the potential to really shake-up how we search for products.",
      "\u201cIf this becomes the norm, then it brings about big changes in how consumers are routed through to the sites of retailers, and poses questions for the likes of advertising and sponsored link costs via search engines,\u201d says Ms Ellett.",
      "For some, the AI experience has been a mixed shopping bag.",
      "London-based Polly Arrowsmith says she\u2019s a good present giver, but her interest in tech meant she was intrigued to see how successful AI would be, and if it would trump her own ideas.",

      "\u201cMy sister is 60 and has a stressful job, so I said she likes walking, relaxation and Neom candles,\u201d says the director of marketing.",
      "\u201cIt was vague with its suggestions, and came back with generic results like a tote bag and diary, and posters with inspirational quotes which my sister would think I had lost the plot if I gave her that. It didn\u2019t offer specific products.\u201d",
      "Strangely, however, it was very specific when it came to generating ideas for her partner, who she added to ChatGPT that he was male, 47, and likes technology.",
      "\"I was impressed as it came up with a particular pair of noise cancelling headphones which I thought he might like.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt assumed he might like a foot massage machine, a personalised walking stick, or a meal delivery service. It looked at his age and not his interests. It assumed if he is 83 then he must be on physical decline. But he is very fit; he\u2019s a member of two walking clubs.\u201d",
      "Overall, Ms Arrowsmith says she thinks AI would be a useful tool for someone who didn\u2019t know where to start.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good starting point, but I feel like you need to know something about that person to begin with.\u201d",

      "The 29-year-old was busy repairing a taxi under the shade of a mango tree when the BBC met him at his home in the small town of Kasoa, about 30km (18 miles) from the capital Accra.",
      "He often spoke of \"the hardship\" - a phrase that has become common in Ghana since the nation plunged into a deep economic crisis in 2022.",
      "This was the year when the government defaulted on its debt repayments, international rating agencies downgraded Ghana's creditworthiness to \"junk status\", and inflation skyrocketed to 54%. To add to the woes of Ghanaians, their currency, the cedi, has lost 70% of its value in the past eight years.",
      "This forced Ghana to secure a $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The economic recovery efforts have been costly, resulting in significant losses for pensioners and investors who held government bonds.",
      "All this has made Mr Qainoo so despondent that he does not intend to vote in Saturday's presidential and parliamentary elections, though the electoral commission is confident that voter turnout will be high.",
      "\"I don't know how this country is going to be saved from this crisis,\" Mr Qainoo told the BBC.",
      "His mind is on emigrating to North America or Europe.",
      "\"I would like to leave the country, go outside, live better, work harder,\" Mr Qainoo added.",

      "They see few job prospects in a country with an unemployment rate of 14%.",
      "So it is not surprising that the economy has dominated the election campaign.",
      "The two main presidential front-runners are:",
      "Former President John Mahama, who is hoping to barrel his way back to power like Donald Trump, and",

      "The two are vying to succeed President Nana Akufo-Addo. He is stepping down at the end of his two terms, with Ghanaians hoping for a smooth transfer of power to ensure that Ghana retains its reputation as stable democracy.",
      "Contesting the election under the banner of the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP), Bawumia's major handicap is incumbency.",
      "Holding a masters in economics from the UK's prestigious Oxford University, he heads the government's economic management team, and the collapsing economy has tarnished his reputation as an \"economic whizzkid\".",
      "He was mocked in 2023 as \"our Maguire\" - a reference to Manchester United footballer Harry Maguire, who had been performing badly on the pitch at the time.",
      "On the campaign trail, Bawumia preferred to call himself \"the driver's mate\" - a phrase used in Ghana to describe a commercial vehicle driver's assistant, as he sought to distance himself from decisions taken under Akufo-Addo's watch.",
      "\"We may be tired of hearing it, but there is no avoiding the fact that the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war resulted in the greatest economic depression in the world since the 1990s with most countries recording negative GDP growth,\" he said.",
      "Bawumia has criss-crossed the country in a blue-coloured bus, with his image emblazoned on it alongside his campaign slogan: \"It is possible\" - a reference to the fact that he can win, and stimulate economic growth.",
      "No party in Ghana has ever won more than two consecutive terms since the country restored democracy in 1992, a tradition the NPP says it is determined to break by ensuring that it wins a parliamentary majority and Bawumia the presidency.",
      "The centrepiece of his campaign is a promise to create a \"digital economy\",  with skills training for one million young people in a bid to put a dent in the unemployment rate.",
      "\"Dr Bawumia\u2019s government plans to invest in a digital economy hub and provide venture capital funding for tech start-ups,\" his campaign website says.",
      "\"This will include creating innovation hubs, providing regulatory incentives, and supporting tech entrepreneurs with mentorship and business development resources,\" it adds.",
      "Ghanaian political analyst Clement Sefa Nyarko told the BBC that Bawumia's promise to create a \"digital economy\" was his biggest electoral drawcard.",
      "\"Bawumia has transitioned from being a so-called economic wizzkid to a digitalisation champion and I think that\u2019s one of the big things he is riding on,\" Dr Nyarko said.",
      "\"In fact, if you see his posters in town, he has this symbol of digitalisation, suggesting that he is the man to take Ghana forward,\" he added.",
      "As for Mahama, his campaign has focused on a promise to \"reset\" the economy, with the essence of his message being, as Dr Nyarko put it: \"Give me a chance. At least the economy didn\u2019t crash under my watch despite the difficulties.\"",
      "But his critics have doubts, pointing out that Ghana plunged into an electricity crisis when he was in office from 2014 to 2017 so they do not see how a man who could not keep the lights on can reset the economy.",
      "This - along with the fact that his government was dogged by corruption allegations,  which he dismissed as politically motivated - led to him failing to win a second term in 2017.",
      "The power cuts were so bad that Mahama joked at the time that he was  known as \"Mr Dumsor\" -  dum means off and sor means on in the local Twi language.",
      "In this campaign, Mahama - the flagbearer of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) - has promised to make Ghana a \"24-hour economy\" through the creation of night-time jobs in both the public and private sectors.",
      "\"All the major and most prosperous economies in the world operate various degrees of 24-hour economies.",
      "\"They include the United States, where nearly 30% of the labour force work at night; the United Kingdom (19%); Germany (12%) and France (7%). In Africa, Kenya is contemplating a 24-hour economy,\" a document outlining his economic strategy says.",
      "In order to ease the cost-of-living crisis, both candidates have also promised to scrap some taxes, including the much-criticised electronic levy on mobile transactions and the levy on the carbon emissions produced by petrol or diesel-powered vehicles.",
      "Economist Prof Godfred Bokpin told the BBC it was unclear how the two candidates would fulfil their promise as it would create a \"fiscal gap\", at a time when Ghana was under an IMF-backed economic recovery programme that required the government to increase its revenue and slash expenditure.",
      "\"They will face a challenge in terms of navigating within the IMF-supported programme,\" he added.",
      "Political analyst Asa Asante told the BBC that he expected a close race between Mahama and Bawunia.",
      "\"Politics is nothing but a contest of ideas and a referendum of your work. People are going to see which one will really work the magic and of course what are their records,\" he added.",
      "The political odds appear to be in Mahama's favour, with an opinion poll released on Monday by Global InfoAnalytics giving him 52% of the vote to Bawumia's 41.3%.",
      "But with the poll having a margin of error of 1.9%, some analysts say Mahama could fall short of crossing the 50% mark, forcing a run-off.",
      "Bawumia's campaign team has dismissed the poll as skewed, saying they are confident of propelling him to the presidency on Saturday - and making history by giving Ghana its first Muslim president.",

      "Before the start of the rebel offensive, the government had regained control of Syria's main cities with the help of Russia, Iran and Iran-backed militias. However, large parts of the country remained out of its control.",
      "The rebels' last stronghold was in Aleppo and Idlib provinces, which border Turkey and where more than four million people were living, many of them displaced from government-held areas.",

      "HTS and its allies said on 27 November that they had launched an offensive to \"deter aggression\", accusing the government and allied Iran-backed militias of escalating attacks on civilians in the north-west.",

      "The Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah, which was crucial in helping push back rebels in the early years of the war, has suffered recently from Israel's offensive in Lebanon. Its new leader Naim Qassem said on Thursday that it would \"be by Syria's side in thwarting the goals of this aggression as much as we can\".",

      "A tsunami warning was initially issued along the coasts of both northern California and southern Oregon - an area that includes about 4.7 million people - but was later rescinded.",
      "The earthquake's epicentre hit closest to the town of Ferndale, California, a small city in Humboldt County about 260 miles (418km) north of San Francisco.",
      "Local officials said no deaths or major widespread damage had been reported in the aftermath of the quake, which is one of only nine such 7 magnitude quakes to strike globally this year.",
      "Humboldt County Sheriff's Office told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, there had been no catastrophic destruction to buildings or infrastructure, but some homes did report minor damage.",
      "Several stores in the area reported items falling off shelves and power briefly went out for many residents, the sheriff's office said.",
      "More than 10,000 people were without power in Humboldt County after the earthquake struck, according to poweroutage.us.",
      "While the earthquake did not cause widespread damage, one resident of Ferndale who spoke to the BBC in the minutes following the quake said the inside of the building she was in \"looks like a bomb has gone off in every room\".",
      "Olivia Cobian, the innkeeper at the Gingerbread Mansion Inn in Ferndale, said the inside of the inn now \"looks like a warzone\".",
      "\"We have huge cast iron fireplaces that have been lifted up and moved over, everything's fallen over, broken\".",
      "Another who witnessed the quake was Todd Dunaway, who was eating lunch in his home in Fortuna, California when the earthquake hit.",
      "\"It literally felt like standing on a giant waterbed,\" he told the BBC. \"The noise of rattling windows, creaking walls, falling dishes and decorations added to the drama and scariness of it all as it is happening. Naturally - you can't help wonder as it is happening 'Is this the really big one?'\"",
      "Mr Dunaway said he and his wife - who was also in the house - were shaking nervously for 15 minutes afterwards waiting to see if there would be a bigger aftershock.",
      "His large swimming pool was still sloshing ferociously for minutes after the shaking stopped and lost about 18 inches (45cm) of water.",
      "His sporting goods store experienced some damage, with boxes of shoes falling from the shelves, but nothing major, he said.",
      "Multiple aftershocks were reported after the initial earthquake, which struck around 10:44 local time (18:44 GMT).",
      "Some areas, including the city of Berkeley in northern California, issued an evacuation order due to the threat of a possible tsunami.",
      "\"EVACUATE NOW,\" an X post from the city warned. \"People in the Tsunami Zone are in IMMEDIATE DANGER and MUST EVACUATE NOW. Stay east of 7th St. This is a lawful order to leave now.\"",
      "Kayla Aihara was staying at a hotel in Half Moon Bay, California and got the back-to-back alerts about the earthquake and potential tsunami.",
      "Before the tsunami warning was cancelled, workers at the hotel had told her to vacate a gym and go to higher ground out of fear of the tsunami's impacts.",
      "Some vacated outside and she said multiple people crowded near the shoreline of the Pacific Coast hotel, watching the waves and waiting to see any hints of a tsunami.",
      "California Governor Gavin Newsom was briefed on the earthquake and met with state emergency officials to help coordinate the response.",
      "At an event along the US-Mexico border, the governor announced he'd signed a state of emergency declaration to help free resources to respond to the earthquake.",
      "He said the earthquake is \"another reminder of the state that we live in and the state of mind that we need to bring to our day-to-day reality here in the state of California\".",
      "Tsunami signs line the roads of many coastal communities along the US West Coast. They mark any \"tsunami hazard zone\" and often point those in the area to evacuation routes leading them to higher ground.",
      "Those who live in these tsunami zones are encouraged to familiarise themselves with their evacuation routes and have a kit ready for quick evacuation.",
      "California's emergency services website notes a tsunami can hit in as little as 5 to 10 minutes after a large earthquake and sometimes the first wave to hit is not the biggest. It notes if you see water draw out from the shoreline and go out to sea quickly, \"escape immediately to higher ground or inland\".",
      "The US West Coast is the confluence of a number of the Earth's tectonic plates, and tremors are not uncommon. But a strong 7 magnitude quake isn't typically seen in the region. Experts say there are between 10 and 15 earthquakes of this magnitude that hit globally each year.",

      "A Boeing plea deal intended to resolve a case related to two fatal crashes of its planes has been rejected by a US judge.",

      "Those issues had also been raised by some families of those killed on the flights, who had criticised it as a \"sweetheart\" arrangement that did not properly hold the firm to account for the deaths.",
      "Judge O'Connor also focused on the deal's requirements that race be considered when hiring the monitor,  which he said would undermine confidence in the person hired.",
      "\"In a case of this magnitude, it is in the utmost interest of justice that the public is confident this monitor selection is done based solely on competency,\" he wrote.",

      "The incident reignited questions about what Boeing had done to improve its safety and quality record since the accidents, which were tied to the company's flight control system.",
      "The door panel malfunction happened shortly before the end of a three-year period of increased monitoring and reporting.",
      "Boeing had agreed to the monitoring as part of a 2021 plea deal to resolve a charge it had deceived regulators over the flight control system.",

      "Last week, Trump threatened he would impose a blanket 25% tariff on both countries when he takes office in January unless they secured their shared borders with the US.",
      "Canadian officials were quick to distance their country's border issues from those of Mexico, arguing that drug smuggling and unlawful crossings at the southern border were much higher, and that Mexico was serving as a \"back door\" in North America for Chinese investment.",
      "Those remarks have not gone unnoticed in Mexico.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum told the Associated Press this week that \u201cMexico must be respected, especially by its trading partners\u201d.",
      "She added that Canada had its own social problems with fentanyl use, adding the country \u201ccould only wish they had the cultural riches Mexico has\u201d.",

      "'It's going to be hard': US firms race to get ahead of Trump tariffs",
      "Sheinbaum's remarks came after Canada's US ambassador, Kirsten Hillman, told the news agency that during a recent dinner at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Florida residence, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the president-elect that the northern border was \"vastly different than the Mexican border\".",
      "Doug Ford, leader of Ontario, Canada's most populous province, said last week that lumping Canada and Mexico together on border security - given the differences between the two boundaries - was \"the most insulting thing\" he has heard from the US, a long-time close ally of Canada.",
      "Canadian officials have also tried to position the US and Canada as a united front against China, while saying they share concerns that China was using Mexico as a backdoor to flood the North American market with cheap imports.",

      "The country also plans to impose a 25% duty on Chinese steel and aluminium.",
      "Mexico has not levied a similarly steep tariff.",
      "At the moment, all three countries are under a North American trade agreement that was renegotiated during Trump's first term. It is up for renegotiation again in 2026.",

      "\"They've had an opportunity to fix these concerns for years and they just don't want to,\" Ford said in late November.",
      "Trudeau has said that while Canada preferred Mexico remain a united North American trade partner, \u201cwe may have to look at other options\" if the country doesn't address China trade.",
      "Marta Leardi-Anderson, the executive director of the Cross-Border Institute at the University of Windsor - an Ontario city connected by a bridge to Detroit, Michigan - said Ford's comments are likely a reflection of Ontario's deep reliance on its US trade relationship.",
      "The province is at the heart of the highly integrated auto industry in Canada, and trade between Ontario and the US totalled more than C$493bn ($350bn) in 2023.",
      "\"That's a huge amount of economic energy from just one region of the country,\" Ms Leardi-Anderson said.",
      "She added that Trump's views on tariffs and border security have forced Mexico and Canada - also long-time allies - to dissect the shortcomings in their relationship in ways they have not done before.",
      "These comments were seen as a betrayal by Mexico's lead trade negotiator, Gutierrez Romano, who told Canadian newspaper the Globe and Mail last week that \"it is not rational to be divided against the United States\".",
      "Ford's comments and Trudeau's perceived silence about them were also seen as offensive by some of the Mexican public, says Oliver Sant\u00edn Pe\u00f1a, a professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.",
      "\"Ultimately, it is not a good time in the bilateral relationship [between Canada and Mexico],\" Mr Pe\u00f1a told the BBC, noting the nations have enjoyed a steady relationship for 85 years.",

      "\"She would not fall for provocations,\" Mr Pe\u00f1a said, but also wants to communicate \"that her country should be respected\".",
      "Sheinbaum, who took office in October, is still establishing herself in the role and the country's first woman president and has taken the position that Mexico is to be respected as a full and equal partner, particularly by its North American neighbours.",

      "US border agents have seized 43lbs (19.5kg) of fentanyl at the northern border between October 2023 and this September, compared to more than 21,000lbs at the southern border.",
      "Over the same period, there were just under 200,000 migrant encounters at the northern border, and more than two million at the southern border.",
      "Canada has promised to beef up border security since Trump's surprise tariff threat.",

    "story": [
      "For about two months each year, fisherman Faustino Mauloko da Cunha transforms his home along the South Pacific coast into a whale monitoring station.",
      "From the morning, villagers and student volunteers gather at the house in Subaun,  a village in the north of Timor-Leste. Armed with binoculars and telephoto cameras, they watch the cobalt waters for one of its great treasures - pygmy blue whales.",
      "When there is a sighting, it\u2019s all systems go.",
      "Faustino's son, Zacarias, dispatches a drone. Then the team\u2019s leader, Australian marine ecologist Karen Edyvane, guides him to take the best photographs. When the drone returns, the team reviews the pictures, taking notes on a white board.",
      "It's a small and thrifty operation in Timor-Leste, which is part of an archipelago that lies between South East Asia and the South Pacific. But it has generated a wealth of information about pygmy blue whales - one of the largest animals on earth, whose vast habitats and elusive nature make them challenging to study.",
      "These citizen science researchers, all of them locals, have spotted nearly 3,000 pygmy blue whales over the past 10 years - Prof Edyvane considers that a \u201ctruly extraordinary\u201d number.",
      "Timor-Leste has one of the world\u2019s highest concentrations of marine mammals.",
      "During the migration season - October and November - hundreds of pygmy blue whales pass through the country\u2019s waters as they make the epic journey spanning thousands of kilometres from the Banda Sea, which lies to the north of Timor-Leste, to southern Australia.",
      "But the area has been under-researched, says Prof Edyvane, who started the citizen science monitoring programme in 2014.",
      "During the last two whale seasons, she has based herself in Subaun, about 50km (31 miles) from the capital Dili, working with fishermen, students and dive tour operators to document the cetaceans.",
      "They have documented \"some of the lesser known, intimate reproductive behaviours of blue whales, some for the very first time,\" says Prof Edyvane, a researcher at Charles Darwin University and Australian National University.",
      "In 2022, for instance, tourists with a local tour operator invovlved in the programme captured underwater footage of a mother nursing her calf, offering a glimpse into the species\u2019 reproductive behaviours, which have remained largely unknown.",
      "\"It\u2019s very, very exciting,\u201d she adds.",
      "The programme started as a Facebook group, inviting local tour operators, fishermen and residents to share sightings of cetaceans.",
      "Prof Edyvane trained them on surveying methods and taught them how to use telephoto cameras and drones so that they could conduct aerial and boat surveys.",
      "\u201cWhen locals see the whales swimming by, they will post pictures on Facebook and WhatsApp. Updates come on a real-time basis and when someone shares something, everyone gets very excited,\u201d Prof Edyvane says.",
      "In 2016, the team worked with a dive tour operator to launch the first whale-watching tour.",
      "It was only last year that they set up a \u201cresearch station\u201d outside the da Cunha\u2019s village home - photos show a simple hut overlooking the bay. Outside are two tables, plastic chairs and white boards mounted on the hut's walls.",
      "During this year's whale season, undergraduates from the National University of East Timor and University Oriental Timor-Leste gathered at the research station to help with the sightings.",
      "Even such a basic structure has made the task easier.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re able to monitor all day and all night,\" Prof Edyvane says. \"We\u2019ve also been able to get the most incredible footage. The whales come in so close sometimes we can actually hear their blows.\"",
      "Citizen researchers like these have become powerful eyes and ears on the ground for marine scientists, says wildlife scientist Vanessa Pirotta.",
      "\u201cThe combination of people having access to tools like drones and social media means we have insights into things that are happening while we may be behind the desk writing grants to fund our work,\u201d she said.",
      "The increase in research activity in Subaun has also led to a rise in tourism.",
      "The demand for whale-watching tours has increased, diving instructor Cassio Schumacher tells the BBC, adding that these tours are \u201cbooked up years in advance\u201d.",
      "Local non-profits have warned of the risks of unregulated whale tourism and the government has said it intends to use Prof Edyvane's research  to \u201cfully protect and conserve\" the marine life that pass through Timor-Leste\u2019s waters.",
      "Prof Edyvane believes that with regulation, whale tourism has the potential to create jobs and grow Timor-Leste\u2019s economy.",
      "The country is one of the poorest in the world, where average annual incomes in cities hover around $1,500, according to the International Monetary Fund. In Subaun, most villagers work as subsistence fishermen and farmers, earning just about $600 to $900 a year.",
      "The da Cunha family has now started preparing meals from local produce and the day\u2019s catch for the students and tourists - an additional source of income.",
      "\u201cWe enjoyed having the guests around and will love to do it again,\" Faustino, 51, tells the BBC on a WhatsApp video call.  \"We will make it a better experience [next season].\"",
      "His son, Zacarias, has also been contracted to provide drone services for the project. Prof Edyvane says she plans to train him to give talks about whales in English.",
      "The 26-year-old says what he appreciates is that the visitors are learning to protect the area: \u201cThe university students learn fast and well to defend this area.\"",

      "Thirty years ago, on 5 December 1994, at a ceremony in Budapest, Ukraine joined Belarus and Kazakhstan in giving up their nuclear arsenals in return for security guarantees from the United States, the UK, France, China and Russia.",
      "Strictly speaking, the missiles belonged to the Soviet Union, not to its newly independent former republics.",

      "\u201cBut it was a political issue. The top leadership made the decision and we just carried out the orders.\u201d",
      "At the time, it all seemed to make perfect sense. No-one thought Russia would attack Ukraine within 20 years.",

      "Macron certainly liked to compare himself with le grand Charles.",
      "But when De Gaulle had a similar government crisis in 1962, he went to the people and received a huge popular mandate in the next election.",
      "Macron has done the reverse. He has had his vote \u2013 the botched election in July \u2013 and lost it. Power has now shifted out of his hands into those of the putative prime minister, answerable to parliament.",
      "But just as the country reverts to being more of a parliamentary system, the Assembly itself has proved incapable of action.",
      "As more than one commentator has pointed out,  France \u2013 with its monarchical instincts and top-down conception of power \u2013 has never developed a culture of compromise.",
      "So the three blocs in the Assembly today \u2013 installed by the voters after Macron\u2019s dissolution in June \u2013 have proved incapable of creating a constructive environment for government.",
      "As the veteran journalist Eric Brunet said after viewing the debate this evening on BFMTV: \u201cWhat we have just seen is jaw-droppingly French.",
      "\u201cNo pragmatism. Just ideology. All the speeches were about values, about extremes. Our whole discourse is disconnected from reality. It is typically, singularly French.\u201d",
      "Some see it as the culmination of years of France refusing to face economic reality \u2013 governments of all colours having given way to calls for ever-growing public spending. The result is a deficit and a debt which can only be addressed by cuts,  which no government can ever get passed.",
      "According to Nicolas Beytout, of the pro-business L\u2019Opinion newspaper,  this is the start of a series of crises which \u2013 counterintuitively \u2013 the country actually needs.  Because only by being brought face-to-face with the economic abyss, will voters, parties \u2013 the country \u2013 accept the tough decisions that lie ahead.",
      "Beytout predicts that any new prime minister will face the same problems as Barnier, and like him fail.",
      "\u201cA new government needs time, which it won\u2019t have. It needs a majority, which it won\u2019t have. And it needs the determination to see through the necessary reduction in state spending \u2013 which it won\u2019t have.",

      "UnitedHealthcare boss Brian Thompson, 50, was fatally shot in the back on Wednesday morning outside the Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan.",
      "The attacker fled the scene without taking any of Thompson's belongings. Police believe the victim was targeted in a pre-planned killing.",
      "Investigators are also using facial recognition technology and bullet casings with cryptic messages written on them to track down the suspect. They have yet to reveal a motive in the shooting.",
      "Here's what we know about the suspect and the investigation.",
      "How did the shooting and escape happen?",
      "The shooting took place at about 06:45 EST (11:45 GMT) in a busy part of Manhattan close to Times Square and Central Park. Thompson had been scheduled to speak at an investor conference later in the day.",
      "According to police, the suspect - who was clad in a black face mask and light brown or cream-coloured jacket - appeared to be waiting for Thompson for five minutes outside the Hilton hotel where he was expected to speak.",
      "Thompson, who arrived on foot, was shot in the back and leg, and was pronounced dead about half an hour later at a local hospital.",

      "New York Police Department (NYPD) Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny has revealed that the suspect's weapon appeared to jam, but that he was able to quickly fix it and keep shooting.",
      "CCTV footage appears to show the gunman had fitted a suppressor, also known as a silencer, to his pistol, BBC Verify has established.",
      "New York City Mayor Eric Adams - a veteran of the NYPD - told MSNBC that the use of a silencer was unprecedented in his career.",
      "\"I have never seen a silencer before,\" he said. \"That was really something shocking to us all.\"",
      "Investigators reportedly believe the firearm is a BT Station Six 9, a weapon which is marketed as tracing its roots back to pistols used by Second World War-era Allied special operations forces.",
      "Police have reportedly visited gun stores in Connecticut to try to determine where the weapon was purchased.",
      "After the shooting, video shows the suspect fleeing the scene on foot. Officials initially said the suspect used an electric Citi Bike owned by Lyft.",
      "But Lyft, which owns and operates Citi Bike, later said it had been told by the NYPD that one of its vehicles had not been used, according to the BBC's US partner, CBS News.",
      "The investigation",
      "So far, the investigation into Thompson's killing has centred on a few clues that police are using to identify the suspect.",
      "Officials released two images of an unmasked man on Thursday that the NYPD said was \"wanted for questioning\" in connection with the murder.",
      "Law enforcement sources told CBS that the person is believed to have used a fake ID to check into a hostel in the area. The name used is fraudulent and is not believed to belong to an actual person.",
      "Investigators believe the person of interest took a bus that originated in Atlanta, Georgia, to New York days before the shooting, CBS reports, citing a person briefed on the investigation. It's unclear whether the person got on the bus at Atlanta or later during a stop.",
      "It is unclear if he is the same person as the suspect.",
      "Earlier, police revealed the suspect was photographed at a nearby Starbucks just minutes before the shooting.",
      "While he is masked in the image, police sources told CBS that the mask is pulled down far enough so that his eyes and part of his nose can be seen.",
      "With that, investigators are using facial recognition software to try to find a match.",
      "Investigators have so far not identified a motive in the killing, although police did note that the assailant fled without taking any of Thompson's belongings.",
      "Additionally, police are testing three bullet casings and three live rounds found at the scene for DNA.",
      "The words \"deny,\" \"defend\" and \"depose\" were discovered on the casings, two law enforcement sources told CBS.",
      "Investigators believe this could be a reference to the \"three D's of insurance\" - a known reference made by opponents of the industry.",
      "The terms refer to tactics used by insurance companies to refuse payment claims by patients in America's complicated and mostly privately run healthcare system.",
      "The words resemble - but are not exactly the same as \u2013 the title of a book called Delay, Deny, Defend: Why Insurance Companies Don't Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It.",

      "Professor Feinman declined to comment when the BBC contacted him.",
      "A mobile phone was discovered in an alley along the suspect's escape route. Police say they are \"working through\" the phone.",
      "A coffee cup believed to have been discarded by the suspect has also been dusted for fingerprints and sent to an NYPD crime lab in the hopes that it may help reveal his identity or establish a chain of events.",
      "Investigators also said they executed a search warrant at a location in Manhattan's Upper West Side, which he was seen entering earlier in the day.",
      "The location is near the Frederick Douglas housing project, where police say surveillance video showed the suspect outside at approximately 05:00 the morning of the crime.",
      "Police earlier said they would also search Thompson's room at the nearby Marriott, which is down the street from where the incident took place.",

    "story": [
      "Namibia's governing party, Swapo, has retained its hold on power after more than 30 years, however its grip has been loosened - the latest African country where incumbents have had a difficult time this year.",
      "According to official results, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, the Swapo candidate, won the presidential election with 57% of the vote, becoming the country\u2019s first female leader.",
      "Opposition parties have refused to accept the outcome after the polls were marred by logistical problems and irregularities.",
      "Other important questions that have yet to be answered include how it was possible that Swapo increased its share of the presidential vote when in the parliamentary election it recorded its worst-ever performance, losing 12 of its 63 seats and only just holding on to its parliamentary majority.",
      "Swapo is not alone in suffering a major electoral setback.",
      "This year has been an \"annus horribilis\" for those governments in sub-Saharan Africa that have had to face voters at the ballot box.",
      "In almost every election held in the region this year under reasonably democratic conditions, the governing party either lost a significant number of seats or lost power completely.",
      "This trend has been driven by a combination of factors:",
      "the economic downturngrowing public intolerance of corruptionand the emergence of increasingly assertive and well-coordinated opposition parties.",
      "the economic downturn",
      "growing public intolerance of corruption",
      "and the emergence of increasingly assertive and well-coordinated opposition parties.",
      "The trend is likely to continue into 2025.",
      "One of the most striking aspect of the elections that have taken place in 2024 is that many have resulted in landslide defeats for governments that have previously appeared to have a strong grip on power - including in countries that have never before experienced a change at the top.",
      "The Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) that had ruled the country since independence in 1966 was crushed in October\u2019s general elections.",
      "As well as losing power, the BDP went from holding 38 seats in the 69-strong parliament to almost being wiped out.",
      "After winning only four seats, the BDP is now one of the smallest parties in parliament, and faces an uphill battle to remain politically relevant.",
      "There was also a landslide defeat for the governing party in Mauritius in November, where the Alliance Lepep coalition, headed by Pravind Jagnauth of the Militant Socialist Movement, won only 27% of the vote and was reduced to just two seats in parliament.",
      "With the opposition Alliance du Changement sweeping 60 of the 66 seats available, Mauritius has experienced one of the most complete political transformations imaginable.",
      "Senegal and the self-declared republic of Somaliland also saw opposition victories.",
      "In the case of Senegal, the political turnaround was just as striking as in Botswana, albeit in a different way.",
      "Just weeks ahead of the election, the main opposition leaders Bassirou Diomaye Faye and Ousmane Sonko were languishing in jail as the government of President Macky Sall abused its power in a desperate bid to avert defeat.",
      "After growing domestic and international pressure led to Faye and Sonko being released, Faye went on to win the presidency in the first round of voting, with the government\u2019s candidate winning only 36% of the vote.",
      "Even in cases where governments have not lost, their reputation and political control have been severely dented.",
      "Like Swapo, South Africa\u2019s African National Congress (ANC) retained power but only after a bruising campaign that saw it fall below 50% of the vote in a national election for the first time since the end of white-minority rule in 1994.",
      "This forced President Cyril Ramaphosa to enter into a coalition government, giving up 12 cabinet posts to other parties, including powerful positions such as Home Affairs.",
      "As a result, a region that is known more for governments that manage to hold on to power for decades has seen 12 months of vibrant, intensely contested, multiparty politics.",
      "The only exceptions to this have been countries where elections were seen as neither free nor fair, such as Chad and Rwanda, or in which governments were accused by opposition and rights groups of resorting to a combination of rigging and repression to avert defeat, as in Mozambique.",
      "Three trends have combined to make it a particularly difficult year to be in power.",
      "In Botswana, Mauritius and Senegal, growing citizen concern about corruption and the abuse of power eroded government credibility.",
      "Opposition leaders were then able to play on popular anger at nepotism, economic mismanagement and the failure of leaders to uphold the rule of law to expand their support base.",
      "Especially in Mauritius and Senegal, the party in power also undermined its claim to be a government committed to respecting political rights and civil liberties \u2013 a dangerous misstep in countries where the vast majority of citizens are committed to democracy, and which have previously seen opposition victories.",
      "The perception that governments were mishandling the economy was particularly important because many people experienced a tough year financially.",
      "High food and fuel prices have increased the cost of living for millions of citizens, increasing their frustration with the status quo.",
      "In addition to underpinning some of the government defeats this year, economic anger was the main driving force that triggered the youth-led protests in Kenya that rocked President William Ruto\u2019s government in July and August.",
      "This is not an African phenomenon, of course, but a global one.",
      "Popular discontent over inflation played a role in the defeat of Rishi Sunak and the Conservative Party in the UK and the victory of Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the United States.",
      "What was perhaps more distinctive about the transfers of power in Africa this year was the way that opposition parties learned from the past.",
      "In some cases, such as Mauritius, this meant developing new ways to try and protect the vote by ensuring every stage of the electoral process was carefully watched.",
      "In others, it meant forging new coalitions to present the electorate with a united front.",
      "In Botswana, for example, three opposition parties and a number of independent candidates came together under the banner of the Umbrella for Democratic Change to comprehensively out-mobilise the BDP.",
      "A similar set of trends could make life difficult for Ghana's New Patriotic Party (NPP) in Saturday's election, and will also cause the Malawian government of President Lazarus Chakwera major problems when general elections come around in 2025.",
      "If Ghana does see a transfer of power, sub-Saharan Africa will have experienced five opposition victories in 2024 - more than any other year in its history.",
      "That so many governments are being given an electoral bloody nose against a backdrop of global democratic decline that has seen a rise in authoritarianism in some regions is particularly striking.",
      "It suggests that Africa has much higher levels of democratic resilience than is often recognized, notwithstanding the number of entrenched authoritarian regimes that continue to exist.",
      "Civil society groups, opposition parties and citizens themselves have mobilised in large numbers to demand accountability, and punish governments that have failed both economically and democratically.",
      "International governments, organizations, and activists looking for new ways to defend democracy around the world should pay more attention to a region that is often assumed to be an inhospitable environment for multiparty politics, yet has seen more examples of democratic bounce-back than other regions of the world.",

      "On Tuesday night, at 23:00 local time (14:00 GMT) President Yoon, seated in front of blue creaseless curtains, made an unexpected address to the nation.",
      "He said he was imposing martial law to protect the country from \"anti-state\" forces that sympathised with North Korea. The embattled leader is in a deadlock over a budget bill, dogged by corruption scandals and investigations into his cabinet members.",
      "What followed was a sleepless night for Seoul.",
      "Shortly after Yoon\u2019s announcement, police lined the white metal gates outside the National Assembly building in the heart of Seoul, the building that the country\u2019s tourism authorities have framed as \u201cthe symbol of Korean democracy\u201d.",
      "The military then announced that all parliamentary activity was suspended under martial law. But neither that nor the heavy security presence stopped thousands from gathering in front of the assembly in concern and fury.",
      "It is easy to forget that South Korea - now a vibrant democracy - had its last brush with authoritarianism in the not-too-distant past - it only emerged from military rule in 1987. Martial law was last imposed in 1979.",
      "This was \u201ca move I never expected to see in the 21st century in South Korea,\u201d university student Juye Hong told BBC World Service's OS programme from Seoul.",
      "The scramble",
      "Soon after Yoon's shock announcement, the opposition's Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, hosted a live stream urging people to assemble at the National Assembly and protest there.",
      "He also asked  his fellow lawmakers to make their way to the assembly to vote down the order.",
      "Hundreds of South Koreans responded.",

      "\"No words can express how afraid I am that things might turn out like North Korea for our people,\" a South Korean who did not want to be named told BBC OS.",
      "Meanwhile, word was spreading that special forces had been deployed to the assembly building. Helicopters were heard overhead as they circled the skies before landing on the parliament\u2019s roof.",
      "Reporters jostled in the crowd outside the gates, clicking away with their cameras.",
      "As concerns grew that the government might restrict the media, journalists in Seoul stayed in touch with one another, exchanging advice on how to stay safe.",
      "Ahn Gwi-ryeong, the 35-year-old spokesperson for the opposition Democratic Party found herself facing down soldiers at gunpoint. A video of the moment, where she is tugging at the barrel of a soldier's rifle, has since gone viral.",
      "\"I wasn't thinking about anything intellectual or rational, I was just like, \u2018We have to stop this, if we don't stop this, there's nothing else,\u2019\u2019 she told the BBC.",
      "\"To be honest, I was a bit scared at first when I first saw the martial law troops. I thought, \u2018Is this something that can happen in 21st century Korea, especially in the National Assembly?\"",
      "\"After such a storm last night, it was hard to get back to reality,\" she added, recalling the previous night.  \"I felt like I was witnessing the regression of history.\"",
      "As Ahn was confronting the soldiers, the clock was ticking for opposition lawmakers, who rushed to get into the assembly to block the order. Once that happened, the president would have to withdraw it.",
      "But first, MPs and their aides had to get inside. Some crawled through the legs of security forces, others shoved and screamed at armed soldiers; many frantically clambered over fences and walls.",

      "\"If my phone rings in the middle of the night, it's not a good thing,\" he recalled.",
      "The Dali, a massive 948ft (289m) cargo ship had slammed into Baltimore's iconic Francis Scott Key Bridge, sending the 1.5-mile (2.4km) bridge into the cold waters of the state's Patapsco River.",
      "\"It wasn't immediately clear what we were dealing with,\" Buttigieg told the BBC in an interview. \"How many people had been impacted, and how much of the bridge had been destroyed.\"",
      "Six men, all members of a road crew working on the bridge, were killed in the incident, which left the Dali - still afloat - stuck under huge chunks of shredded metal and concrete. Another man was pulled from the icy water, seriously injured.",
      "A new documentary from BBC One - available on iPlayer on 5 December - reveals new details of the investigation into the crash, including a possible cause: a cable that shook loose, disrupting the ship's power supply and causing an initial blackout minutes before it struck the bridge.",
      "After that, investigators believe they discovered a lack of fuel pressure to the generators may have created power fluctuations that tripped breakers and caused the ship to go dark again, with no time to change course before slamming into the bridge.",

      "Watch on iPlayer: Why Bridges Collapse: The Baltimore Disaster",
      "Lost power, a mayday call and the crash that brought down a Baltimore bridge",
      "Previously unseen bodycam footage taken after the collapse shows first responders and officials struggling to come to grips with the enormity of what they faced in the confusing hours after the crash.",
      "\"Key Bridge is down. It was last reported that there are at least several vehicles in the water,\" an officer can be heard saying. \"And several people still unaccounted for.\"",
      "'A hell of a clean-up'",
      "In the aftermath of the collapse, an estimated 45,000 tonnes of debris blocked the Patapsco, a 700ft (213m) wide and 50ft (15m) deep and economically vital shipping channel.",
      "Recovering the bodies and removing the twisted, broken steel and concrete from the channel - plus moving the Dali - fell to a massive team including US Army, Navy and Coast Guard members, as well as Maryland authorities and specialist private firms.",
      "The woman who led the effort, Colonel Estee Pinchasin, the Army Corps of Engineers Baltimore district commander, said that she had \"never seen anything of that magnitude before\".",
      "\"Everything [was] mangled up on top and around,\" she said. \"You had these big, large spans that were just laying in the water. You see four-inch steel that's been bent... how can you even start to think about the force?\"",
      "The dangerous work of searching the debris field and determining which pieces could be safely removed - and when - fell, in part, to teams of divers who inspected both the ship and the destruction beneath the surface.",
      "Never-before-seen footage obtained by the BBC shows the difficult conditions they faced: jagged and potentially dangerous pieces of rubble and muddy, brown water, which often meant they could not see more than a foot or two ahead of them.",
      "\"There was no visibility. I kind of compared it to a metal jungle gym underwater,\" recalled Robyn Bianchi, the assistant salvage master for one of the firms involved, Donjon Marine.",
      "\"You turn off all the lights in the room and try tell me all the pieces of where they connect to that metal jungle gym. Oh, and by the way, the jungle gym is completely twisted and looks nothing like it did when it was built to perfection.\"",
      "What caused the crash?",
      "A preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board, or NTSB, found that two electrical blackouts disabled equipment ahead of the incident, and noted that the ship lost power twice in the 10 hours leading up to the crash.",
      "In the aftermath, NTSB investigators were tasked with determining what happened. Eventually, they discovered a loose cable, which it is believed may have caused a power surge that tripped two breakers and disrupted electricity.",
      "As the crew struggled to restart the engine, a second blackout took place, likely as the result of a pump supplying generators with fuel shutting down and not restarting automatically.",
      "The erratic generators may have created additional power fluctuations that trip the ship's breakers - a common occurrence faced by seafarers, but which mostly takes place in open waters.",
      "Sal Mercogliano, a maritime historian and former merchant mariner, said that the silence the sailors must have heard in those moments is \"the worst sound you ever hear\" on a ship.",
      "\"At that moment, you realise you don't have control of the ship anymore,\" he added. \"It is a nightmare... you have a very short period of time in which to restore power.\"",
      "In the Dali's case, it was already too late. The time between the ship losing power and striking the bridge, it was later determined, was about four minutes.",
      "Despite the destruction and loss of life, officials are relieved that the incident was not worse.",
      "On the night of the collapse, police were able to stop traffic, with the last car clearing the bridge just 40 seconds before it fell.",
      "\"Cars would have kept coming,\" Maryland Governor Wes Moore said. \"By the time the people driving the vehicles realised the bridge was gone, it just would have been too late.\"",
      "\"I can't tell you how many lives they saved,\" he added. \"Because the answer is countless.\"",

    "summary": "Life for women among the Amazon\u2019s illegal gold miners is harsh, violent, and can be deadly.",
    "story": [
      "Dayane Leite never wanted to become a sex worker but at the age of 17 her husband died of a heart attack and she couldn\u2019t pay for the funeral.",
      "Her home town, Itaituba in Brazil\u2019s northern Para state, is at the heart of the country\u2019s illegal gold-mining trade, so a friend suggested raising the money by having sex with miners, deep in the Amazon.",
      "\u201cGoing to the mines is a roll of the dice,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cThe women are seriously humiliated there. They may be slapped in the face and yelled at.",
      "\u201cI was sleeping in my bedroom and a guy jumped through the window and put a gun to my head. And if they pay, they want to own the women.\u201d",
      "Dayane successfully gathered the money for the funeral, and at the age of 18 she had her first child. For the last 16 years, like many women in Itaituba, she has been returning periodically to the mines to work as a cook, a washerwoman, a barmaid and a sex worker.",
      "She now has a family of seven to support.",
      "\u201cI'm not going to say that all the women in the city do it, but a fair share of them do sex work. So it\u2019s kind of normal. We don\u2019t really care,\u201d says Natalia Cavalcante, who became a sex worker in a remote mining settlement at 24. Four years later, after marrying the owner of a bar, she became the madam of a brothel \u2013 a job she only gave up recently, to look after her nieces in the city.",
      "Life in mining villages in the rainforest is harsh - most consist of just a dirt track, saloon bars and a church. But the miners themselves live even further out, in shacks made of wood and canvas, surrounded by snakes and jaguars, and in total darkness once the generator is switched off. Women working as cooks have to live in these camps, alongside the men.",
      "The miners appear in the village whenever they have found gold and have money to spend, Natalia adds. Sometimes they have to be persuaded to have a shower before sex, women say.",
      "Running a brothel is illegal under Brazilian law, but Natalia says she took no commission, she just employed bar staff and rented out rooms.",
      "Young women would contact her asking for work, and she sometimes lent them money for the journey, a seven-hour drive from Itaituba.",
      "Asked whether she had misgivings about involving other women in the work, she replied: \u201cSometimes I think: \u2018I\u2019ve been through that, and I know it\u2019s not that nice.\u2019 But then I think: \u2018The girl has a family, sometimes a child to raise. Many of the girls who go have one or two children.\u2019 So we accept it.\u201d",
      "Even before marrying, Natalia had made a lot of money.",
      "She now has her own house in Itaituba, a motorbike, and considerable quantities of gold that she sometimes received as payment for sex, two or three grams at a time. Her goal is to study, to become a lawyer or an architect.",
      "Some women in Itaituba, nicknamed Gold Nugget City, have set themselves up in business with the money they made, she says.",
      "But it\u2019s a big risk to venture as a woman into the violent and lawless mining settlements.",
      "While the environmental harm of the mines is well known, the human cost - which the UN says includes violence, sexual exploitation and trafficking - goes largely unreported.",
      "A dealer in precious metals told the BBC that the illegal gold from these mines would typically be relabelled as gold from a licensed mining co-operative, before being exported and turned into jewellery and components for mobile phones, or other electronic goods.",
      "The three largest customers of Brazilian gold are Canada, Switzerland and the UK. More than 90% of all exports to Europe are from areas where illegal mining occurs, according to the Instituto Escolhas think tank.",
      "It\u2019s not unknown for women to be murdered in mining villages. The dead body of 26-year-old Raiele Santos was found last year in the room where she had been living near the Cui\u00fa-Cui\u00fa gold mine, 11 hours\u2019 drive from Itaituba.",
      "Her elder sister, Railane, says a man had offered her money for sex and she had refused, so he found her later and beat her to death.",
      "\u201cA lot of women die on a daily basis, a lot of women,\u201d Railane says.",
      "\u201cI was born in the mines, I grew up in the mines, and now I'm afraid to live in the mines.\u201d",
      "A man has been arrested in connection with Raiele\u2019s murder, but has not yet been tried. He denies all the charges against him.",
      "The land covered by Brazil\u2019s illegal gold mines more than doubled in the 10 years to 2023, to 220,000 hectares \u2013 an area larger than Greater London. No-one knows how many women work in this area, or even how many illegal miners there are. The Brazilian government says the latter figure could be anywhere from 80,000 to 800,000.",
      "Under President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the government has taken steps to close illegal mines and to stop dealers buying the gold they produce, but high gold prices continue to drive many men to try their luck.",
      "Dayane wants to stop working in the mining areas because of the risks and the toll the hardship takes on her body, but she is planning what she hopes will be one last trip. Her goal is to earn enough in two or three months to open a snack bar on her return, though she realises she may not succeed.",
      "Whenever she is alone, walking in the forest, she will worry about her children, she says.",
      "\u201cI will keep trying, until I can\u2019t any more,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause I think that one day, my children will say: \u2018My mum worked so hard. She went through what she went through for us, and she never gave up.\u2019\u201d",

Before he left, he ignited a firestorm when he issued a sweeping pardon for his son, Hunter, who had been convicted on federal drug and gun charges, and pleaded guilty to tax charges. When asked about the pardon earlier this week, the first lady, who attended every day of Hunter Biden's Delaware trial, said \"of course I support the pardon of my son.\"",

      "\"As we celebrate our final holiday season here in the White House, we are guided by the values that we hold sacred: faith, family, and service to our country, kindness toward all of our neighbors, and the power of community,\" she said.",
      "It takes over 300 volunteers from across the country along with about 9,810 feet of ribbon, 28,125 ornaments and 2,200 paper doves to deck the halls of the White House.",
      "The White House expects to welcome over 100,000 visitors during the holiday season. The first lady on Tuesday welcomed families of National Guard members to be the first to view the decorations. Upon arrival, visitors will see a Christmas tree dedicated to Gold Star families with six stacked stars representing all six branches of the military. Down the East Colonnade guests will be surrounded by bells \"symbolizing the peaceful sounds of the holiday season.\" In the East Room, a reflective canopy twinkles next to the chandeliers like snowfall as two large Christmas trees guard the main door.",
      "The first known Christmas tree inside the White House was in 1889 during the Benjamin Harrison administration, according to the White House. It was a much smaller affair with only a Christmas tree in the Second Floor Oval Room decorated with candles by President Harrison's grandchildren.",
      "The annual gingerbread White House manages to combine 25 sheets of gingerbread dough, 10 sheets of sugar cookie dough, 65 pounds of pastillage, 45 pounds of chocolate, 50 pounds of royal icing, and 10 pounds of gum paste into the form of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.",
      "Volunteers who bring the decorations to life",
      "Alisa Cooper de Uribe, a first-grade bilingual teacher at the New Mexico International School in Albuquerque and the 2021 New Mexico Teacher of the Year, was one of the volunteers who assembled the thousands of doves. She traveled to Washington, D.C., with her family to be part of the White House decorations team.",
      "\"It's a sisterhood, a brotherhood. It was a very collegial atmosphere,\" Cooper de Uribe told CBS News. \"And that was one of the things that I was really impressed by was how so many people who were gathered together without any knowledge of each other before, how well these people work together.\"",
      "The holiday volunteers are teachers, military families, nurses, and small business owners from across the country who all apply before being selected for decor duty. Bright and early the day after Thanksgiving, the volunteers arrived at the White House to begin full days of glitter and garland before the first lady unveiled all their work. The Office of the First Lady sent out special invitations to State Teachers of the Year winners like de Uribe to join the holiday volunteer tradition. Some volunteers formed text chains and Facebook groups, intending to keep in touch long after the ornaments are taken down.",
      "Centerpiece of the holiday decor",

The owners named it \"Tremendous\" as a tribute to the resilience of North Carolina communities affected by Hurricane Helene.",

    "summary": "At 32, she's an accomplished actor, successful singer-songwriter, billionaire business owner, and philanthropist. But Selena Gomez's gutsiest move may have been sharing her real self.",
    "story": [
      "On any red carpet, Selena Gomez is the picture of beauty, poise and confidence. But she'll be the first to tell you that things aren't always what they appear. For instance, her latest film: \"Emilia P\u00e9rez.\" Gomez co-stars as the wife of a powerful Mexican drug lord who secretly transitions. The film is a hard-hitting true crime story, a poignant love story, a journey of self-discovery \u2013 and a musical. But somehow it all works.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" click on the video player below:",
      "Gomez said shooting left her \"a little sore\" from all the dance numbers. So, why did she want to do it? \"I found it incredibly compelling,\" she said. \"I've never really seen a movie like this before. I don't think I've ever been this proud of something in the acting field.\"",
      "And that's really saying something; at 32, Gomez has a lot to be proud of: She's an accomplished actor, but she's also a very successful singer-songwriter, and thanks to her wildly popular Rare Beauty line of cosmetics, she's a billionaire, and a very active philanthropist. It's all quite impressive, and even more so when you realize where she started.",
      "Gomez was born in the Texas town of Grand Prairie. Her mom, Mandy Teefy, was only 16 years old. Selena's parents split when she was five. She says the family had a lot of love, and not much else, with tough times when her mother struggled to put food on the table. \"My mom worked multiple jobs,\" she said. \"She also was finishing high school when she was having me. When I'm doing something great today, it just makes me more thankful for the lessons that my mother taught me.\"",
      "Gomez was barely 10 when she landed a part on TV's \"Barney & Friends,\" and a few years later she became a fixture on the Disney Channel, on such shows as \"Wizards of Waverly Place.\"",
      "She branched out into music, and became a pop sensation. And when the pandemic came, she switched gears again, hosting \"Selena + Chef,\" a popular online cooking show shot in the kitchen of her L.A. home. \"We had cameras everywhere, from every aspect of it,\" she said.",
      "And how are her cooking skills now? \"They're not that great, I'm not gonna lie!\" she laughed.",
      "And then, in 2021 she helped cook up one of the biggest hits on TV: \"Only Murders in the Building.\" She praised her co-stars, Steve Martin and Martin Short: \"These men, Steve and Martin, have been working longer than I've been alive, but they are the first ones to be on set. They take time to ask everyone they run into how their day is. And on top of it, they think everything through. They are wonderful people, and they've helped me grow up in a lot of ways. These guys have become my friends and allies and people I can ask advice from. I couldn't be more grateful to work with them.\"",
      "Gomez is the first to admit that she's had a magical life, and that it hasn't always been a bed of roses. She's been open about her health struggles, like having lupus and receiving a kidney transplant.",
      "She also decided to take her struggles with anxiety and depression, and her bipolar diagnosis, public. Her 2022 documentary, \"Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me,\" is an unvarnished look at her life \u2013 the highs and the very deep lows.",
      "She admits she was a little nervous about sharing it with the world but, \"once I released it, it felt like a huge relief, because I am a firm believer that one of the strongest things you can do is be vulnerable. And that doesn't mean you have to pour your heart out to everyone. But I made that choice, because I knew I wasn't the only one that felt that way. And if my world was already out there for everyone to see, I'd like to tell my part of the story. And to add on that, it's a dream what I'm doing.\"",
      "Part of what her dream is was a benefit held last month for her Rare Impact Fund, a charity aimed at helping young people who suffer from the same mental health challenges she's been through. \"This is probably the most important thing to me, besides my family,\" she said. \"This is the cherry on top of everything.\"",
      "Another high point is her relationship with music producer Benny Blanco, whom People Magazine named one of the sexiest men alive. \"Yeah, that's my man!\" Gomez said. \"To know that there is someone in the world that deeply cares about every tiny detail about who I am, I'm really, really lucky.\"",
      "It's clear from \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" that she's an artist who likes to take risks. But Selena Gomez's gutsiest move has been sharing her real self, and that has made all the difference.",
      "I asked, \"The reaction in general has been overwhelmingly positive, hasn't it?\"",
      "\"Sure. Maybe,\" Gomez replied.",
      "Maybe?\u00a0 \"It's not that I really need anyone's approval,\" she added. \"I think I'm just really, I'm okay with where I am and who I am. And I'm glad. I'm glad that I finally got there.\"",

    "story": [
      "If the annual Jingle Ball at New York's Madison Square Garden is the Super Bowl of holiday concerts, then Elvis Duran is in the role of head coach. From introducing acts like Olivia Rodrigo, to mingling with pop princesses (\"Sabrina Carpenter, everyone!\"), and interviewing rock royalty like Cher, on this day, this Elvis is king.",
      "But he says being interviewed for TV is different for him: \"I'm not a camera guy, I'm a radio guy,\" he said.",
      "If you don't recognize his face, you may know his voice. Since 1996 the 60-year-old disc jockey has been host of \"Elvis Duran and the Morning Show,\" the country's most popular Top 40 morning program. \"I can't believe it's been 30 years, because it's been nothing but fun,\" he said.",
      "Every day, millions of listeners nationwide wake up to Duran and his crew dishing about music, pop culture \u2026 pretty much whatever's on their minds. \"I've been working with some of the same people for 25-30 years,\" he said. \"The energy with each other is what makes it work. I don't need to be the center of attention.\"",
      "With 70 markets across the country listening, Duran's a rarity these days \u2013 a nationally-known radio DJ.",
      "I asked, \"Growing up, I remember big-name radio DJs. Now it's kind of you and Ryan Seacrest. What happened?\"",
      "\"Radio isn't what radio used to be,\" Duran replied. \"A lot of radio companies gave up on personalities; they just wanted to play music, it's cheaper. That's not good for our business. So, I've done everything I can to keep personality on a radio show in the mornings.\"",
      "And it's Duran's personality that over the years has won him loyal fans, including some of the biggest names in pop music. \"Lady Gaga grew up dreaming of hearing her song on our show,\" he said. \"And when she walked into the room, she was sort of nervous. And I was thinking, 'Well, shouldn't it be the opposite way? It is Lady Gaga!'\"",
      "But it's everyday listeners with whom Duran feels a special bond. He said, \"We are in the friendship business. I think about you when you hop in your car in the morning. You're either leaving a house that may be full of turmoil, or going to a job with a boss you don't like. But I have you for 20-30 minutes, and I can be your friend.\"",
      "Duran fell in love with radio as a kid: \"I'd spend the night at my grandmother's house when mom and dad were out late, and I listened to the radio. And I became friends with this voice in the dark.\"",
      "He was just seven and growing up in McKinney, Texas. \"I didn't have a lot of friends growing up. I was a loner. And so, I found friendship through the radio.\"",
      "And so began his quest to become one of those voices. He even built his own transmitter, with a studio located in his bedroom closet. \"My only listener was the lady next door.\"",
      "Duran's first real radio job came at age 14. After dropping out of college, he spent a decade bouncing between markets across the country. \"Back in the old days in radio, you never unpacked, you never took dishes out of boxes, because you were always moving,\" he said. \"But you know what, I've been very lucky. I've been at Z100 since 1989. So, I'm doing okay.\"",
      "While his show is based in the Big Apple, Duran's heart belongs in New Mexico. As a kid, he visited the \"Land of Enchantment\" frequently. He says the quiet of Santa Fe is the polar opposite of New York City. \"Of course, I need that. Santa Fe is a magical place. And I think, in some ways, this city has kind of saved my life a little bit. It's good to be in a situation where you're forced to relax.\"",
      "Duran and his husband, Alex Carr, share a home here, not far from where they were married in 2019. But decades before their first date, they had a chance encounter \u2013 where else? \u2013 on the radio, back in 1998. \"I had him on as a contest winner once,\" Duran said.\u00a0 \"Jingle Ball tickets. How old were you?\"",
      "\"Eighteen,\" said Carr.",
      "\"Ooh, God!\"",
      "Duran often hosts his show from Santa Fe. Thanks to a home studio, his commute is short. \"Every morning at 2:30 a.m. Santa Fe time, I slither up this staircase, and here you go.\"",
      "I asked, \"Is the Elvis in New Mexico a different Elvis than the Elvis in the New York studio?\"",
      "\"Oh, absolutely,\" he replied. \"And everyone back in New York has said to me at one time or another, 'You're so relaxed out there. We really like the New Mexico Elvis.'\"",
      "Duran can't say how long he'll keep broadcasting (\"To be able to do this this long, with this family, it's a miracle, it really is\"), but he isn't ready to mute his microphone just yet. He's still got a lot of friends to keep company.",
      "Asked how much this goes back to the seven-year-old Elvis listening to that voice on the radio, Duran replied, \"All of it. You know, I'm not lonely anymore. I never, ever want to go back to being a lonely person ever again. And I don't want anyone listening to our show to be lonely. That's the legacy we're all trying to leave. I don't want them to remember my name; I just want them to remember how we made them feel every day. That's it.\"",

    "summary": "Even those enrolled in Medicare have a harder time paying for treatment compared with older adults in other countries.",
    "story": [
      "In the U.S., having health insurance is necessary, but not sufficient to ensure access to affordable medical care.",
      "While the U.S. lacks a universal health care system like those that exist in most other wealthy nations, most Americans over 65 are insured through Medicare. Yet many still struggle to afford care, with high out-of-pocket costs putting necessary medications and doctor visits out of reach, according to\u00a0research from The Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit that works to promote an equitable health care system.",
      "These extra costs, for which Medicare beneficiaries are on the hook, make it harder for older Americans to access affordable care relative to their peers in nine other countries, the group found. Researchers compared coverage for older adults in the U.S. to health care systems in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.",
      "Nearly one in four older adults in the U.S. spent at least $2,000 in out-of-pocket expenses last year, compared to less than 5% of older adults in France and the Netherlands who spent that much, The Commonwealth Fund found. Only in Switzerland did older adults report spending more on health care than those in the U.S.",
      "\"The reason to focus on this population is because in the U.S. nearly every adult over 65 has Medicare,\" Munira Z. Gunja, senior researcher for international health policy and practice innovations at The Commonwealth Fund told CBS MoneyWatch. While the U.S. stands out as \"the only high-income country without a universal health system,\" when it comes to the over-65 population, \"at least, we are on par with other countries,\" she said.",
      "Does Medicare fall short?",
      "But the study suggests that the kind of coverage Medicare plans provide isn't meeting many Americans' needs. Eight percent of older adults in the U.S., more than any other wealthy country except Austria, reported delaying or forgoing medical care because of costs. And there are repercussions to not getting the care one needs: One-third of older U.S. adults who said they faced cost-related barriers to accessing care reported being either in fair or poor health.",
      "\"We find that while nearly every older adult has Medicare coverage, it is still more expensive than what older adults in other nations face, and because of that, older adults in the U.S. are more likely to skip care,\" Gunja said. \"When they need prescription drugs, they are more likely to skip getting those too.\"",
      "Oftentimes, for example, Medicare Advantage members find themselves seeing out-of-network doctors, which exposes them to \"a ton of health care costs,\" according to Gunja.",
      "One exception",
      "There's one area in which Medicare beneficiaries faced few out-of-pocket costs and, as a result, were less likely to skip care \u2014 mental health treatment. Less than 5% of residents in all nations skipped mental health care over affordability concerns. The stat illustrates that when treatment is affordable, patients are more inclined to seek out the care they need, according to Gunja.",
      "\"It's a benefit that's offered on all health plans, and we see what happens when people don't need to spend as much on a service,\" she said.",
      "Solutions?",
      "When older people skip or delay care, their health can worsen, leading to sicker patients, who tend to require more costly care. That in turn drives up federal Medicare spending, according to The Commonwealth Fund.",
      "Gunja suggests that the U.S. can look to other countries for solutions that make health care more affordable for older adults. Some examples include capping out-of-pocket expenses and fully covering hospital and physician services.",
      "\"Across the board, the U.S. generally comes out last for most measures when it comes to affordability measures,\" Gunja said. \"Getting health insurance is absolutely necessary. But it's only the first step. We need to make sure coverage is not just comprehensive, but also affordable.\"",

      "While total cases nationwide remain lower than some previous records, the pace of weekly reported cases reached 577 ahead of Thanksgiving \u2014 more than 10 times the same time last year, and the worst in at least a decade.",
      "Health officials have cited a variety of factors for this year's wave of whooping cough cases, including gaps in immunity from vaccination or prior infection and the switch to safer but less effective vaccines in the 1990s.",
      "\"We have to acknowledge that our vaccination rates, in Montgomery County for school-age children, are low. They've decreased since the pandemic, and they're lower than the state of Ohio, and lower than the United States as well,\" said Dr. Becky Thomas, medical director of the health department for Ohio's Montgomery County.",
      "Within Ohio, Montgomery County makes up the largest share of cases reported in recent months, despite not having the most people in the state.",
      "Around 63% of their cases have been in schoolchildren and 12% are in daycares, Thomas said. The department often finds out about outbreaks first from school nurses, warning of large numbers of kids calling out sick with whooping cough.",
      "Thomas said doctors have been seeing high pertussis case counts for months, larger than the wave they saw last year.",
      "\"We had an increase in cases last fall, but nothing compared to this fall. And when we first started noticing a really significant increase was about the time that kids went back to school, so about the middle of August,\" said Thomas.",
      "Thomas said that the vast majority of reported cases in the county have said they were vaccinated for pertussis, though it is unclear if everyone was up-to-date on the shots. A third of cases have been in teens, who are recommended to have gotten a booster dose by age 12.",
      "\"We have specific data on vaccination records for entering seventh graders that shows those vaccination rates for that tetanus, whooping cough vaccine that they should have entering school are decreased,\" said Thomas.",
      "This year's whooping cough surge also comes as health departments are bracing for the return of an expected wave of COVID-19 and flu infections this winter.",
      "\"Whooping cough isn't the only respiratory illness that we're concerned about. So we're encouraging people to stay home when they're sick, practice good hand hygiene, get their health care provider if they need to if they're symptoms are worsening or severe, and of course get vaccinated,\" said Jennifer Wentzel, the county health department's commissioner.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 15:49:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Anthem will reverse a policy that would have capped insurance coverage for anesthesia after objections from doctors and lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield said Thursday that the health insurance provider is reversing a policy that was set to go into effect in February of that would have limited anesthesia coverage during surgeries and other procedures, a change that had prompted an outcry from some physicians and lawmakers.",
      "The policy, which would have covered Anthem's plans in Connecticut, New York and Missouri, was disclosed in recent weeks, with the company's New York unit posting a\u00a0notice on Dec. 1. The policy would have excluded people under 22 years old and maternity care.",
      "According to the original policy statement, Anthem had said it would pay only for anesthesia treatments for the length of time that a procedure or surgery is estimated to require based on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's physician work time values. The insurer noted that claims for anesthesia \"above the established number of minutes will be denied.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News on Thursday, Anthem said it was backing away from the policy, and added there had been \"widespread misinformation about an update to our anesthesia policy.\"",
      "\"As a result, we have decided to not proceed with this policy change,\" an Anthem spokesperson wrote in an email. \"To be clear, it never was and never will be the policy of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to not pay for medically necessary anesthesia services. The proposed update to the policy was only designed to clarify the appropriateness of anesthesia consistent with well-established clinical guidelines.\"",
      "Before the announcement of Anthem's reversal, the plan had drawn criticism from medical professionals as well as Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, who wrote on social media on Wednesday that the plan is \"appalling.\"",
      "\"Saddling patients with thousands of dollars in surprise additional medical debt.   And for what? Just to boost corporate profits?\" Murphy wrote. \"Reverse this decision immediately.\"",
      "Connecticut Comptroller Sean Scanlon told the Hartford Courant Thursday that the policy would not take place in his state after negotiating with the insurer.",
      "\"After hearing from people across the state about this concerning policy, my office reached out to Anthem, and I'm pleased to share this policy will no longer be going into effect here in Connecticut,\" Scanlon told the newspaper.",
      "\"Appalling behavior by commercial health insurers\"",
      "In a statement last month, the American Society of Anesthesiologists also called on Anthem to reverse the policy.",
      "\"With this new policy, Anthem will arbitrarily pre-determine the time allowed for anesthesia care during a surgery or procedure,\" the group said. \"If an anesthesiologist submits a bill where the actual time of care is longer than Anthem's limit, Anthem will deny payment for the anesthesiologist's care.\"",
      "The insurer's new policy could result in denials of coverage to patients who might need more anesthesia because their surgery is difficult or unusual, or if a complication occurs, the group added.",
      "\"This is just the latest in a long line of appalling behavior by commercial health insurers looking to drive their profits up at the expense of patients and physicians providing essential care,\" said Donald E. Arnold, an anesthesiologist and president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. \"This egregious policy breaks the trust between Anthem and its policyholders who expect their health insurer to pay physicians for the entirety of the care they need.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 16:29:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Levels of both the flu and COVID viruses are still low across much of the country, the CDC says.",
    "story": [
      "This year's winter surge of influenza and COVID-19 has yet to arrive for most of the country, data published this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows, with trends so far a fraction of what they were at this time last year.",
      "\"COVID-19 activity remains low and is stable in most areas. Seasonal influenza activity is increasing slightly among children but remains low nationally,\" the CDC said this week, in its weekly report on data about the two viruses.",
      "The agency's updates are usually published every week by Friday, but were delayed until after the weekend because of the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "A return to normal for flu?",
      "By this time last year, data tracking outpatient visits to places like emergency rooms and doctor's offices for the flu had already climbed above the agency's baseline for the season. This year's latest report suggests flu cases are only now starting to cross that threshold.",
      "\"We're maybe slightly later than last year, and maybe quite a bit later than the year before, but those years were unusually early,\" said University of North Carolina epidemiology professor Justin Lessler, a top expert in the CDC-backed network of disease forecasters.",
      "Lessler said this year's figures look \"much closer to about where you'd expect a normal flu season to be\" before the COVID-19 pandemic, when measures to curb the outbreak scrambled seasonal patterns of flu and other respiratory germs.",
      "Compared with last year, rates of weekly flu hospitalizations are around five times lower. Emergency room visits with flu from school-age kids have accelerated, the CDC's data shows, but remain less than a third of what they were at this time last year.",
      "One big factor that could be affecting the figures this year is immunity in the population from the last two waves of influenza, alongside vaccination.",
      "\"We have had two fairly substantial seasons, which could be driving this delay. Of course the question is, does that mean we're having a delay, or a milder season. That's really kind of uncertain at this point,\" said epidemiologist Shaun Truelove, associate scientist at Johns Hopkins University's public health school.",
      "Modeling of this year's flu season gathered from different experts make different assumptions about what the country's flu immunity looks like, as they try to play out different scenarios of how this year's flu season might look like.",
      "Truelove, who also helps lead the CDC-funded disease forecasting network, also thinks that this year could mark a \"return to normal\" for flu.",
      "\"That being said, flu is never consistent. We get early seasons and late seasons. So it's hard to say exactly what that means, and everything's a bit weird post-pandemic, in terms of scale and timing,\" said Truelove.",
      "Watching for another COVID-19 wave",
      "Several COVID-19 trends that the CDC tracks also remain below what was recorded at this time in 2023. This is a contrast with previous summer waves of the virus, which have only dipped slightly into the fall before picking up again during the winter.",
      "COVID-19 emergency room visits are \"low\" or \"minimal\" in nearly all states, after this year's late summer wave of the virus. Levels of the virus in wastewater are \"minimal\" in all regions, compared to \"high\" levels around this time last year.",
      "\"Does that mean that there was enough immunity built up in that summer wave that we're going to not see a winter wave? Does it mean the winter wave is going to come, but be a little bit later and maybe a little smaller,\" said Lessler.",
      "Both Truelove and Lessler said one major \"data gap\" making comparisons to previous seasons challenging has been the lapse in nationwide COVID-19 hospitalization data during the summer surge.",
      "A pandemic-era emergency requirement for health care providers to report COVID-19 hospitalizations lapsed earlier this year, and only recently resumed under a new rule issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Other factors muddying the figures include changes to how people test and seek care for COVID-19 infections.",
      "Another big unknown is the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Most circulating variants right now are a medley of closely related variants like XEC and KP.3.1.1.",
      "\"We don't know, like we do for flu, what the average pace of COVID's evolution away from our immune system will be, when it settles down,\" Lessler said.",
      "Early data released last month by researchers at The Ohio State University found XEC looked to be more infectious compared with the parent variant it shares upstream with KP.3.1.1, but not significantly more than its siblings.",
      "\"I actually have thought it had settled down a bit, after this year. We'll see what I think after the season's done. But right now, I'm a little less sure,\" he said.",
      "Other respiratory germs on the rise",
      "While COVID-19 and flu remain at unusually low levels nationwide, rates of at least other germs that spread through coughs and sneezes remain elevated.",
      "CDC's data on emergency room visits from the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae, sometimes called \"walking pneumonia,\" have increased in recent weeks especially in babies.",
      "Cases in this year's wave of pertussis, or whooping cough, are also continuing to accelerate in several states around the country.",
      "The agency tallied 577 infections of pertussis nationwide for the week ending Nov. 23, around 33% higher than last week's count. That's higher than the peak of 2014's record pertussis wave, which reached 326 weekly infections reported in late December.",
      "Ohio remains the state with the most cases of whooping cough this past week, after 66 infections with pertussis were reported.",
      "The CDC's \"acute respiratory illness\" metric, which lumps together levels of patients showing up in emergency rooms with a broad array of cough and cold illnesses including influenza and whooping cough, tallies 14 states with \"moderate\" levels including Ohio.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he wants ex-congressman Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri and a former auctioneer, to run the IRS. As a lawmaker, Long co-sponsored legislation that aimed to wipe out much of the tax code.",
      "In making the announcement, Trump praised Long's \"32 years of experience running his own businesses in Real Estate and, as one of the premier Auctioneers in the Country.\" He also noted that since leaving Congress in 2023, Long has worked as a business and tax adviser.",
      "While Trump didn't mention the current IRS Commissioner, Danny Werfel, in his announcement, the decision signals the president-elect is likely to replace him with Long after taking office in January, Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Naming Long as the next IRS chief drew both support from conservatives as well as criticism from the left, with Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia who serves on the House Ways and Means Tax subcommittee calling it a \"terrible mistake,\" while Idaho Republican Senator Mike Crapo issued a statement saying he's looking forward to hearing Long's ideas for the tax agency. The fiscally conservative National Taxpayers Union Foundation praised Trump's choice, saying Long could help reform the IRS.",
      "Long has recently served as a tax adviser to businesses seeking to employ a controversial tax credit, but, unlike prior IRS commissioners, his background is largely outside of the tax industry, experts noted.",
      "\"This guy is an auctioneer \u2014 that's his expertise,\" Owens noted. \"This is an incredibly unserious choice.\"",
      "Werfel, who was appointed by President Biden, stepped into the role in 2023, with his term set to expire in 2027. Typically, presidents allow IRS commissioners to serve out their term, as Mr. Biden allowed Trump's former IRS appointee, Charles Rettig, to do before naming Werfel to the role.",
      "If the Senate approves his appointment to the IRS, Long would oversee an agency with 85,000 employees and an annual budget exceeding $12 billion.",
      "A spokesperson for the Trump campaign declined to comment.",
      "Here's what to know about Long and the IRS.",
      "Who is Billy Long?",
      "Long, who attended the University of Missouri but didn't graduate, described himself on a\u00a0website\u00a0for his congressional run as a \"fourth-generation native of Southwest Missouri.\" He touted his skills as an auctioneer, noting that he had been named the \"best auctioneer in the Ozarks for seven years in a row.\"",
      "Long also worked in real estate and in talk radio, hosting a show on a Missouri AM radio station.",
      "He shuttered his auction firm, Billy Long Auctions, before he was sworn into Congress in 2011, according to a local publication.",
      "What professional experience does Long have with taxes?",
      "As a congressman, Long co-sponsored some tax-related bills, including several efforts to eliminate the estate tax as well as a measure called the Tax Code Termination Act.",
      "That legislation would have wiped out much of the current tax code, replacing it with what the bill called a \"simple and fair system\" that would have applied \"a low rate to all Americans.\" Such flat taxes are considered regressive by many experts because low- and middle-income taxpayers would end up paying a larger share of their incomes than would wealthy Americans.",
      "\"As a business owner, Billy knows first-hand how government regulation and heavy taxes can affect the small businesses that serve as the economic engine of our country,\" his campaign site noted.",
      "While Long isn't an accountant or CPA, he has been involved in tax advising since leaving Congress. In a 2023 podcast, for example, he touted his work helping businesses use the Employee Retention Tax Credit, a credit that the IRS has\u00a0flagged for its high rate of fraud.",
      "In the podcast, Long also said that when he served as a congressman, he helped make the ERTC easier for businesses to claim, noting that the credit was difficult to qualify for during its first iteration.",
      "\"We went from having to say COVID adversely affected your business definitely, to taking that away, and you don't have to prove that you had any downturn,\" he said. \"We're doing recoveries for folks that had their best two years ever during COVID.\"",
      "The IRS says the ERTC is aimed at employers who paid wages to workers between March 12, 2020, and January 1, 2022, and that were either suspended by government order during the pandemic or experienced a \"required decline in gross receipts during 2020 or the first three calendar quarters of 2021.\" The credit is also available to startups that began at the end of 2021 and had less than $1 million in revenue.",
      "How does Long's experience compare with prior IRS commissioners?",
      "Long's lack of tax industry experience sets him apart from other recent IRS commissioners.",
      "Werfel, the current IRS chief, has an undergraduate degree from Cornell University and a master's degree in public policy from Duke University as well as a law degree from the University of North Carolina. He's also held a number of government jobs involved in operations and the IRS, including serving as acting commissioner of the IRS from May to December 2013, according to his biography.",
      "Werfel's predecessor, Charles Rettig, who was appointed by President-elect Trump, also held several degrees, including a master's in taxation. Before joining the IRS, Rettig worked as a tax attorney for more than three decades and served as the chairman of the IRS Advisory Council.",
      "What is happening with the IRS now?",
      "Under Werfel, the IRS has expanded audits of wealthy taxpayers and big corporations, clawing back billions in unpaid taxes, efforts that were funded by the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "The tax agency has also reduced the time it takes consumers to connect with an IRS employee, while also rolling out a free tax filing system called Direct File.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have pushed back against the expanded IRS funding, claiming\u00a0the agency would use the money to hire thousands of new agents to increase audits on middle-class taxpayers.",
      "The Treasury had said that funding could help the IRS add nearly 87,000 full-time workers over 10 years, but the agency didn't specify whether those new workers would be auditors, customer service workers or other types of employees. That figure also represented the total number of employees that could be hired, without calculating the impact of the number of IRS workers who are expected to retire or leave the department over the next several years.",
      "Some Democratic lawmakers are expressing concern that, if appointed, Long could disrupt the progress that the IRS has made under Werfel.",
      "Werfel \"has done an excellent job rebuilding the IRS, boosting customer service and enhancing enforcement aimed at wealthy tax evaders,\" Rep. Beyer said in a statement. \"Removing him will clearly signal Trump's intention to make the agency less responsive to the American people, while giving a green light to wealthy tax cheats to evade their fair share of the tax burden.\"",
      "Still, Republican lawmakers expressed support for the pick, such as Senator Crapo, who highlighted \"privacy and security\" issues at the IRS and \"inefficient use of resources.\" He added, \"I look forward to learning more about Mr. Long's vision for the agency.\"",

    "story": [
      "Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was shot to death Wednesday outside the New York Hilton Midtown in Manhattan, where the company was hosting an investor day.",
      "Thompson, 50, was\u00a0named\u00a0CEO of UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group's insurance arm, in April 2021. He first joined UnitedHealth Group in 2004 and had previously served as CEO of the company's government programs, including Medicare and retiree coverage, and community and state programs providing Medicaid and other types of coverage to millions of individuals.",
      "In his most recent role as CEO of UnitedHealthcare, he was responsible for leading growth across the company's global, employer, individual, specialty and government benefits businesses, according to a 2021 company statement announcing his appointment.",
      "\"Brian's experience, relationships and values make him especially well-suited to help UnitedHealthcare improve how health care works for consumers, physicians, employers, governments and our other partners, leading to continued and sustained long-term growth,\" UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty said at the time.",
      "Thompson held other positions over his 20 years at the company, including chief financial officer for UnitedHealthcare's Employer and Individual, Community and State and Medicare and Retirement businesses. He also served as the financial controller for UnitedHealthcare's Employer and Individual business and was a director in the company's corporate development division.",
      "A low-key CEO",
      "For a top executive at a $562 billion company that affects how millions of Americans get health care, Thompson kept a relatively low profile. At an investor meeting last year, he outlined UnitedHealth's shift to \"value-based care,\" paying doctors and other caregivers to keep patients healthy, rather than focusing on treating them when they get sick.",
      "\"Health care should be easier for people,\" Thompson said at the time. \"We are cognizant of the challenges. But navigating a future through value-based care unlocks a situation where the \u2026 family doesn't have to make the decisions on their own.\"",
      "In 2023, Thompson earned total compensation of $10.2 million, according to a\u00a0disclosure\u00a0by UnitedHealth Group.",
      "Before joining UnitedHealth Group, Thompson worked as a certified public accountant at accounting firm PwC, according to his biography on networking site LinkedIn. Thompson graduated from the University of Iowa in 1997 with a bachelor's degree in business administration and most recently resided in Maple Grove, Minnesota.",
      "Following the shooting, UnitedHealthcare canceled its Wednesday meeting with Wall Street analysts and investors, which Thompson had been scheduled to attend.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened and shocked at the passing of our dear friend and colleague Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare,\" UnitedHealth Group said in a statement. \"Brian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him. We are working closely with the New York Police Department and ask for your patience and understanding during this difficult time. Our hearts go out to Brian's family and all who were close to him.\"",
      "On LinkedIn, former colleagues described Thompson as an \"affable\" and \"popular\" leader.",
      "\"BT was whip-smart and affable \u2014 a guy who could grasp the complexities of health care and explain them in simple, relatable terms true to his Iowa upbringing,\" said Matt Burns, who served as vice president of communications at UnitedHealth Group from 2015 to 2018.",
      "Thompson is survived by his wife, Paulette Thompson, and two sons.",
      "\"We are shattered to hear about the senseless killing of our beloved Brian,\" Thompson's wife said in a statement provided to CBS News by her sister. \"Brian was an incredibly loving, generous, talented man who truly lived life to the fullest and touched so many lives. Most importantly, Brian was an incredibly loving father to our two sons and will be greatly missed. We appreciate your well wishes and request complete privacy as our family moves through this difficult time.\"",
      "Minnesota leaders express shock",
      "Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also weighed in on Thompson's death. \"This is a shocking and devastating loss for our whole community. 'Shocking' is the only word I can find at the moment,\" he said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added in a post on social media that Thompson was \"a great man.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 18:09:41 -0500",
    "summary": "Payments to victims of Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com are the largest yet by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
    "story": [
      "More than 4 million Americans gouged by credit repair companies including Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com will soon collectively receive $1.8 billion in refund checks, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced Thursday.",
      "The payments make up the biggest distribution yet from the CFPB's victims relief fund, financed by civil penalties paid by companies that violate consumer protection laws, the agency said.",
      "Checks will be mailed in coming weeks to 4.3 million consumers who were charged illegal advance fees or subjected to allegedly deceptive bait-and-switch advertising by Lexington Law, CreditRepair.com and their parent companies, according to the federal agency.",
      "The CFPB in August 2023 obtained a legal judgment against the credit repair businesses, with a district court ruling the companies had violated a law that prohibits such companies from collecting fees until at least six months after their promised results.",
      "The companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after the court ruling, shutting about 80% of their business operations, including telemarketing call centers.",
      "\"Exploited vulnerable consumers\"",
      "\"Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com exploited vulnerable consumers who were trying to rebuild their credit, charging them illegal junk fees for results they hadn't delivered,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra stated in a news release. \"This historic distribution of $1.8 billion demonstrates the CFPB's commitment to making consumers whole, even when the companies that harm them shut down or declare bankruptcy.\"",
      "Since its launch in 2011, the CFPB has distributed more than $3.3 billion to consumers harmed by a range of illegal practices, such as student loan and mortgage relief scams and predatory lending. The victims relief fund allows the CFPB to provide financial relief in cases where direction compensation from the violating company is not possible.",
      "The brainchild of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, the CFPB was established after the 2008 financial crisis. Funded by the Federal Reserve, the agency has weathered several legal challenges from opponents. The Supreme Court\u00a0in May upheld\u00a0its funding structure, which had been challenged by the payday lending industry.",
      "Still, the agency's efforts could prove short-lived amid calls from some Republicans to weaken the agency or get rid of it entirely. On Wednesday, billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 among those designated by President-elect Donald Trump to\u00a0front an effort\u00a0to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash regulations and cut government spending \u2014 called for deleting the CFPB, arguing in a\u00a0post\u00a0on social media that there are \"too many duplicative regulatory agencies.\"",
      "When will the refund checks be sent?",
      "Payments will be sent between December and January to eligible consumers harmed by the companies, and those eligible do not need to take any action to receive a check.",
      "Those who think they are eligible but have not received a payment by mid-January can then contact JND Legal Administration at www.cfpb-lexlaw.org. Details about the distribution can be found here.",
      "How big will the payments be?",
      "The CFPB said the payments are based on a pro-rata share of fees paid by consumers to CreditRepair.com and Lexington Law, but that the payments might not cover all the fees they incurred.",
      "If the payments were divided evenly, each person would receive about $419.",
      "\"If funds remain after the distribution is complete, additional checks may be sent to consumers who cashed their initial check. You don't need to take any additional action,\" the agency said.",
      "Can I file a claim?",
      "No, according to the agency. \"There won't be opportunities to file claims for this redress case,\" it said.",
      "Is the refund check taxable?",
      "It's unlikely, because the checks are considered refunds for payments that consumers made to the credit repair companies, rather than taxable income, the CFPB said. \"If you have tax-related questions, however, please contact a tax advisor,\" it added.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 17:40:01 -0500",
    "summary": "Even those enrolled in Medicare have a harder time paying for treatment compared with older adults in other countries.",
    "story": [
      "In the U.S., having health insurance is necessary, but not sufficient to ensure access to affordable medical care.",
      "While the U.S. lacks a universal health care system like those that exist in most other wealthy nations, most Americans over 65 are insured through Medicare. Yet many still struggle to afford care, with high out-of-pocket costs putting necessary medications and doctor visits out of reach, according to\u00a0research from The Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit that works to promote an equitable health care system.",
      "These extra costs, for which Medicare beneficiaries are on the hook, make it harder for older Americans to access affordable care relative to their peers in nine other countries, the group found. Researchers compared coverage for older adults in the U.S. to health care systems in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.",
      "Nearly one in four older adults in the U.S. spent at least $2,000 in out-of-pocket expenses last year, compared to less than 5% of older adults in France and the Netherlands who spent that much, The Commonwealth Fund found. Only in Switzerland did older adults report spending more on health care than those in the U.S.",
      "\"The reason to focus on this population is because in the U.S. nearly every adult over 65 has Medicare,\" Munira Z. Gunja, senior researcher for international health policy and practice innovations at The Commonwealth Fund told CBS MoneyWatch. While the U.S. stands out as \"the only high-income country without a universal health system,\" when it comes to the over-65 population, \"at least, we are on par with other countries,\" she said.",
      "Does Medicare fall short?",
      "But the study suggests that the kind of coverage Medicare plans provide isn't meeting many Americans' needs. Eight percent of older adults in the U.S., more than any other wealthy country except Austria, reported delaying or forgoing medical care because of costs. And there are repercussions to not getting the care one needs: One-third of older U.S. adults who said they faced cost-related barriers to accessing care reported being either in fair or poor health.",
      "\"We find that while nearly every older adult has Medicare coverage, it is still more expensive than what older adults in other nations face, and because of that, older adults in the U.S. are more likely to skip care,\" Gunja said. \"When they need prescription drugs, they are more likely to skip getting those too.\"",
      "Oftentimes, for example, Medicare Advantage members find themselves seeing out-of-network doctors, which exposes them to \"a ton of health care costs,\" according to Gunja.",
      "One exception",
      "There's one area in which Medicare beneficiaries faced few out-of-pocket costs and, as a result, were less likely to skip care \u2014 mental health treatment. Less than 5% of residents in all nations skipped mental health care over affordability concerns. The stat illustrates that when treatment is affordable, patients are more inclined to seek out the care they need, according to Gunja.",
      "\"It's a benefit that's offered on all health plans, and we see what happens when people don't need to spend as much on a service,\" she said.",
      "Solutions?",
      "When older people skip or delay care, their health can worsen, leading to sicker patients, who tend to require more costly care. That in turn drives up federal Medicare spending, according to The Commonwealth Fund.",
      "Gunja suggests that the U.S. can look to other countries for solutions that make health care more affordable for older adults. Some examples include capping out-of-pocket expenses and fully covering hospital and physician services.",
      "\"Across the board, the U.S. generally comes out last for most measures when it comes to affordability measures,\" Gunja said. \"Getting health insurance is absolutely necessary. But it's only the first step. We need to make sure coverage is not just comprehensive, but also affordable.\"",

      "Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and urban and rural governments alike are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies.",
      "But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas, abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents are pushing back against the world's most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.",
      "In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling hills of the area's westernmost counties and butt up against wooded bike trails winding through the suburbs. But one of the latest proposals in the area, Plaza 500, would see a 466,000-square-foot facility and adjacent electrical substation built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds and a community center.",
      "The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials promised jobs and a significant property tax boost. But data center critics say the incentives aren't enough to counteract the consequences of building the facilities so close to homes.",
      "Tyler Ray, a leader in the fight against the Virginia project, worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by 2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help power the data centers' hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere.",
      "Ray and his neighbors tried to stop the development, but their efforts were largely unsuccessful. The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project was exempt.",
      "\"I don't know how a general resident, even someone who has been engaging intently on an issue, has any chance to go up against the data center industry,\" Ray said the night the supervisors voted.",

      "For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of direct jobs \u2013 often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently that its investment in nearby Loudoun County, which included two data centers, created around 150 direct jobs, a figure that data center opponents say isn't worth the hassle. But data center advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction, technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730 indirect jobs.",
      "Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax County should reap the benefits.",
      "\"I have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the big picture,\" Smith said. \"Data centers are not going away.\"",
      "On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the 4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia river.",

Those payments, in addition to $1.7 in charitable donations from the company in 2023, have been instrumental in updating infrastructure and bolstering services. These funds have gone toward a new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer and $5,000 grants for homebuyers so far totaling at least $2.8 million.",
      "\"This road right here? Wouldn't happen if it wasn't for AWS,\" said Boardman Mayor Paul Keefer, riding in the passenger seat of Police Chief Rick Stokoe's cruiser, pointing out the window at construction workers shifting dirt and laying pavement.",

    "summary": "Anthem will reverse a policy that would have capped insurance coverage for anesthesia after objections from doctors and lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield said Thursday that the health insurance provider is reversing a policy that was set to go into effect in February of that would have limited anesthesia coverage during surgeries and other procedures, a change that had prompted an outcry from some physicians and lawmakers.",
      "The policy, which would have covered Anthem's plans in Connecticut, New York and Missouri, was disclosed in recent weeks, with the company's New York unit posting a\u00a0notice on Dec. 1. The policy would have excluded people under 22 years old and maternity care.",
      "According to the original policy statement, Anthem had said it would pay only for anesthesia treatments for the length of time that a procedure or surgery is estimated to require based on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's physician work time values. The insurer noted that claims for anesthesia \"above the established number of minutes will be denied.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News on Thursday, Anthem said it was backing away from the policy, and added there had been \"widespread misinformation about an update to our anesthesia policy.\"",
      "\"As a result, we have decided to not proceed with this policy change,\" an Anthem spokesperson wrote in an email. \"To be clear, it never was and never will be the policy of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to not pay for medically necessary anesthesia services. The proposed update to the policy was only designed to clarify the appropriateness of anesthesia consistent with well-established clinical guidelines.\"",
      "Before the announcement of Anthem's reversal, the plan had drawn criticism from medical professionals as well as Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, who wrote on social media on Wednesday that the plan is \"appalling.\"",
      "\"Saddling patients with thousands of dollars in surprise additional medical debt.   And for what? Just to boost corporate profits?\" Murphy wrote. \"Reverse this decision immediately.\"",
      "Connecticut Comptroller Sean Scanlon told the Hartford Courant Thursday that the policy would not take place in his state after negotiating with the insurer.",
      "\"After hearing from people across the state about this concerning policy, my office reached out to Anthem, and I'm pleased to share this policy will no longer be going into effect here in Connecticut,\" Scanlon told the newspaper.",
      "\"Appalling behavior by commercial health insurers\"",
      "In a statement last month, the American Society of Anesthesiologists also called on Anthem to reverse the policy.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 14:39:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Judge Reed O'Connor took issue with both a lack of judicial oversight and certain diversity requirements included in the deal's independent monitoring process.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Texas rejected a proposed plea agreement between the Justice Department and Boeing that would have settled the U.S. government's claims against the company, after crashes of two 737 Max jetliners that killed 346 people, according to a court order issued Thursday.",
      "In his ruling, Judge Reed O'Connor took issue with both a lack of judicial oversight and certain diversity requirements included in the deal's independent monitoring process and ordered the parties to provide the court with a plan for possible ways forward early next month.",
      "The federal government's proposed agreement with airplane manufacturing giant over the deadly crashes included various provisions, including an admission of guilt to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and a $243.6 million fine \u2014 much less than the billions the families of the victims had requested. The deal would also have required Boeing to spend $455 million on safety programs and to work with an independent monitor who would oversee the company's progress.",
      "Investigators alleged in court records that leading up to the crashes, Boeing deceived federal officials who regulated the planes. In 2021, Boeing and the Justice Department entered into a deferred prosecution agreement, which meant the criminal charge would have been dropped if Boeing had complied with the terms of the deal. But earlier this year, federal prosecutors informed the court that Boeing had not followed through on all of the requirements and intended to move forward with the case.",
      "By July, after weeks of negotiations, Boeing and the Justice Department settled on the proposed plea agreement, prompting an outcry from families of those who died in the crashes. At the time, CBS News reported the deal only covered wrongdoing by Boeing tied to the crashes and did not give the company immunity for other incidents, including a door panel that blew off a Max jetliner during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. According to a Justice Department official, the proposed agreement also did not cover any current or former Boeing officials, only the corporation.",
      "Attorneys for some of the victims' families opposed the deal, arguing the \"rotten\" agreement with the government did not justly remedy the families' claims against Boeing. In court filings, they accused Boeing of more criminality and urged stricter penalties, harsher monitoring and recognition of the lives lost.",
      "In rejecting the plea agreement, the judge took aim at diversity, equity and inclusion considerations that the parties said they would take when hiring an independent monitor. He wrote that he was \"concerned with the Government's shifting and contradictory explanations of how the plea agreement's diversity-and-inclusion provision will practically operate in this case.\"",
      "Judge O'Connor had previously raised this issue and in responsive court filings, the Justice Department defended the language, arguing it predated the Boeing agreement. \"This new language reflected not a change in policy but rather a principle that has always governed the process: that selection of a monitor must be based solely on merit, from the broadest possible pool of qualified candidates,\" they said.",
      "O'Connor ruled Thursday that the language was inappropriate: \"In a case of this magnitude, it is in the utmost interest of justice that the public is confident this monitor selection is done based solely on competency. The parties' DEI efforts only serve to undermine this confidence in the Government and Boeing's ethics and anti-fraud efforts.\"",
      "The judge also wrote that the Justice Department's previous efforts to oversee Boeing's conduct \"failed\" and said the independent monitor provision in the proposed deal did not go far enough to include the court in the process.",
      "\"At this point, the public interest requires the Court to step in. Marginalizing the Court in the selection and monitoring of the independent monitor as the plea agreement does undermines public confidence in Boeing's probation, fails to promote respect for the law, and is therefore not in the public interest,\" O'Connor wrote, \"Accordingly, the Court cannot accept the plea agreement.\"",
      "The Justice Department said it's reviewing the decision. Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "In a statement, Paul Cassell, an attorney for some of the victims' families, told CBS News, \"Judge O'Connor has recognized that this was a cozy deal between the Government and Boeing that failed to focus on the overriding concerns \u2013 holding Boeing accountable for its deadly crime and ensuring that nothing like this happens again in the future.\"",

    "summary": "A growing number of unemployed workers have been searching for a new job for more than 15 weeks, labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "The unemployment rate might be near a historic low, but it's taking longer for hundreds of thousands of out-of-work Americans to find new jobs, signaling cracks within a once-hot labor market as employers continue to cope with the impact of higher borrowing costs.",
      "About 40% of the 7 million people who were out of work in October, or roughly 2.84 million people, have been looking for work for more than 15 weeks, an increase of 20% since a year earlier, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. More than half of those job seekers have been on the hunt for new employment for more than 27 weeks, or about half a year.",
      "A drawn-out job search is increasingly common in the labor market today as companies hold off on hiring, especially in some industries such as tech and professional services, ZipRecruiter chief economist Julia Pollak told CBS MoneyWatch. It's a far cry from the heady years of 2021 and 2022, when Americans switched jobs at high rates in search of better pay and more fulfilling work, a trend termed \"The Great Resignation.\"",
      "The job market has since weakened under the strain of the Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy, with the central bank boosting borrowing rates to their highest point in 23 years to combat inflation, Pollak noted. While inflation has rapidly cooled in the past two years and the Fed began cutting rates in September, the burden of higher borrowing costs has caused consumers to pull back on buying cars and homes, impacting key sectors of the economy, Pollak said.",
      "The job market today reflects \"low hiring, low firing and low job-switching,\" Pollak noted. \"It's this 'big stay'-type of situation \u2014 it's great if you have a job you like, and it's not great if you don't have a job.\"",
      "Employers in October hired 12,000 workers, a jobs report that marked the slowest month for hiring since December 2020. As the anemic number reflects, businesses were weighed down by Hurricanes Milton and Helene as well as labor disputes such as the Boeing machinists strike.",
      "Leading up to the November 5 election, a majority of American held a\u00a0dim view of the strength of the U.S. economy, a factor partly credited with helping President-elect Donald Trump claim victory. While much of voters' anger was focused on inflation, the job market also played a role in their views, with the unemployment rate inching up from a pandemic low of 3.4%, and with some workers saying their pay\u00a0hasn't yet caught up to inflation.",
      "Since the election, though, voters' views of the economy\u00a0have improved, especially among Trump supporters, CBS News polling has found.",
      "November's jobs report",
      "On Friday, the Labor Department will release the November jobs report, with economists forecasting 207,000 new hires last month, according to financial data firm FactSet. The jobless rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%, near 50-year lows.",
      "\"The broader thread in the labor market has been a slow, gradual cooling, and the question is whether after accounting for these quirks if that will still be evident\" in Friday's data, Pollack noted, referring to businesses recovering after the storms and the labor strikes.",
      "Employers cut almost 60,000 jobs last month, an increase of 27% from a year earlier, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The automotive and tech industries had the largest numbers of layoffs last month, the group said.",
      "\"The automotive industry is currently experiencing significant challenges, including potential tariffs affecting U.S. automakers with overseas factories, intensifying competition from Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, and shifts in government subsidies for EVs,\" Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas said in a statement.",
      "The job market and interest rate cuts",
      "The slowing labor market helped sway the Federal Reserve's decision to begin cutting rates in September, which marked the central bank's\u00a0first rate cut in four years. The Fed followed with a second rate cut in November, and a majority of economists are forecasting another reduction at the central bank's December 18 meeting.",
      "According to BNP Parabas analysts, the job market may be in a period of uncertainty partly due to the election.",
      "\"In September, an Atlanta Fed/Duke University survey found that 30% of businesses were paring investment plans due to uncertainty about the then-upcoming election,\" the analysts wrote in a recent research report, noting that they are predicting another rate cut this month.",
      "They added, \"Though we suspect that pre-election uncertainty played a role in restraining hiring of late, this report (due on 6 December) may be too early to reveal a clear unlocking of previously postponed hiring. Uncertainties about tariffs, immigration and fiscal policy remain.\"",
      "Even so, some economists are paring their forecasts for the pace of the Fed's expected rate cuts in 2025, citing President-elect Trump's plans to impose tariffs, cut taxes and deport millions of illegal immigrants, which could, if enacted, reignite inflation.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 16:52:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Jared Isaacman is an entrepreneur and veteran private astronaut with strong ties to Elon Musk and his rocket company SpaceX.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, a veteran private astronaut with strong ties to Elon Musk and his rocket company SpaceX, has been picked to serve as NASA's next administrator, President-elect Donald Trump  announced Wednesday.",
      "If confirmed, Isaacman, 41, would be the fifth NASA administrator with spaceflight experience, replacing former Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, who flew into orbit aboard the space shuttle Columbia in early 1986.",
      "\"I am delighted to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,\" Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social. \"... Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.\"",
      "Isaacman founded the payment processing company later named Shift4 Payments while he was a high school student. He chartered the first purely commercial, all-civilian American \"space tourist\" mission \u2014 Inspiration4 \u2014 in February 2021, paying SpaceX an undisclosed amount to launch him and three other civilian flyers on a two-day, 23-hour flight.",
      "He flew to space again this past September, commanding the first of three planned SpaceX Polaris missions, logging nearly five days in space on a flight that took the crew farther from Earth than any astronauts have gone since the Apollo moon program. Isaacman also became the first private citizen to carry out a spacewalk.",
      "He is scheduled to lead another Polaris mission aboard a SpaceX capsule before leading the first crew to space aboard the California rocket builder's gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "Dates have not been announced for either of those missions, and it's not yet clear what impact Isaacman's selection to lead NASA will have on those flights, whether Isaacman still intends to fly aboard one or both or what sort of influence his friendship with Musk might have on NASA's future direction.",
      "But Isaacman, a skilled pilot who flies his own MiG-29 fighter jet, made it clear in a post following Trump's announcement that NASA can expect him to be a vocal space advocate who will help \"usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilization.\"",
      "\"With the support of President Trump, I can promise you this: We will never again lose our ability to journey to the stars and never settle for second place,\" Isaacman said. \"We will inspire children, yours and mine, to look up and dream of what is possible. Americans will walk on the moon and Mars and in doing so, we will make life better here on Earth.\"",
      "He said it would be the \"honor of a lifetime to serve in this role and to work alongside NASA's extraordinary team to realize our shared dreams of exploration and discovery.\"",
      "Jim Bridenstine, Nelson's predecessor at the helm of NASA, helped kickstart the agency's Artemis moon program during the first Trump administration.",
      "He said in a statement Wednesday that \"Jared's vision for pushing boundaries, paired with his proven track record of success in private industry, positions him as an ideal candidate to lead NASA into a bold new era of exploration and discovery. I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm him.\"",
      "The Isaacman announcement comes as NASA struggles to keep the Artemis program on track amid tight budgets and what the agency's own inspector general calls the \"unsustainable\" costs of NASA's Space Launch System, or SLS, moon rocket.",
      "SpaceX supporters argue the company's more powerful, fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship rocket is the obvious choice for deep space exploration, but the huge rocket is far from operational with just a half-dozen suborbital test flights to its credit.",
      "The SLS, on the other hand, is considered operational in that it completed an initial test flight in November 2022, sending an unpiloted Orion capsule around the moon and back. But unlike the Super Heavy-Starship, the SLS is a throwaway, expendable booster expected to cost some $1.4 billion for each of its first four moon missions.",
      "NASA is currently gearing up to launch three NASA astronauts and a Canadian flyer on an SLS-Orion mission \u2014 Artemis 2 \u2014 late next year. But problems with the first Orion's heat shield and other issues threaten to push the Artemis 2 flight into 2026, years past initial expectations.",
      "It's not yet clear when the Artemis 3 mission, the first to carry astronauts to a landing near the moon's south pole, might be feasible.",
      "But that flight will feature a lunar lander built by SpaceX, a variant of the company's Starship upper stage. SpaceX has carried out six test flights of the fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship to date, but has not yet put the Starship upper stage into orbit or brought it down for an intact landing.",
      "Given the company's rapid-fire test schedule, most observers believe SpaceX will get the Super Heavy-Starship working as planned in the near future, but scores of test flights will be required to demonstrate the safety and reliability required by NASA to put astronauts aboard.",
      "And the moon mission poses unique challenges.",
      "For the initial landing mission, multiple Super Heavy \"tanker\" flights will be required to refuel the moon lander in low-Earth orbit before it can be sent to the moon. Once in lunar orbit, it will await the arrival of the Artemis 3 crew, launched aboard an Orion capsule by an SLS rocket.",
      "After boarding the Starship lander, two astronauts would descend to the surface, carry out the mission's planned exploration, and then head back up to the orbiting Orion for the trip back to Earth.",

      "Most Social Security recipients receive one check each month, but a quirk of the calendar means some older Americans didn't get a check at the start of December. On top of that, some beneficiaries may see their annual cost-of-living adjustment kick in this month, earlier than the typical starting month of January.",
      "While the Social Security Administration sets its\u00a0annual payment schedule\u00a0well in advance of the year, the payment dates could take some seniors by surprise this month, for both better and worse.",

      "In October, the Social Security Administration set its 2025\u00a0cost-of-living adjustment at 2.5%, the smallest annual COLA hike since 2021. The COLA is based on recent inflation rates, and because price hikes have cooled from their pandemic high, seniors are getting a smaller benefit increase for the next year.",

    "story": [
      "Amazon secretly excluded two ZIP codes from its fastest delivery service while charging nearly 50,000 Prime members who live in the areas its full Prime subscription price, the District of Columbia's attorney general alleges in a lawsuit filed Wednesday.",
      "Amazon violated consumer protection laws by stopping its quickest delivery service to the two historically lower-income neighborhoods, then misled customers about why their packages were arriving later than advertised when they complained, according to the suit filed in D.C. Superior Court.",
      "The world's biggest online retailer's paid subscription service, Amazon Prime, offers two-day delivery for millions of items, as well as next-day or same-day for many other products for $139 a year, or $14.99 a month.",
      "Amazon in June 2022 decided to stop using its fleet of branded trucks to make Prime deliveries to D.C. ZIP codes 20019 and 20020, servicing them instead with third-party delivery services like UPS and the U.S. Postal Service. The company knew the decision would result in significantly slower deliveries for the areas, but did not tell existing or prospective customers, the suit alleges.",
      "Amazon informed the attorney general's office that the change came as the result of safety concerns for its drivers, the attorney general said. Yet the company was legally obligated to disclose the change to customers.",
      "\"Amazon is charging tens of thousands of hard-working Ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide. While Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one ZIP code is worth less than a dollar in another,\" D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb stated in a news\u00a0release.\"We're suing to stop this deceptive conduct and make sure District residents get what they're paying for.\"",
      "Amazon Prime two-day delivery",
      "Last year, the rest of the city's Prime members received packages within two days of checkout 75% of the time, but those in the impacted ZIP codes received their orders within two days just 24% of the time, according to the suit.",
      "Amazon dismissed as \"categorically false\" claims that its business practices are discriminatory or deceptive.",
      "\"We want to be able to deliver as fast as we possibly can to every ZIP code across the country, however, at the same time we must put the safety of delivery drivers first,\" an Amazon spokesperson said in an emailed statement.",
      "The spokesperson added, \"In the ZIP codes in question, there have been specific and targeted acts against drivers delivering Amazon packages. We made the deliberate choice to adjust our operations, including delivery routes and times, for the sole reason of protecting the safety of drivers.\"",
      "The company said it's clear with customers about expected delivery dates. \"And we're always transparent with customers during the shopping journey and checkout process about when, exactly, they can expect their orders to arrive,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Amazon would like to work with the attorney general's office to reduce crime and improve safety in those areas, the spokesperson stated. \"Nevertheless, we will proceed in the process and demonstrate that providing fast and accurate delivery times and prioritizing the same of customers and delivery partners are not mutually exclusive.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Department of Labor is proposing to phase out a controversial Depression-era program that lets some employers pay disabled workers less than the federal minimum wage.",
      "Federal law currently allows the agency to issue certificates that let employers pay certain workers less than the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour based on the notion that their disabilities hinder productivity. Intended to help those with disabilities gain employment, the law currently has about 40,000 American workers laboring for half the minimum wage or less, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"Many earn less than half, some earn just pennies on the dollar,\" Taryn Williams, assistant secretary of labor for disability employment, said at a Tuesday news briefing.",

      "The Labor Department's proposal follows a review of the program, and the new rule would not take effect until a public comment period ends on Jan. 17, 2025, days before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. The new administration could review and respond to the comments and issue a final rule, or withdraw it entirely.",
      "Still, even if the proposal is not enacted, subminimum pay for those with disabilities could become a thing of the past, as more than a dozen states and the District of Columbia have already banned the program.

    "summary": "About 3.7 million people are at immediate risk of losing health coverage should the federal government cut funding for Medicaid expansions, as some allies of President-elect Donald Trump have proposed.",
    "story": [
      "With Donald Trump's return to the White House and Republicans taking full control of Congress in 2025, the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion is back on the chopping block.",
      "More than 3 million adults in nine states would be at immediate risk of losing their health coverage should the GOP reduce the extra federal Medicaid funding that's enabled states to widen eligibility, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, and the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families. That's because the states have trigger laws that would swiftly end their Medicaid expansions if federal funding falls.",
      "The states are Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia.",
      "The 2010 Affordable Care Act encouraged states to expand Medicaid programs to cover more low-income Americans who didn't get health insurance through their jobs. Forty states and the District of Columbia agreed, extending health insurance since 2014 to an estimated 21 million people and helping drive the U.S. uninsured rate to record lows.",
      "In exchange, the federal government pays 90% of the cost to cover the expanded population. That's far higher than the federal match for other Medicaid beneficiaries, which averages about 57% nationwide.",
      "Conservative policy groups, which generally have opposed the ACA, say the program costs too much and covers too many people. Democrats say the Medicaid expansion has saved lives and helped communities by widening coverage to people who could not afford private insurance.",
      "If Congress cuts federal funding, Medicaid expansion would be at risk in all states that have opted into it \u2014 even those without trigger laws \u2014 because state legislatures would be forced to make up the difference, said Renuka Tipirneni, an associate professor at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health.",
      "Decisions to keep or roll back the expansion \"would depend on the politics at the state level,\" Tipirneni said.",
      "For instance, Michigan approved a trigger as part of its Medicaid expansion in 2013, when it was controlled by a Republican governor and legislature. Last year, with the government controlled by Democrats, the state eliminated its funding trigger.",
      "Six of the nine states with trigger laws \u2014 Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Montana, North Carolina and Utah \u2014 went for Trump in the 2024 election.",
      "Most of the nine states' triggers kick in if federal funding falls below the 90% threshold. Arizona's trigger would eliminate its expansion if funding falls below 80%.",
      "Montana's law rolls back expansion below 90% funding but allows it to continue if lawmakers identify additional funding. Under state law, Montana lawmakers must reauthorize its Medicaid expansion in 2025 or the expansion will end.",
      "Across the states with triggers, between 3.1 million and 3.7 million people would swiftly lose their coverage, researchers at KFF and the Georgetown center estimate. The difference depends on how states treat people who were added to Medicaid before the ACA expansion; they may continue to qualify even if the expansion ends.",
      "Three other states \u2014 Iowa, Idaho and New Mexico\u2014 have laws that require their governments to mitigate the financial impact of losing federal Medicaid expansion funding but would not automatically end expansions. With those three states included, about 4.3 million Medicaid expansion enrollees would be at risk of losing coverage, according to KFF.",
      "The ACA allowed Medicaid expansions to adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or about $20,783 for an individual in 2024.",
      "Nearly a quarter of the 81 million people enrolled in Medicaid nationally are in the program due to expansions.",
      "\"With a reduction in the expansion match rate, it is likely that all states would need to evaluate whether to continue expansion coverage because it would require a significant increase in state spending,\" said Robin Rudowitz, vice president and director of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF. \"If states drop coverage, it is likely that there would be an increase in the number of uninsured, and that would limit access to care across red and blue states that have adopted expansion.\"",
      "States rarely cut eligibility for social programs such as Medicaid once it's been granted.",
      "The triggers make it politically easier for state lawmakers to end Medicaid expansion because they would not have to take any new action to cut coverage, said Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families.",
      "To see the impact of trigger laws, consider what happened after the Supreme Court in 2022 struck down Roe v. Wade and, with it, the constitutional right to an abortion. Conservative lawmakers in 13 states had crafted trigger laws that would automatically implement bans in the event a national right to abortion were struck down. Those state laws resulted in restrictions taking effect immediately after the court ruling, or shortly thereafter.",
      "States adopted triggers as part of Medicaid expansion to win over lawmakers skeptical of putting state dollars on the hook for a federal program unpopular with most Republicans.",
      "It's unclear what Trump and congressional Republicans will do with Medicaid after he takes office in January, but one indicator could be a recent recommendation from the Paragon Health Institute, a leading conservative policy organization led by former Trump health adviser Brian Blase.",
      "Paragon has proposed that starting in 2026 the federal government would phase down the 90% federal match for expansion until 2034, when it would reach parity with each state's federal match for its traditional enrollees. Under that plan, states could still get ACA Medicaid expansion funding but restrict coverage to enrollees with incomes up to the federal poverty level. Currently, to receive expansion funding, states must offer coverage to everyone up to 138% of the poverty level.",
      "Daniel Derksen, director of the Center for Rural Health at the University of Arizona, said it's unlikely Arizona would move to eliminate its trigger and make up for lost federal funds. \"It would be a tough sell right now as it would put a big strain on the budget,\" he said.",
      "Medicaid has been in the crosshairs of Republicans in Washington before. Republican congressional leaders in 2017 proposed legislation to cut federal expansion funding, a move that would have shifted billions in costs to states. That plan, part of a strategy to repeal Obamacare, ultimately failed.",

    "summary": "As China responds to the latest U.S. measures by banning the export of several key minerals, one analyst warns of \"a trade war that has no winners.\"",
    "story": [
      "China announced on Tuesday a ban on the export of a number of minerals with military and technology applications to the U.S., one day after the Biden administration further curbed its own exports as part of its crackdown on China's semiconductor industry.",
      "The Chinese ban applies to the minerals antimony, gallium and germanium. It also restricts the export of graphite. The minerals are used in a wide range of things including semiconductors, infrared technologies, fiber optic cables, bullets and electric vehicle batteries.",
      "\"These new controls only underscore the importance of strengthening our efforts with other countries to de-risk and diversify critical supply chains away from PRC (China),\" a White House spokesperson was quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency.",
      "\"In principle, the export of gallium, germanium, antimony, and superhard materials to the United States shall not be permitted,\" the Chinese Commerce Ministry said in its directive.",
      "According to consultancy Project Blue, China accounted for 98.8% of refined gallium production and 59.2% of refined germanium output this year. Last year, it accounted for 48% of globally mined antimony, which is used in items including nuclear weapons, ammunition and batteries.",
      "\"The move is a considerable escalation of tensions in supply chains where access to raw material units is already tight in the West,\" Project Blue cofounder Jack Bedder told Reuters.",
      "China issued the new ban just two days after the U.S. curbed exports to 140 companies in China's semiconductor industry. The U.S. crackdown \u2014 the third in three years \u2014 was aimed at stymieing China's ability to advance artificial intelligence technologies for military applications.",
      "The escalating tit-for-tat economic measures by Washington and Beijing come weeks before the swearing in of President-elect Donald Trump for his second term. During his first term, Trump launched a trade war with China, and he's threatened to escalate the standoff once again with a new 10% blanket tariff on all Chinese imports once he returns to office.",
      "\"It comes as no surprise that China has responded to the increasing restrictions by American authorities, current and imminent, with its own restrictions on the supply of these strategic minerals,\" Peter Arkell, chairman of the Global Mining Association of China, told Reuters. \"It's a trade war that has no winners.\"",

      "Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific airline has apologized for offering passengers an episode of the American show \"Family Guy\" to watch that includes a scene and a joke referencing the notorious 1989 crackdown on protesters in the Chinese capital's Tiananmen Square.",
      "The episode, from the first season of the American animated series, shows father figure Peter Griffin standing next to the \"Tank Man\" in a recreation of an infamous photograph depicting a lone resistor to China's military forces as they moved in to disperse a days-long pro-democracy protest. As the tanks approach, the cartoon dad says: \"Ah screw this, I just came over to buy some fireworks,\" before fleeing.",
      "A spokesperson for Hong Kong's flagship airline told the South China Morning Post\u00a0on Tuesday that it had apologized to customers after someone complained on social media about the episode being offered in-flight.",

      "On June 4, 1989, Chinese soldiers ordered in by Communist Party hardliners  opened fire on thousands of protesters who had occupied Beijing's central Tiananmen Square.",
      "The enduring \"Tank Man\" image has come to symbolize the bloody crackdown, which Chinese authorities have gone to great lengths to erase from history since it happened. CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer visited the square 30 years after the crackdown, in 2019, and found nothing there to commemorate the events, and when she showed photos of the crackdown, including the \"Tank Man\" picture, to young Chinese passers-by, none of them recognized the images.",
      "After unprecedented pro-democracy protests swept across Hong Kong in 2019, authorities in the semi-autonomous Chinese region cracked down on dissent, rounding up hundreds of opposition and civil society figures and quickly adopting new national security legislation cementing Beijing's control.",
      "In November, a\u00a0Hong Kong court charged 47 people, including some prominent pro-democracy activists, over their involvement in an unofficial primary to pick opposition candidates.",

      "The Dec. 2 announcement is sparking questions about whether the site is satire, as well as the identity of the people behind the apparent relaunch. The new Enron website includes the kind of blandly uplifting videos often favored by corporate PR departments, such as a ballerina at the beach and a rocket launch, with a voice over talking about \"rebirth\" and accepting change.",

      "The College Company is run by Connor Gaydos, whose LinkedIn account now identifies him as the CEO of Enron.

      "In making the announcement, Trump praised Long's \"32 years of experience running his own businesses in Real Estate and, as one of the premier Auctioneers in the Country.\" He also noted that since leaving Congress in 2023, Long has worked as a business and tax adviser.",

      "Naming Long as the next IRS chief drew both support from conservatives as well as criticism from the left, with Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia who serves on the House Ways and Means Tax subcommittee calling it a \"terrible mistake,\" while Idaho Republican Senator Mike Crapo issued a statement saying he's looking forward to hearing Long's ideas for the tax agency. The fiscally conservative National Taxpayers Union Foundation praised Trump's choice, saying Long could help reform the IRS.",

      "Long, who attended the University of Missouri but didn't graduate, described himself on a\u00a0website\u00a0for his congressional run as a \"fourth-generation native of Southwest Missouri.\" He touted his skills as an auctioneer, noting that he had been named the \"best auctioneer in the Ozarks for seven years in a row.\"",
      "Long also worked in real estate and in talk radio, hosting a show on a Missouri AM radio station.",
      "He shuttered his auction firm, Billy Long Auctions, before he was sworn into Congress in 2011, according to a local publication.",
      "What professional experience does Long have with taxes?",
      "As a congressman, Long co-sponsored some tax-related bills, including several efforts to eliminate the estate tax as well as a measure called the Tax Code Termination Act.",
      "That legislation would have wiped out much of the current tax code, replacing it with what the bill called a \"simple and fair system\" that would have applied \"a low rate to all Americans.\" Such flat taxes are considered regressive by many experts because low- and middle-income taxpayers would end up paying a larger share of their incomes than would wealthy Americans.",
      "\"As a business owner, Billy knows first-hand how government regulation and heavy taxes can affect the small businesses that serve as the economic engine of our country,\" his campaign site noted.",
      "While Long isn't an accountant or CPA, he has been involved in tax advising since leaving Congress. In a 2023 podcast, for example, he touted his work helping businesses use the Employee Retention Tax Credit, a credit that the IRS has\u00a0flagged for its high rate of fraud.",
      "In the podcast, Long also said that when he served as a congressman, he helped make the ERTC easier for businesses to claim, noting that the credit was difficult to qualify for during its first iteration.",
      "\"We went from having to say COVID adversely affected your business definitely, to taking that away, and you don't have to prove that you had any downturn,\" he said. \"We're doing recoveries for folks that had their best two years ever during COVID.\"",
      "The IRS says the ERTC is aimed at employers who paid wages to workers between March 12, 2020, and January 1, 2022, and that were either suspended by government order during the pandemic or experienced a \"required decline in gross receipts during 2020 or the first three calendar quarters of 2021.\" The credit is also available to startups that began at the end of 2021 and had less than $1 million in revenue.",
      "How does Long's experience compare with prior IRS commissioners?",
      "Long's lack of tax industry experience sets him apart from other recent IRS commissioners.",
      "Werfel, the current IRS chief, has an undergraduate degree from Cornell University and a master's degree in public policy from Duke University as well as a law degree from the University of North Carolina. He's also held a number of government jobs involved in operations and the IRS, including serving as acting commissioner of the IRS from May to December 2013, according to his biography.",
      "Werfel's predecessor, Charles Rettig, who was appointed by President-elect Trump, also held several degrees, including a master's in taxation. Before joining the IRS, Rettig worked as a tax attorney for more than three decades and served as the chairman of the IRS Advisory Council.",
      "What is happening with the IRS now?",
      "Under Werfel, the IRS has expanded audits of wealthy taxpayers and big corporations, clawing back billions in unpaid taxes, efforts that were funded by the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "The tax agency has also reduced the time it takes consumers to connect with an IRS employee, while also rolling out a free tax filing system called Direct File.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have pushed back against the expanded IRS funding, claiming\u00a0the agency would use the money to hire thousands of new agents to increase audits on middle-class taxpayers.",
      "The Treasury had said that funding could help the IRS add nearly 87,000 full-time workers over 10 years, but the agency didn't specify whether those new workers would be auditors, customer service workers or other types of employees. That figure also represented the total number of employees that could be hired, without calculating the impact of the number of IRS workers who are expected to retire or leave the department over the next several years.",
      "Some Democratic lawmakers are expressing concern that, if appointed, Long could disrupt the progress that the IRS has made under Werfel.",
      "Werfel \"has done an excellent job rebuilding the IRS, boosting customer service and enhancing enforcement aimed at wealthy tax evaders,\" Rep. Beyer said in a statement. \"Removing him will clearly signal Trump's intention to make the agency less responsive to the American people, while giving a green light to wealthy tax cheats to evade their fair share of the tax burden.\"",
      "Still, Republican lawmakers expressed support for the pick, such as Senator Crapo, who highlighted \"privacy and security\" issues at the IRS and \"inefficient use of resources.\" He added, \"I look forward to learning more about Mr. Long's vision for the agency.\"",

    "summary": "President Biden is weighing giving preemptive pardons to perceived enemies of President-elect Donald Trump to shield them from possible \"retribution.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Biden is considering blanket preemptive pardons for prominent critics of President-elect Donald Trump in both parties to shield them from possible \"retribution\" or legal prosecution by the incoming administration.",
      "Multiple people familiar with the ongoing discussions tell CBS News the president has debated with senior White House aides the possibility of issuing the preemptive pardons, but no specific names have been formally recommended to him. The concept of preemptive pardons, and names of people who could benefit from them, have been more rigorously discussed among administration officials expected to help Mr. Biden make final determinations, a group that includes White House Chief of Staff Jeffrey Zients and White House Counsel Ed Siskel.",
      "Among those who could be eligible for preemptive legal relief include well-known names at the center of many of the most rancorous moments of the first Trump administration, many of whom remain the subject of his public ire.",
      "The list includes Dr. Anthony Fauci, who helped coordinate the nation's COVID-19 response and later served as Mr. Biden's top science adviser; retired Gen. Mark A. Milley, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who has called Trump a \"fascist\" and provided information for several books and news reports detailing the former president's behavior and activities around the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol; California Democratic Senator-elect Adam Schiff, and other Democratic and Republican lawmakers who led the two impeachment cases against Trump or sat on the House committee that reviewed the Jan. 6 attack \u2014   a group that includes former Wyoming Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, who actively campaigned against Trump this past fall.",
      "Fauci, Milley and Cheney were not immediately available for comment.\u00a0In an interview with NPR in late November, Schiff said he didn't think a preemptive pardon is a good idea, because \"I think the courts are strong enough to withstand\" threats made by Trump.",
      "\"I think this is frankly so implausible as not to be worthy of much consideration,\" Schiff said. \"I would urge the president not to do that. I think it would seem defensive and unnecessary.\"",
      "News that Mr. Biden was considering preemptive pardons\u00a0was first reported this week by Politico. The White House initially would not engage on the subject this week, but confirmation that the idea is under consideration comes in the wake of the president's sweeping pardon for his son, Hunter Biden, shielding him from all potential criminal activity over 11 years.",
      "The pardon, the first ever issued by any American president for one of his children, came Sunday in the wake of Trump's announced plans to nominate Pam Bondi to serve as attorney general and Kash Patel to lead the FBI. Bondi, Patel and others set for positions in the second Trump administration have spent years discussing plans to seek retribution for Trump's critics or to take steps to stifle news outlets considered critical or hostile to the president-elect.",
      "Rep. Brendan Boyle, Democrat of Pennsylvania, first publicly suggested this week that Mr. Biden should issue preemptive pardons.",
      "\"Trump has made it clear that he is more focused on settling personal scores than on protecting the American people or upholding the rule of law,\" he said in a statement of Trump's plan to nominate Patel to lead the FBI.",
      "In addition to issuing preemptive protection to Trump's political enemies, Mr. Biden is also preparing to grant more traditional \"criminal justice pardons\" in the coming weeks for nonviolent drug offenders or others who've served time for various offensives and are often the beneficiaries of presidential pardons, according to one of the people familiar with his plans.",
      "The White House has been fielding hundreds of requests for such pardons or clemency, including from Rev. Jesse Jackson,\u00a0who this week wrote to the president asking for pardons\u00a0for his son, former Illinois Democratic congressman Jesse Jackson Jr., and his daughter-in-law, former Chicago Alderwoman Sandi Jackson. This week House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, suggested Mr. Biden should pardon \"on a case-by-case basis the working-class Americans in the federal prison system whose lives have been ruined by unjustly aggressive prosecutions for nonviolent offenses.\"",

      "The federal Bureau of Prisons is permanently closing the notorious \"rape club\" women's prison in Dublin, Califorina, and will idle six facilities in a sweeping realignment after years of abuse, decay and mismanagement.",
      "The agency informed employees and Congress on Thursday through a notification that it plans to shutter the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin that has been the focus of controversy for a number of years. The bureau is additionally deactivating multiple minimum-security prison camps in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Colorado, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Florida.",
      "The agency said staff and inmates at the impacted locations will be moved to other facilities.",
      "The document issued by the Bureau of Prisons said it was taking \"decisive and strategic action\" to address \"significant challenges, including a critical staffing shortage, crumbling infrastructure and limited budgetary resources.\" The agency said it is not downsizing and is committed to finding positions for every affected employee.",
      "The closures are a striking coda to the Biden administration's stewardship of the Justice Department's biggest agency. After repeatedly promising to reform FCI Dublin and other troubled facilities, Bureau of Prisons Director Colette Peters is pivoting to closures and consolidation, citing inadequate staffing and staggering costs to repair aging infrastructure.",
      "The permanent shutdown of FCI Dublin, just east of San Francisco, comes seven months after\u00a0a temporary closure was announced following reform attempts\u00a0in the wake of staff-on-inmate abuse that led to the \"rape club\" moniker. At the time, it appeared the agency was set on closing the low-security prison, but officials held out the possibility that it could be repaired and reopened for a different purpose, such as housing male inmates.",
      "The assessment identified considerable repairs necessary to reopen the FCI Dublin, the agency said. Low staffing, exacerbated by the high cost of living in the Bay Area, also contributed to the decision to close the facility, the agency said.",
      "\"We understand the impact the closure will have on our employees and are committed to ensuring all are able to continue accomplishing the agency's mission at other locations,\" the statement read.",
      "The prison has been at the center of a\u00a0years-long investigation. Since 2021, at least eight employees, including a former warden, have been charged with sexually abusing inmates.",
      "Five employees have pleaded guilty. Two were convicted at trial, including former warden Ray Garcia. The case against the eighth employee is pending.",
      "At the time of the closure announcement, FCI Dublin was housing about 600 inmates.",
      "The move comes three years after the agency closed its troubled New York jail in Manhattan after myriad problems came to light in the wake of Jeffrey Epstein's suicide there, including lax security, staffing shortages and squalid, unsafe conditions such as falling concrete and busted cells.",
      "The Bureau of Prisons and the correctional workers union have repeatedly pushed for additional federal prison funding, highlighting what they say is an inadequate amount of money to address pay increases, staff retention and a multibillion-dollar repair backlog. More than half of federal prison facilities were built before 1991 and many are becoming outmoded or obsolete, the agency said.",
      "The agency said it expects that reassigning employees to remaining facilities will boost retention and cut down on mandatory overtime and augmentation, a practice by which cooks, teachers, nurses and other prison workers are assigned to guard inmates.",
      "FCI Dublin's permanent closure represents an extraordinary acknowledgement by the Bureau of Prisons that it has failed to fix the facility's culture and environment in the wake of AP reporting that exposed rampant sexual abuse within its walls. Hundreds of people who were incarcerated at FCI Dublin are suing the agency, seeking reforms and monetary compensation for mistreatment at the facility.",
      "The closures at FCI Dublin and across the federal prison system come amid an AP investigation that has uncovered deep, previously unreported flaws within the Bureau of Prisons. AP reporting has disclosed widespread criminal activity by employees, dozens of escapes, chronic violence, deaths and severe staffing shortages that have hampered responses to emergencies, including assaults and suicides.",

      "Gaetz immediately resigned from Congress after Trump announced he wanted the Florida Republican to join his Cabinet. The timing of his resignation came days before the House panel was set to vote on releasing its report on Gaetz.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, urged the committee to keep the report secret, arguing that a former member is beyond the panel's jurisdiction and it would set a \"terrible precedent.\"",
      "\"I believe it is very important to maintain the House's tradition of not issuing ethics reports on people who are no longer members of Congress,\" he said on Nov. 15. \"The House Ethics Committee's jurisdiction is over sitting members of Congress. That's an important rule.\"",
      "Casten's resolution cited four instances in which the Ethics Committee has released reports on its investigations into members after they've resigned.",
      "The bipartisan committee met Nov. 20 to consider whether to release the report, but was evenly split along party lines about how to move forward. A day later, Gaetz withdrew himself from consideration, facing a tenuous path to Senate confirmation. There was growing interest from senators on both sides of the aisle in seeing the report before a confirmation vote.",
      "The House Ethics Committee met again Thursday to discuss its investigation into allegations against Gaetz.

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 14:39:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Judge Reed O'Connor took issue with both a lack of judicial oversight and certain diversity requirements included in the deal's independent monitoring process.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Texas rejected a proposed plea agreement between the Justice Department and Boeing that would have settled the U.S. government's claims against the company, after crashes of two 737 Max jetliners that killed 346 people, according to a court order issued Thursday.",
      "In his ruling, Judge Reed O'Connor took issue with both a lack of judicial oversight and certain diversity requirements included in the deal's independent monitoring process and ordered the parties to provide the court with a plan for possible ways forward early next month.",
      "The federal government's proposed agreement with airplane manufacturing giant over the deadly crashes included various provisions, including an admission of guilt to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and a $243.6 million fine \u2014 much less than the billions the families of the victims had requested. The deal would also have required Boeing to spend $455 million on safety programs and to work with an independent monitor who would oversee the company's progress.",
      "Investigators alleged in court records that leading up to the crashes, Boeing deceived federal officials who regulated the planes. In 2021, Boeing and the Justice Department entered into a deferred prosecution agreement, which meant the criminal charge would have been dropped if Boeing had complied with the terms of the deal. But earlier this year, federal prosecutors informed the court that Boeing had not followed through on all of the requirements and intended to move forward with the case.",
      "By July, after weeks of negotiations, Boeing and the Justice Department settled on the proposed plea agreement, prompting an outcry from families of those who died in the crashes. At the time, CBS News reported the deal only covered wrongdoing by Boeing tied to the crashes and did not give the company immunity for other incidents, including a door panel that blew off a Max jetliner during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. According to a Justice Department official, the proposed agreement also did not cover any current or former Boeing officials, only the corporation.",
      "Attorneys for some of the victims' families opposed the deal, arguing the \"rotten\" agreement with the government did not justly remedy the families' claims against Boeing. In court filings, they accused Boeing of more criminality and urged stricter penalties, harsher monitoring and recognition of the lives lost.",
      "In rejecting the plea agreement, the judge took aim at diversity, equity and inclusion considerations that the parties said they would take when hiring an independent monitor. He wrote that he was \"concerned with the Government's shifting and contradictory explanations of how the plea agreement's diversity-and-inclusion provision will practically operate in this case.\"",
      "Judge O'Connor had previously raised this issue and in responsive court filings, the Justice Department defended the language, arguing it predated the Boeing agreement. \"This new language reflected not a change in policy but rather a principle that has always governed the process: that selection of a monitor must be based solely on merit, from the broadest possible pool of qualified candidates,\" they said.",
      "O'Connor ruled Thursday that the language was inappropriate: \"In a case of this magnitude, it is in the utmost interest of justice that the public is confident this monitor selection is done based solely on competency. The parties' DEI efforts only serve to undermine this confidence in the Government and Boeing's ethics and anti-fraud efforts.\"",
      "The judge also wrote that the Justice Department's previous efforts to oversee Boeing's conduct \"failed\" and said the independent monitor provision in the proposed deal did not go far enough to include the court in the process.",
      "\"At this point, the public interest requires the Court to step in. Marginalizing the Court in the selection and monitoring of the independent monitor as the plea agreement does undermines public confidence in Boeing's probation, fails to promote respect for the law, and is therefore not in the public interest,\" O'Connor wrote, \"Accordingly, the Court cannot accept the plea agreement.\"",
      "The Justice Department said it's reviewing the decision. Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "In a statement, Paul Cassell, an attorney for some of the victims' families, told CBS News, \"Judge O'Connor has recognized that this was a cozy deal between the Government and Boeing that failed to focus on the overriding concerns \u2013 holding Boeing accountable for its deadly crime and ensuring that nothing like this happens again in the future.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who President-elect Donald Trump tapped to lead the newly coined Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, are meeting with lawmakers Thursday as they seek to build support for the cost-cutting initiative.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson is hosting Musk and Ramaswamy on Capitol Hill to discuss ideas for reform with lawmakers, after Trump announced that the Tesla CEO and entrepreneur would spearhead the effort last month. The president-elect outlined that the two men would \"pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.\"",
      "Johnson said in remarks to reporters ahead of the meeting that during a \"historic moment\" for the country, the two men \"are going to help navigate through this exciting new day,\" calling them \"innovators\" and \"forward thinkers.\"",
      "\"We have long lamented the size and scope of the government, that it has grown too large,\" Johnson said. \"Government is too big, it does too many things and it does almost nothing well. And the taxpayers deserve better.\"",
      "The speaker outlined that Musk and Ramaswamy were first meeting for a \"brainstorming session\" with decision-makers in Congress, including chairs of relevant committees and the leaders of the DOGE caucuses in the House and Senate. He said that the two men were set to meet with lawmakers more broadly later in the day.",
      "\"We need to make government more efficient and that is what this whole objective is,\" Johnson said, adding that it would be a bicameral effort with bipartisan support.",
      "Last month, GOP Reps. Aaron Bean of Florida and Pete Sessions of Texas started the DOGE caucus in the House, while Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa launched its counterpart in the Senate. Ernst touted the effort on Fox News last week, noting that she has a decade-long track record on waste projects that she's bringing to the initiative.",
      "\"We look forward to working with the caucus and making sure that DOGE is successful,\" Ernst said.",
      "In recent days, some Democrats have said they will join or expressed interest in the caucus as well. Rep. Jared Moskowitz, a Florida Democrat, told reporters Wednesday that he's \"not afraid of having the conversation,\" saying that \"staying in a safe space and not having the conversation isn't going to help anybody.\"",
      "\"I think Democrats should embrace government efficiency,\" Moskowitz said, after becoming the first in his party to join the caucus. \"That doesn't mean that we're going to start cutting services, but I think it can be more efficient.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, told reporters on Thursday that she'd be willing to work with Musk if he \"wants to change government contracting to cut billions of dollars of waste out of the Pentagon budget.\"",
      "\"We're here to do work on behalf of the American people,\" Warren said. \"And if that means working with Elon Musk, I'm ready. And if it means fighting Elon Musk, I'm ready for that, too.\"",
      "Still, the DOGE initiative, with a meme-inspired acronym, has prompted operational questions, including what authority it will have to cut spending, which is authorized by Congress, and what spending it would target.",
      "Musk and Ramawsamy outlined that they are aiming to cut $500 billion in annual spending. But around two-thirds of federal spending is mandatory, while large portions of discretionary spending goes to defense. Among the areas the two men said they intended to target for cuts are The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, International organizations that receive grants and entities like Planned Parenthood. Musk and Ramaswamy have also outlined a plan to reduce the number of federal employees.",
      "Ramaswamy came into the Trump orbit after initially running against him in the presidential primary. Meanwhile, Musk, the world's richest person, became a major part of Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, even offering ahead of the election to give $1 million a day to sign his political action committee's petition backing the Constitution. He appeared with Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsyvlania, ahead of the election and has since been a frequent visitor to Mar-a-Lago.",

      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French Prime Minister Michel Barnier on Thursday was meeting Emmanuel Macron to submit his resignation after losing a vote of no confidence in parliament, with the president urgently seeking ways to halt growing political and financial chaos. Poised to be contemporary France's shortest-serving premier, Barnier arrived at the Elysee Palace just after 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. Eastern) for the resignation formality, with the outgoing premier and government constitutionally obliged to step down after the defeat in parliament.",
      "A majority of lawmakers supported the no-confidence vote Wednesday that was proposed by the hard-left and backed by the far-right, headed by Marine Le Pen.",
      "Barnier's record-quick ejection comes after snap parliamentary elections this summer that resulted in a hung parliament, with no political force able to form an overall majority and the far-right holding the key to the government's survival.",
      "The trigger for Barnier's ouster was his 2025 budget plan including austerity measures that were unacceptable to a majority in parliament, but that he argued were necessary to stabilize France's finances. On Monday he had forced through a social security financing bill without a vote.",
      "The successful no-confidence motion cancelled the government's entire financing plan, leading to an automatic renewal of the current budget into next year, unless any new government can somehow rush through approval of a new budget by Christmas \u2014 an unlikely scenario.",
      "\"France probably won't have a 2025 budget,\" said ING Economics in a note, predicting that the country \"is entering a new era of political instability.\"",
      "Moody's, a ratings agency, warned that Barnier's fall \"deepens the country's political stalemate\" and \"reduces the probability of a consolidation of public finances.\"",

      "Macron now has the unenviable task of picking a viable successor. The president was to address the nation Thursday evening, his office said. Macron has more than two years of his presidential term left, but some opponents are calling on him to resign, too.",
      "National Assembly Speaker Yael Braun-Pivet on Thursday urged Macron to waste no time in choosing a new premier, saying France could not be allowed to \"drift\" for any length of time.",
      "There was no indication early Thursday of how quickly Macron would appoint Barnier's successor, nor what their political leanings might be.",
      "Loyalist Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu and Macron's centrist ally Francois Bayrou have been touted as possible contenders, as has former Socialist premier and interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve.",
      "With the support of the far-right, a majority of 331 MPs in the 577-member chamber voted to oust the government on Wednesday night. It was the first successful no-confidence vote since a defeat for Georges Pompidou's government in 1962, when Charles de Gaulle was president.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 11:27:11 -0500",
    "summary": "A growing number of unemployed workers have been searching for a new job for more than 15 weeks, labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "The unemployment rate might be near a historic low, but it's taking longer for hundreds of thousands of out-of-work Americans to find new jobs, signaling cracks within a once-hot labor market as employers continue to cope with the impact of higher borrowing costs.",
      "About 40% of the 7 million people who were out of work in October, or roughly 2.84 million people, have been looking for work for more than 15 weeks, an increase of 20% since a year earlier, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. More than half of those job seekers have been on the hunt for new employment for more than 27 weeks, or about half a year.",
      "A drawn-out job search is increasingly common in the labor market today as companies hold off on hiring, especially in some industries such as tech and professional services, ZipRecruiter chief economist Julia Pollak told CBS MoneyWatch. It's a far cry from the heady years of 2021 and 2022, when Americans switched jobs at high rates in search of better pay and more fulfilling work, a trend termed \"The Great Resignation.\"",
      "The job market has since weakened under the strain of the Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy, with the central bank boosting borrowing rates to their highest point in 23 years to combat inflation, Pollak noted. While inflation has rapidly cooled in the past two years and the Fed began cutting rates in September, the burden of higher borrowing costs has caused consumers to pull back on buying cars and homes, impacting key sectors of the economy, Pollak said.",
      "The job market today reflects \"low hiring, low firing and low job-switching,\" Pollak noted. \"It's this 'big stay'-type of situation \u2014 it's great if you have a job you like, and it's not great if you don't have a job.\"",
      "Employers in October hired 12,000 workers, a jobs report that marked the slowest month for hiring since December 2020. As the anemic number reflects, businesses were weighed down by Hurricanes Milton and Helene as well as labor disputes such as the Boeing machinists strike.",
      "Leading up to the November 5 election, a majority of American held a\u00a0dim view of the strength of the U.S. economy, a factor partly credited with helping President-elect Donald Trump claim victory. While much of voters' anger was focused on inflation, the job market also played a role in their views, with the unemployment rate inching up from a pandemic low of 3.4%, and with some workers saying their pay\u00a0hasn't yet caught up to inflation.",
      "Since the election, though, voters' views of the economy\u00a0have improved, especially among Trump supporters, CBS News polling has found.",
      "November's jobs report",
      "On Friday, the Labor Department will release the November jobs report, with economists forecasting 207,000 new hires last month, according to financial data firm FactSet. The jobless rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%, near 50-year lows.",
      "\"The broader thread in the labor market has been a slow, gradual cooling, and the question is whether after accounting for these quirks if that will still be evident\" in Friday's data, Pollack noted, referring to businesses recovering after the storms and the labor strikes.",
      "Employers cut almost 60,000 jobs last month, an increase of 27% from a year earlier, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The automotive and tech industries had the largest numbers of layoffs last month, the group said.",
      "\"The automotive industry is currently experiencing significant challenges, including potential tariffs affecting U.S. automakers with overseas factories, intensifying competition from Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, and shifts in government subsidies for EVs,\" Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas said in a statement.",
      "The job market and interest rate cuts",
      "The slowing labor market helped sway the Federal Reserve's decision to begin cutting rates in September, which marked the central bank's\u00a0first rate cut in four years. The Fed followed with a second rate cut in November, and a majority of economists are forecasting another reduction at the central bank's December 18 meeting.",
      "According to BNP Parabas analysts, the job market may be in a period of uncertainty partly due to the election.",
      "\"In September, an Atlanta Fed/Duke University survey found that 30% of businesses were paring investment plans due to uncertainty about the then-upcoming election,\" the analysts wrote in a recent research report, noting that they are predicting another rate cut this month.",
      "They added, \"Though we suspect that pre-election uncertainty played a role in restraining hiring of late, this report (due on 6 December) may be too early to reveal a clear unlocking of previously postponed hiring. Uncertainties about tariffs, immigration and fiscal policy remain.\"",
      "Even so, some economists are paring their forecasts for the pace of the Fed's expected rate cuts in 2025, citing President-elect Trump's plans to impose tariffs, cut taxes and deport millions of illegal immigrants, which could, if enacted, reignite inflation.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 09:33:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Pete Hegseth received a six-figure sum amid allegations of financial mismanagement, intoxication and sexual impropriety, all of which he denies.",
    "story": [
      "Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's embattled pick for secretary of defense, received a six-figure severance payment and signed a non-disclosure agreement when he exited the organization Concerned Veterans of America. The payment came amid allegations of financial mismanagement, repeated incidents of intoxication and sexual impropriety, as well as dissension among its leaders over Hegseth's foreign policy views.",
      "The Army veteran turned Fox News host signed a non-disclosure agreement when he stepped down as CEO in January 2016, two sources associated with Concerned Veterans of America told CBS News, with one source saying the agreement included a financial payout. The CVA sources spoke to CBS News under conditions of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss legally-binding contracts, while also fearing professional reprisal.",
      "Public tax filings reviewed by CBS News confirm that Hegseth was paid more than $172,000 between October 2016 and September 2017 \u2013 well after Hegseth's formal departure from his role as CEO of Concerned Veterans of America in January 2016.",
      "Hegseth remained listed on tax filings as a former CEO working 50 hours a week between 2016 and 2017. An archived 2016 biography on Hegseth's website described him as a Fox News contributor and host, and did not list an ongoing role with Concerned Veterans for America.",
      "In a statement to the Military Times at the time of his departure, Hegseth said he was leaving his role in the organization to focus on releasing a book and other advocacy work, while CVA said it wished him well \"in all future endeavors.\"",
      "Hegseth's attorney, Timothy Parlatore, told CBS News on Wednesday evening the payment to his client by Concerned Veterans of America was a \"standard severance package.\"",
      "\"They make EVERYONE who leaves CVA sign an NDA. It was standard for all employees. Not just Pete,\" Parlatore said.",
      "Hegseth on Wednesday pushed back on reports that Trump is considering other candidates for defense secretary. On Capitol Hill as he continued to visit Republican members of Congress, he told CBS News that he does not intend to withdraw his name from consideration. He also said he spoke with Trump Wednesday morning, and the president-elect encouraged him to keep fighting.",
      "Experts consulted by CBS News said severance payments and non-disclosure agreements for outgoing CEOs are common. Such payments are issued for a number of reasons, including to maintain professional relationships, to work as an adviser to an incoming CEO, or to provide a soft landing for departing leaders, they said.",
      "Hegseth has contested the allegation that he was forced out of his CEO position. On Dec. 4 he retweeted a letter obtained by the New York Post on X, saying: \"Read for yourself. You'll see the truth is on our side.\"",
      "The letter, written on Concerned Veterans of American letterhead in January 2016, was authored by Randy Lair, a trustee of the veterans' advocacy group.",
      "\"The truth is Pete resigned his position as CEO of Concerned Veterans of America as a result of a difference of opinion as to the future of the organization and so that he could focus on other endeavors, including, his relationship with Fox News,\" Lair wrote in part.",
      "He added: \"Pete was not terminated by the organization and, in fact, we at CVA worked with him though [sic] this difficult decision and mutually agreed the end of 2015 was the best timing for both parties\u2026The bottom line is that Pete Hegseth voluntarily resigned his position and CVA recognizes and appreciates his accomplishments as CEO.\"",
      "Sources affiliated with Concerned Veterans of America at the time of Hegseth's tenure told CBS News that there was a \"difference of opinion\" over Hegseth steering the organization toward advocacy for foreign policy views that championed military intervention. Senior leaders of the organization strongly opposed Hegseth's foreign policy advocacy over its historical mission of backing conservative fixes to the Department of Veterans Affairs.",
      "However, the sources also highlighted what Lair's letter did not mention, specifically internal assessments of Hegseth's handling of the organization's finances and the alleged incidents of intoxication and sexual misconduct, which Hegseth and Parlatore, his attorney, have denied.",
      "Hegseth's financial record at Concerned Veterans for America",
      "Hegseth led Vets for Economic Freedom Trust, operating as Concerned Veterans for America, from 2012 to 2016. Tax records show that, during three of the five years of his leadership, the organization spent more money than it raised from donations and other means.",
      "Filings for October 2012 to September 2013 show the organization brought in $3.8 million but spent $3.9 million, representing a shortfall of $130,000. Hegseth's CEO compensation is listed as $67,500.",
      "Filings for October 2013 to September 2014 show revenue swelled $15.7 million but the organization spent $16.1 million \u2014 including $8.6 million on advertising and promotion \u2014 resulting in a shortfall of $428,000. Hegseth's salary is listed as $144,894.",
      "Filings for October 2014 to September 2015 show Hegseth's salary grew to $182,549 and the organization ran a surplus for the first time since 2011, with revenue of $14.1 million and expenses of just under $14 million.",
      "However, the organization again spent more than it raised the following year, when Hegseth was listed as the outgoing CEO. Filings for October 2015 to September 2016 show the organization raised just under $16 million but spent $16.4 million, resulting in a shortfall of $437,000.",
      "The filings show expenses at the organization were slashed after Hegseth's departure. From October 2016 to September 2017, compensation, salaries and wages were reduced to $2 million, down from almost $7 million the previous year. Spending on travel was reduced to $416,000, down from almost $2.4 million, and spending on conferences, conventions and meetings amounted to $124,000, down from $2.4 million.",
      "Hegseth has denied allegations of financial mismanagement, repeated incidents of intoxication and sexual impropriety at the organization. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal published Dec. 4, Hegseth said, \"We had hundreds of employees and thousands of volunteers \u2014 yet based on the anonymous accusations of a few disgruntled employees, the legacy media has made it sound as if we ran a college frat house. That's just untrue.\"",
      "Allegations at Vets for Freedom",
      "Prior to joining Concerned Veterans for America, Hegseth led Vets for Freedom (VFF) from 2007 to 2010, where he also faced allegations of financial mismanagement.",
      "In 2008, the organization raised $8.7 million, but spent $9.1 million. Filings show it received a loan of $20,000 to \"provide additional liquidity to the organization.\"",
      "The New Yorker reported that donors were concerned their money was being wasted and arranged for VFF to be merged with another organization, Military Families United, which took over most of its management.",
      "Revenue at VFF dwindled to $268,000 by 2010 and by 2011, the organization's revenue was listed as $22,000. Hegseth joined Concerned Veterans for America the following year.",
      "Margaret Hoover, host of the PBS program \"Firing Line\" and a former adviser to Vets for Freedom, said in an interview on CNN that Hegseth had managed the organization \"very poorly.\" Hoover expressed doubt about his ability to run the sprawling Defense Department when he had struggled with a staff of less than 10 people, and a budget of under $10 million.",
      "\"I don't know how he's going to run an organization with an $857 billion budget, and 3 million individuals, based on what I saw in those years,\" she said.",

      "Officials from some of the largest U.S. airlines faced intense questioning on Capitol Hill Wednesday over so-called junk fees passengers are being charged for baggage, seat selection and other services.",
      "\"Our investigation found that in 2023 alone, American, Delta, United, Frontier and Spirit collected more than $3 billion in seat fees \u2014 only seat fees. That's not airfare, that's just fees for booking a specific seat in advance, or selecting a slightly better seat,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal in a hearing by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on the impact of such charges on consumers.",
      "\"And that's an increase of 50% from 2018, just six years ago,\" added the Connecticut Democrat, who chairs panel.",
      "Overall, five U.S. carriers collected $12.4 billion in seat fees between 2018 and 2023, in addition to baggage and other charges, according to a report released last week by Democrats on the subcommittee.",
      "Speaking on behalf of their respective airlines at the hearing were Steve Johnson, vice chair and chief strategy officer, American Airlines; Peter Carter, chief external affairs officer, Delta Air Lines; Andrew Nocella, EVP and chief commercial officer, United Airlines; Robert Schroeter, SVP, chief commercial officer, Frontier Airlines; and Matthew Klein, EVP and chief commercial officer, Spirit Airlines",
      "\"Terrible experience\"",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley criticized Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines during the two-hour hearing for bonuses paid to gate employees to charge customers extra fees for large carry-ons. The subcommittee says Spirit and Frontier paid employees $26 million in incentives to strictly enforce airline bag policies in 2022 and 2023.",
      "\"You guys do appreciate that flying on your airlines is a disaster, don't you?\" the Missouri Republican said, adding, \"Flying on your airlines is horrible, it's a terrible experience. I mean, I say this as a father of three young children. But I can't tell you \u2014 nobody enjoys flying on your airlines, it's a disaster.\"",
      "Spirit charges between $15 and $77 for a carry-on bag that won't fit under a seat.",
      "Airlines say that their fee policies are transparent and allow passengers to choose various travel experiences at different price points. Frontier said its incentive program aims to ensure \"that all customers are treated equally and fairly,\" CBS News' Kris Van Cleave reported ahead of the Wednesday hearing.",
      "\"We respectfully disagree with numerous statements and conclusions contained in the report,\" Spirit said.",
      "Asked for his response to the subcommittee's findings, United CEO Scott Kirby told Van Cleave, \"At United at least, we're 100% focused on getting customers to choose to fly United. If you don't want to check a bag, you shouldn't have to pay the implied cost of checking a bag. We're creating options for customers and it's working.\"",
      "Airline fees have been a frequent target of criticism by the Biden administration, all the way up to\u00a0President Joe Biden.

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Trump said Atkins, the CEO of Patomak Partners and a former SEC commissioner, was a \"proven leader for common sense regulations.\" In the years since leaving the SEC, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation.",
      "\"He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The commission oversees U.S. securities markets and investments and is currently led by Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government's crackdown on the crypto industry. Gensler, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, announced last month that he would be stepping down from his post on the day that Trump is inaugurated \u2014 Jan. 20, 2025.",
      "Trump, once a crypto skeptic, had pledged to make the U.S. \"the crypto capital of the planet\" and create a \"strategic reserve\" of bitcoin. Money has poured into crypto assets since he won. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, is now above $95,000. And shares in crypto platform Coinbase have surged more than 70% since the election.",
      "Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of Coinbase, congratulated Atkins in a post on X.",
      "\"We appreciate his commitment to balance in regulating U.S. securities markets and look forward to his fresh leadership at (the SEC),\" Grewal wrote. \"It's sorely needed and cannot come a day too soon.\"",
      "Congressman Brad Sherman, a California Democrat and a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, said he worries Atkins would not sufficiently regulate cryptocurrencies as SEC chair.",
      "\"He'd probably take the position that no cryptocurrency is a security, and hence no exchange that deals with crypto is a securities exchange,\" Sherman said. \"The opportunity to defraud investors would be there in a very significant way.\"",
      "Atkins began his career as a lawyer and has a long history working in the financial markets sector, both in government and private practice. In the 1990s, he worked on the staffs of two former SEC chairmen, Richard C. Breeden and Arthur Levitt.",
      "His work as an SEC commissioner started in 2002, a time when the fallout from corporate scandals at Enron and WorldCom had turned up the heat on Wall Street and its government regulators.",
      "Atkins was widely considered the most conservative member of the SEC during his tenure at the agency and was known to have a strong free-market bent. As a commissioner, he called for greater transparency in and analysis of the costs and benefits of new SEC rules.",
      "He also emphasized investor education and increased enforcement efforts against those who steal from investors over the internet, manipulate markets, engage in Ponzi schemes and other types of fraud.",
      "At the same time, Atkins objected to stiff penalties imposed on companies accused of fraudulent conduct, contending that they did not deter crime. He caused a stir in the summer of 2006 when he said the practice of granting stock options to executives before the disclosure of news that was certain to increase the share price did not constitute insider trading.",
      "U.S. Rep. Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said Atkins has the experience needed to \"restore faith in the SEC.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Pentagon, Pete Hegseth, is showing defiance amid misconduct allegations as support for his confirmation appeared to be in doubt. There are now several candidates under consideration to replace him as Trump's intended nominee, sources familiar with the transition tell CBS News, among them, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst.",
      "But the embattled former Fox News host on Wednesday pushed back on reports that Trump is considering other candidates for defense secretary. On Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning, as he continued to visit Republican members of Congress, Hegseth told CBS News that he does not intend to withdraw his name from consideration. He also said he spoke with Trump Wednesday morning, and the president-elect encouraged him to keep fighting.",
      "\"I spoke to the president-elect this morning. He said, 'Keep going, keep fighting. I'm behind you all the way,'\" Hegseth said. \"Why would I back down? I've always been a fighter. I'm here for the fighters. This is personal and passionate for me.\"",
      "In an interview with SiriusXM's \"The Megyn Kelly Show\" Wednesday, Hegseth said he had spoken with Trump earlier in the day and that the incoming president had told him, \"I've got your back.\" On reports of the possibility that DeSantis could replace him as defense chief nominee, he told Kelly, \"It's all the president's choice. I spoke to the president this morning. He said, I'm his guy.\"",
      "Despite the acrimony between DeSantis and Trump during the primary campaign, the Florida governor is interested in the job, according to two sources familiar with DeSantis' thinking. His second and final term as governor ends in January 2027. Trump has already announced a series of Cabinet nominees who hail from Florida, including Sen. Marco Rubio, for secretary of state. Although serving as defense secretary would pose some political risk, DeSantis believes it would position him well for a presidential run in 2028, the source said.",
      "Hegseth, a former \"Fox & Friends\" weekend co-host and Army veteran, has been meeting with Senate Republicans in recent weeks to build support for his confirmation. But reports in recent days that detailed alleged sexual misconduct, financial mismanagement at veterans' charities, repeated intoxication and infidelity appeared to be softening his support. Some Senate Republicans have called the allegations \"disturbing\" and said they came as a surprise.",
      "Still, Hegseth on Wednesday told reporters at the Capitol his meetings with Senate Republicans have been \"a wonderful process.\" In his interview with Kelly, Hegseth said, \"No one has looked me in the eye and said, 'I have concerns and I can't vote for you.' In fact, most have said, 'Let's take a picture, and I'm behind you all the way.'\"",
      "Hegseth also defended himself in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal Wednesday. Amid reports about his removal as the head of a veterans' charity over allegations of financial mismanagement, intoxication, sexual misconduct and fostering a toxic work climate, Hegseth wrote of his work for that organization, Concerned Veterans for America.",
      "\"We fought entrenched interests and mobilized veterans and patriotic Americans across the country,\" he said, denying reports of any misconduct and accusing the media of publishing falsehoods.",
      "\"We had hundreds of employees and thousands of volunteers\u2014yet based on the anonymous accusations of a few disgruntled employees, the legacy media has made it sound as if we ran a college frat house,\" he wrote. \"That's just untrue.\"",
      "Hegseth also said that he left CVA over \"an internal difference of opinion about its future. I wanted to engage in foreign policy; our donors didn't.\" And he added that the group's leadership \"wrote me a glowing letter when I left.\"",
      "In his interview with Kelly, Hegseth addressed the sexual assault allegation that emerged in late November. He responded \"absolutely not\" when asked if he had raped a woman in a Monterey, California, hotel in 2017. He admitted that it would have once been a fair characterization to call him a \"serial cheater\" but says he has changed. \"I may have been drinking, but I was cognizant enough to remember every single detail. And I'm not here to say that my conduct was good,\" he said. \"Being in a hotel room with someone that's not the person you're with is not OK. I own up to that, and I've had to own up to that, and that's been difficult.\"",
      "He said he paid his accuser \"because I had to \u2014 or at least I thought I did at the time.\" He explained that he was newly married, was under consideration for a role in the first Trump administration and wanted to protect his family and his Fox News job.",
      "He also responded to reporting by NBC News that cited current and former Fox News employees who said that \"on more than a dozen occasions\" while Hegseth was a \"Fox & Friends Weekend\" co-host, \"they smelled alcohol on him before he went to air,\" and appeared on TV \"after they'd heard him talk about being hungover as he was getting ready or on set.\" The report said \"[t]hree current employees said his drinking remained a concern up until Trump announced him as his choice to run the Pentagon, at which point Hegseth left Fox.\"",
      "But in the op-ed, Hegseth did not directly address allegations about his alcohol consumption. \"I've been at Fox News\u2014where I saw my work as a continuation of my mission to fight for America. Again, the legacy press has used anonymous sources to try to discredit even that,\" and he referred readers to his X feed for statements of support from professional colleagues. He did tell Kelly, \"I've never had a drinking problem.\"",
      "North Dakota GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer is scheduled to meet with Hegseth Wednesday afternoon and told reporters earlier in the day, \"The allegations are very, very serious. They can't be trivialized. And I just want to know that, that he's redeemed, and going forward, he's going to be better.\"",
      "Cramer also added, \"I think the mood of the conference is one of the pretty serious, really, really serious about it, and serious about how these things affect his ability to do the job, the ability of the troops to look up to him.\"",
      "He suggested the Republican conference was watching for signals from the Trump transition team about Hegseth.",
      "\"There's the mood of the conference, and then there's the mood of the Trump transition team itself,\" he said. \"So we'll see what kind of messages and signals we hear throughout the course of the day. As you can tell, these things have been breaking pretty fast and furious.\"",
      "Cramer said of Ernst that she would be \"easy to confirm, and I think she'd be great,\" and in fact, \"if she wanted it, she'd be my first pick.\"",
      "\"I have never backed down from a fight and won't back down from this one,\" Hegseth wrote, adding, \"I look forward to an honest confirmation hearing with our distinguished senators\u2014not a show trial in the press.\"",
      "Hegseth has continued to meet with the Republican senators who will weigh in on his nomination. But one prominent Republican, Sen. Josh Hawley, told reporters Wednesday afternoon that Hegseth canceled their upcoming meeting.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 20:07:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court weighed whether Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria violates the Constitution.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared sympathetic to Tennessee's efforts to restrict access to gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, as the justices stepped into the politically charged debate over health care for transgender youth.",
      "Twenty-four states have passed laws similar to Tennessee's, which prohibits puberty blockers or hormone therapy for those under the age of 18. The dispute brought by the Biden administration, three families and a doctor tests whether states cross a constitutional line when regulating medical care that transgender adolescents argue is crucial to their well-being.",
      "The court's conservative justices appeared likely to side with Tennessee in the case. Several cited \"evolving\" medical research as to the benefits and risks of gender-affirming care for adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria. At numerous points during arguments, which ran more than two hours, several members of the conservative wing questioned whether determinations about policies with shifting scientific findings are for courts to decide, rather than best left to state lawmakers elected by the people.",
      "\"If the Constitution doesn't take sides, if there's strong, forceful, scientific policy arguments on both sides in a situation like this, why isn't it best to leave it to the democratic process?\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts noted recent studies by some health authorities in European countries that have warned of insufficient evidence on the efficacy of treatments for transgender youth. Following an independent review from the United Kingdom, England's National Health Service stopped prescribing puberty blockers and hormones to minors with gender dysphoria.",
      "\"We're not the best situated to address issues like that,\" Roberts said. \"Doesn't that make a stronger case for us to leave those determinations to the legislative bodies rather than try to determine them for ourselves?\"",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch, who authored a 2020 decision that extended protections from discrimination in the workplace to transgender and gay employees, did not ask any questions.",
      "U.S. v. Skrmetti",
      "The case before the Supreme Court, U.S. v. Skrmetti, involves a Tennessee law known as SB1 that was\u00a0adopted in 2023. It bars health care providers from administering puberty blockers or hormone therapy if they're meant to enable \"a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex.\" The state argued that it has a \"compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty,\" and in prohibiting treatments that \"might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\"",
      "Tennessee's law is part of a wave of measures passed by GOP-led states in recent years prohibiting gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria. President-elect Donald Trump has also pledged to restrict medical treatments for transgender adolescents and prohibit transgender athletes from competing in women's sports, another area where states have enacted bans.",
      "During oral arguments, several of the court's conservative justices sounded skeptical of the federal government's assertion that Tennessee's ban should be struck down as unconstitutional because it discriminates based on sex. They also raised concerns about the evidence surrounding the efficacy of the treatments and questioned whether courts should second-guess state lawmakers on the issue.",
      "\"If it's evolving like that and changing, and England's pulling back and Sweden's pulling back, it strikes me as a pretty heavy yellow light, if not red light, for this court to come, the nine of us, and constitutionalize the whole area when the rest of the world, or at least the countries that have been at the forefront of this, are pumping the brakes on this kind of treatment,\" Kavanaugh said.",
      "Roberts echoed that sentiment, saying the justices \"might think that we can do just as good a job with respect to the evidence here as Tennessee or anybody else, but my understanding is that the Constitution leaves that question to the people's representatives rather than to nine people, none of whom is a doctor.\"",
      "Justice Samuel Alito sparred with Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who argued on behalf of the Biden administration, over medical research on puberty blockers and hormone therapy, peppering her with questions about the findings of studies into the benefits and risks of gender-affirming care for minors.",
      "Kavanaugh, later joined by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, questioned the implications of a decision that would adopt the Biden administration's preferred standard of review that judges should apply when weighing the constitutionality of Tennessee's law and others like it.",
      "\"What would that mean for women's and girl's sports in particular?\" he asked Prelogar. \"Would transgender athletes have a constitutional right, as you see it, to play in women and girl's sports \u2014 basketball, swimming, volleyball, track, etc. \u2014 notwithstanding the competitive, fairness and safety issues that have been vocally raised by some female athletes?\"",
      "The Biden administration has argued that the lower court applied the wrong standard when evaluating the constitutionality of Tennessee's law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit held that the ban is subject to rational-basis review, the most deferential of the three tiers of scrutiny. But Prelogar has argued the law should be subject to a more stringent level of judicial review, known as heightened scrutiny, because it classifies based on sex and discriminates based on transgender status.",
      "If the Supreme Court agrees with the Biden administration, it could send the case back to the lower court to apply that more demanding standard, as Prelogar is asking it to do.",
      "The court's liberals highlighted the potentially dire consequences of gender dysphoria and the role of gender-affirming care in addressing them, and likened Tennessee's ban to state laws that discriminated on the basis of race in the past. They grilled the attorney appearing on behalf of the state, Tennessee Solicitor General J. Matthew Rice, with questions aimed at showing the state's law constitutes sex-based discrimination.",
      "\"The whole thing is imbued with sex. It's based on sex,\" Justice Elena Kagan told Rice. \"You might have reasons for thinking that it's an appropriate regulation and those reasons should be tested and respect given to them. But it's a dodge to say, this is not based on sex, it's based on medical purpose.\"",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued the \"evidence is very clear that there are some children who actually need this treatment.\"",
      "Rice argued that the state is trying to protect young people from \"irreversible and life-altering consequences\" of these medical interventions and said the treatments are \"risky\" and \"unproven.\" The law, he told the Supreme Court, sets age- and use-based limits on medical care, and is a routine exercise of the state's authority to regulate medicine.",
      "\"Politically accountable lawmakers, not judges, are in the best position to assess this evolving medical issue,\" he said.",
      "But the Biden administration, along with the three Tennessee families and Memphis doctor, assert the state's ban draws sex-based lines and discriminates based on transgender status, a violation of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection.",
      "Under Tennessee's law, an adolescent assigned female at birth cannot receive puberty blockers or testosterone to live and present as a male, but an adolescent assigned male at birth can, Prelogar said. And an adolescent assigned male at birth cannot receive puberty blockers or estrogen to live and present as a female, but an adolescent assigned female at birth can, she told the court.",
      "Prelogar argued Tennessee's law \"categorically bans treatment when and only when it's inconsistent with the patient's birth sex.\"",
      "Shortly before Tennessee's law took effect, the families with transgender children and Dr. Susan Lacy, who provided gender-affirming care to patients diagnosed with gender dysphoria, challenged the ban in federal court, arguing it is unconstitutional. The Biden administration then intervened.",
      "A federal district court blocked the law, finding that it discriminates based on sex and transgender status and is likely unconstitutional. The judge ruled that the \"benefits of the medical procedures banned by SB1 are well-established,\" and said the law bars treatments for \"a tiny fraction of minors, while leaving them available to all other minors (who would be subjected to the very risks that the state asserts SB1 is intended to eradicate).\"",
      "A divided panel of judges on the 6th Circuit then reversed that decision and allowed Tennessee's ban to take effect while legal proceedings continued. The measure, the court found, regulates gender-affirming care for all minors, regardless of sex.",
      "\"Life-tenured federal judges should be wary of removing a vexing and novel topic of medical debate from the ebbs and flows of democracy by construing a largely unamendable Constitution to occupy the field,\" Chief Judge Jeffrey Sutton wrote.",
      "Both the Biden administration and the families, represented by the ACLU, separately asked the Supreme Court to review the 6th Circuit's decision. The high court in June agreed to do so, but took up only the Biden administration's appeal, which asked the justices to decide whether Tennessee's law violated the Equal Protection Clause. The parents had argued the law infringed on their due process right to make decisions about their children's medical care, but the justices are not considering that question.",
      "Barrett noted that regardless of how the Supreme Court rules, the parents could still pursue their parental-rights claim.",
      "Prelogar argued on behalf of the U.S. on Wednesday, and she shared time with Chase Strangio of the ACLU, who made history as the first openly transgender person to argue before the Supreme Court. Rice presented the state's case to the justices.",
      "The case is the most significant involving transgender rights that the Supreme Court, now with a 6-3 conservative majority, has heard in years. In 2020, the high court divided 6-3 in finding that Title VII's protections from discrimination in the workplace extend to gay and transgender employees. Gorsuch authored the majority opinion, which Chief Justice John Roberts and the four liberal members joined.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court in this case is expected by the end of June.",

    "story": [
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, a veteran private astronaut with strong ties to Elon Musk and his rocket company SpaceX, has been picked to serve as NASA's next administrator, President-elect Donald Trump  announced Wednesday.",
      "If confirmed, Isaacman, 41, would be the fifth NASA administrator with spaceflight experience, replacing former Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, who flew into orbit aboard the space shuttle Columbia in early 1986.",
      "\"I am delighted to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,\" Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social. \"... Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.\"",
      "Isaacman founded the payment processing company later named Shift4 Payments while he was a high school student. He chartered the first purely commercial, all-civilian American \"space tourist\" mission \u2014 Inspiration4 \u2014 in February 2021, paying SpaceX an undisclosed amount to launch him and three other civilian flyers on a two-day, 23-hour flight.",
      "He flew to space again this past September, commanding the first of three planned SpaceX Polaris missions, logging nearly five days in space on a flight that took the crew farther from Earth than any astronauts have gone since the Apollo moon program. Isaacman also became the first private citizen to carry out a spacewalk.",
      "He is scheduled to lead another Polaris mission aboard a SpaceX capsule before leading the first crew to space aboard the California rocket builder's gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "Dates have not been announced for either of those missions, and it's not yet clear what impact Isaacman's selection to lead NASA will have on those flights, whether Isaacman still intends to fly aboard one or both or what sort of influence his friendship with Musk might have on NASA's future direction.",
      "But Isaacman, a skilled pilot who flies his own MiG-29 fighter jet, made it clear in a post following Trump's announcement that NASA can expect him to be a vocal space advocate who will help \"usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilization.\"",
      "\"With the support of President Trump, I can promise you this: We will never again lose our ability to journey to the stars and never settle for second place,\" Isaacman said. \"We will inspire children, yours and mine, to look up and dream of what is possible. Americans will walk on the moon and Mars and in doing so, we will make life better here on Earth.\"",
      "He said it would be the \"honor of a lifetime to serve in this role and to work alongside NASA's extraordinary team to realize our shared dreams of exploration and discovery.\"",
      "Jim Bridenstine, Nelson's predecessor at the helm of NASA, helped kickstart the agency's Artemis moon program during the first Trump administration.",
      "He said in a statement Wednesday that \"Jared's vision for pushing boundaries, paired with his proven track record of success in private industry, positions him as an ideal candidate to lead NASA into a bold new era of exploration and discovery. I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm him.\"",
      "The Isaacman announcement comes as NASA struggles to keep the Artemis program on track amid tight budgets and what the agency's own inspector general calls the \"unsustainable\" costs of NASA's Space Launch System, or SLS, moon rocket.",
      "SpaceX supporters argue the company's more powerful, fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship rocket is the obvious choice for deep space exploration, but the huge rocket is far from operational with just a half-dozen suborbital test flights to its credit.",
      "The SLS, on the other hand, is considered operational in that it completed an initial test flight in November 2022, sending an unpiloted Orion capsule around the moon and back. But unlike the Super Heavy-Starship, the SLS is a throwaway, expendable booster expected to cost some $1.4 billion for each of its first four moon missions.",
      "NASA is currently gearing up to launch three NASA astronauts and a Canadian flyer on an SLS-Orion mission \u2014 Artemis 2 \u2014 late next year. But problems with the first Orion's heat shield and other issues threaten to push the Artemis 2 flight into 2026, years past initial expectations.",
      "It's not yet clear when the Artemis 3 mission, the first to carry astronauts to a landing near the moon's south pole, might be feasible.",
      "But that flight will feature a lunar lander built by SpaceX, a variant of the company's Starship upper stage. SpaceX has carried out six test flights of the fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship to date, but has not yet put the Starship upper stage into orbit or brought it down for an intact landing.",
      "Given the company's rapid-fire test schedule, most observers believe SpaceX will get the Super Heavy-Starship working as planned in the near future, but scores of test flights will be required to demonstrate the safety and reliability required by NASA to put astronauts aboard.",
      "And the moon mission poses unique challenges.",
      "For the initial landing mission, multiple Super Heavy \"tanker\" flights will be required to refuel the moon lander in low-Earth orbit before it can be sent to the moon. Once in lunar orbit, it will await the arrival of the Artemis 3 crew, launched aboard an Orion capsule by an SLS rocket.",
      "After boarding the Starship lander, two astronauts would descend to the surface, carry out the mission's planned exploration, and then head back up to the orbiting Orion for the trip back to Earth.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he has named longtime aide Peter Navarro, who served on the White House Trade Council in the first Trump administration, to be \"senior counselor for trade and manufacturing.\"",
      "The announcement comes just months after Navarro, 75, was released from prison after serving a four-month sentence for defying a congressional subpoena. Navarro was subpoenaed for records and testimony in 2022 by the now-defunct House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, and he refused to comply, claiming that Trump had asserted executive privilege over the material sought by the committee.",
      "A federal judge in Washington convicted Navarro of two counts of contempt, and he reported to a Florida federal correctional facility in March to serve a four-month sentence. He spoke at the Republican National Convention in July the same day he was released from prison, slamming the \"Department of Injustice\" in his speech.",
      "Trump praised Navarro in the announcement Wednesday as a \"man who was treated horribly by the Deep State, or whatever else.\"",
      "As a trade adviser in the first Trump administration, Navarro endorsed \"America First\" trade policies, including steep tariffs to protect domestic industries.",
      "In the social media post announcing Navarro's selection, Trump praised Navarro's time as a trade adviser. \"The Senior Counselor position leverages Peter's broad range of White House experience, while harnessing his extensive Policy analytic and Media skills,\" Trump wrote. \"His mission will be to help successfully advance and communicate the Trump Manufacturing, Tariff, and Trade Agendas.\"",
      "Trump announced in 2016 that Navarro would be serving at the helm of the newly formed White House Trade Council and as director of trade and industrial policy. Prior to that, he had written a book called \"Death by China\" that endorsed a hardline toward trade with China.",
      "In March 2020, Trump named Navarro as policy coordinator of the Defense Production Act, which Trump invoked on March 18, 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, to manufacture medical supplies and PPE. On \"60 Minutes\" in April 2020, Navarro fiercely defended protectionist trade policies despite the shortage of that equipment before the pandemic.",
      "\"It's the globalization of production through multinational corporations, who salute no flag, who love cheap sweatshop labor, and who love the massive subsidies that the Chinese government throws at production to bring it from here to there,\" Navarro told \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker.",
      "Congressional subpoena and prison time",
      "The House Jan. 6 committee subpoenaed records and testimony from Navarro, alleging that he developed plans to overturn the outcome of the 2020 election. \"Mr. Navarro appears to have information directly relevant to the Select Committee's investigation into the causes of the January 6th attack on the Capitol,\" said the committee's chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson, at the time.",
      "In 2021, Navarro wrote a book in which he wrote that he and other Trump advisers constructed a plan called the \"Green Bay Sweep\" as the \"last, best chance to snatch a stolen election from the Democrats' jaws of deceit.\" Additionally, in the weeks leading up to the Jan. 6 attack, Navarro promoted a document he called the \"Navarro Report\" that asserted baseless and discredited claims of election fraud.",
      "Navarro refused to comply with the subpoena, saying that Trump had invoked executive privilege. The committee recommended in a unanimous vote to recommend contempt charges, with the Justice Department ultimately agreeing, charging him with two counts of contempt.",
      "Navarro testified at an evidentiary hearing that Trump invoked executive privilege in a Feb. 2022 conversation, 11 days after he was subpoenaed. But U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta barred that defense, saying there was no evidence that any official assertion was made, and Navarro did not testify at his one-day trial.",
      "In his sentencing, Mehta noted Navarro's public statements after the attack and said there was no evidence of executive privilege. While Mehta said that it appeared that Navarro at least believed he was operating under the guise of executive privilege, he said executive privilege is not a \"magical dust\" or \"a get-out-of-jail free card.\"",
      "Navarro attempted to appeal his conviction, even requesting after he surrendered to prison his case be heard by the Supreme Court, which declined. He reported to prison in March and served four months at the Federal Correctional Institute in Miami, which is reserved for older inmates.",

      "\"I have learned that politics alone cannot measure up to the challenges we face,\" Romney said. \"A country's character is a reflection not just of its elected officials, but also of its people. I leave Washington to return to be one among them.\"",
      "Romney announced in September 2023 that he would not seek reelection after his first term in the upper chamber, noting at the time that \"it's time for a new generation of leaders.\" The 77-year-old Utah Republican was the GOP nominee for president in 2012 and also served as the governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007.",
      "In his farewell speech Wednesday, Romney said that \"Americans have always been fundamentally good.\" He argued that while there have been mistakes, \"some grievous,\" the nation has from its earliest days rushed to help neighbors in need, welcomed the poor and the huddled masses and respected different faiths.",
      "Romney said as his time in office comes to an end, he hopes to be \"a voice of unity and virtue,\" saying that \"it is only if the American people merit his benevolence, that God will continue to bless America.\"",
      "The Utah Republican, known as a moderate in the upper chamber who has been openly critical of President-elect Donald Trump, became the first senator in U.S. history to vote to convict a member of his own party in 2020 during Trump's first impeachment trial. And he also voted to convict Trump of inciting an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. At the time he announced his retirement, Romney told reporters that the possibility of Trump returning to the White House did not weigh into his decision.",

      "\"Of course, a certain telegenic quality, dare I say, a presidential aura, doesn't hurt either,\" McConnell continued.",
      "McConnell said Romney made himself a \"linchpin\" for bipartisan negotiations, and \"managed to cram more into six years than many colleagues fit in in 12 or 18.\"",
      "Romney, too, celebrated his work on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Electoral Count Reform Act, gun safety legislation and religious protections in marriage legislation, saying that he \"will leave this chamber with a sense of achievement.\" But he acknowledged that he will \"also leave with a recognition that I did not achieve everything I had hoped.\"",
      "Romney said \"the scourge of partisan politics\" has prevented efforts to stabilize the nation's debt, stressing that without the \"burden\" of the interest on the debt, the nation could spend three times as much military procurement, or twice as much on Social Security benefits every month.",
      "McConnell noted that observers might have wondered after Romney's governorship and bid for the presidency what more he had to prove as he came to the Senate.",

      "The mother of Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's embattled pick for defense secretary, defended her son Wednesday morning in an appearance on Fox News, following reporting on an email she sent to her son years earlier accusing him of being an \"abuser of women.\"",
      "Penelope Hegseth, appearing on \"Fox & Friends\" Wednesday morning, said her son and his wife at the time were going through a \"very difficult divorce\" when she wrote the email in 2018,\u00a0 noting that she wrote it \"in haste\" and with \"deep emotions.\"",
      "\"I wrote that out of love,\" she said. \"And about two hours later, I retracted it with an apology email, but nobody's seen that.\"",
      "Hegseth's mother said in the email, published by The New York Times, that she was writing on \"behalf of all the women (and I know it's many) you have abused in some way,\" telling her son to \"get some help and take an honest look at yourself.\"",
      "But Hegseth's mother said she was appearing Wednesday on Fox to \"tell the truth\" to the American people, and to Republican senators on the hill \u2014 \"especially our female senators.\"",
      "Hegseth, a former \"Fox & Friends\" weekend co-host, has been meeting with Republican senators on Capitol Hill this week and before the Thanksgiving recess, looking to secure support as the chamber prepares to work on the confirmation of Trump intended Cabinet and administration nominees early next year.

Hegseth has denied the allegations.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 10:27:28 -0500",
    "summary": "About 3.7 million people are at immediate risk of losing health coverage should the federal government cut funding for Medicaid expansions, as some allies of President-elect Donald Trump have proposed.",
    "story": [
      "With Donald Trump's return to the White House and Republicans taking full control of Congress in 2025, the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion is back on the chopping block.",
      "More than 3 million adults in nine states would be at immediate risk of losing their health coverage should the GOP reduce the extra federal Medicaid funding that's enabled states to widen eligibility, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, and the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families. That's because the states have trigger laws that would swiftly end their Medicaid expansions if federal funding falls.",
      "The states are Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia.",
      "The 2010 Affordable Care Act encouraged states to expand Medicaid programs to cover more low-income Americans who didn't get health insurance through their jobs. Forty states and the District of Columbia agreed, extending health insurance since 2014 to an estimated 21 million people and helping drive the U.S. uninsured rate to record lows.",
      "In exchange, the federal government pays 90% of the cost to cover the expanded population. That's far higher than the federal match for other Medicaid beneficiaries, which averages about 57% nationwide.",
      "Conservative policy groups, which generally have opposed the ACA, say the program costs too much and covers too many people. Democrats say the Medicaid expansion has saved lives and helped communities by widening coverage to people who could not afford private insurance.",
      "If Congress cuts federal funding, Medicaid expansion would be at risk in all states that have opted into it \u2014 even those without trigger laws \u2014 because state legislatures would be forced to make up the difference, said Renuka Tipirneni, an associate professor at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health.",
      "Decisions to keep or roll back the expansion \"would depend on the politics at the state level,\" Tipirneni said.",
      "For instance, Michigan approved a trigger as part of its Medicaid expansion in 2013, when it was controlled by a Republican governor and legislature. Last year, with the government controlled by Democrats, the state eliminated its funding trigger.",
      "Six of the nine states with trigger laws \u2014 Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Montana, North Carolina and Utah \u2014 went for Trump in the 2024 election.",
      "Most of the nine states' triggers kick in if federal funding falls below the 90% threshold. Arizona's trigger would eliminate its expansion if funding falls below 80%.",
      "Montana's law rolls back expansion below 90% funding but allows it to continue if lawmakers identify additional funding. Under state law, Montana lawmakers must reauthorize its Medicaid expansion in 2025 or the expansion will end.",
      "Across the states with triggers, between 3.1 million and 3.7 million people would swiftly lose their coverage, researchers at KFF and the Georgetown center estimate. The difference depends on how states treat people who were added to Medicaid before the ACA expansion; they may continue to qualify even if the expansion ends.",
      "Three other states \u2014 Iowa, Idaho and New Mexico\u2014 have laws that require their governments to mitigate the financial impact of losing federal Medicaid expansion funding but would not automatically end expansions. With those three states included, about 4.3 million Medicaid expansion enrollees would be at risk of losing coverage, according to KFF.",
      "The ACA allowed Medicaid expansions to adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or about $20,783 for an individual in 2024.",
      "Nearly a quarter of the 81 million people enrolled in Medicaid nationally are in the program due to expansions.",
      "\"With a reduction in the expansion match rate, it is likely that all states would need to evaluate whether to continue expansion coverage because it would require a significant increase in state spending,\" said Robin Rudowitz, vice president and director of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF. \"If states drop coverage, it is likely that there would be an increase in the number of uninsured, and that would limit access to care across red and blue states that have adopted expansion.\"",
      "States rarely cut eligibility for social programs such as Medicaid once it's been granted.",
      "The triggers make it politically easier for state lawmakers to end Medicaid expansion because they would not have to take any new action to cut coverage, said Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families.",
      "To see the impact of trigger laws, consider what happened after the Supreme Court in 2022 struck down Roe v. Wade and, with it, the constitutional right to an abortion. Conservative lawmakers in 13 states had crafted trigger laws that would automatically implement bans in the event a national right to abortion were struck down. Those state laws resulted in restrictions taking effect immediately after the court ruling, or shortly thereafter.",
      "States adopted triggers as part of Medicaid expansion to win over lawmakers skeptical of putting state dollars on the hook for a federal program unpopular with most Republicans.",
      "It's unclear what Trump and congressional Republicans will do with Medicaid after he takes office in January, but one indicator could be a recent recommendation from the Paragon Health Institute, a leading conservative policy organization led by former Trump health adviser Brian Blase.",
      "Paragon has proposed that starting in 2026 the federal government would phase down the 90% federal match for expansion until 2034, when it would reach parity with each state's federal match for its traditional enrollees. Under that plan, states could still get ACA Medicaid expansion funding but restrict coverage to enrollees with incomes up to the federal poverty level. Currently, to receive expansion funding, states must offer coverage to everyone up to 138% of the poverty level.",
      "Daniel Derksen, director of the Center for Rural Health at the University of Arizona, said it's unlikely Arizona would move to eliminate its trigger and make up for lost federal funds. \"It would be a tough sell right now as it would put a big strain on the budget,\" he said.",
      "Medicaid has been in the crosshairs of Republicans in Washington before. Republican congressional leaders in 2017 proposed legislation to cut federal expansion funding, a move that would have shifted billions in costs to states. That plan, part of a strategy to repeal Obamacare, ultimately failed.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 21:07:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Heat shield damage seen during the first Artemis test flight is now understood, NASA says, but more time is needed to implement fixes.",
    "story": [
      "Less than a year after announcing major delays for the next two Artemis moon missions, NASA managers said Thursday the projected flight dates are slipping once again, with the first piloted voyage around the moon now expected in the April 2026 timeframe, and the first lunar landing in mid 2027.",
      "NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said the delays are needed to revise the Orion crew capsule's re-entry trajectory to reduce stress and prevent the sort of unexpected heat shield damage seen after an unpiloted 2022 test flight \u2014 and to complete extensive testing of the capsule's environmental control and life support systems.",
      "\"Based on the data, we have decided, unanimously, to move forward with the current Artemis 2/Orion capsule and heat shield with a modified entry trajectory...to lessen the heat coming back into the Earth's atmosphere,\" Nelson said.",
      "\"Additionally, we need to complete our updates to the Orion environmental controls and the life support systems that were identified earlier this year.\"",
      "Future heat shields for the Artemis 3 moon landing mission and subsequent flights will use essentially the same materials but with modifications to improve their performance during re-entry.",
      "In the meantime, Nelson said, \"We are planning for Artemis 2 to launch in April of '26 and we're going to do all in our power, with our commercial partners, to launch earlier.\"",
      "The Artemis program aims to send astronauts to the moon's south polar region where ice deposits may allow crews to one day extract oxygen and hydrogen to produce air, water and rocket propellants that would not have to be carried up, at great expense, from Earth.",
      "Following the launch of Artemis 2, Nelson said NASA is going \"to make (any) adjustments that are necessary, and we plan to launch Artemis 3, the first landing on the moon in over a half century. Assuming the SpaceX lander is ready, we plan to launch Artemis 3 in mid-2027. That will be well ahead of the Chinese government's announced intention (of sending taikonauts to the moon in) 2030...We need to get this Artemis 2 test flight right to ensure the success of our return to the moon.\"",
      "NASA launched the Artemis program's first test flight, Artemis 1, in November 2022, using the agency's new Space Launch System, or SLS, rocket to send an unpiloted Lockheed Martin-built Orion capsule on a looping flight around the moon and back.",
      "NASA had planned to launch the Artemis 2 mission at the end of this year to carry a three-man one-woman crew around the moon to thoroughly test the spacecraft's life support, propulsion and other systems.",
      "But after the Artemis 1 flight, engineers discovered the Orion capsule's 16-foot-wide heat shield suffered unexpected damage during it's high-speed return from the moon using a technique called a \"skip entry.\"",
      "In a skip entry, the capsule dips into the atmosphere, slows and rises back up before dropping back into the atmosphere for the final descent. The idea is similar to how a flat rock can skip across a still pond. Skip entries provide a number of benefits, including a wider range of splashdown targets.",
      "The Orion heat shield is designed to ablate, or char, during re-entry when the spacecraft enters Earth's atmosphere at more than 25,000 mph. But the charred material is intended to stay in place, providing a layer of insulation. During the Artemis 1 re-entry, more charred material separated from the heat shield than computer models predicted.",
      "While the unexpected \"liberation\" had no impact on the spacecraft \u2014 NASA said astronauts would not have even noticed had any been on board \u2014 engineers wanted to make sure they understood the underlying cause so they could update computer models to accurately predict re-entry effects across multiple trajectories.",
      "After hundreds of tests and an exhaustive engineering analysis, NASA has \"since determined that while the capsule was dipping in and out of the atmosphere as part of that planned skip entry, heat accumulated inside the heat shield's outer layer,\" said Pam Melroy, a former shuttle commander and now deputy administrator of NASA.",
      "That heat build up led to \"gases forming and becoming trapped inside the heat shield,\" she said. \"This caused internal pressure to build up and led to cracking and uneven shedding of that outer layer.\"",
      "While the same type of heat shield will be used for the Artemis 2 mission in April 2026, the crew will use a modified re-entry trajectory to reduce the sort of heating that damaged the Artemis 1 heat shield.",
      "As for the Artemis 3 lunar landing flight, the new mid-2027 target launch date assumes SpaceX's lunar lander, a variant of the upper stage used by the company's new Super Heavy-Starship rocket, completes multiple test flights in Earth orbit, along with at least one unpiloted lunar landing.",
      "On Wednesday, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he was selecting billionaire Jared Isaacman, a space veteran with strong ties to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, to serve as NASA's next administrator.",
      "During the news conference Thursday, Nelson was asked whether he was concerned that the next administration might make major changes to the Artemis program given SpaceX's development of the new Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "\"First of all, there is one human-rated spacecraft that is flying and that has already flown beyond the moon, and that's the SLS (Space Launch System) combined with Orion,\" Nelson said. \"Secondly, this is a partnership. It's a commercial partnership. It's an international partnership.",
      "\"I think what is going to happen over time is you're going to have a number of years that we're going to have the partners flying with NASA, and then whatever the technologies that are developed later on will dictate what is going to be the system that's flying.\"",
      "He concluded by saying, \"I don't see the concern that your question raises, although it's a legitimate question, that you're suddenly going to have Starship take over everything.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 16:52:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Jared Isaacman is an entrepreneur and veteran private astronaut with strong ties to Elon Musk and his rocket company SpaceX.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, a veteran private astronaut with strong ties to Elon Musk and his rocket company SpaceX, has been picked to serve as NASA's next administrator, President-elect Donald Trump  announced Wednesday.",
      "If confirmed, Isaacman, 41, would be the fifth NASA administrator with spaceflight experience, replacing former Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, who flew into orbit aboard the space shuttle Columbia in early 1986.",
      "\"I am delighted to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,\" Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social. \"... Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.\"",
      "Isaacman founded the payment processing company later named Shift4 Payments while he was a high school student. He chartered the first purely commercial, all-civilian American \"space tourist\" mission \u2014 Inspiration4 \u2014 in February 2021, paying SpaceX an undisclosed amount to launch him and three other civilian flyers on a two-day, 23-hour flight.",
      "He flew to space again this past September, commanding the first of three planned SpaceX Polaris missions, logging nearly five days in space on a flight that took the crew farther from Earth than any astronauts have gone since the Apollo moon program. Isaacman also became the first private citizen to carry out a spacewalk.",
      "He is scheduled to lead another Polaris mission aboard a SpaceX capsule before leading the first crew to space aboard the California rocket builder's gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "Dates have not been announced for either of those missions, and it's not yet clear what impact Isaacman's selection to lead NASA will have on those flights, whether Isaacman still intends to fly aboard one or both or what sort of influence his friendship with Musk might have on NASA's future direction.",
      "But Isaacman, a skilled pilot who flies his own MiG-29 fighter jet, made it clear in a post following Trump's announcement that NASA can expect him to be a vocal space advocate who will help \"usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilization.\"",
      "\"With the support of President Trump, I can promise you this: We will never again lose our ability to journey to the stars and never settle for second place,\" Isaacman said. \"We will inspire children, yours and mine, to look up and dream of what is possible. Americans will walk on the moon and Mars and in doing so, we will make life better here on Earth.\"",
      "He said it would be the \"honor of a lifetime to serve in this role and to work alongside NASA's extraordinary team to realize our shared dreams of exploration and discovery.\"",
      "Jim Bridenstine, Nelson's predecessor at the helm of NASA, helped kickstart the agency's Artemis moon program during the first Trump administration.",
      "He said in a statement Wednesday that \"Jared's vision for pushing boundaries, paired with his proven track record of success in private industry, positions him as an ideal candidate to lead NASA into a bold new era of exploration and discovery. I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm him.\"",
      "The Isaacman announcement comes as NASA struggles to keep the Artemis program on track amid tight budgets and what the agency's own inspector general calls the \"unsustainable\" costs of NASA's Space Launch System, or SLS, moon rocket.",
      "SpaceX supporters argue the company's more powerful, fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship rocket is the obvious choice for deep space exploration, but the huge rocket is far from operational with just a half-dozen suborbital test flights to its credit.",
      "The SLS, on the other hand, is considered operational in that it completed an initial test flight in November 2022, sending an unpiloted Orion capsule around the moon and back. But unlike the Super Heavy-Starship, the SLS is a throwaway, expendable booster expected to cost some $1.4 billion for each of its first four moon missions.",
      "NASA is currently gearing up to launch three NASA astronauts and a Canadian flyer on an SLS-Orion mission \u2014 Artemis 2 \u2014 late next year. But problems with the first Orion's heat shield and other issues threaten to push the Artemis 2 flight into 2026, years past initial expectations.",
      "It's not yet clear when the Artemis 3 mission, the first to carry astronauts to a landing near the moon's south pole, might be feasible.",
      "But that flight will feature a lunar lander built by SpaceX, a variant of the company's Starship upper stage. SpaceX has carried out six test flights of the fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship to date, but has not yet put the Starship upper stage into orbit or brought it down for an intact landing.",
      "Given the company's rapid-fire test schedule, most observers believe SpaceX will get the Super Heavy-Starship working as planned in the near future, but scores of test flights will be required to demonstrate the safety and reliability required by NASA to put astronauts aboard.",
      "And the moon mission poses unique challenges.",
      "For the initial landing mission, multiple Super Heavy \"tanker\" flights will be required to refuel the moon lander in low-Earth orbit before it can be sent to the moon. Once in lunar orbit, it will await the arrival of the Artemis 3 crew, launched aboard an Orion capsule by an SLS rocket.",
      "After boarding the Starship lander, two astronauts would descend to the surface, carry out the mission's planned exploration, and then head back up to the orbiting Orion for the trip back to Earth.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 17:26:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Abutting homes, schools an parks, the sprawling warehouses are a huge drain on local resources and major pollutant.",
    "story": [
      "The sprawling, windowless warehouses that hold rows of high-speed servers powering almost everything the world does on phones and computers are increasingly becoming fixtures of the American landscape, popping up in towns, cities and suburbs across the United States.",
      "Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and urban and rural governments alike are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies.",
      "But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas, abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents are pushing back against the world's most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.",
      "In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling hills of the area's westernmost counties and butt up against wooded bike trails winding through the suburbs. But one of the latest proposals in the area, Plaza 500, would see a 466,000-square-foot facility and adjacent electrical substation built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds and a community center.",
      "The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials promised jobs and a significant property tax boost. But data center critics say the incentives aren't enough to counteract the consequences of building the facilities so close to homes.",
      "Tyler Ray, a leader in the fight against the Virginia project, worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by 2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help power the data centers' hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere.",
      "Ray and his neighbors tried to stop the development, but their efforts were largely unsuccessful. The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project was exempt.",
      "\"I don't know how a general resident, even someone who has been engaging intently on an issue, has any chance to go up against the data center industry,\" Ray said the night the supervisors voted.",
      "For local governments, attracting data centers to their municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in 2024 that Virginia's current data centers brought in $1 billion in tax revenue.",
      "For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of direct jobs \u2013 often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently that its investment in nearby Loudoun County, which included two data centers, created around 150 direct jobs, a figure that data center opponents say isn't worth the hassle. But data center advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction, technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730 indirect jobs.",
      "Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax County should reap the benefits.",
      "\"I have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the big picture,\" Smith said. \"Data centers are not going away.\"",
      "On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the 4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia river.",
      "Last year, AWS paid roughly $34 million in property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a $66 million tax break. Those payments, in addition to $1.7 in charitable donations from the company in 2023, have been instrumental in updating infrastructure and bolstering services. These funds have gone toward a new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer and $5,000 grants for homebuyers so far totaling at least $2.8 million.",
      "\"This road right here? Wouldn't happen if it wasn't for AWS,\" said Boardman Mayor Paul Keefer, riding in the passenger seat of Police Chief Rick Stokoe's cruiser, pointing out the window at construction workers shifting dirt and laying pavement.",
      "AWS has cultivated relationships with local officials including Keefer and Stokoe, who have both been in positions to vote on whether to authorize tax breaks with the company. Some former county commissioners and residents worry that those relationships are too cozy.",
      "Kevin Miller, AWS's vice president of global data centers, said in an interview with the Associated Press that \"our interest is in being a model corporate citizen, to really be partners with those communities.\"",
      "Skepticism of the deals started years ago, when three formerly elected officials allegedly helped approve data center deals while also owning a stake in a company that contracted with AWS to provide fiber optic cables for the data centers. In June, they each paid $2,000 to settle an ethics complaint.",
      "Those officials are no longer in office. But the latest data center deal struck between Morrow County officials and AWS, which gives the company an estimated $1 billion in tax breaks spread over the 15 years to build five new data centers, again raised eyebrows.",
      "Two former Morrow County Commissioners, Jim Doherty and Melissa Lindsay, pushed unsuccessfully in 2022 for AWS to pay more in taxes in new data center negotiations.",
      "\"We didn't want to blow it up. We didn't want to run them off,\" said Lindsay. \"But there were better deals to be made.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 19:28:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Craig Garriott has built satellites for Boeing for nearly three decades.",
    "story": [
      "Whether it's providing internet to storm-ravaged communities or supporting American troops at war, Craig Garriott has long believed the satellites he builds for Boeing helped protect lives.",
      "Now, Garriott, 53, says, it's the lives of hundreds of technicians at the Boeing facility where he has worked for nearly three decades that need protecting from company management.",
      "\"They've taken the focus off quality, the focus off the people on the floor, and they've put it completely on profit and going fast,\" Garriott said in an exclusive interview with CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave. \"I'm afraid with Boeing in the hands that it's in now down here, they're not gonna listen to me until somebody dies.\"",
      "He said efforts by Boeing executives to boost production at the company's Los Angeles-area military and commercial satellite plant have led to a \"toxic culture\" that has put workers there in danger. Garriott recalled how a four-ton satellite estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars crashed to the factory floor after it wasn't properly secured \u2014 an incident so catastrophic he compared it to \"a plane falling out of the sky.\"",
      "\"One person was underneath that satellite and they barely got out,\" said Garriott, who also represents 600 hourly workers as the head of the local carpenters union. \"It's the worst thing that can possibly happen on a site.\"",
      "A Boeing spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about the incident. In a statement to CBS News, the spokesperson said, \"Boeing is dedicated to the safety of its employees, and all employees are empowered and encouraged to report any safety concerns.\"",
      "Garriott's allegations echo concerns raised by multiple whistleblowers who have worked on Boeing's commercial airliners, including the troubled 737 MAX. And they add to struggles already facing Boeing's space division.",
      "The most high-profile Boeing space failure occurred in September, when the company's Starliner spacecraft experienced a cascade of technical troubles on a manned test flight to the International Space Station. NASA considered the return flight too risky, and sent it back to Earth without the two astronauts it had planned to shuttle home. Those astronauts will instead travel back next year in a capsule built by rival SpaceX and its CEO Elon Musk.",
      "Tapped by President-elect Trump to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, Musk is set to potentially wield enormous influence over lucrative space and defense contracts, which could put Boeing at a further disadvantage.",
      "Boeing, the company that helped put a man on the moon, is now exploring a new course \u2014 indicating it may sell off parts of its space business, according to a recent report in the Wall Street Journal. During Boeing's October earnings call, new CEO Kelly Ortberg suggested he was reevaluating the company's portfolio.",
      "\"We're better off doing less and doing it well than doing more and not doing it well,\" Ortberg said.",
      "The Boeing spokesperson did not respond to questions about how the company views competition from SpaceX or about steps it is taking to prepare for the incoming administration.",
      "Garriott estimates he's raised 300-400 safety violations over past year",
      "Acquired by Boeing in 2000, the satellite manufacturing facility has long been considered one of Boeing's more stable business units. It relies in part on a union workforce that Garriott said is responsible for constructing and testing satellites and their component parts.",
      "\"This is perhaps the most technical group of hourly people that you'll probably find on this planet,\" said Garriott, who estimated he's raised between 300 and 400 safety violations over the past year. Those complaints, he said, range from obstructed fire extinguishers and fire alarms to concerns over heavy machinery blocking exits and trapping workers in certain parts of the factory.",
      "In October, union workers filed a complaint with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration that, according to Garriott, highlighted unsafe conditions on the factory floor.",
      "Another technician at the facility, who spoke to CBS News on the condition he remain anonymous to protect his job, said safety had become \"an afterthought\" and quality had \"degraded\" over the past five to six years.",
      "\"You speak up now, you're a troublemaker\"",
      "Garriott sued Boeing in April alleging company management retaliated against him for raising safety issues. He said he's been harassed by leadership at the facility and has been the target of dozens of corporate investigations that he says turned up nothing and were only meant to intimidate him.",
      "\"When I first started at Boeing, the guys that spoke up and said, 'Hey, this doesn't feel right,' those guys were revered,\" Garriott said. \"You speak up now, you're a troublemaker.\"",
      "In a statement, Boeing said it investigated Garriott's claims and disputed the allegations he made in his lawsuit.",
      "'We have strict policies prohibiting retaliation toward employees who raise concerns, and Boeing did not retaliate against Mr. Garriott,\" the Boeing spokesperson said.",
      "Garriott is the latest whistleblower claiming the company retaliated against him after raising safety concerns. John Barnett, a former quality manager at the company's 787 Dreamliner factory, died by suicide in March while in Charleston, South Carolina, giving testimony in his whistleblower retaliation case.",
      "Barnett's mother, Vicky Stokes, told CBS News in April she holds the aircraft manufacturing giant responsible for the grinding treatment that ultimately left her son despondent.",
      "\"If this hadn't gone on so long, I'd still have my son, and my sons would have their brother and we wouldn't be sitting here. So in that respect, I do,\" Stokes said when asked if she places some of the blame for her son's death on Boeing.",
      "In June, former Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told lawmakers on the Senate investigations subcommittee that Boeing's culture is \"far from perfect,\" but said the company is \"committed to making sure every employee feels empowered to speak up if there is a problem.\" He also said Boeing is working on improving \"transparency and accountability, while elevating employee engagement.\"",
      "Garriott said although his family fears he will endure further reprisals from Boeing, he's now speaking out publicly in an effort to improve conditions for workers he said he took an oath as union head to protect.",
      "\"I'm not gonna stop till I know that Boeing understands that these people mean something, they matter,\" Garriott said, urging company executives to open up a dialogue with workers on the factory floor. \"Make 'em feel like they matter. Make 'em feel like their safety matters.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:59:07 -0500",
    "summary": "Bluesky has added millions of new subscribers in the last month as some users leave X. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "It's unusual for a new social media service to get a foothold in a marketplace entrenched by the likes of X (formerly Twitter), Instagram and TikTok which, dominate people's phones. But Bluesky, a nearly 2-year-old app, is now grabbing attention amid a recent surge of new users, which the company says is likely due to growing frustrations with X.",
      "While the platform has grown since it opened as an invite-only service in February 2023, its membership snowballed following the November 5 presidential election. Bluesky currently has more than 22 million users, up from about 12 million people in mid-October, according to the company's data.",
      "Bluesky believes its recent growth is partly due to changes at X under billionaire owner Elon Musk, according to Bluesky Chief Operating Officer Rose Wang, who recently spoke to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Musk, who bought Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion, has overhauled the service, changing its name to X\u00a0and\u00a0prioritizing accounts from people who pay for a blue checkmark \u2014 although accounts with more than 2,500 \"verified subscriber followers\" get access to Premium features for free.",
      "Ad sales almost immediately softened after Musk took over the platform, with companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Disney removing paid ads from X\u00a0last year. Most recently, The Guardian said it would no longer be posting its content under its official account on X. In its announcement, the British newspaper described X as \"toxic,\" adding that the platform has been used by Musk to shape political discourse.",
      "Musk became one of the most viral voices on elections during the 2024 campaign, frequently sharing conspiratorial narratives while promoting President-elect Donald Trump, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "When Twitter became X, \"it was no longer a public town square, and now it's more of a partisan microphone,\" Wang said, adding, \"that is a big reason why we think people are coming over.\"",
      "X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "What is the difference between X and Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky resembles the \"old Twitter\" in terms of layout and content,\u00a0wrote\u00a0PCWorld tech writer Dave Parrack in a recent column. He added, \"Bluesky feels like a safe haven. There's very little trolling, and when it does happen, people aren't biting.\"",
      "Bluesky users can find people to follow through so-called \"starter packs,\" or curated lists of people to follow by interest or fields, such as this group of garden writers. That enables users to quickly build a feed of posts from people that they pick, rather than being fed content by a corporate algorithm, the company says.",
      "Because people can tailor their interests and connect with other like-minded users, there's more interaction on the service than on X, according to Wang.",
      "Some companies are also reporting more engagement with their posts on the Bluesky app versus rival platforms. An executive for The Boston Globe, for instance\u00a0noted\u00a0that the newspaper's posts on Bluesky receive three times the traffic as on Meta's Threads.",
      "\"Thirty percent of users Bluesky are posters versus 1% on Twitter,\" Wang said.",
      "Even so, it's questionable whether Bluesky's jump in new users is making much of a dent in X's consumer base.",
      "The presidential election delivered a surge in traffic to Musk's social media service, according to tracking service Similarweb. It found that more than 46 million U.S. users visited X on November 6, the day after President-elect Donald Trump's win \u2014 more than any day in the prior year. About 115,000 people in the U.S. deactivated their accounts on X that same day, its data shows.",
      "How Bluesky makes money",
      "While Bluesky's user base is growing quickly, the company remains small in terms of its funding and staff, which Wang describes as \"a tiny team of 20\" employees, including herself and CEO Jay Graber. The service was created by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, although the business has been independent since 2021.",
      "In October, the company\u00a0raised $15 million in venture funding, which followed a seed round of $8 million in 2023. Wang noted that Bluesky is focused on figuring out how to sustain its business, which will soon include new revenue streams from subscriptions and financial transactions.",
      "\"We are launching subscriptions at the end of this year,\" Wang noted. \"It'll be custom aesthetics, custom avatar frames, maybe more video uploads.\"",
      "The company is also planning to enable financial transactions between users, such as if a game designer wants to sell his or her products to Bluesky users. The service would take a portion of the payment, Wang noted.",
      "Bluesky doesn't accept advertising, nor has it marketed itself in the wake of Musk's takeover of Twitter, she added.",
      "To be sure, Bluesky may never achieve the size of bigger social media networks, which advertisers flock to in order to reach much larger groups of users. For instance, Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, had more than 3 billion daily users across its apps in the most recent quarter, and\u00a0booked almost $40 billion in revenue during that time.",
      "How do you sign up for Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky opened as an invitation-only platform in February 2023, but anyone can now sign up for the service.",
      "User handles on the service are a little bit different than X or other social media networks because they end with the site's domain, .bsky.social. Posts are limited to 300 characters, 20 more than on X. Photos and videos can also uploaded, though videos can't be longer than 60 seconds. GIFs and emojis are available, too.",
      "As with other platforms, you can tag people on Bluesky by typing \"@\" before their username, you can like posts by tapping a heart icon, and use hashtags to highlight a theme. Bluesky has added a\u00a0menu\u00a0to hashtags, so that when users click on one they'll get different options for seeing, or muting, posts on a particular topic.",
      "\"It's more of a community space \u2014 it's more of a Reddit model, where you land in those cosy corners,\" Wang added. \"At the end of the day it's all about the people, and what I encourage people to do is just come to Bluesky, give it a chance and see for yourself what the experience is like.\"",

      "The long-winged seabird named Wisdom, a Laysan albatross, returned to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge at the northwestern edge of the Hawaiian Archipelago and laid what experts estimate may be her 60th egg, the Pacific Region of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service said in a Facebook post this week.",
      "Wisdom and her mate, Akeakamai, had returned to the atoll in the Pacific Ocean to lay and hatch eggs since 2006. Laysan albatrosses mate for life and lay one egg per year, but according to the USFWS, Akeakamai hadn't been seen for several years, prompting \"Wisdom to begin courtship dances with other males\" as soon as she returned to the island last week.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 00:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump wants former lawmaker and auctioneer Billy Long to replace IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he wants ex-congressman Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri and a former auctioneer, to run the IRS. As a lawmaker, Long co-sponsored legislation that aimed to wipe out much of the tax code.",
      "In making the announcement, Trump praised Long's \"32 years of experience running his own businesses in Real Estate and, as one of the premier Auctioneers in the Country.\" He also noted that since leaving Congress in 2023, Long has worked as a business and tax adviser.",
      "While Trump didn't mention the current IRS Commissioner, Danny Werfel, in his announcement, the decision signals the president-elect is likely to replace him with Long after taking office in January, Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Naming Long as the next IRS chief drew both support from conservatives as well as criticism from the left, with Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia who serves on the House Ways and Means Tax subcommittee calling it a \"terrible mistake,\" while Idaho Republican Senator Mike Crapo issued a statement saying he's looking forward to hearing Long's ideas for the tax agency. The fiscally conservative National Taxpayers Union Foundation praised Trump's choice, saying Long could help reform the IRS.",
      "Long has recently served as a tax adviser to businesses seeking to employ a controversial tax credit, but, unlike prior IRS commissioners, his background is largely outside of the tax industry, experts noted.",
      "\"This guy is an auctioneer \u2014 that's his expertise,\" Owens noted. \"This is an incredibly unserious choice.\"",
      "Werfel, who was appointed by President Biden, stepped into the role in 2023, with his term set to expire in 2027. Typically, presidents allow IRS commissioners to serve out their term, as Mr. Biden allowed Trump's former IRS appointee, Charles Rettig, to do before naming Werfel to the role.",
      "If the Senate approves his appointment to the IRS, Long would oversee an agency with 85,000 employees and an annual budget exceeding $12 billion.",
      "A spokesperson for the Trump campaign declined to comment.",
      "Here's what to know about Long and the IRS.",
      "Who is Billy Long?",
      "Long, who attended the University of Missouri but didn't graduate, described himself on a\u00a0website\u00a0for his congressional run as a \"fourth-generation native of Southwest Missouri.\" He touted his skills as an auctioneer, noting that he had been named the \"best auctioneer in the Ozarks for seven years in a row.\"",
      "Long also worked in real estate and in talk radio, hosting a show on a Missouri AM radio station.",
      "He shuttered his auction firm, Billy Long Auctions, before he was sworn into Congress in 2011, according to a local publication.",
      "What professional experience does Long have with taxes?",
      "As a congressman, Long co-sponsored some tax-related bills, including several efforts to eliminate the estate tax as well as a measure called the Tax Code Termination Act.",
      "That legislation would have wiped out much of the current tax code, replacing it with what the bill called a \"simple and fair system\" that would have applied \"a low rate to all Americans.\" Such flat taxes are considered regressive by many experts because low- and middle-income taxpayers would end up paying a larger share of their incomes than would wealthy Americans.",
      "\"As a business owner, Billy knows first-hand how government regulation and heavy taxes can affect the small businesses that serve as the economic engine of our country,\" his campaign site noted.",
      "While Long isn't an accountant or CPA, he has been involved in tax advising since leaving Congress. In a 2023 podcast, for example, he touted his work helping businesses use the Employee Retention Tax Credit, a credit that the IRS has\u00a0flagged for its high rate of fraud.",
      "In the podcast, Long also said that when he served as a congressman, he helped make the ERTC easier for businesses to claim, noting that the credit was difficult to qualify for during its first iteration.",
      "\"We went from having to say COVID adversely affected your business definitely, to taking that away, and you don't have to prove that you had any downturn,\" he said. \"We're doing recoveries for folks that had their best two years ever during COVID.\"",
      "The IRS says the ERTC is aimed at employers who paid wages to workers between March 12, 2020, and January 1, 2022, and that were either suspended by government order during the pandemic or experienced a \"required decline in gross receipts during 2020 or the first three calendar quarters of 2021.\" The credit is also available to startups that began at the end of 2021 and had less than $1 million in revenue.",
      "How does Long's experience compare with prior IRS commissioners?",
      "Long's lack of tax industry experience sets him apart from other recent IRS commissioners.",
      "Werfel, the current IRS chief, has an undergraduate degree from Cornell University and a master's degree in public policy from Duke University as well as a law degree from the University of North Carolina. He's also held a number of government jobs involved in operations and the IRS, including serving as acting commissioner of the IRS from May to December 2013, according to his biography.",
      "Werfel's predecessor, Charles Rettig, who was appointed by President-elect Trump, also held several degrees, including a master's in taxation. Before joining the IRS, Rettig worked as a tax attorney for more than three decades and served as the chairman of the IRS Advisory Council.",
      "What is happening with the IRS now?",
      "Under Werfel, the IRS has expanded audits of wealthy taxpayers and big corporations, clawing back billions in unpaid taxes, efforts that were funded by the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "The tax agency has also reduced the time it takes consumers to connect with an IRS employee, while also rolling out a free tax filing system called Direct File.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have pushed back against the expanded IRS funding, claiming\u00a0the agency would use the money to hire thousands of new agents to increase audits on middle-class taxpayers.",
      "The Treasury had said that funding could help the IRS add nearly 87,000 full-time workers over 10 years, but the agency didn't specify whether those new workers would be auditors, customer service workers or other types of employees. That figure also represented the total number of employees that could be hired, without calculating the impact of the number of IRS workers who are expected to retire or leave the department over the next several years.",
      "Some Democratic lawmakers are expressing concern that, if appointed, Long could disrupt the progress that the IRS has made under Werfel.",
      "Werfel \"has done an excellent job rebuilding the IRS, boosting customer service and enhancing enforcement aimed at wealthy tax evaders,\" Rep. Beyer said in a statement. \"Removing him will clearly signal Trump's intention to make the agency less responsive to the American people, while giving a green light to wealthy tax cheats to evade their fair share of the tax burden.\"",
      "Still, Republican lawmakers expressed support for the pick, such as Senator Crapo, who highlighted \"privacy and security\" issues at the IRS and \"inefficient use of resources.\" He added, \"I look forward to learning more about Mr. Long's vision for the agency.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Biden is considering blanket preemptive pardons for prominent critics of President-elect Donald Trump in both parties to shield them from possible \"retribution\" or legal prosecution by the incoming administration.",
      "Multiple people familiar with the ongoing discussions tell CBS News the president has debated with senior White House aides the possibility of issuing the preemptive pardons, but no specific names have been formally recommended to him. The concept of preemptive pardons, and names of people who could benefit from them, have been more rigorously discussed among administration officials expected to help Mr. Biden make final determinations, a group that includes White House Chief of Staff Jeffrey Zients and White House Counsel Ed Siskel.",
      "Among those who could be eligible for preemptive legal relief include well-known names at the center of many of the most rancorous moments of the first Trump administration, many of whom remain the subject of his public ire.",
      "The list includes Dr. Anthony Fauci, who helped coordinate the nation's COVID-19 response and later served as Mr. Biden's top science adviser; retired Gen. Mark A. Milley, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who has called Trump a \"fascist\" and provided information for several books and news reports detailing the former president's behavior and activities around the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol; California Democratic Senator-elect Adam Schiff, and other Democratic and Republican lawmakers who led the two impeachment cases against Trump or sat on the House committee that reviewed the Jan. 6 attack \u2014   a group that includes former Wyoming Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, who actively campaigned against Trump this past fall.",
      "Fauci, Milley and Cheney were not immediately available for comment.\u00a0In an interview with NPR in late November, Schiff said he didn't think a preemptive pardon is a good idea, because \"I think the courts are strong enough to withstand\" threats made by Trump.",
      "\"I think this is frankly so implausible as not to be worthy of much consideration,\" Schiff said. \"I would urge the president not to do that. I think it would seem defensive and unnecessary.\"",
      "News that Mr. Biden was considering preemptive pardons\u00a0was first reported this week by Politico.

      "The pardon, the first ever issued by any American president for one of his children, came Sunday in the wake of Trump's announced plans to nominate Pam Bondi to serve as attorney general and Kash Patel to lead the FBI.

    "summary": "Heat shield damage seen during the first Artemis test flight is now understood, NASA says, but more time is needed to implement fixes.",
    "story": [
      "Less than a year after announcing major delays for the next two Artemis moon missions, NASA managers said Thursday the projected flight dates are slipping once again, with the first piloted voyage around the moon now expected in the April 2026 timeframe, and the first lunar landing in mid 2027.",
      "NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said the delays are needed to revise the Orion crew capsule's re-entry trajectory to reduce stress and prevent the sort of unexpected heat shield damage seen after an unpiloted 2022 test flight \u2014 and to complete extensive testing of the capsule's environmental control and life support systems.",
      "\"Based on the data, we have decided, unanimously, to move forward with the current Artemis 2/Orion capsule and heat shield with a modified entry trajectory...to lessen the heat coming back into the Earth's atmosphere,\" Nelson said.",
      "\"Additionally, we need to complete our updates to the Orion environmental controls and the life support systems that were identified earlier this year.\"",
      "Future heat shields for the Artemis 3 moon landing mission and subsequent flights will use essentially the same materials but with modifications to improve their performance during re-entry.",
      "In the meantime, Nelson said, \"We are planning for Artemis 2 to launch in April of '26 and we're going to do all in our power, with our commercial partners, to launch earlier.\"",
      "The Artemis program aims to send astronauts to the moon's south polar region where ice deposits may allow crews to one day extract oxygen and hydrogen to produce air, water and rocket propellants that would not have to be carried up, at great expense, from Earth.",
      "Following the launch of Artemis 2, Nelson said NASA is going \"to make (any) adjustments that are necessary, and we plan to launch Artemis 3, the first landing on the moon in over a half century. Assuming the SpaceX lander is ready, we plan to launch Artemis 3 in mid-2027. That will be well ahead of the Chinese government's announced intention (of sending taikonauts to the moon in) 2030...We need to get this Artemis 2 test flight right to ensure the success of our return to the moon.\"",
      "NASA launched the Artemis program's first test flight, Artemis 1, in November 2022, using the agency's new Space Launch System, or SLS, rocket to send an unpiloted Lockheed Martin-built Orion capsule on a looping flight around the moon and back.",
      "NASA had planned to launch the Artemis 2 mission at the end of this year to carry a three-man one-woman crew around the moon to thoroughly test the spacecraft's life support, propulsion and other systems.",
      "But after the Artemis 1 flight, engineers discovered the Orion capsule's 16-foot-wide heat shield suffered unexpected damage during it's high-speed return from the moon using a technique called a \"skip entry.\"",
      "In a skip entry, the capsule dips into the atmosphere, slows and rises back up before dropping back into the atmosphere for the final descent. The idea is similar to how a flat rock can skip across a still pond. Skip entries provide a number of benefits, including a wider range of splashdown targets.",
      "The Orion heat shield is designed to ablate, or char, during re-entry when the spacecraft enters Earth's atmosphere at more than 25,000 mph. But the charred material is intended to stay in place, providing a layer of insulation. During the Artemis 1 re-entry, more charred material separated from the heat shield than computer models predicted.",
      "While the unexpected \"liberation\" had no impact on the spacecraft \u2014 NASA said astronauts would not have even noticed had any been on board \u2014 engineers wanted to make sure they understood the underlying cause so they could update computer models to accurately predict re-entry effects across multiple trajectories.",
      "After hundreds of tests and an exhaustive engineering analysis, NASA has \"since determined that while the capsule was dipping in and out of the atmosphere as part of that planned skip entry, heat accumulated inside the heat shield's outer layer,\" said Pam Melroy, a former shuttle commander and now deputy administrator of NASA.",
      "That heat build up led to \"gases forming and becoming trapped inside the heat shield,\" she said. \"This caused internal pressure to build up and led to cracking and uneven shedding of that outer layer.\"",
      "While the same type of heat shield will be used for the Artemis 2 mission in April 2026, the crew will use a modified re-entry trajectory to reduce the sort of heating that damaged the Artemis 1 heat shield.",
      "As for the Artemis 3 lunar landing flight, the new mid-2027 target launch date assumes SpaceX's lunar lander, a variant of the upper stage used by the company's new Super Heavy-Starship rocket, completes multiple test flights in Earth orbit, along with at least one unpiloted lunar landing.",
      "On Wednesday, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he was selecting billionaire Jared Isaacman, a space veteran with strong ties to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, to serve as NASA's next administrator.",
      "During the news conference Thursday, Nelson was asked whether he was concerned that the next administration might make major changes to the Artemis program given SpaceX's development of the new Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "\"First of all, there is one human-rated spacecraft that is flying and that has already flown beyond the moon, and that's the SLS (Space Launch System) combined with Orion,\" Nelson said. \"Secondly, this is a partnership. It's a commercial partnership. It's an international partnership.",
      "\"I think what is going to happen over time is you're going to have a number of years that we're going to have the partners flying with NASA, and then whatever the technologies that are developed later on will dictate what is going to be the system that's flying.\"",
      "He concluded by saying, \"I don't see the concern that your question raises, although it's a legitimate question, that you're suddenly going to have Starship take over everything.\"",

      "In an interview with CBS News correspondent Natalie Brand, the independent Vermont senator said that he feared some of Kennedy's views on health issues are \"extremely dangerous,\" criticizing Kennedy's call to pull fluoride out of U.S. water supply systems and his \"very wrong\" views on vaccines.",
      "But the Vermont independent also said he might be able to find common ground on working with Kennedy, echoing his criticism of the influence the food industry has in Washington.",
      "\"I think what he's saying about the food industry is exactly correct. I think you have a food industry concerned about their profits, could care less about the health of the American people. I think they have to be taken on,\" Sanders told Brand.",
      "Sanders, who currently serves as chair of the Senate's health committee, said he had last spoken to Kennedy years ago. He said he was looking forward to sitting down and talking with Trump's picks to head other health agencies who would report to Kennedy.",
      "\"Trump over the years, and Kennedy himself, has talked about as a health problem, the fact that we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.

      "\"We are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts, because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized at some point in the past. We don't, but we are going to undertake it. But we are going to definitely struggle with the resources necessary to do that,\" said Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods.",
      "FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf also warned the agency was facing an increasingly steep battle pushing through new rules, like long-stalled efforts to move forward a new \"healthy\" standard and nutrition labels that would go on the front of food packages, as well as crack down on cigarettes.",
      "\"Given the current state of judicial affairs, First Amendment rights, the fact that corporations have the same rights as individuals, every little thing we do, unless specifically in detail instructed by Congress, it's not just that we lose in court, but we lose years,\" Califf said.",
      "One long-awaited change that could see movement soon is a ban on the food dye\u00a0Red No. 3, which advocacy groups have petitioned for. California moved last year to be the first state to ban the food dye on its own over health concerns.",
      "\"We are hopeful that, within the next few weeks, we will be acting on that petition and a decision should be forthcoming,\" said Jones.",

    "story": [
      "The federal Bureau of Prisons is permanently closing the notorious \"rape club\" women's prison in Dublin, Califorina, and will idle six facilities in a sweeping realignment after years of abuse, decay and mismanagement.",
      "The agency informed employees and Congress on Thursday through a notification that it plans to shutter the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin that has been the focus of controversy for a number of years. The bureau is additionally deactivating multiple minimum-security prison camps in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Colorado, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Florida.",
      "The agency said staff and inmates at the impacted locations will be moved to other facilities.",
      "The document issued by the Bureau of Prisons said it was taking \"decisive and strategic action\" to address \"significant challenges, including a critical staffing shortage, crumbling infrastructure and limited budgetary resources.\" The agency said it is not downsizing and is committed to finding positions for every affected employee.",
      "The closures are a striking coda to the Biden administration's stewardship of the Justice Department's biggest agency. After repeatedly promising to reform FCI Dublin and other troubled facilities, Bureau of Prisons Director Colette Peters is pivoting to closures and consolidation, citing inadequate staffing and staggering costs to repair aging infrastructure.",
      "The permanent shutdown of FCI Dublin, just east of San Francisco, comes seven months after\u00a0a temporary closure was announced following reform attempts\u00a0in the wake of staff-on-inmate abuse that led to the \"rape club\" moniker. At the time, it appeared the agency was set on closing the low-security prison, but officials held out the possibility that it could be repaired and reopened for a different purpose, such as housing male inmates.",
      "The assessment identified considerable repairs necessary to reopen the FCI Dublin, the agency said. Low staffing, exacerbated by the high cost of living in the Bay Area, also contributed to the decision to close the facility, the agency said.",
      "\"We understand the impact the closure will have on our employees and are committed to ensuring all are able to continue accomplishing the agency's mission at other locations,\" the statement read.",
      "The prison has been at the center of a\u00a0years-long investigation. Since 2021, at least eight employees, including a former warden, have been charged with sexually abusing inmates.",
      "Five employees have pleaded guilty. Two were convicted at trial, including former warden Ray Garcia. The case against the eighth employee is pending.",
      "At the time of the closure announcement, FCI Dublin was housing about 600 inmates.",
      "The move comes three years after the agency closed its troubled New York jail in Manhattan after myriad problems came to light in the wake of Jeffrey Epstein's suicide there, including lax security, staffing shortages and squalid, unsafe conditions such as falling concrete and busted cells.",
      "The Bureau of Prisons and the correctional workers union have repeatedly pushed for additional federal prison funding, highlighting what they say is an inadequate amount of money to address pay increases, staff retention and a multibillion-dollar repair backlog. More than half of federal prison facilities were built before 1991 and many are becoming outmoded or obsolete, the agency said.",
      "The agency said it expects that reassigning employees to remaining facilities will boost retention and cut down on mandatory overtime and augmentation, a practice by which cooks, teachers, nurses and other prison workers are assigned to guard inmates.",
      "FCI Dublin's permanent closure represents an extraordinary acknowledgement by the Bureau of Prisons that it has failed to fix the facility's culture and environment in the wake of AP reporting that exposed rampant sexual abuse within its walls. Hundreds of people who were incarcerated at FCI Dublin are suing the agency, seeking reforms and monetary compensation for mistreatment at the facility.",
      "The closures at FCI Dublin and across the federal prison system come amid an AP investigation that has uncovered deep, previously unreported flaws within the Bureau of Prisons. AP reporting has disclosed widespread criminal activity by employees, dozens of escapes, chronic violence, deaths and severe staffing shortages that have hampered responses to emergencies, including assaults and suicides.",

      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans on Thursday blocked two Democratic resolutions that would have compelled the House Ethics Committee to release a potentially damaging report on its investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz, voting to refer the matter back to the committee.",
      "Democratic Reps. Sean Casten of Illinois and Steve Cohen of Tennessee introduced twin privileged resolutions, forcing floor action within two legislative days. In a 206 to 198 vote, all but one Republican voted to refer Casten's resolution back to the Ethics Committee. Cohen's resolution met the same fate in a 204 to 198 vote, with one Republican voting with Democrats. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock of California was the only member to cross party lines.",
      "In a statement, Casten accused his Republican colleagues of voting \"to sweep these allegations under the rug and set an unfortunate precedent.\" He said he would continue to pursue the report's release.",
      "The votes came after President-elect Donald Trump announced last month that he intended to nominate Gaetz for attorney general, prompting intense scrutiny over the Florida Republican's background and the House Ethics Committee's investigation into allegations that Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Gaetz, who has denied the allegations, withdrew from consideration for the attorney general nomination a little over a week after Trump made the announcement.",
      "Gaetz immediately resigned from Congress after Trump announced he wanted the Florida Republican to join his Cabinet. The timing of his resignation came days before the House panel was set to vote on releasing its report on Gaetz.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, urged the committee to keep the report secret, arguing that a former member is beyond the panel's jurisdiction and it would set a \"terrible precedent.\"",
      "\"I believe it is very important to maintain the House's tradition of not issuing ethics reports on people who are no longer members of Congress,\" he said on Nov. 15. \"The House Ethics Committee's jurisdiction is over sitting members of Congress. That's an important rule.\"",
      "Casten's resolution cited four instances in which the Ethics Committee has released reports on its investigations into members after they've resigned.",
      "The bipartisan committee met Nov. 20 to consider whether to release the report, but was evenly split along party lines about how to move forward. A day later, Gaetz withdrew himself from consideration, facing a tenuous path to Senate confirmation. There was growing interest from senators on both sides of the aisle in seeing the report before a confirmation vote.",
      "The House Ethics Committee met again Thursday to discuss its investigation into allegations against Gaetz.

    "story": [
      "More than 4 million Americans gouged by credit repair companies including Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com will soon collectively receive $1.8 billion in refund checks, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced Thursday.",
      "The payments make up the biggest distribution yet from the CFPB's victims relief fund, financed by civil penalties paid by companies that violate consumer protection laws, the agency said.",
      "Checks will be mailed in coming weeks to 4.3 million consumers who were charged illegal advance fees or subjected to allegedly deceptive bait-and-switch advertising by Lexington Law, CreditRepair.com and their parent companies, according to the federal agency.",
      "The CFPB in August 2023 obtained a legal judgment against the credit repair businesses, with a district court ruling the companies had violated a law that prohibits such companies from collecting fees until at least six months after their promised results.",
      "The companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after the court ruling, shutting about 80% of their business operations, including telemarketing call centers.",
      "\"Exploited vulnerable consumers\"",
      "\"Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com exploited vulnerable consumers who were trying to rebuild their credit, charging them illegal junk fees for results they hadn't delivered,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra stated in a news release. \"This historic distribution of $1.8 billion demonstrates the CFPB's commitment to making consumers whole, even when the companies that harm them shut down or declare bankruptcy.\"",
      "Since its launch in 2011, the CFPB has distributed more than $3.3 billion to consumers harmed by a range of illegal practices, such as student loan and mortgage relief scams and predatory lending. The victims relief fund allows the CFPB to provide financial relief in cases where direction compensation from the violating company is not possible.",
      "The brainchild of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, the CFPB was established after the 2008 financial crisis. Funded by the Federal Reserve, the agency has weathered several legal challenges from opponents. The Supreme Court\u00a0in May upheld\u00a0its funding structure, which had been challenged by the payday lending industry.",
      "Still, the agency's efforts could prove short-lived amid calls from some Republicans to weaken the agency or get rid of it entirely. On Wednesday, billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 among those designated by President-elect Donald Trump to\u00a0front an effort\u00a0to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash regulations and cut government spending \u2014 called for deleting the CFPB, arguing in a\u00a0post\u00a0on social media that there are \"too many duplicative regulatory agencies.\"",
      "When will the refund checks be sent?",
      "Payments will be sent between December and January to eligible consumers harmed by the companies, and those eligible do not need to take any action to receive a check.",
      "Those who think they are eligible but have not received a payment by mid-January can then contact JND Legal Administration at www.cfpb-lexlaw.org. Details about the distribution can be found here.",
      "How big will the payments be?",
      "The CFPB said the payments are based on a pro-rata share of fees paid by consumers to CreditRepair.com and Lexington Law, but that the payments might not cover all the fees they incurred.",
      "If the payments were divided evenly, each person would receive about $419.",
      "\"If funds remain after the distribution is complete, additional checks may be sent to consumers who cashed their initial check. You don't need to take any additional action,\" the agency said.",
      "Can I file a claim?",
      "No, according to the agency. \"There won't be opportunities to file claims for this redress case,\" it said.",
      "Is the refund check taxable?",
      "It's unlikely, because the checks are considered refunds for payments that consumers made to the credit repair companies, rather than taxable income, the CFPB said. \"If you have tax-related questions, however, please contact a tax advisor,\" it added.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 17:40:01 -0500",
    "summary": "Even those enrolled in Medicare have a harder time paying for treatment compared with older adults in other countries.",
    "story": [
      "In the U.S., having health insurance is necessary, but not sufficient to ensure access to affordable medical care.",
      "While the U.S. lacks a universal health care system like those that exist in most other wealthy nations, most Americans over 65 are insured through Medicare. Yet many still struggle to afford care, with high out-of-pocket costs putting necessary medications and doctor visits out of reach, according to\u00a0research from The Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit that works to promote an equitable health care system.",
      "These extra costs, for which Medicare beneficiaries are on the hook, make it harder for older Americans to access affordable care relative to their peers in nine other countries, the group found. Researchers compared coverage for older adults in the U.S. to health care systems in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.",
      "Nearly one in four older adults in the U.S. spent at least $2,000 in out-of-pocket expenses last year, compared to less than 5% of older adults in France and the Netherlands who spent that much, The Commonwealth Fund found. Only in Switzerland did older adults report spending more on health care than those in the U.S.",
      "\"The reason to focus on this population is because in the U.S. nearly every adult over 65 has Medicare,\" Munira Z. Gunja, senior researcher for international health policy and practice innovations at The Commonwealth Fund told CBS MoneyWatch. While the U.S. stands out as \"the only high-income country without a universal health system,\" when it comes to the over-65 population, \"at least, we are on par with other countries,\" she said.",
      "Does Medicare fall short?",
      "But the study suggests that the kind of coverage Medicare plans provide isn't meeting many Americans' needs. Eight percent of older adults in the U.S., more than any other wealthy country except Austria, reported delaying or forgoing medical care because of costs. And there are repercussions to not getting the care one needs: One-third of older U.S. adults who said they faced cost-related barriers to accessing care reported being either in fair or poor health.",
      "\"We find that while nearly every older adult has Medicare coverage, it is still more expensive than what older adults in other nations face, and because of that, older adults in the U.S. are more likely to skip care,\" Gunja said. \"When they need prescription drugs, they are more likely to skip getting those too.\"",
      "Oftentimes, for example, Medicare Advantage members find themselves seeing out-of-network doctors, which exposes them to \"a ton of health care costs,\" according to Gunja.",
      "One exception",
      "There's one area in which Medicare beneficiaries faced few out-of-pocket costs and, as a result, were less likely to skip care \u2014 mental health treatment. Less than 5% of residents in all nations skipped mental health care over affordability concerns. The stat illustrates that when treatment is affordable, patients are more inclined to seek out the care they need, according to Gunja.",
      "\"It's a benefit that's offered on all health plans, and we see what happens when people don't need to spend as much on a service,\" she said.",
      "Solutions?",
      "When older people skip or delay care, their health can worsen, leading to sicker patients, who tend to require more costly care. That in turn drives up federal Medicare spending, according to The Commonwealth Fund.",
      "Gunja suggests that the U.S. can look to other countries for solutions that make health care more affordable for older adults. Some examples include capping out-of-pocket expenses and fully covering hospital and physician services.",
      "\"Across the board, the U.S. generally comes out last for most measures when it comes to affordability measures,\" Gunja said. \"Getting health insurance is absolutely necessary. But it's only the first step. We need to make sure coverage is not just comprehensive, but also affordable.\"",

But data center critics say the incentives aren't enough to counteract the consequences of building the facilities so close to homes.",
      "Tyler Ray, a leader in the fight against the Virginia project, worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by 2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help power the data centers' hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere.",
      "Ray and his neighbors tried to stop the development, but their efforts were largely unsuccessful. The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project was exempt.",
      "\"I don't know how a general resident, even someone who has been engaging intently on an issue, has any chance to go up against the data center industry,\" Ray said the night the supervisors voted.",
      "For local governments, attracting data centers to their municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in 2024 that Virginia's current data centers brought in $1 billion in tax revenue.",
      "For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of direct jobs \u2013 often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently that its investment in nearby Loudoun County, which included two data centers, created around 150 direct jobs, a figure that data center opponents say isn't worth the hassle. But data center advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction, technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730 indirect jobs.",
      "Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax County should reap the benefits.",
      "\"I have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the big picture,\" Smith said. \"Data centers are not going away.\"",
      "On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the 4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia river.",
      "Last year, AWS paid roughly $34 million in property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a $66 million tax break. Those payments, in addition to $1.7 in charitable donations from the company in 2023, have been instrumental in updating infrastructure and bolstering services. These funds have gone toward a new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer and $5,000 grants for homebuyers so far totaling at least $2.8 million.",
      "\"This road right here? Wouldn't happen if it wasn't for AWS,\" said Boardman Mayor Paul Keefer, riding in the passenger seat of Police Chief Rick Stokoe's cruiser, pointing out the window at construction workers shifting dirt and laying pavement.",
      "AWS has cultivated relationships with local officials including Keefer and Stokoe, who have both been in positions to vote on whether to authorize tax breaks with the company. Some former county commissioners and residents worry that those relationships are too cozy.",
      "Kevin Miller, AWS's vice president of global data centers, said in an interview with the Associated Press that \"our interest is in being a model corporate citizen, to really be partners with those communities.\"",
      "Skepticism of the deals started years ago, when three formerly elected officials allegedly helped approve data center deals while also owning a stake in a company that contracted with AWS to provide fiber optic cables for the data centers. In June, they each paid $2,000 to settle an ethics complaint.",
      "Those officials are no longer in office. But the latest data center deal struck between Morrow County officials and AWS, which gives the company an estimated $1 billion in tax breaks spread over the 15 years to build five new data centers, again raised eyebrows.",
      "Two former Morrow County Commissioners, Jim Doherty and Melissa Lindsay, pushed unsuccessfully in 2022 for AWS to pay more in taxes in new data center negotiations.",
      "\"We didn't want to blow it up. We didn't want to run them off,\" said Lindsay. \"But there were better deals to be made.\"",

    "summary": "At least 364 pertussis cases were reported, marking the worst Thanksgiving week on record.",
    "story": [
      "At least 364 pertussis infections were reported to health authorities last week, according to figures published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, marking the worst Thanksgiving week for whooping cough in recent decades.",
      "This tops the previous Thanksgiving record of 228 cases of pertussis which were reported for the week ending Nov. 27, 2010. That year there were 27,550 cases reported by the end of 2010, below the 28,167 already tallied so far this year.",
      "Thanksgiving usually sees a slowdown in cases reported across most diseases, because of delays in testing and reporting around the holiday as well as changes in people going to the doctor.",
      "But this year's whooping cough wave is continuing to accelerate in several states this week, including in Ohio, which reported 84 cases. That is the most of any state, and more than the 67 pertussis cases that Ohio reported in the week before.",
      "\"Pertussis can be cyclical. After seeing lower numbers of reported cases in the past few years \u2014 during and after the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 nationally, pertussis is now returning to pre-pandemic trends. Ohio is no different,\" a spokesperson for Ohio's health department said in a statement.",
      "The Ohio spokesperson said this year's increase remained \"consistent with some years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,\" and has yet to top the total number of cases reported in 2013.",
      "While total cases nationwide remain lower than some previous records, the pace of weekly reported cases reached 577 ahead of Thanksgiving \u2014 more than 10 times the same time last year, and the worst in at least a decade.",
      "Health officials have cited a variety of factors for this year's wave of whooping cough cases, including gaps in immunity from vaccination or prior infection and the switch to safer but less effective vaccines in the 1990s.",
      "\"We have to acknowledge that our vaccination rates, in Montgomery County for school-age children, are low. They've decreased since the pandemic, and they're lower than the state of Ohio, and lower than the United States as well,\" said Dr. Becky Thomas, medical director of the health department for Ohio's Montgomery County.",
      "Within Ohio, Montgomery County makes up the largest share of cases reported in recent months, despite not having the most people in the state.",
      "Around 63% of their cases have been in schoolchildren and 12% are in daycares, Thomas said. The department often finds out about outbreaks first from school nurses, warning of large numbers of kids calling out sick with whooping cough.",
      "Thomas said doctors have been seeing high pertussis case counts for months, larger than the wave they saw last year.",
      "\"We had an increase in cases last fall, but nothing compared to this fall. And when we first started noticing a really significant increase was about the time that kids went back to school, so about the middle of August,\" said Thomas.",
      "Thomas said that the vast majority of reported cases in the county have said they were vaccinated for pertussis, though it is unclear if everyone was up-to-date on the shots. A third of cases have been in teens, who are recommended to have gotten a booster dose by age 12.",
      "\"We have specific data on vaccination records for entering seventh graders that shows those vaccination rates for that tetanus, whooping cough vaccine that they should have entering school are decreased,\" said Thomas.",
      "This year's whooping cough surge also comes as health departments are bracing for the return of an expected wave of COVID-19 and flu infections this winter.",
      "\"Whooping cough isn't the only respiratory illness that we're concerned about. So we're encouraging people to stay home when they're sick, practice good hand hygiene, get their health care provider if they need to if they're symptoms are worsening or severe, and of course get vaccinated,\" said Jennifer Wentzel, the county health department's commissioner.",

    "summary": "Anthem will reverse a policy that would have capped insurance coverage for anesthesia after objections from doctors and lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield said Thursday that the health insurance provider is reversing a policy that was set to go into effect in February of that would have limited anesthesia coverage during surgeries and other procedures, a change that had prompted an outcry from some physicians and lawmakers.",
      "The policy, which would have covered Anthem's plans in Connecticut, New York and Missouri, was disclosed in recent weeks, with the company's New York unit posting a\u00a0notice on Dec. 1. The policy would have excluded people under 22 years old and maternity care.",
      "According to the original policy statement, Anthem had said it would pay only for anesthesia treatments for the length of time that a procedure or surgery is estimated to require based on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's physician work time values. The insurer noted that claims for anesthesia \"above the established number of minutes will be denied.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News on Thursday, Anthem said it was backing away from the policy, and added there had been \"widespread misinformation about an update to our anesthesia policy.\"",
      "\"As a result, we have decided to not proceed with this policy change,\" an Anthem spokesperson wrote in an email. \"To be clear, it never was and never will be the policy of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to not pay for medically necessary anesthesia services. The proposed update to the policy was only designed to clarify the appropriateness of anesthesia consistent with well-established clinical guidelines.\"",
      "Before the announcement of Anthem's reversal, the plan had drawn criticism from medical professionals as well as Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, who wrote on social media on Wednesday that the plan is \"appalling.\"",
      "\"Saddling patients with thousands of dollars in surprise additional medical debt.   And for what? Just to boost corporate profits?\" Murphy wrote. \"Reverse this decision immediately.\"",
      "Connecticut Comptroller Sean Scanlon told the Hartford Courant Thursday that the policy would not take place in his state after negotiating with the insurer.",
      "\"After hearing from people across the state about this concerning policy, my office reached out to Anthem, and I'm pleased to share this policy will no longer be going into effect here in Connecticut,\" Scanlon told the newspaper.",
      "\"Appalling behavior by commercial health insurers\"",
      "In a statement last month, the American Society of Anesthesiologists also called on Anthem to reverse the policy.",
      "\"With this new policy, Anthem will arbitrarily pre-determine the time allowed for anesthesia care during a surgery or procedure,\" the group said. \"If an anesthesiologist submits a bill where the actual time of care is longer than Anthem's limit, Anthem will deny payment for the anesthesiologist's care.\"",
      "The insurer's new policy could result in denials of coverage to patients who might need more anesthesia because their surgery is difficult or unusual, or if a complication occurs, the group added.",
      "\"This is just the latest in a long line of appalling behavior by commercial health insurers looking to drive their profits up at the expense of patients and physicians providing essential care,\" said Donald E. Arnold, an anesthesiologist and president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. \"This egregious policy breaks the trust between Anthem and its policyholders who expect their health insurer to pay physicians for the entirety of the care they need.\"",

      "Israel has repeatedly rejected accusations of genocide in Gaza, insisting that it has a right to defend itself after the Palestinian territory's Hamas rulers carried out their brutal attack on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage. Since the start of the war in Gaza, at least 44,580 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military offensive, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry, and most of its residents have been internally displaced.",

Month after month, Israel has treated Palestinians in Gaza as a subhuman group unworthy of human rights and dignity, demonstrating its intent to physically destroy them. Our damning findings must serve as a wake-up call to the international community: this is genocide. It must stop now.\"",

    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French Prime Minister Michel Barnier on Thursday was meeting Emmanuel Macron to submit his resignation after losing a vote of no confidence in parliament, with the president urgently seeking ways to halt growing political and financial chaos. Poised to be contemporary France's shortest-serving premier, Barnier arrived at the Elysee Palace just after 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. Eastern) for the resignation formality, with the outgoing premier and government constitutionally obliged to step down after the defeat in parliament.",
      "A majority of lawmakers supported the no-confidence vote Wednesday that was proposed by the hard-left and backed by the far-right, headed by Marine Le Pen.",
      "Barnier's record-quick ejection comes after snap parliamentary elections this summer that resulted in a hung parliament, with no political force able to form an overall majority and the far-right holding the key to the government's survival.",
      "The trigger for Barnier's ouster was his 2025 budget plan including austerity measures that were unacceptable to a majority in parliament, but that he argued were necessary to stabilize France's finances. On Monday he had forced through a social security financing bill without a vote.",
      "The successful no-confidence motion cancelled the government's entire financing plan, leading to an automatic renewal of the current budget into next year, unless any new government can somehow rush through approval of a new budget by Christmas \u2014 an unlikely scenario.",
      "\"France probably won't have a 2025 budget,\" said ING Economics in a note, predicting that the country \"is entering a new era of political instability.\"",
      "Moody's, a ratings agency, warned that Barnier's fall \"deepens the country's political stalemate\" and \"reduces the probability of a consolidation of public finances.\"",
      "The Paris stock exchange fell at the opening on Thursday before recovering to show small gains, while the yields on French government bonds were again under upward pressure in debt markets.",
      "Macron now has the unenviable task of picking a viable successor. The president was to address the nation Thursday evening, his office said. Macron has more than two years of his presidential term left, but some opponents are calling on him to resign, too.",
      "National Assembly Speaker Yael Braun-Pivet on Thursday urged Macron to waste no time in choosing a new premier, saying France could not be allowed to \"drift\" for any length of time.",
      "There was no indication early Thursday of how quickly Macron would appoint Barnier's successor, nor what their political leanings might be.",
      "Loyalist Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu and Macron's centrist ally Francois Bayrou have been touted as possible contenders, as has former Socialist premier and interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve.",
      "With the support of the far-right, a majority of 331 MPs in the 577-member chamber voted to oust the government on Wednesday night. It was the first successful no-confidence vote since a defeat for Georges Pompidou's government in 1962, when Charles de Gaulle was president.",
      "Macron flew back into Paris just ahead of the vote after wrapping up a three-day state visit to Saudi Arabia, an apparent world away from the domestic crisis.",

      "Laurent Wauquiez, the head of right-wing deputies in parliament, said the far-right and hard-left bore the responsibility for a no-confidence vote.",
      "Barnier is the fifth prime minister to serve under Macron since he came to power in 2017, with every premier serving a successively shorter period.",
      "Given the composition of the National Assembly, there is no guarantee that Barnier's successor will last any longer.",

    "summary": "A court handwriting expert may have helped reveal true identity of a leading Byzantine painter.",
    "story": [
      "Crime-solving techniques applied to a medieval illuminated manuscript in Paris may have solved a centuries-old puzzle - the true identity of a leading Byzantine painter who injected humanity into the rigid sanctity of Orthodox religious art.",
      "A contemporary of Giotto, considered the father of Western painting, the artist conventionally known as Manuel Panselinos was equally influential in a totally different tradition that's largely overlooked in the West.",
      "But nothing is known of his life, and scholars now believe Panselinos was just a nickname that eventually supplanted the real name of the man for whom it was coined - likely Ioannis Astrapas, from the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki.",
      "The art of Byzantium, that decorates churches across Greece, Serbia and other Orthodox countries, stands out for the stark formalism of its elongated, glowering saints, quasi-cubist mountains and doe-eyed Madonnas.",
      "Work attributed to Panselinos, from the late 13th and early 14th centuries, is considered the finest produced in an empire that straddled Europe and Asia and endured from the fall of Rome until the capture of the imperial capital Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks in 1453.",
      "Art historians had long suspected that the name - Greek for \"full moon\" - could have originated as a nickname for some member of the so-called Macedonian School of painting, based in Thessaloniki.",
      "Recent research by a Greek monk and linguistics scholar linked \"Panselinos\" with Macedonian School painter Astrapas. Now court handwriting expert Christina Sotirakoglou has matched lettering on a manuscript tentatively attributed to Astrapas with characters on a church painting in northern Greece, long seen as Panselinos' best work.",
      "Father Cosmas Simonopetritis, a former senior administrator in Mount Athos, the semiautonomous monastic community where the Protato church stands, says Sotirakoglou's and his own research \"clearly prove\" Panselinos' real identity.",
      "\"Panselinos was a real person, and (the name) was just the nickname by which Ioannis Astrapas became known,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "Constantinos Vafiadis, a professor of Byzantine art in Athens who was not involved in the studies, said he found merit in the nickname theory and Astrapas link, even though it appeared more than one painter had undertaken the Protato project.",
      "\"I agree with attributing part of the paintings to Ioannis Astrapas,\" he said. \"But again there remains much ground for future research into that person, because other Mount Athos monuments from the same period have not yet been sufficiently published.\"",
      "\"Panselinos\" - a role model for generations of painters - and his contemporaries are associated with a renaissance of kinds in Orthodox art that revived forms and techniques inherited from antiquity. Facial expressions acquired a deeper humanity, and greater attention was paid to proportion and depth of field in composition.",
      "Father Cosmas said Astrapas was an \"extremely gifted painter ... with vast knowledge who harmonically combined the ancient, classical world with Orthodox Byzantine spirituality.\"",
      "\"And that ... makes his work unique worldwide,\" he added.",
      "Artists' signatures were not common at the time, although some survive from members of the Astrapas family. There are none by \"Panselinos.\"",
      "The trail started with earlier research linking Astrapas with the artist and scholar who wrote and illustrated Marcian Codex GR 516, an early 14th century Greek handwritten text treating subjects from astronomy to music theory. Among the painted illustrations was a full moon.",
      "\"For me ... that was the main proof,\" Father Cosmas said.",
      "With a name found for the hand that produced the manuscript, the next step was to check its style against writing on the Protato painting, traditionally linked with \"Panselinos.\"",
      "\"Mrs. Sotirakoglou, who is a handwriting expert, filled in that blank,\" Father Cosmas said.",
      "There was one problem: Women have for more than 1,000 years been banned from entering Mount Athos.",
      "\"I was forced to study the Protato paintings based on photographs,\" Sotirakoglou, who works as a court consultant on identifying or authenticating handwriting in criminal cases, told the AP.",
      "\"(The work) was very difficult, because the writing on the wall paintings is in capital letters, and the painters subdued their personal handwriting to conform\" with the traditional format, she said - rather like anonymous letter-writers' attempts to disguise their true style. \"The Marcian codex is written in very small lower-case letters.\"",
      "The first clue came from the Greek letter Phi, the English F.",
      "\"It's a Phi that stands out, and is similar\" in both the manuscript and the Protato painting, she said. \"Matches also followed with other letters, T, with its proportions, which is bigger, covering the other letters and is topped with a curve, the proportions of the K.\"",
      "\"But when the Phi was revealed, the code of the writing was broken and the job became much easier,\" she added.",
      "Father Cosmas said that during his administrative duties on Mount Athos he attended services at the Protato church on a daily basis.",
      "\"That's where my desire was born ... to explore the mystery around the name and the identity of Panselinos,\" he said, adding that he thinks the artist \"has now acquired his true identity.\"",

    "story": [
      "Mexican soldiers and marines have seized over a ton of fentanyl pills in two raids in the north, with officials calling it the biggest catch of the synthetic opioid in the country's history.",
      "The raids came after a sharp drop in fentanyl seizures in Mexico earlier this year, and days after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatened to impose 25% tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico unless those countries cracked down on the flow of migrants and drugs across the border.",
      "Experts say the timing may not be a coincidence.",
      "\"It is clear that the Mexican government has been managing the timing of fentanyl seizures,\" said security analyst David Saucedo. \"But under the pressure by Donald Trump, it appears President Claudia Sheinbaum's administration is willing to the increase the capture of drug traffickers and drug seizures that Washington is demanding.\"",
      "Saucedo said it's clear the Mexican government \"doesn't see fentanyl as one of its own problems, and fighting it isn't its priority,\" He added there would only be big busts \"when there is pressure from Washington.\"",
      "Mexico's top security official said soldiers and marines late Tuesday spotted two men carrying guns in the northern state of Sinaloa, home to the drug cartel of the same name.",
      "They chased the men, who ran into two houses. In one house soldiers found about 660 pounds of fentanyl, and in the other a truck packed with about 1,750 pounds of the drug, mostly in pill form.",
      "\"In Sinaloa, we achieved the biggest seizure in history of fentanyl,\" Public Safety Secretary Omar Garcia Harfuch wrote in his social media accounts. Several guns were also seized and two men were arrested.",
      "President Sheinbaum said Wednesday that \"this is an investigation that had been going on for some time, and yesterday it bore fruit.\"",
      "But that claim contrasts with the seemingly random nature of the bust, which started when a military patrol \"noticed the presence of two men carrying what appeared to be guns.\"",
      "In the past, Mexican security forces have sometimes used the story of following armed men running into houses as a pretext to enter homes without search warrants. In at least one case, the government version was disproved by security camera footage.",
      "The latest haul was striking because fentanyl seizures in Mexico had fallen dramatically in the first half of the year. At some points during the summer, under former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, federal forces reported seizures amounted to as little as 50 grams (2 ounces) per week.",
      "Figures for the first half of 2024 show that Mexican federal forces seized only 286 pounds (130 kilograms) of fentanyl nationwide between January and June, down 94% from the 5,135 pounds (2,329 kilograms) seized in 2023.",
      "The synthetic opioid has been blamed for about 70,000 overdose deaths annually in the United States, and U.S. officials have tried to step up efforts to seize it as it comes over the border, often in the form of counterfeit pills made in Mexico from precursor chemicals largely imported from China.",
      "As \"60 Minutes\" reported, the fentanyl crisis began 10 years ago when the cartels started to wrestle control of the supply chain from China, purchasing the drug's precursor chemicals to make fentanyl themselves in clandestine labs in Mexico. In 2019, China \"scheduled,\" or blocked, finished fentanyl from being exported to the U.S., further cementing the cartels' domination of the pipeline.",
      "L\u00f3pez Obrador always denied that fentanyl is even produced in Mexico, though experts - and even members of his own administration - acknowledge that it is.",
      "And if Mexico doesn't go after those fentanyl production facilities, then they will still be churning out similar quantities in the future.",
      "\"It's a very very big seizure,\" Saucedo said. \"But if they don't dismantle the labs, this kind of production will continue.\"",
      "Also Wednesday, the U.S. State Department announced it was increasing the reward for the top leader of another cartel, Nemesio Oseguera, from $10 million to $15 million.",

The kidnappers decided to throw his body into the sea after he died, the relative said.",

      "Eastman traveled out of the Philippines and returned to Sibuco to attend his wife's graduation when he was kidnapped. He had been posting YouTube and Facebook videos of his life in Sibuco, a poor, remote coastal town, where the suspects spotted him, police said earlier.",
      "They said the suspects appeared to be common criminals who did not belong to any Muslim rebel groups which have been accused of ransom kidnappings in the past.",
      "Security problems have long hounded the southern Philippines, the homeland of a Muslim minority in the largely Roman Catholic nation.",
      "The southern third of the Philippines has bountiful resources but has long been hamstrung by poverty, insurgencies and outlaws.",
      "On his YouTube page, Eastman said he came to the Philippines and met \"the love of my life deep in the mountains\" of Zamboanga del Norte, which he said he would be exploring to offer followers a glimpse of \"day to day life as the first and only foreigner\" to take up permanent residence in the remote region.",
      "A 2014 peace agreement between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the largest of several Muslim separatist groups, has considerably eased widespread fighting in the south. Relentless military offensives have weakened smaller armed groups such as the Abu Sayyaf, reducing kidnappings, bombings and other violence.",
      "The Abu Sayyaf has targeted Americans and other Western tourists and missionaries, most of whom were freed after ransoms were paid. A few were killed, including American Guillermo Sobero, who was beheaded on the southern island of Basilan, and a U.S. missionary, Martin Burnham, who was killed while Philippine army forces were trying to rescue him and his wife, Gracia Burnham, in 2002 in a rainforest near Sibuco.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 20:16:13 -0500",
    "summary": "The Israeli military said its aircraft struck senior Hamas militants involved in terrorist activities in the area.",
    "story": [
      "Israeli airstrikes tore through a tent camp for displaced Palestinians in southern Gaza on Wednesday, sparking fires and killing at least 21 people, according to the head of a nearby hospital, in the latest assault on a sprawling tent city that Israel designated a humanitarian safe zone but has repeatedly targeted. A spokesman for Gaza's civil defense agency said five children were killed in the strike.",
      "The Israeli military said it struck senior Hamas militants involved in terrorist activities in the area, without providing additional details, and said it took precautions to minimize harm to civilians.",
      "The strike on the Muwasi tent camp was one of several deadly assaults across the Gaza Strip on Wednesday. An Israeli attack in central Gaza killed at least 10 more people, including four children, according to Palestinian medics.",
      "Israel's devastating war in Gaza, launched after Hamas' October 2023 attack, shows no signs of ending after nearly 14 months. Hamas is still holding dozens of Israeli hostages, and most of Gaza's population has been displaced and is reliant on international food aid to survive. Israel is also pressing a major offensive in the isolated north, where experts say Palestinians might be experiencing famine.",
      "The Biden administration has pledged to make a new push for a Gaza ceasefire now that there's a truce in Lebanon between Israel and the militant group Hezbollah, ending more than a year of cross-border fighting. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump demanded this week the release of hostages held by Hamas before he is sworn into office in January.",
      "Wednesday's strike in Muwasi \u2014 a desolate area with few public services that holds hundreds of thousands of displaced people \u2014 wounded at least 28 people, according to Atif al-Hout, the director of Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis.",
      "An Associated Press journalist at the hospital counted at least 15 bodies, but said reaching a precise number was difficult because many of the dead were dismembered and some were badly burned.",
      "\"It was like doomsday,\" said a wounded woman, Iman Jumaa, who held back tears as she described how the strike killed her father, her brothers and her brothers' children.",
      "Videos and photos of the strike shared widely on social media showed flames and a column of black smoke rising into the night sky, as well as twisted metal tent frames and shredded fabric. Palestinian men searched through the still-burning wreckage, shouting, \"Over here guys!\" Further away, civilians stood at a distance, observing the destruction.",
      "The military said the strikes had set off secondary blasts, indicating explosives present in the area had detonated. It was not possible to independently confirm the Israeli claims, and the strikes could also have ignited fuel, cooking gas canisters or other materials in the camp.",
      "Shortly after the strike, Al-Awda Hospital said two people had been killed and 38 wounded in an attack on a residential block in the Nuseirat refugee camp. The military had no immediate comment on the strike, but said earlier strikes in central Gaza had hit \"terrorist targets.\"",
      "Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames Hamas for their deaths, saying the militants often operate in residential areas and are known to position tunnels, rocket launchers and other infrastructure near homes, schools and mosques.",
      "Previous Israeli strikes on tent camps in Gaza have drawn widespread international outrage, such as when a wounded student's last moments were caught on video as he burned to death in a tent outside a hospital.",
      "In northern Gaza, dozens of Palestinian families said Israel's expanding offensive had forcibly displaced them from schools-turned-shelters. Associated Press footage showed people on the road Wednesday leaving Beit Lahia, many crowded onto donkey carts with their belongings in their arms. Others walked on foot.",
      "\"This morning a quadcopter (drone) detonated four bombs at the school. There were people injured, human remains \u2014 we left with nothing,\" said Sadeia al-Rahel.",
      "The 57-year-old said her family has been eating grass, leaves, and animal feed for two months due to the lack of food aid in the north.",
      "The amount of aid entering Gaza plunged in October, and hunger is widespread across the territory, even in central Gaza where aid groups have more access. Humanitarian organizations say Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order make it difficult to deliver assistance. Israel has said it is working to increase the flow of aid.",
      "Israel's offensive has killed over 44,500 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "The Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on southern Israel killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and around 250 people were abducted. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "On Wednesday, Israel said its forces recovered the body of a hostage who was captured alive during the Oct. 7 attack. Israel believes Itay Svirsky was killed by his captors.",
      "The families of hostages held in Gaza have grown increasingly concerned that their loved ones are at risk so long as the war continues. Israel's military released on Wednesday the findings of a probe into the circumstances behind the deaths of six hostages whose bodies were recovered in August, determining they were probably shot by their captors after a nearby Israeli strike in February.",

    "title": "South Korean leader faces likely impeachment over martial law order",
    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 20:06:48 -0500",
    "summary": "South Korea is reeling over a shock martial law declaration by President Yoon Suk Yeol, whose short-lived gamble will have major implications.",
    "story": [
      "Seoul\u00a0\u2014 South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol seemed to treat a declaration of martial law as if it were a light switch, flipping it on at 11 p.m. Tuesday night, only to be unanimously rebuked in an emergency session of the country's parliament just two hours later. It took him about three hours from that point to accept defeat and announce that he was lifting the martial law order.",
      "The martial law declaration and revocation within six hours was the fiercest whiplash between military control and democracy that South Korea has endured since it became a democracy in 1987. It appears highly likely to bring a swift end to Yoon's two-year tenure as the country's elected leader.",
      "The president's gamble seemed rooted primarily in his own domestic political isolation and, while short-lived, it was sure to have major ramifications both for Yoon as a politician, and for South Korea as a nation.",
      "Below is a look at what Yoon did, why he did it, and what it could mean for one of Asia's most vibrant democracies and biggest economies.",
      "What is martial law?",
      "A declaration of martial law is typically used by political or military leaders in a country facing a purported immediate threat to stability or security. It is ostensibly intended to protect the rule of law and citizens by putting military forces in immediate control of a country, suspending the authority of a civilian government and legal system.",
      "Yoon's order immediately put South Korea's military in charge of security across the country, froze virtually all existing laws and granted the forces extraordinary powers to detain people without charge and to censor the media.",
      "There was no indication that South Korean troops took advantage of the powers granted to them during the six hours of martial law on Tuesday evening, though there were tense scuffles as forces blocked access to the parliament building and throngs of angry citizens turned up to protest Yoon's sudden move.",
      "Why did South Korea's president impose martial law?",
      "\"I declared martial law at 11:00 last night with a firm will to save the country against anti-state forces that are trying to paralyze the essential functions of the state and destroy the constitutional order of liberal democracy,\" Yoon told his nation in a televised address, claiming the declaration would protect south Korea from a \"threat of the North Korean communist forces.\"",
      "But he never identified any specific military movements by the North, and his shock move appeared to have been directed more at what he called the \"legislative dictatorship\" of his own country's opposition Democratic Party.",
      "Yoon has seen his approval rating fall for several months, and with the opposition in control of the parliament for the last two years, he's struggled to move forward any of his political objectives. He's also faced criticism for dismissing multiple calls for independent investigations into financial scandals involving himself and his wife.",
      "He complained Tuesday that the opposition had effectively left him unable to govern, including by proposing nearly two dozen impeachment motions against his conservative government and slashing his national budget by at least $700 billion dollars.",
      "But despite Yoon's political isolation and falling support among voters, few in the country anticipated a counterattack as dramatic as the declaration of martial law.",
      "What will the martial law declaration mean for South Korea?",
      "In an early indication of the huge impact of Yoon's move, South Korea's Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun offered his resignation Wednesday, expressing regret \"for causing confusion and concern to the public regarding martial law.\"",
      "In a statement from his office, Kim said he took \"full responsibility for all matters related to martial law,\" excusing rank and file troops who he said had merely \"performed their duties\" under his orders.",
      "\"Martial law has been lifted and the public is returning to their daily lives, but the domestic political and security situations are not easy,\" Kim said in the statement, adding that the ministry would \"make every effort to manage current issues stably while ensuring that there are no disruptions in national defense operations.\"",
      "The White House, in a statement late Tuesday in Washington, expressed relief that Yoon had rescinded his martial law declaration.",
      "\"Democracy is at the foundation of the U.S.-ROK alliance, and we will continue to monitor the situation,\" an administration spokesperson said, referring to South Korea by the initials of its official name, the Republic of Korea.",
      "\"Whichever way this shakes out, this is a major setback for what has been seen as a democratic stronghold in the Asia Pacific for the last 44 years,\" said CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, a former senior Homeland Security official.",
      "\"The overall perception of South Korea as a stable democracy has been tarnished at a time when an aggressive China and overall retrenchment from democracy globally are big concerns for U.S. national security,\" said Vinograd, who's now the geopolitical lead at the Brunswick Group think tank in Washington.",
      "Washington has a deeply vested interest in stability in South Korea. About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in the country, largely to deter any aggression by nuclear-armed North Korea, but also as a deterrent against an increasingly assertive China.",
      "South Korea's capital Seoul lies just 30 miles south of the Demilitarized Zone \u2014 the no-man's land created to separate the North and South when an armistice ended combat in the Korean War in 1953. The two countries technically remain at war as there was never a formal treaty, and tension between the Koreas has escalated in recent years, including under Yoon, who's taken a harder line on the North than his predecessor.",
      "\"The Biden administration is going to be faced with some very difficult decisions about what to say and do,\" said Vinograd. \"South Korea is one of our closest allies, but this move seems to have come as a surprise to the White House.\"",
      "\"South Korea is a strong balancing factor against North Korea and against communist China,\" Vinograd said, adding that both the North and Moscow \"are likely cheering the democratic upheaval in South Korea.\"",
      "\"They see any signs of instability in South Korea as something that they can take advantage of,\" she said. \"Without a vibrant democracy in South Korea, forces within China, within North Korea, will likely feel emboldened, and overall, democratic tendencies in the Asia Pacific will likely take a hit as well.\"",
      "Yoon faces calls to resign, threat of impeachment",
      "Yoon looked increasingly likely to lose his job Wednesday after his seemingly dramatic miscalculation of political support.",
      "The Democratic Party called quickly for Yoon to step down or face impeachment, and along with five smaller opposition parties, it submitted a bill in parliament Wednesday to impeach the president, with voting expected on the measure Friday or Saturday.",
      "\"It was clearly revealed to the entire nation that President Yoon could no longer run the country normally. He should step down,\" senior Democratic Party lawmaker Park Chan-dae said in a statement, urging Yoon not to wait to be forced out.",
      "South Korea's parliament, the National Assembly, can impeach the president if over two-thirds of lawmakers vote in favor of the move. If it happens and he doesn't resign first, South Korea's constitutional court will then hold a trial to either confirm or deny the impeachment motion. Six of the nine justices on the court must back an impeachment for it to go ahead.",
      "Yoon's PPP holds 108 seats in the 300-member legislature, but even his own party appeared unlikely to back the embattled president too robustly. Its leader called Wednesday for Yoon's entire cabinet to resign, and the unanimous vote overruling his martial law declaration was a clear indication of the level of opposition to his conduct.",
      "South Korean stocks tumble after martial law declaration",
      "The streets of Seoul appeared largely normal Wednesday despite the overnight tumult. While police were out in force amid renewed protests against Yoon around the parliament, the usual morning rush hour traffic choked roads and railways.",
      "More protests were expected, however, and South Korea's biggest labor union coaltion, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, declared a nationwide strike and said it would hold a rally in the capital until Yoon left office.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Seoul urged American nationals in the city to avoid areas where protests were taking place, and some of the country's biggest employers, including the LG Electronics brand, urged employees to work from home.",
      "The unrest also took a toll on Asian stocks, with South Korean shares falling about 1.4% Wednesday and the country's currency, the won, stable but still close to a two-year low against the dollar.",
      "South Korean Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok and national bank governor Rhee Chang-yong gathered their deputies overnight for emergency meetings, and the finance ministry promised to take whatever measures were necessary to prop up falling share prices, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Reuters said canned goods and staples such as instant noodles and bottled water flew off store shelves overnight as South Koreans feared a possible lingering political crisis.",
      "\"South Korea is no stranger to martial law,\" Vinograd told CBS News, noting that the measure had been declared at least 15 times by various authoritarian regimes since the country's founding in 1948.",
      "\"I'm deeply disturbed by this kind of situation,\" Seoul resident Kim Byeong-In, 39, told Reuters overnight, \"and I'm very concerned about the future of the country.\"",

Yet Barnier's proposed austerity budget \u2014 slashing 40 billion euros ($42 billion) in spending and raising taxes by 20 billion euros \u2014 has only deepened divisions, inflaming tensions in the lower house and triggering this dramatic political confrontation.",
      "Barnier on Monday invoked a rarely used constitutional mechanism to push through the contentious 2025 budget without parliamentary approval, arguing it was essential to maintain \"stability\" amid deep political divisions.",
      "The use of the constitutional tool, called Article 49.3, allows the government to pass legislation without a parliamentary vote but leaves it exposed to no-confidence motions. Opposition leaders argue that Barnier's concessions, including scrapping an electricity tax hike, do not go far enough to address their concerns. The far-right leader Marine Le Pen accused Barnier of ignoring her party's demands.",

    "story": [
      "Manila, Philippines\u00a0\u2014 Chinese coast guard vessels backed by navy ships fired powerful water cannons and blocked and sideswiped a Philippine patrol vessel on Wednesday in renewed aggression at a disputed shoal in the South China Sea, Philippine officials said.",
      "U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines, MaryKay Carlson, condemned China's \"unlawful use of water cannons and dangerous maneuvers,\" accusing Beijing in a social media post of putting \"lives at risk\" by disrupting a Philippine maritime operation.",
      "\"We condemn these actions and stand with our like-minded friends, partners, allies in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific,\" Carlson said.",
      "China claims virtually the entire South China Sea as its territory, but that claim overlaps with the territorial waters, exclusive economic zones and high seas claims of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. Indonesia has also had confrontations with the Chinese coast guard, which backs Beijing's fishing fleets.",
      "The long-simmering territorial disputes between China and America's allies and other Asian nations are a delicate fault line in the regional rivalry between Washington and Beijing. The U.S. lays no claims in the South China Sea, which is a key global shipping route, but has declared that freedom of navigation and overflight, and the peaceful resolution of the conflicts, are among its core national interests.",

      "Three Philippine coast guard and bureau of fisheries vessels were on routine patrol to protect Filipino fishermen at Scarborough Shoal when several Chinese coast guard and navy ships approached and staged \"aggressive actions\" after dawn, the Philippine coast guard said.",
      "Liu Dejun, a spokesperson for China's Coast Guard, said four Philippine ships had \"dangerously approached\" the coast guard's \"normal law enforcement patrol vessels,\" forcing the Chinese forces to \"exercise control\" around the Scarborough Shoal, which China claims as its territory and calls Huangyan Island.",
      "Liu said one of the Philippine craft ignored warnings, making maneuvers that \"seriously threatened\" the safety of a coast guard vessel.",
      "\"We warn the Philippines to immediately stop infringement, provocation and propaganda, otherwise it will be responsible for all consequences,\" he said.",
      "China has increasingly accused the Philippines and other Asian neighbors of violating its sovereignty in contested offshore regions. It has vowed to defend what Beijing considers its territory, despite a 2016 international arbitration decision that invalidated China's historical claims to the waters around Scarborough Shaol.",
      "Despite the Chinese ships' \"reckless\" maneuvers, the Philippine coast guard and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resource said they renewed their \"commitment to protecting the rights and safety of our fishermen within our maritime jurisdiction.\"",
      "\"We will continue to be vigilant in safeguarding our national interests in the West Philippine Sea,\" the two Philippine law enforcement agencies said, using the Philippine name for the seas off the archipelago's western coast.",

      "Since then, each week has brought a grim litany of shootouts, abductions, bodies dumped in the street and vehicles and businesses set alight, sending Culiacan's 800,000 residents scrambling for cover.",
      "The bloodletting began on September 9 after details emerged of how the son of the cartel's jailed founder Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman reportedly double-crossed the cartel's other co-founder, Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada.",
      "Zambada was arrested on U.S. soil on July 25 after allegedly being kidnapped in Mexico and delivered to U.S. authorities against his will.",
      "Zambada claimed he was ambushed by Joaquin Guzman Lopez, one of \"El Chapol\"'s sons, who he said lured him onto a plane that was headed for the United States, where \"El Chapo\" himself is serving a life sentence.",

Bodies have appeared across the city, often left slung out on the streets or in cars with either sombreros on their heads or pizza slices or boxes pegged onto them with knives. The pizzas and sombreros have become informal symbols for the warring cartel factions, underscoring the brutality of their warfare.",

      "The operation ended in humiliation for the government, which was forced to free the drug lord after the cartel launched a massive assault on the city.",
      "While Culiacan recovered quickly from that episode -- and Ovidio was later recaptured -- the succession war now raging within the cartel has brought the local economy to the brink of collapse.",
      "At least 30,000 people have lost their jobs, representing about a third of all social welfare recipients, according to the city's chamber of commerce.",

    "story": [
      "A Chinese national living in California has been arrested and charged by federal law enforcement after he allegedly bought and exported guns and ammunition to North Korea at the direction of North Korean agents who funneled him $2 million to purchase the equipment, according to a newly unsealed criminal complaint.",
      "Shenghua Wen, 41, also admitted to trying to obtain military uniforms in an apparent attempt to help North Korean soldiers disguise themselves and conduct a \"surprise attack\" against South Korea, prosecutors said in an affidavit accompanying the complaint, which was filed on Nov. 26.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Wen came to the U.S. on a student visa in 2012 and lives in Ontario, California. During a series of interviews earlier this year, he allegedly told investigators that he met with North Korean officials in China before coming to the U.S., and they directed him to procure firearms, ammunition and technology on behalf of Pyongyang.",
      "Wen told the FBI he was \"good at smuggling,\" court records said, and he allegedly admitted he shipped two containers of guns in 2023 from Long Beach, California, to Hong Kong, where they were then smuggled into North Korea.",
      "Wen is charged with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on North Korea, which make it illegal to send American money or goods to the country without permission. An attorney for Wen could not immediately be identified.",
      "The affidavit filed in federal court in California revealed that FBI agents recovered 50,000 rounds of ammunition from Wen's car, and he allegedly admitted to having bought the ammo at the direction of North Korean officials. Law enforcement also seized a device used to detect chemical threats and a tool that can detect hidden surveillance devices, according to the affidavit. Investigators said they found photos of firearms and equipment that Wen sent in messages with co-conspirators, some of which they included in the affidavit.",
      "The criminal complaint did not detail the complete extent to which Wen allegedly worked on behalf of North Korea's government, but prosecutors wrote he communicated with his handlers via encrypted messaging apps where the officials directed his conduct and coordinated the smuggling operations.",
      "Wen allegedly bought some of the weapons he sent to North Korea via third-party straw purchasers and told investigators he drove on numerous occasions to Texas to obtain the firearms. To fund the allegedly illegal purchases and international shipments, Wen told authorities the North Korean government funneled about $2 million through a Chinese Bank into bank accounts belonging to Wen's partner, the criminal complaint said.",
      "\"During the interview on September 6, 2024, [Wen] explained that he believed the North Korean government wanted the weapons, ammunition, and other military-related equipment to prepare for an attack against South Korea,\" prosecutors wrote, adding his cellphone also contained numerous photos of U.S. military uniforms, pointing to his intent to ship the uniforms overseas.",
      "The Justice Department has charged other individuals living in the U.S. with similar conduct tied to the North Korean government. In May, federal prosecutors accused an Arizona woman of carrying out a scheme to help North Korean IT workers illegally obtain remote employment with American companies. The group allegedly used the identities of more than 60 individuals who lived in the U.S. to generate nearly $7 million for the North Korean government from more than 300 U.S. companies.",

    "summary": "Former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, now at the nonprofit Young America&apos;s Foundation, sounded off after a Dane County, Wisconsin, judge struck down much of his trademark Act 10 collective bargaining and budget law.",

      "YAF President Scott Walker speaks to Fox News Digital about ruling against Act 10 public unions law.",
      "Former Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker spoke out after a county judge in Madison struck down major parts of a 2011 law geared toward public employee unions.",
      "Dane County Judge Jacob Frost ruled that the provisions of a law known as Act 10, which selectively exempt certain public workers from its restrictions on unionization and collective bargaining, are unconstitutional. The controversial law sought to close a budget deficit by limiting collective bargaining, thereby moderating public workers' benefits that Walker said at the time helped solve a fiscal situation he was required to address.",
      "The original passage in 2011 led to weekslong protests inside the state Capitol, and even saw legislative Democrats flee to neighboring Illinois to prevent Republicans from reaching a quorum to vote on it. Walker later survived a 2012 recall election over the law's passage and rode his success into a decent showing in the 2016 presidential race, where he eventually bowed out of the primary that ultimately went to Donald Trump.",
      "On Tuesday, Walker, who currently leads the conservative-training nonprofit Young America's Foundation (YAF), said his law simply took power \"out of the hands of the big union bosses and put it firmly into the hands of the hardworking taxpayers\u2026\"",
      "\"And what this court decision did as brazen political action was to throw that out and put power back in the hands of those union bosses,\" he said in an interview, calling collective bargaining not a right but an \"expensive entitlement.\"",

      "Frost stripped more than 60 sections of the law from the books.",
      "The law was upheld multiple times at the state and federal levels, Walker replied, adding a new issue is that of a potentially-growing \"liberal activist majority\" on the officially nonpartisan Wisconsin Supreme Court that may hear any appeal of the ruling.",
      "Walker said that if appealed, the first place the case will land is in Waukesha court, which he predicted would overturn Frost. But a subsequent appeal by the left would bring it before the state\u2019s high bench.",
      "\"It\u2019s all the more reason why the Supreme Court race in Wisconsin this spring (2025) is more important than ever,\" he said.",
      "Walker went on to discuss the roots of Act 10, and how it was his way of abiding by Wisconsin\u2019s balanced-budget requirement. He noted the original name was the \"Budget Repair Act\" and that a prior Democratic administration instead chose to cut funding for municipalities, which instead resulted in layoffs.",
      "Instead of risking job loss or Medicare cuts, Walker opted to require public workers to contribute more to their entitlements in return for keeping their pensions solvent.",

    "summary": "President of Restoring Integrity &amp; Trust in Elections Derek Lyons spoke with Fox News Digital regarding the top legal voting battles his group faced ahead of the 2024 election.",
    "story": [
      "Derek Lyons, president of Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections, spoke with Fox News Digital about the top election integrity cases his team took up ahead of the 2024 election.",
      "The 2024 election cycle was rife with repeated legal battles to protect the voting processes from left-wing attorneys leveraging the courts to strip election safeguards, the chief of an election integrity nonprofit who saw a string of legal wins told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"They've been selling American people a lie,\" Restoring Integrity & Trust in Elections (RITE) President Derek Lyons told Fox News Digital in a Zoom interview, referring to left-wing efforts to undermine election laws. \"And I think that these past two election cycles, where people have said \u2018No, voting is very easy and millions, hundreds of millions of people have been doing it,\u2019 have shown that what they're doing is misleading, at the very least.\"",
      "RITE is a\u00a0non-profit organization founded in 2022 following voters\u2019 concern over the security of the 2020 election during the COVID-19 pandemic. The group was co-founded by Fox News contributor Karl Rove and includes board members such as former Attorney General Bill Barr and Fox News contributor Andrew McCarthy. The organization hit the ground running in 2022 to ensure its \"mission of protecting the rule of law in the qualifications for, administration of, and tabulation of voting in the United States,\" according to the group\u2019s website.",
      "Lyons spoke to Fox News Digital just less than a month after Election Day, when he took a victory lap for his team\u2019s battles against efforts to reportedly undermine election integrity, detailing the top legal tactics left-wing activists took during the election season.",

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)",
      "Lyons, an attorney and former White House staff secretary and counselor to the president under President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s first term, explained that Democrat activists were hyper-focused throughout the election on decrying efforts put forth by state legislatures to ensure safe elections, such as voter ID laws, frequently claiming such a policy would disenfranchise voters.",
      "\"\u200b\u200bThe main thing they do is anytime anybody puts up any sort of election integrity measure, whether that's voter I.D., voter photo I.D., whether that's rationalization of cure periods \u2013 the ability of people to fix errors in their ballots sort of after the election \u2013 ballot receipt deadlines, so that we can know the result of the election quickly \u2026 they attack it and say, this is disenfranchising,\" he said.",

      "\"'This makes voting harder \u2026 this takes away people's right to vote.' \u2026. They invoke federal voting rights laws that were meant to prevent the worst abuses of Jim Crow. They're sort of shameless about it. They'll throw any, any tactic at it,\" he explained of Democratic efforts to change voting laws.",
      "People line up outside a polling station located at the McFaul Activity Center in Bel Air, Maryland, during early voting on Oct. 27, 2020. (REUTERS/Hannah McKay)",
      "When groups such as RITE step in to challenge claims that such voting laws are legal and protect elections from illegal activity, Lyons said left-wing activists slam them in court as holding no standing.",
      "\"They try to kick us out on procedural grounds because, ultimately, a lot of times they don't want to defend the merits of what election administrators are trying to do.\"",
      "Lyons pointed to a successful case in Wisconsin back in 2022 when RITE challenged state officials from enabling what he called \"re-voting\" procedures, which entailed absentee voters who already submitted their ballots changing their votes mid-election. RITE challenged the practice and won to ensure that once a ballot is mailed, it cannot be changed.",
      "\"We were able to win that case on the grounds that once a ballot is put into the mail, received by the election officials, that's the end of that person's vote. There's no fishing ballots back out and putting them back in, etc. Which obviously creates a risk of errors and double voting and all sorts of other problems. And so they tried to kick us out on standing. We were able to defeat that and secure that victory in Wisconsin,\" he said.",

      "Pennsylvania was again the premier battleground state this year, with both Trump, Vice President Kamala Harris and a bevy of their respective surrogates criss-crossing the state to rally support ahead of Election Day. For RITE, the group has filed and taken part in 10 different election cases since 2022, including a case revolving around potential double votes.",
      "\"In Philadelphia, we just got them to admit that they had planned to eliminate a crucial check against double voting to make sure that people weren't both voting in the mail and in person. So we had that in place for both elections [the 2022 midterms and 2024 election] to prevent that type of double voting, which does happen in Allegheny County,\" he said of the double vote case.",
      "WHY THE LEFT HATES ELECTION INTEGRITY AND THE SECRET BALLOT",
      "Lyons also celebrated a win in a case he described as the \"crown\u200b\u200b jewel\" of Pennsylvania: ensuring undated and incorrectly dated mail-in ballots were not counted in the official tally.",
      "The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in September that mail-in ballots without the correct dates on ballot envelopes cannot be counted in elections.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a campaign rally at The Alan Horwitz \"Sixth Man\" Center on Oct. 27, 2024 in Philadelphia. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)",
      "The ruling gained widespread attention following Nov. 5, when Democratic-led election boards bucked the state high court's ruling and voted to include such ballots in a recount concerning longtime Democratic Sen. Bob Casey\u2019s race against Sen.-elect Dave McCormick. Democrats in the state openly defied the ruling before the state Supreme Court ordered counties to not include undated ballots, and Democrats walked back their decision.",
      "NEW ELECTION INTEGRITY GROUP WILL POUR MILLIONS INTO PAYING, PROTECTING WHISTLEBLOWERS ON 'FRONT LINES'",
      "\"\u200b\u200bWe took it to state court and got a declaration that this had to be done under state law,\" Lyons said of RITE\u2019s battle against Democratic activists over undated ballot envelopes. \"They ran to federal court and said federal law prevents this. We won that case. They took it to the Court of Appeals. Democrat judges disagreed with them and said the date requirement does not violate federal law. They went back to state court and said, \u2018well, this violates the state constitution.\u2019 That case was procedurally improper. That case was thrown out. And then they tried to bring some other little case that nobody was paying attention to and use that case to revolutionize the way election administration was done in Pennsylvania. And finally, the state Supreme Court, to its great credit, said enough.\"",
      "In Arizona, RITE had another win when it led a coalition of groups against a ballot initiative all the way through the Arizona Supreme Court that Lyons said would have expanded ballot harvesting.",
      "\"One of our first engagements that we're very proud of was, we quickly led a coalition of like-minded groups to litigate against a ballot initiative that was pending \u2026 in Arizona that would have eliminated things like precinct voting, would have expanded opportunities for ballot harvesting. It would have prevented efforts to keep noncitizens off the voter rolls and a host of other, I think, really bad rules for elections,\" he said.",

      "\"We were able to invalidate hundreds of thousands of signatures that the left, the liberal organizations that were pursuing this initiative had, quote unquote, gathered. We invalidated them. We litigated the case up to the Arizona Supreme Court. It actually went back a couple of times. And in the end, that ballot initiative was not approved. And so that meant that the 2022 election, but I think more importantly the 2024 election in Arizona, was not infected by ballot harvesting.\"",
      "When asked if Democrat activists essentially cried uncle amid the avalanche of election lawsuits, Lyons pointed to Democratic Party elections attorney Marc Elias and a case originating out of Ohio as his \"favorite\" example of defeat over liberal attorneys.",
      "VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS SUPPORT PHOTO ID REQUIREMENT TO VOTE, NEW POLL SAYS",
      "\"Marc Elias went to Ohio. Ohio passed a very sensible voter photo ID law. He started out the year in 2024 boasting and proclaiming to all who would listen on Twitter and in the media, that if Ohio passed this law, it will be sued and the law will be struck down. So he went to Ohio, and he did file that lawsuit. He followed through on his threat.\"",
      "\"We showed up, and we defended that lawsuit. We defended against that lawsuit alongside the state. And the victory was complete and total. A Democrat judge appointed by President Clinton, I believe, threw out his entire case, said 'you have not proven at all that there's even a remote chance that any voters are disenfranchised or burdened by this law. Case dismissed. Final judgment.' [Elias] didn't even appeal that case. Didn't even bother to try to take it up to the courts of appeals,\" he recounted.",
      "Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed the voter ID bill into law in January 2023, which mandated voters provide a driver\u2019s license, state ID, passport or military ID when casting a ballot, instead of previous forms of identification such as a bank statement.",
      "Democrats and some residents in the state dubbed it one of the most restrictive ID policies in the nation and the \"worst anti-voter\" bill, arguing it would disenfranchise lower-income voters who have suspended licenses or lacked the required documentation. The Ohio Secretary of State office found over the summer that more than 8,000 voters who tried to cast ballots since the law's passage were not included in final vote tallies as they lacked the proper identification, USA Today previously reported.",
      "Republicans have defended the law as \"an elementary precaution to protect the voting process,\" citing that Americans cannot board a plane or buy alcohol without the same requirement.",
      "A voter arrives at a polling location to cast his ballot in the Michigan Primary Election on Aug. 2, 2022 in Lansing, Michigan. (Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)",
      "Concerns over election integrity have been brewing for years and were underscored during the 2020 election as voters hunkered down amid stay-at-home orders, and mail-in and absentee ballot voting grew. Heading into the 2024 election, a poll from January found\u00a046% of registered Republicans said they had no confidence ballots would be accurately counted and reported, Fox Digital previously reported. On the other hand, 81% of registered Democrats reported in the poll they are \"very\" confident the 2024 elections would be \"fair.\"",
      "Polls focused on specific measures touted by Republicans and conservatives to ensure safe elections have received widespread support across the board. A Gallup Poll released days ahead of Election Day found that 84% of respondents favored requiring voters to provide a photo ID, while 83% said they support providing proof of citizenship when registering to vote for the first time. The poll noted that voter attitudes toward these issues were similar to those seen in its July 2022 poll.",
      "\"Voter photo ID is supported by something like 80% of the country. The notion that this is somehow unconstitutional has been rejected time and time and time again,\" Lyons said.",
      "Looking toward future elections, Lyons said RITE will focus on election laws surrounding left-wing efforts to \"normalize\" noncitizen votes in blue states before such efforts seep into red states, as well as continuing their efforts on voter ID laws, enhancing the integrity of signature matching requirements, and unraveling what Lyons said was left-wing \"lies\" surrounding claims of disenfranchised voters over practices such as voter ID laws.",

      "\"I think our organization was able to do and to plug into a much broader coalition of of groups ,who really care about what I call the crown jewel of the United States of America, which is our elections. That's the key. It's the foundation of our self-government. And I think today we can believe, and we can have confidence, and we can be proud of the fact that they're a little more secure today than they were two years ago and four years ago,\" he said."

      "It then tells you that your parcel is stuck at a distribution center because you need to pay more postage. It asks you to go to a link to pay the fee. And it warns you that you have only 48 hours to do so, or else your package will be returned to the sender. It tries to create a sense of urgency by making you click on the yellow button that says \"SCHEDULE FOR DELIVERY\" in capital letters. Don\u2019t do it!",
      "Fake delivery email. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Fake Rachel Ray Cookware Set scam disguised as Kohl\u2019s email",
      "One of the phishing scams we encountered recently is an email claiming that you've won a Rachel Ray Cucina Cookware Set. This email is particularly deceptive because it appears to come from a reputable retailer, Kohl's, but there are several red flags to watch out for. The email falsely claims to be from \"Kohl's Department\" instead of the official \"Kohl's.\" This slight alteration is a common tactic used by scammers to trick recipients into believing the email is legitimate.",
      "The email's reply-to address is tech@student.lvusd.org, which is clearly unrelated to Kohl's. Official emails from Kohl's would not use a student email address. The message includes phrases like \"You have won a Rachel Ray Cucina Cookware Set\" to create a sense of urgency and excitement, prompting you to click on the provided link without proper verification.",
      "Fake Kohl\u2019s email. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Additional red flags to spot phishing emails",
      "As you can see, phishing emails can be hard to distinguish from genuine ones, especially during the busy holiday season when you may receive many emails from various sources. However, there are some additional red flags beyond the ones we've already mentioned that can help you identify a fake email. Here are some of them:",
      "Check the sender\u2019s address and domain name. Fake emails often use spoofed or similar-looking addresses and domain names to deceive you. For example, an email from support@amaz0n.com or info@fedex.delivery.com is likely a phishing attempt. You'll notice in the Apple phishing email below the email address has just a bunch of letters and numbers. Always verify the sender\u2019s address and domain name before opening or responding to an email.",
      "Check the spelling and grammar. Phishing emails often contain spelling and grammar errors or use poor or unnatural language. For example, an email that says, \"Dear Customer, Your order has been shipped. Please confirm your delivery address by clicking here.\" It is suspicious because it does not address you by name, uses a generic greeting and asks you to click on a link. Always read the email carefully and look for any mistakes or inconsistencies.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Check the links and attachments. Fake emails often contain links and attachments that lead to malicious websites or download malware to your device. For example, an email that says, \"You have won a $100 gift card from Walmart. Click here to claim your prize.\" It is likely a scam. On a laptop or desktop, always carefully hover your mouse over the links and check the URL before clicking on them, and never open or download any attachments from unknown or suspicious sources.",
      "How to handle spam emails",
      "Use strong antivirus software: The first and most crucial step to protect yourself from accidentally clicking on fake links in spam emails is to have strong antivirus software installed on your device. This software can detect and block malicious emails and links, providing an extra layer of security.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "Do not open or reply to spam emails.\u00a0This can confirm your email address to the sender and encourage them to send you more spam. It can also expose you to malicious links or attachments that can harm your device or data.",
      "Mark spam email as junk or spam. Most email providers have a\u00a0feature that allows you to flag spam emails and move them to a separate folder. This can help you filter out spam emails from your inbox and also improve the spam detection of your email provider.",
      "Do not share your email address publicly or with unknown sources.\u00a0This can reduce the chances of your email address being collected by spammers. You can also use a disposable or\u00a0email alias for signing up for online services that you do not trust or need.",
      "Use a personal data removal service: Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams during the busy holiday season.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "If you realize that you have clicked on a link or opened an attachment from a fake email, don\u2019t panic. Here are some steps that you can take to minimize the damage and protect yourself:",
      "1. Disconnect your device from the internet.\u00a0This will prevent any further communication or data transfer between your device and the malicious website or\u00a0malware. You can do this by turning off your Wi-Fi or unplugging your ethernet cable.",
      "2. Scan your device for malware. Use a reputable\u00a0antivirus software to scan your device and remove any potential threats.

      "3. Change your passwords. If you have entered or provided any passwords or personal information on the malicious website, you should change them as soon as possible. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. You should also\u00a0enable\u00a0two-factor authentication for your online accounts, which adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code or a device confirmation in addition to your password.",
      "5. Monitor your accounts and credit reports.\u00a0If you have entered or provided any financial information on the malicious website or link you clicked on, you should monitor your bank accounts, credit cards and credit reports for any suspicious or unauthorized activity.",
      "6. You should also\u00a0contact your bank or credit card company and inform them of the incident. You may need to cancel or freeze your cards or accounts to prevent any further fraud.",
      "7. Report the phishing email.\u00a0You should also report the phishing email to the sender\u2019s legitimate organization, such as your bank, retailer or delivery service, and to the authorities, such as the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or the\u00a0Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG). This will help them to take action and prevent others from falling for the same scam.",
      "8. Use identity theft protection services\u00a0if you entered your personal information on any links you clicked on or websites that you were directed to. Identity theft protection companies can monitor your personal information (home title, Social Security number, phone number, email address) and alert you in the event they become breached. It can also alert you if any of these are being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",

By staying alert and applying the tips we\u2019ve discussed, you can enjoy the season without falling victim to their schemes. Remember, phishing emails are designed to play on your emotions \u2014 whether it's excitement, urgency or curiosity.

Historically, Play Protect hasn\u2019t been 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android phones. The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you of any\u00a0phishing emails or\u00a0ransomware scams.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Download apps from reliable sources: It\u2019s important to download apps only from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. You might say I am contradicting myself, but the Play Store is still safer than other options out there. They have strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software.\u00a0However, even with the security measures provided by Google Play, downloading apps from the store does not guarantee 100% protection against malware or harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they can pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Never trust download links that you get through SMS.",
      "3. Be cautious with app permissions: Always review the permissions requested by apps before installation. If an app requests access to features that seem unnecessary for its function, it could be a sign of malicious intent. Do not give any app Accessibility permissions unless you really need to. Avoid granting permissions that could compromise your personal data.",
      "4. Take loans from legit institutions:\u00a0Always take loans from legitimate financial institutions like banks or well-known lenders. Avoid sketchy apps or services promising instant cash with minimal requirements. They\u2019re often too good to be true. Legit lenders are transparent about their terms, interest rates, and fees, and they won\u2019t demand access to your personal data or pressure you with scare tactics. If you\u2019re unsure about a lender, check reviews, verify their credentials, or consult a financial advisor before committing.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It can be tempting to use apps that promise instant loans, especially when you need the money. But they're often just trying to scam you and push you into a never-ending debt cycle. If you need a loan, go to a trusted bank or lender. Protecting yourself from malicious apps like those infected with SpyLoan malware starts with staying informed and cautious. Always scrutinize the apps you download, stick to trusted platforms, and think twice before sharing sensitive information.",

This means that any new vulnerabilities discovered in the operating system will not be patched, leaving your computer exposed to potential attacks.",
      "Since the start of 2023, 47 vulnerabilities have been discovered in Windows 7. Cybercriminals actively target outdated operating systems because they're more likely to be unpatched and vulnerable. Without official support, Microsoft is no longer compelled to disclose formal vulnerabilities, making it harder for users to stay informed about potential security risks.",

      "1) Upgrading your operating system or computer: While it\u2019s possible to continue using Windows 7 with a third-party antivirus, it\u2019s generally recommended to upgrade to a newer operating system for the best security.\u00a0If your current computer meets the system requirements, you could consider upgrading to Windows 10 or even Windows 11. However, if a new computer isn\u2019t in your budget right now, using a supported antivirus on your Windows 7 machine is a good step.",
      "2) Install strong antivirus software: If upgrading isn't possible immediately, install a strong, reputable, up-to-date antivirus software that's compatible with Windows 7. However, keep in mind that this is a temporary solution and doesn't address all the vulnerabilities in the operating system itself. There are several antivirus programs that continue to support Windows 7.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Consider a new computer: While it's understandable that you're on a fixed budget, investing in a new computer might be the most cost-effective solution in the long run.

But think about it this way: It's like insurance for your digital life. The headache and costs of dealing with a hacked computer? Trust me, that's way worse.

Well, get ready to have your mind blown! Scientists at the Technical University of Munich have cooked up something that might just change the game for anyone who's ever wished walking was a little easier.",
      "They call it the WalkON system, a pair of high-tech shorts that's not your average gym wear. These bad boys can cut down the energy you need for a stroll or jog by up to 18%! Whether you're a spring chicken or in your golden years, these shorts could be a game-changer, especially if stairs have become your nemesis or long walks leave you winded.",

      "Enter by\u00a0signing up for my free newsletter.",
      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the robotic shorts work",
      "The WalkON system combines sensors, artificial tendons and smart motors to enhance your natural walking motion. It starts with advanced sensors embedded in the shorts that continuously monitor the stress on your tendons. These sensors are incredibly precise, picking up on subtle changes in your movement, including how fast you\u2019re walking and the angle of your hips.",
      "Connected to these sensors are two thin artificial tendons that extend from your thighs to a specially designed waist belt. These tendons play a crucial role in how the system assists you. When you start to walk, the shorts analyze your gait pattern and can even detect the moment you transition from standing to walking. As each leg enters the \"swing phase,\" the system knows exactly when to kick in.",
      "At just the right moment, small but powerful motors activate and gently pull on the artificial tendons. This action helps lift your thigh, reducing the effort needed by your hip flexor muscles, making it feel much easier to move. What\u2019s really impressive is how adaptable WalkON is; whether you prefer a slow stroll or a brisk jog, the system adjusts its level of assistance based on your speed and leg weight. All of this happens seamlessly, so you experience a natural enhancement to your movement rather than feeling like you\u2019re being pushed or pulled by a machine.",

This reduction in energy expenditure is equivalent to the feeling of instantly losing 22 pounds or 13 pounds, respectively. The system allows you to walk slowly or jog, providing versatility in movement. Participants in tests reported high satisfaction with the device, giving it a mean rating of 6 out of 7 for its ability to assist while maintaining a sense of control.",

Additionally, individuals weakened by illness can find significant advantages in using WalkON to enhance their mobility and independence. Furthermore, the device is designed for those looking to maintain an active and healthy lifestyle, making it a versatile solution for a wide range of users.",

      "WEARABLE EXOSKELETON CAN TURN YOU INTO A SUPERHUMAN ATHLETE",
      "Comparison to other exoskeletons",
      "Unlike traditional rigid exoskeletons, WalkON's soft, flexible design offers several advantages over its more cumbersome counterparts. Conventional exoskeletons often feature rigid frames that can be difficult and time-consuming to put on, limiting their practicality for daily use.",
      "In contrast, WalkON's soft robotic shorts can be put on quickly and easily, similar to regular clothing, and are more than a mechanical device. Professor Lorenzia Masia, the lead researcher, aptly compares WalkON to an electric bike for walking. This analogy highlights the system's ability to enhance natural movement without overpowering it, making mobility more accessible and appealing to a wider range of users. The lightweight, tendon-driven design of WalkON allows for a more natural range of motion, adapting to the user's movements rather than constraining them.",
      "Furthermore, WalkON's compact and unobtrusive nature addresses a common concern with exoskeletons: social acceptance. Its design allows it to be worn discreetly under regular clothing, potentially increasing user comfort in social situations. This feature, combined with its efficiency in reducing metabolic cost, positions WalkON as a more practical solution for everyday use compared to bulkier exoskeleton systems.",
      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Availability and cost",
      "Given the current stage of development and testing, it's likely that WalkON could be available to you within the next three to five years, pending further research and regulatory approvals.",
      "While no exact price point is yet available, we can compare it to other assistive technologies. Current exoskeletons can cost anywhere from $40,000 to $100,000-plus. However, given WalkON's simpler design and intended widespread use, it's possible that it could be priced more affordably, perhaps in the range of $5,000 to $15,000 when it first hits the market. As with many technologies, the price could decrease over time as production scales up.",
      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The WalkON system's potential to enhance mobility for people of all ages, particularly older adults and those with health challenges, is immense. By making movement easier and more efficient, WalkON could encourage more active lifestyles, potentially improving overall health and quality of life for many individuals. While questions about availability and cost remain, the development of WalkON is a promising sign that we're moving towards more accessible and user-friendly mobility assistance solutions.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to discuss what Americans should be concerned about with the data breach; he also talks about Apple's bold new move toward AI.",
      "There are companies whose entire business model is built around collecting personal data, including criminal records, employment details, addresses and more. They use this data to offer background check services to other businesses and individuals. However, while they profit from this information, they often fail to adequately protect it. Earlier this year, the National Public Data made headlines for\u00a0failing to secure 2.7 billion records of people whose data it collected. Now, on a smaller scale, another data aggregator has exposed the personal information of 600,000 Americans.",

      "Illustration of a hacker (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What information leaked?",
      "As reported by\u00a0Website Planet, the exposed database contained 644,869 PDF files, totaling 713.1 GB of sensitive data. These documents mainly consisted of background checks but also included court records, vehicle ownership details such as license plates and VINs, and property ownership reports. The background checks alone revealed highly sensitive personal data, including full names, home addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, employment details, information about family members, social media accounts and criminal histories.",
      "The worst part is that the database was left publicly accessible without password protection or encryption, allowing anyone to grab it. Anyone with the link could view and download the files. Plus, the files were named in a way that exposed personal details, using formats like \"First_Middle_Last_State.PDF.\" This made sensitive information visible even without opening the files.",

      "HERE\u2019S WHAT RUTHLESS HACKERS STOLE FROM 110 MILLION AT&T CUSTOMERS",

      "The database that exposed over 600,000 records belongs to SL Data Services LLC, an information research provider that appears to prioritize convenience over basic data security. The company operates a sprawling network of around 16 websites, including Propertyrec, which advertises real estate ownership data and property records. However, SL Data Services\u2019 business goes far beyond property records, offering services like criminal background checks, DMV records and even birth and death records.",
      "While Propertyrec promotes its affordability, claiming users can search for documents for as little as $1, customer reviews paint a different picture. Many users report being unknowingly enrolled in subscription services, resulting in recurring charges instead of the promised one-time fees. This predatory business practice raises further questions about the company\u2019s ethics and transparency.",

      "How could the leak affect people?",
      "The exposure of sensitive personal info in this breach is a big deal for the people involved. The database has detailed data about them, and that\u2019s basically a jackpot for cybercriminals. This kind of leak can lead to various dangerous outcomes.",
      "For one, attackers could use this info to run phishing scams or social engineering tricks. If they know details like your job, family or even criminal history, they can send super convincing messages to trick you into sharing even more sensitive details, like your financial info. That\u2019s not all. Criminals could also use this leaked data to impersonate someone and apply for loans, credit cards or other services in their name.",
      "What really gets me, though, is that most people whose info got leaked probably won\u2019t even find out about it unless they\u2019re using a service to remove their data. A lot of them might not have even known they were being background-checked in the first place. For those with criminal records, this kind of leak could cause major reputational damage or lead to discrimination, even if the info is outdated or flat-out wrong.",

      "7 ways to protect yourself from data leaks",
      "1) Remove your personal information from the internet:\u00a0While no service can promise to completely erase your data from the internet, using a data removal service is one of the best steps you can take. They do the heavy lifting by actively scanning and removing your personal information from hundreds of websites. This helps protect you from scammers who may cross-reference data from breaches with other information they find on the dark web.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2) Be wary of mailbox communications:\u00a0With your address exposed, bad actors could try to scam you through physical mail. They may impersonate companies or people you trust and send fake urgent letters about things like missed deliveries, account suspensions or security alerts. Be skeptical of unexpected communications and verify any claims before taking action.",
      "3) Be cautious of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software: The leaked data could lead to phishing attacks via email, phone calls or messages from unknown sources. Be on high alert for any requests for personal information, especially if they seem urgent or ask you to click on suspicious links. Always verify the legitimacy of any request before responding.",
      "To protect your devices from malicious links, make sure you have strong antivirus protection. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Monitor your accounts: Given the scope of this breach, it\u2019s crucial to start regularly reviewing your bank accounts, credit card statements and other financial accounts. Keep an eye out for any unauthorized transactions and report them immediately to your bank or credit card company to prevent further damage.",
      "5) Use strong, unique passwords: Create complex passwords for each of your online accounts and consider using a\u00a0password manager to keep track of them securely.",
      "6) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Implement this extra layer of security on all accounts that offer it to prevent unauthorized access.",
      "7) Regularly update your software: Keep your operating system, apps and security tools\u00a0up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities.",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It\u2019s alarming how many companies profit from collecting personal data, yet fail to protect it adequately. Recent breaches, including one exposing the sensitive information of 600,000 Americans, highlight this negligence. With unprotected databases containing everything from criminal records to addresses, cybercriminals have a treasure trove of information to exploit. This situation underscores the urgent need for you to take proactive steps to safeguard your privacy and demand better security practices from these data aggregators.",

      "9 ways you can get scammed if your phone number falls into the wrong hands",
      "In today\u2019s digital age, your phone number is more than just a way for friends and family to reach you. It can be a gateway for scammers to access your personal information and wreak havoc on your life. From\u00a0phishing attempts to extortion, the risks are numerous and varied. Here are nine ways scammers can exploit your phone number if it falls into the wrong hands:",
      "Scammers can also use your phone number to launch rather easy\u00a0phishing attacks. They might send text messages or make calls posing as your bank or a popular online service that you subscribe to. The goal is to call you and trick you into providing login credentials, credit card details or other personal information, which they can then use for fraudulent activities. And once they have all your other information, they can do a lot more damage just by having your phone number as that initial segue.",
      "In some cases, scammers use your phone number for extortion or blackmail. They may claim to have compromising information about you and demand payment to keep it private. By contacting you directly, they can apply continuous pressure, making their threats seem more real and immediate.",
      "One unique way they do this to target elderly people is by pretending to be your grandchild or another relative in distress. The scammer often claims that your grandchild is in an emergency situation \u2014 such as needing bail money or medical assistance \u2014 and urgently requests financial help. With AI voice cloning technology, they may even be able to use your grandchild's voice. This emotional manipulation usually gets the victim to pay up.",
      "This one may not be as dramatic, but your phone number can be sold to\u00a0robocall and spam message services. These automated systems bombard you with unwanted calls and texts, often promoting scams or fraudulent products. While these may seem like minor annoyances, they can lead to bigger scams if you engage with the messages or follow their instructions. Hang up on them.",
      "HOW TO STOP ANNOYING ROBOCALLS",
      "Illustration of a scammer with cash in his hand\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Phone number spoofing is a common tactic where scammers disguise their caller ID to appear as a trusted contact by calling from what appears to be a familiar number as it may have the same area code where you live, an area code where your friends or family live or even the actual phone number of someone close which you can recognize.",
      "This makes it more likely that you'll answer the call, giving them the opportunity to deceive you into revealing personal information or transferring money. This is, of course, the case when phone spoofing is used against you. But in situations where they use YOUR phone number, they can be scamming those close to you without you even knowing!",
      "With these phone spoofing tactics, scammers can use your phone number to\u00a0impersonate government officials, such as IRS agents or Social Security administrators. They may call you claiming there\u2019s an urgent issue, like unpaid taxes or suspicious activity involving your Social Security number. This ploy often involves threats of legal action or arrest to pressure you into providing sensitive information or making immediate payments.",
      "Instead of pretending to be from a government agency, another trick is for scammers to try their luck by posing as a representative from a utility company, like an electric or water company. Scammers will claim that you have an overdue invoice and threaten to cut off your service unless you pay immediately. Using your phone number, they can contact you repeatedly, making the scam seem more legitimate (and pressing).",
      "SIM swapping or a\u00a0port-out scam is when scammers transfer your phone number to a new SIM card in their possession. By convincing your mobile carrier to reroute your number, they can receive all your calls and messages, including those containing two-factor authentication codes. This allows them to bypass security measures and take over your online accounts.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "With SIM swapping techniques/port-out, scammers can also use your phone number as a key to access sensitive data stored in your online accounts. By initiating password resets and intercepting verification codes sent via SMS, they can gain unauthorized access to your email, social media and banking accounts, leading to significant personal and financial damage.",
      "Finally, scammers can use all the tactics above to not only access the accounts you already have but also create fake online accounts in your name. These accounts can be used for a variety of malicious purposes, such as spreading malware, launching further scams or conducting identity theft. The presence of your phone number makes these accounts appear more legitimate, increasing the chances of deceiving others.",

      "7. Use an identity theft protection service: Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "8. Remove your personal information from the internet:\u00a0While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with the information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "President-elect Trump's plans to curb illegal immigration will lighten the load of Border Patrol agents and local police across the southern U.S. border, former National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) President Brandon Judd told Fox News Digital.",
      "Trump won 14 out of 18 counties within 20 miles of the U.S. border, challenging Democrats' traditional hold there. Among Latino voters in those counties, 55% voted for the president-elect \u2014 a 55% increase from his numbers in 2020.",
      "Trump has pledged to target noncitizens who have been convicted of crimes and the 1.4 million immigrants who are still in the U.S. despite receiving a formal order of removal from a judge.",
      "Among his pledged policy changes, Trump has stated that he will declare a national emergency and use the U.S. military to assist with deportations; eliminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, despite the fact that he was blocked from doing so by the Supreme Court in his first term; and end birthright citizenship for children born on U.S. soil.",

      "Trump has also said he will reinstate his \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, which requires migrants entering from the southern border and seeking asylum to remain on Mexican soil until their U.S. court date. President Biden's administration ended the policy in August 2022.",
      "Judd, a former Border Patrol agent, said the reinstatement of the policy would be a boon for police in border towns.",
      "\"Once you have that drop in illegal border crossings, then local law enforcement in border towns, now they're free to actually do their job,\" Judd said. \"Whereas right now, so much of their time is being taken up, having to deal with illegal immigration, having to deal with the drugs\u2026 you're freeing up local and state officials to actually do their job and protect their citizens.\"",
      "Curbing border crossings would also hinder cartels, which make an estimated $13 billion per year smuggling people into the U.S., according to a New York Times report.",
      "VENEZUELAN GANG MEMBERS LINKED TO VIOLENT APARTMENT TAKEOVER ARRESTED IN NEW YORK CITY",
      "The border has seen record numbers of illegal crossings in recent years.\u00a0 (John Moore/Getty Images)",
      "There are fears that cartels are pushing in additional migrants ahead of Trump's inauguration, with Arizona's Cochise County seeing an increase in smuggling pursuits \u2014 up to 10 each day, per News Nation.",
      "\"They\u2019re going to push hard right now. The cartels, they know they have to. They have a president coming in who\u2019s made it very clear, and based on his track record, he will secure this border,\" Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels told the outlet. \"He\u2019ll declare it an emergency.\"",
      "After working as a Border Patrol agent between 1997 and 2003, Judd was president of the NBPC, the union for border patrol officers, from 2012 until May this year. He told Fox News Digital that, although each president during his tenure was different, the Trump administration's border policies were the \"most effective.\"",
      "\"When you look at the Bush administration, we had huge numbers of people, but they were the same people over and over and over again,\" Judd recalled. \"Then under the Obama administration, we were dealing with less people, but we were releasing people into the United States at a level that was unprecedented and that's what caused what we saw, the huge spike during the second term of President Obama.\"",
      "\"What I can say is by far the more impressive administration was the Trump administration, and the numbers bear that out. Also, the [amount] of drugs that were coming in the United States\u2026 was a lot less,\" he continued. \"We saw that on the streets. We saw that in our cities, in our communities. But [for] local law enforcement, [there are] a lot less drugs on the street under the Trump administration than what was in the previous administration.\"",

      "The foreign-born population hit a record high in March, in large part as a result of the flow of illegal migrants into the U.S. over the last few years. The population of foreign-born people living in the U.S. hit a new record high of 51.6 million in March, raising the percentage of foreign-born residents to 15.6% of the total U.S. population, according to a study by the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS).",
      "\"If you go back to the Clinton administration, [border crossings were] centered in San Diego and El Paso. Then the Bush administration, San Diego and El Paso became non-factors. It was all the Tucson sector. Then after the Obama administration, we saw Texas, you know, the Rio Grande Valley. So there's always ebbs and flows,\" Judd said. \"The difference with this administration is, is whereas under Obama, under Bush, under Clinton, we had two to three hot spots [along the border], with the Biden administration\u2026 it's basically across the entire southwest border.\"",
      "\"We've never seen anything like this,\" Judd continued. \"And we went from two to three hot spots to seven to nine hot spots. And it was just completely undeniable because it was across the [entire] border. We were getting flooded everywhere.\"",
      "Local law enforcement agencies nationwide are also planning to pair up with ICE officials using the 287(g) program. Added to the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1996 under then-President Clinton, the program authorized ICE to delegate to state and local law enforcement officers and give them the ability to act as immigration officers. Trump has said that he intends to lean on local law enforcement in his effort to carry out the \"largest deportation\" in U.S. history.",

    "summary": "The Ronald Reagan Institute released its sixth annual National Defense Survey and found &apos;record high&apos; support for U.S. involvement abroad despite a growing sense that isolationism could be on the rise.",
    "story": [
      "Rachel Hoff, Policy Director at the Ronald Reagan Institute tells Fox News Digital the vast majority of Americans prioritize national security and foreign policy despite campaign rhetoric suggesting otherwise.",
      "FIRST ON FOX: An overwhelming majority of Americans view foreign policy and national defense as being \"somewhat\" or \"extremely\" important to them, according to a new survey from the Ronald Reagan Institute that also weighed U.S. attitudes about rival nations and revealed which is viewed as posing the \"greatest threat\" to the country.",
      "As Americans await another change in the White House while the Biden and Trump administrations prepare for the executive reshuffle, and uncertainty has set the tone for what the U.S.\u2019s geopolitical future will look like amid increasingly volatile relations with nations like Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, there is stark uniformity in the way Americans view the topic of national defense.",
      "\"Americans who cast their votes for different candidates share an unshakable core set of beliefs: the United States must lead on the world stage, backed by a strong military that can secure the peace through its strength,\" the Ronald Reagan Institute said in a report first obtained by Fox News Digital detailing its 2024 National Defense Survey results.",
      "US 'SLEEPWALKING' INTO WWIII, EXPERTS WARN NATION IS UNDERPREPARED: 'WE DO NOT HAVE OUR CHURCHILL'",
      "The survey\u2019s results \u2013 which reflected the answers from some 2,500 questionnaires issued between Nov. 8-14 through telephone and online based platforms \u2013 not only highlight that U.S. security and foreign policy issues remain important topics, but they also indicated that the U.S. should take the lead in major international issues.",
      "The opinion shows a divergence from the position frequently pushed by president-elect Donald Trump, who has long championed an \"America first\" policy, which some fear could isolate the U.S. during a geopolitically turbulent time as Russia\u2019s aggression continues to ramp up in Europe, Iran remains a chief threat in the Middle East, and China continues to pose a threat politically, militarily and economically.",
      "\"I think it's really interesting to compare some of the campaign rhetoric that we saw, frankly, from both candidates, and see where that is and is not resonating with the American people,\" Rachael Hoff Policy Director at the Ronald\u00a0Reagan Institute, told Fox News Digital in reference to both Trump and his previous campaign challenger Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "The survey also found that since the annual poll began six years ago, \"a record high\" number of Americans support \"U.S. leadership and international engagement\" with a strong support for a global military posture.",
      "Parachutists jump from a U.S. airplane near Burgenlengenfeld, Germany, on April 12, 2016. (Armin Weigel/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "\"This represents a significant 15-point increase since just last year and a steady upward trend from a low-point in the early 2020s,\" the report said, noting that this shift was most prevalent among younger survey takers which saw a 32-point jump this year for those under the age of 30, along with a 19-point increase for those between the ages of 30 and 44.",
      "WHAT DOES PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP\u2019S WIN MEAN FOR US AMID WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA, UKRAINE?",
      "The drive for more U.S. involvement abroad particularly in East Asia, which includes areas like China and the Korean peninsula, the Middle East and Europe reflects the growing concern Americans have over not only the burgeoning alliance between Russia, Iran, North Korea and China, but on whether the U.S.\u00a0 military can stand up to these nations.",
      "While more than half of male survey takers, 59%, said they believe the U.S. could win a war against China, the female participants were more skeptical with only 45% expressing the same confidence, while 23% said they were unsure compared to 18% of male participants expressing the same.",

      "More confidence in the U.S. military was displayed when asked if the U.S. could win a war against Russia, though again women signaled less confidence than their male peers, with 73% of male participants saying the U.S. would come out on top compared to only 56% of female survey takers.",
      "While it remains unclear why female participants were less confident in the U.S. military, the majority of survey takers collectively agreed that China is the U.S.\u2019s greatest threat, though Russia as the U.S.\u2019s chief enemy.",
      "TIRED OF UKRAINE? REMEMBER SOUTH VIETNAM",
      "\"One of the biggest trends that we've seen in the last three or four years in the poll is really the consensus growing that China is the is the greatest threat that we face \u2013 \u00a0that's really resonating with the American people, and it's something that clearly we've heard on a bipartisan basis from national security leaders in Washington,\" Hoff said. \u00a0That doesn't mean that Americans don't perceive Russia, Iran, North Korea, or even the cooperation between those malign actors as a threat.",

      "\"In fact, one interesting takeaway from our poll this year is that 85% of Americans, a huge percentage\u2026are concerned about the cooperation and collaboration between Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, and we're seeing that play out under the front lines in Ukraine,\" Hoff added. \"We're seeing it play out in the Middle East and it's something that Americans want our government to understand and to get after.\"",
      "Hoff explained that though the survey \u2013 which reflected information made clear in the lead up to and after the U.S. general election \u2013 showed Americans prioritize paying for domestic issues like healthcare, border security and social security above the military and foreign policy-based initiatives, national security and geopolitics remain a major issue for Americans.",
      "\"What we see from the poll across the board is that they don't see foreign policy and national security as something that they want to divest from,\" she said. \"When asked to sort of put those in competition with each other, that's where it gets really, really tough.",
      "\"But they clearly want their government to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time,\" Hoff said. \"The perception that there's kind of a growing isolationist sentiment in this country really doesn't bear out in the data.",

And it turns out, when you ask the American people, that's simply not the case,\" Hoff said.",
      "\"They want America to lead from a position of strength. They want us to have a strong military,\" she continued. \"They want us to stand up for the values of freedom and democracy around the world.

      "That won't happen for another 45 days, but Donald Trump, the president-in-waiting, isn't shying away from acting like the president-in-reality.",
      "Trump can't sign a bill or issue an executive order yet, but he is crowding out Joe Biden as the sitting president winds down his term and steadily recedes from public view. In two foreign trips since the election, Biden has answered all of two questions from reporters.",
      "He has been left to kibitz about Trump\u2019s pronouncements \u2014 \u201cI hope he rethinks it,\u201d he said of Trump\u2019s plan to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico \u2014 rather than drive an agenda of his own.",
      "As for Trump, \u201chis view is that he\u2019s not going to follow rules that he thinks are stupid rules,\u201d said a former senior White House official in Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cHis view is these are hostages and if he can help bring them home, then why would he follow protocol if it\u2019s going to impact peoples\u2019 lives?\u201d",

      "If Biden is unhappy about being upstaged, he hasn\u2019t offered any hints. In fact, Trump\u2019s interventions may prove helpful to the degree they complement Biden\u2019s larger goals.",
      "A senior Biden administration official cited Trump\u2019s social media post warning of \u201chell to pay\u201d unless the hostages are freed from Gaza by Inauguration Day. That message doesn\u2019t hurt the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to secure the hostages\u2019 release in exchange for a ceasefire, the official said.",
      "A president-elect\u2019s first and overriding task is to build a Cabinet and a senior White House team ahead of the four-year term. But Trump and a few of his predecessors haven\u2019t hesitated to dip a toe into real-time crises if so moved.",

He\u2019s not going to sit back and wait until Inauguration Day. And it works.\u201d",

      "Trudeau\u2019s support in Canada has been slipping. He faces a tough re-election bid, and the spectacle of him racing to Mar-a-Lago for an audience with Trump risked making him look like a supplicant.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s smart for him [Trump] to humiliate Trudeau like he has,\u201d a Republican senator said, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk freely. \u201cCanada is a good friend and is not a problem.\u201d",
      "The senator said: \u201cTrump was elected to break some plates, but he doesn\u2019t have a huge mandate. This is a 50-50 country. We\u2019ve got midterm [elections] coming and we\u2019ve got one year to deliver, and it\u2019s going to be hard to get prices down with these tariffs.\u201d",
      "More than a norm, the idea that a president-elect should defer to the sitting president in the realm of foreign policy has roots in law. A Supreme Court ruling in 1936 held that the president possesses \u201cexclusive power ... as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations.\u201d",
      "Barbara Perry, a professor of presidential studies at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center for Public Affairs, said the ruling confirms the court\u2019s view that \u201cthe Founding Fathers and the Constitution want the United States to speak with one voice, and that voice should be the president of the United States.\u201d",
      "One danger of a president-elect\u2019s injecting himself into an active debate before he takes office is that something could go wrong, raising the question of who would be accountable, Perry said.",
      "If Trump\u2019s warning prompted Hamas to execute the hostages before he took office, for example, \u201cwho would be responsible for that?\u201d she asked.",
      "Still, presidents-elect have been hard-pressed to absent themselves from issues they\u2019ll be inheriting before long. Dwight D. Eisenhower traveled to Korea ahead of his inauguration in 1953 to see for himself whether the war there was winnable. On the ground, he met with South Korean President Syngman Rhee, dismissed scenarios for escalating the war and came away convinced the fighting needed to end.",
      "Barack Obama was selective in how he chose to engage before he took office in the thick of a global financial crisis in 2008. When President George W. Bush invited Obama to a meeting of world leaders devoted to the downturn, Obama declined. An Obama spokeswoman said, \u201cWe really felt strong that there was only one president at a time and George Bush was the president.\u201d",
      "Yet Obama injected himself into legislative debates at the time, calling for extending unemployment benefits. He was more reticent when it came to fighting between Palestinians and Israelis \u2014 an intractable dispute that, of course, continues to this day.",
      "A Washington Post article three weeks before Obama took office quoted a government professor as saying, \u201cIt seems clear he\u2019s just cherry-picking those things that can serve his purpose and staying as far away from Middle East troubles as he can.\u201d"

      "Musk financed RBG PAC, according to the report the group filed Thursday night with the Federal Election Commission. The super PAC, which did not disclose its donors before the election, launched ads contending that Trump did not support a federal abortion ban.",
      "All of the money the group pulled in \u2014 $20.5 million \u2014 came from a single donation from the Elon Musk Revocable Trust in Austin, Texas. RBG PAC spent almost all of its money on digital ads, mailers and text messages, according to the campaign finance report, which covered Oct. 17 through Nov. 25.",
      "The group's website says Trump and the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg agree on the abortion issue, drawing criticism from Ginsburg's granddaughter Clara Spara, who told The New York Times that the message was \"nothing short of appalling.\"",
      "Trump took credit for the Supreme Court's overturning Roe v. Wade, a decision that came after three Trump-appointed justices voted with the majority to overturn the national right to an abortion. (One of those justices, Amy Coney Barrett, was appointed to replace Ginsburg weeks before the 2020 election, after Ginsburg died in mid-September.) As president, he supported a federal ban on abortion after 20 weeks.",
      "But during this campaign, Trump backed away from that position and instead declared that he supported states' rights to decide abortion laws. Democrats still hit Trump hard on his past positions to argue that if he were elected, he and a Republican Congress would restrict abortion nationwide.",
      "The late ad blitz from RBG PAC is only a small fraction of Musk's total election spending this year: He also financed America PAC, a super PAC that reported spending $157 million supporting Trump in the presidential race.",
      "America PAC\u2019s latest campaign finance report showed Musk donated $238 million to the group throughout the election cycle,\u00a0including in-kind contributions. And $120 million of that came\u00a0in the final weeks of the race alone.",
      "Federal disclosures show America PAC spent heavily on canvassing, text message-based get-out-the-vote efforts, printing and postage (most likely for direct mail), as well as digital advertising. It also ran a controversial cash giveaway that gave out $1 million each day to someone who signed the group's conservative-leaning petition.",
      "Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner sued Musk and America PAC in late October trying to halt the giveaway, but a judge in the state did not agree to stop the program. The Justice Department also warned the PAC around the same time that the giveaway might be illegal, but it has taken no public action on it.",
      "America PAC\u2019s campaign finance report lists each of the $1 million prizes as payments for a \"spokesperson consultant.\"",
      "Musk also gave $3 million to the MAHA Alliance, a super PAC affiliated with Robert F. Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" push, in late October.",
      "It's possible that Musk donated more to pro-Trump efforts, too, as political committees continue to file fundraising reports pegged to Thursday night's deadline.",
      "Musk, the founder of Space X and CEO of Tesla, is one of Trump's top donors this cycle, but he has also been among his most visible. He has been a regular presence at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Florida estate, and by Trump's side during the transition (to the consternation of some in Trump's orbit).",
      "Trump selected Musk to advise him on cutting spending across the federal government as a co-chair of his \"Department of Government Efficiency\" initiative."

      "In 2017, Gabbard made an unannounced trip to Syria to meet President Bashar al-Assad, the country's authoritarian leader. The trip sparked bipartisan criticism. The same year, she cast doubt on the U.S.' own intelligence agencies' conclusion that Assad's government was responsible for a chemical weapons attack on Syrians.",
      "The letter also argued that Gabbard would \"be the least experienced\" person to hold the director position since it was created in 2004.",
      "\"The Senate must carefully evaluate whether Ms. Gabbard is equipped to effectively oversee an organizational structure as unique and large as the National Intelligence Program and also the effect of her holding this position on the willingness of our closest allies to share intelligence with the U.S.,\" the letter said.",
      "The letter was addressed to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and incoming Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.",
      "Thune's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Schumer's office referred to a letter he sent to Thune this week about the confirmation process, in which he said Democrats are \"ready and willing to work with Senate Republicans to provide advice and consent\" on Trump's nominations.",
      "Reached for comment, a spokesperson for Gabbard on the Trump transition team slammed the letter, as well as the signers' credentials.",
      "\"These unfounded attacks are from the same geniuses who have blood on their hands from decades of faulty 'intelligence,' including the non-existent weapons of mass destruction,\" said spokesperson Alexa Henning, referring to a purported justification for the start of the Iraq War that turned out to be wrong.",

Hegseth has said the encounter was consensual, and he was not charged.\u00a0Robert F.

      "\u201cAnd people wonder why we want these executives dead,\u201d\u00a0Taylor Lorenz, a former New York Times and Washington Post journalist, wrote on Bluesky a few hours after the CEO, Brian Thompson, 50, was gunned down in Manhattan by a man with a silenced pistol.\u00a0After a backlash, Lorenz later posted, \u201cno, that doesn\u2019t mean people should murder them.\u201d",
      "The\u00a0Network Contagion Research Institute\u00a0at Rutgers University identified thousands of similar posts on X within hours of the killing. The posts, which could have been viewed by more than 8.3 million accounts, garnered 180,000 likes and 24,400 reposts, according to the institute.",
      "\u201cThe surge of social media posts praising and glorifying the killing of UnitedHealth CEO Brian Thompson is deeply concerning,\u201d said Alex Goldenberg, a senior adviser for the institute and a fellow at Rutgers.\u00a0(Thompson was CEO of UnitedHealthcare, not of UnitedHealth Group, its parent company.)",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve identified highly engaged posts circulating the names of other healthcare CEOs and others celebrating the shooter,\" he said.\u00a0\"The framing of this incident as some opening blow in a class war and not a brutal murder is especially alarming.\u201d",
      "Law enforcement officials have been warning for years of a heightened risk of political violence from a small minority of Americans, mainly on the right, radicalized on social media and marinating in conspiracy theories.\u00a0(Police have not revealed information about the killer\u2019s possible motive.)",
      "These posts appeared to come mostly from accounts that have expressed far-left views, but some came from far-right accounts as well, noted Tobita Chow, a climate activist whose post summing up the sentiment reached millions of accounts.",
      "\u201cMy notifications are mostly a cascade of populist rage,\u201d he posted. \u201cChecking people\u2019s profiles, it\u2019s coming from across the political spectrum: leftists, normie Dems, MAGA, a libertarian or two, and many people whose presence on here is otherwise entirely apolitical.\u201d",
      "The main theme animating many of the posts about the Thompson killing was that UnitedHealthcare and other insurance companies harm and kill Americans by denying coverage in the name of profit.\u00a0Many posts raised an announcement last month by Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield \u2014 which covers consumers in Connecticut, New York and Missouri \u2014 that it would no longer pay for anesthesia care if a surgery or procedure goes beyond an arbitrary time limit, regardless of how long the procedure takes.\u00a0(Anthem BCBS\u00a0reversed course on the policy Thursday.)",
      "\u201cThen people wonder why a health insurance CEO was gunned down \u2026 because insurance companies pull this garbage,\u201d\u00a0one X user wrote.",
      "On the official\u00a0Facebook post\u00a0about Thompson\u2019s death from UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare, most people reacted with the \u201claughter\u201d emoji. Out of approximately 40,000 reactions on the post, 35,000 used the \u201cHaha\u201d emote and 2,200 used the \u201cSad\u201d emote.",
      "Some of the top sitewide posts on Reddit after the shooting were celebratory, ranging from memes that congratulated the shooter to top replies in subreddits like \u201cr/nursing\u201d that created a mock coverage review and claim denial for Thompson\u2019s care. \u201cThis fatal shooting has been reviewed by a peer and is considered a non-covered experimental procedure,\u201d read a reply with over 2,400 upvotes.",
      "Thompson was the father of two teenagers. Law enforcement officials told NBC News they found the words \u201cdeny,\u201d \u201cdefend\u201d and \u201cdepose,\u201d written on the shell casings found at the shooting scene. Those words seem to echo the title of a 2010 book, \u201cDelay Deny Defend,\u201d whose subtitle is, \u201cWhy insurance companies don\u2019t pay claims and what you can do about it.\u201d The author declined to comment.",
      "Lorenz, who was a technology reporter for The\u00a0New York Times\u00a0from 2019 to 2022 and a columnist for the Washington Post from 2022 to earlier this year,\u00a0also posted\u00a0the photo of another insurance company CEO with a birthdate and a blank date of death. (That post has since been removed.) And she reposted\u00a0a post that said: \u201chypothetically, would it be considered an actionable threat to start emailing other insurance CEOs a simple, \u2018you\u2019re next\u2019?\u201d",
      "Lorenz, who now hosts a popular podcast for Vox Media and has a Substack newsletter, said in an email to NBC News that she was not seeking to justify violence.\u00a0She noted that she\u00a0later posted: \u201cI hope people learn the names of all of these insurance company CEOs and engage in very peaceful letter writing campaigns so that they stop ruthlessly murdering thousands of innocent Americans by denying coverage.\u201d",
      "In the email to NBC News, she said she didn\u2019t intend to suggest that she personally\u00a0wanted health care executives dead.",
      "\u201cMy post that you cited below uses the royal \u2018we\u2019 and is explaining the public sentiment surrounding the event. People absolutely want healthcare executives dead because these executives are responsible for unfathomable levels of death and suffering. \u2026 People have a very justified hatred toward insurance company CEOs because of the death and suffering they facilitate. It\u2019s interesting how you don\u2019t consider that violence.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cMe surfacing commentary that OTHER people post like Jenny, is not me endorsing those people and their posts. I can\u2019t believe I have to explain to a reporter in 2024 that retweets are not endorsements.\u201d",
      "One of the most read X posts on the subject came from Chow, the climate activist. In an interview, he said he was not condoning the killing but was calling attention to populist anger about the private health insurance system.",
      "\u201cSaw mainstream news coverage about the killing of the CEO of United Healthcare on TikTok and I think political and industry leaders might want to read the comments and think hard about them,\u201d he wrote in a post that got 137,000 likes.",
      "\u201cCompassion withheld until documentation can be produced that determines the bullet holes were not a preexisting condition,\u201d one user responded.",
      "\u201cMy take is that there is a great deal of populist anger about the way corporations in private health insurance are able to just abuse people and ruin people\u2019s lives and in the case of health insurance even potentially leave them to die with impunity and for profit,\u201d Chow said. \u201cObviously I don\u2019t think the solution to that is vigilante assassinations, but I think business and political leaders need to take seriously where this sentiment is coming from.\u201d",
      "He said the killing produced an outpouring of complaints about UnitedHealthcare specifically.",
      "Many social media users shared\u00a0a chart from the finance website ValuePenguin\u00a0that showed UnitedHealthcare had the highest claims denial rate among major insurance companies.",
      "While the gunman\u2019s motive is not yet known, health care industry professionals have\u00a0experienced escalating threats, said Drew Neckar, a principal consultant at Cosecure, a security and risk management company.",
      "\u201cThe health care sector specifically has seen a pretty significant increase in violence, whether that be physical violence, threats, et cetera. It\u2019s been a problem for decades, but it has significantly increased since the pandemic,\u201d he said.",
      "Neckar noted that the threats are usually aimed at front-line providers such as doctors and nurses, though he said he has also noticed an increase in threats against health care executives.",
      "\u201cThere isn\u2019t a healthcare organization I\u2019ve worked with in the past several years that hasn\u2019t experienced at least a 25 to 50% increase in actual violence against staff and threats of violence against staff,\u201d he said.",
      "Shannon Watts, founder of the gun violence prevention group Moms Demand Action, vividly recalls the endless, losing battles loved ones waged against UnitedHealthcare for coverage sought by her late stepfather, who was\u00a0dying from glioblastoma\u00a0in the early 2000s.",
      "Despite her bitterness over UnitedHealthcare\u2019s\u00a0treatment of her stepfather, Watts was horrified to read the vitriol aimed at the slain executive.",
      "\u201cYou know it was really across all platforms. It was shocking to me to see prominent people, not just bots, defending, condoning, mocking, celebrating gun violence,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cTwo things can be true: The health insurance system is broken and must be fixed, and also gun violence and murder is wrong.\u201d"

    "summary": "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield said Thursday it was not going ahead with a policy change that would limit reimbursements for anesthesia during surgery and medical procedures.",
    "story": [
      "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield said Thursday it was not going ahead with a policy change that would limit reimbursements for anesthesia during surgery and medical procedures. The new policy would have reimbursed doctors based on time limits set by the insurer.",
      "Anthem BCBS, one of the largest health insurers in the U.S., quietly announced the new reimbursement policy last month for Connecticut, New York and Missouri beginning in February. The policy change triggered outrage from the American Society of Anesthesiologists.",
      "Initially, the policy update went unnoticed, but that changed Wednesday after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot killed in New York City. The killing sparked a wave of online vitriol about the U.S. health care system, and Anthem BCBS\u2019s decision roared into the conversation.",
      "A spokesperson for Anthem BCBS said in a statement: \u201cThere has been significant widespread misinformation about an update to our anesthesia policy. As a result, we have decided to not proceed with this policy change.\"",
      "The spokesperson added, \"To be clear, it never was and never will be the policy of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to not pay for medically necessary anesthesia services. The proposed update to the policy was only designed to clarify the appropriateness of anesthesia consistent with well-established clinical guidelines.\u201d",
      "Before the reversal, New York and Connecticut had stepped in to stop the plan from going into effect.",
      "On Thursday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul took credit for pushing for the reversal. Hochul had expressed her indignation on X on Wednesday.",
      "\"Last night, I shared my outrage at a plan from Anthem to strip away coverage from New Yorkers who had to go under anesthesia for surgery,\" Hochul said in a statement Thursday. \"We pushed Anthem to reverse course and today they will be announcing a full reversal of this misguided policy.\"",
      "On Thursday, Sean Scanlon, Connecticut\u2019s comptroller, posted on X that the policy would no longer be going into effect in the state.",
      "\u201cAfter hearing from people across the state about this concerning policy, my office reached out to Anthem, and I\u2019m pleased to share this policy will no longer be going into effect here in Connecticut,\u201d Scanlon wrote.",
      "Typically, there is no set time limit for anesthesia during surgery or a procedure. Anesthesia is administered for as long as a procedure takes \u2014 a decision determined by the doctor performing the procedure, rather than the anesthesiologist.",
      "\u201cThe issue here is that the time, the length of surgery, is a function of the surgeon, not the anesthesiologist. The anesthesiologist is really at the mercy of the surgeon for however long they need to take to do the surgery well,\u201d said Dr. Dhivya Srinivasa, the founder and chief surgeon at the Institute for Advanced Breast Reconstruction in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cIn my arena, I\u2019m a breast cancer reconstructive surgeon. There is a wide range of how long it will take based on complexity,\u201d Srinivasa said.",
      "The Anthem BCBS spokesperson said Wednesday afternoon the decision had been made to \u201csafeguard against potential anesthesia provider overbilling\u201d as part of the company\u2019s \u201ccontinuous efforts to improve affordability and accessibility to care.\u201d",
      "Anthem would be using the \u201cCMS Physical Work Time values to determine the appropriate number of minutes\u201d for procedures, the spokesperson said, referring to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Dr. Donald Arnold, the president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, sharply questioned how Anthem had determined the time limits.",
      "\u201cNo, it\u2019s not part of Medicare or Medicaid,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody else has a system like this.\u201d",
      "The CMS Physician Work Time values can be found on the CMS website.",
      "\u201cMedicare has some data,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the purpose of the data. We don\u2019t know the provenance. We don\u2019t know how it\u2019s calculated. We don\u2019t know any of that, except we can find the spreadsheet and we can download it. CMS hasn\u2019t answered our questions so that we can understand how it was developed.\u201d",
      "CMS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In January, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts began restricting the use of anesthesia during colonoscopies but reversed its decision after pushback from doctors, including the American Gastroenterological Association."

    "summary": "Temperatures have risen far higher over the past two years than scientists expected. A study offers a possible reason why: Cloud cover has decreased.",
    "story": [
      "The Summary",
      "Global temperatures in the last two years have been even higher than climate scientists expected. A new study offers a possible reason: Cloud cover has decreased. The research suggests that the reduction may be a consequence of global warming, which would mean the planet is heating up even faster than scientists thought.",
      "Global temperatures in the last two years have been even higher than climate scientists expected.",
      "A new study offers a possible reason: Cloud cover has decreased.",
      "The research suggests that the reduction may be a consequence of global warming, which would mean the planet is heating up even faster than scientists thought.",
      "Temperatures around the world have risen far higher over the past two years than scientists expected. The trend has given rise to a puzzle: Are hidden climate change dynamics behind the sudden shift?",
      "Last year was the hottest in recorded history, and through summer, 2024 was on pace to be hotter. Even after factoring in the expected effects of greenhouse gas pollution and El Ni\u00f1o \u2014 a natural pattern that typically boosts temperatures \u2014 researchers couldn\u2019t account for roughly 0.2 degrees Celsius (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit) of the warming observed in 2023.",
      "A new study offers a possible explanation: Cloud cover has decreased over the past two years, it found, allowing more light to reach and heat the Earth\u2019s surface, rather than being reflected back to space.",
      "The research, published Thursday in the journal Science, suggests that an overall decline in the planet\u2019s albedo, as that dynamic is called, is a likely cause of the temperature anomaly observed in 2023.",
      "\u201cThis pretty much fits this most recent additional increase of observed solar radiation,\u201d said Helge Goessling, an author of the study and a climate physicist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany.",
      "The expected behavior of clouds in a warmer world has been one of the toughest aspects of the climate system to study and model. Answering questions about it will help scientists better determine how sensitive the planet is to greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "If the reductions in low cloud cover aren\u2019t a result of chance, it likely means Earth is warming even faster than scientists thought.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not really clear yet to what extent some of this might be variability that goes away again,\u201d Goessling said. \u201cIt shifts the odds towards a higher-than-to-be-expected warming.\u201d",
      "The new research is based on an analysis of climate models and NASA satellite data about the Earth\u2019s reflectivity. It outlines three possible reasons why fewer low clouds are developing, but doesn\u2019t offer conclusions about how much each factor is contributing.",
      "One option is that a natural process is temporarily diverging from normal, causing a reduction in cloud cover. It\u2019s possible, for example, that natural variability is causing the ocean\u2019s surface to warm more than expected, and that is shifting the physics of how clouds form.",
      "A second possibility is changes to maritime shipping regulations: The International Maritime Organization in 2020 imposed limits on the sulphur content allowed in maritime fuels. Some scientists think that reducing the number of sulphur particles that pollute the atmosphere could have the unintended effect of dampening marine cloud formation.",
      "\u201cBecause these act as condensation nuclei for clouds, they can make clouds brighter and also more long-lived,\u201d Goessling said of the sulphur particles.",
      "The third option is that unidentified feedback loops in the climate system are causing clouds to decrease because of global warming.",
      "If the latter two possibilities turn out to be primary contributors, that would mean the climate is more sensitive to human pollution than many scientists had thought \u2014 and, therefore, that humanity is closer to exceeding the targets world leaders set for limiting emissions than previously realized. (The term \u201cclimate sensitivity\u201d refers to how warm the planet would be if the concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere doubled.)",
      "Still, many questions remain, said Zeke Hausfather, the climate research lead at the finance company Stripe and a research scientist at Berkeley Earth.",
      "\u201cWe still do not know for sure that these changes in cloud behavior are not due to short-term variability \u2014 which would return to more normal conditions with time \u2014 or if they represent a new ongoing change to the climate system,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, average land and ocean surface temperatures in 2023 were about 2.12 degrees Fahrenheit above 20th-century averages.",
      "World leaders\u2019 efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions remain insufficient. Global temperatures are on pace to rise more than 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) on average \u2014 well above the goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) set in the Paris Agreement."

      "After nearly two years of friendship bracelets and sparkly bodysuits, Taylor Swift\u2019s record-shattering Eras Tour is finally coming to a close.",
      "Spanning five continents over the course of nearly 150 shows, the tour is making its last-ever stop this weekend in Vancouver, British Columbia, where Swift will perform her final three shows.",
      "Since its kickoff in March 2023, the Eras Tour has become the highest-grossing concert tour in history while also cementing itself as a cultural phenomenon \u2014 frequently making headlines while prompting a constant flurry of fan excitement and speculation.",
      "By summer 2023, the Federal Reserve was already crediting the tour with boosting the U.S. economy by fueling tourism. Her \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d movie, released in October, became the highest-grossing domestic concert film ever by the end of its opening weekend in North America.",
      "The buzz around her tour, magnified by her release last year of \u201cSpeak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d and \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d snagged Swift the accolade of Time\u2019s 2023 Person of the Year. The release of her latest album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d in April infused new twists into the international leg of her tour this year.",
      "Meanwhile, universities across the country have introduced Swift-themed classes to analyze everything from her lyricism to her business strategies. Swifties\u2019 frustration around the hassle of purchasing Eras Tour tickets also made for a powerful political force, helping build momentum for federal scrutiny of Ticketmaster's dominance in the ticketing industry.",
      "The Eras Tour\u2019s setlist includes dozens of songs from Swift\u2019s many studio albums \u2014 dubbed eras \u2014 including some she had not played on tour before. For many who scored tickets, the magnitude of Swift\u2019s three-plus-hour shows will be remembered all too well.",
      "Starting in Arizona, the 2023 Eras Tour traversed a total of 20 cities across the United States over about five months. In August 2023, Swift launched the first international leg of her tour, hitting Mexico, Argentina and Brazil before taking a few months\u2019 hiatus. Tragedy briefly struck the Eras Tour when a 23-year-old fan died last year at her show in Rio de Janeiro amid extreme temperatures.",
      "In 2024, Swift relaunched her tour in February, kicking off with Japan and quickly moving on to Australia and Singapore. Swift toured heavily in Europe this year, performing in countries including: France, Sweden, Portugal, Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Germany and Poland. She also hit England, Scotland and Wales in the United Kingdom. (Her shows in Vienna were canceled this year due to what police said was a foiled terrorist plot.)",
      "This year, the Eras Tour returned to the United States for shows in Florida, Louisiana and Indiana. Having played six nights in Toronto last month, Swift\u2019s next three shows in Vancouver will mark the true end of an era.",
      "Here\u2019s what fans should know about the final shows.",
      "When do the Vancouver shows kick off?",
      "The last stop of the Eras Tour begins Friday evening in Vancouver, where Swift will perform three back-to-back shows at BC Place stadium throughout the weekend. From Dec. 6-8, doors will open at 4:30 p.m. for a 6:45 p.m. showtime.",
      "Concertgoers may not line up earlier than 3:30 p.m. on show days, according to the stadium, which also strictly prohibits overnight camping. Attendees may bring a small bag (like a clutch purse) or a larger, clear bag into the stadium.",
      "What Canadian officials have to say to Swifties",
      "As Canada prepares for another influx of international fans hoping to catch the end of Swift\u2019s tour, the Canada Border Services Agency is encouraging visitors to review its list of border-crossing travel tips, including carrying proper identification and preparing to declare any goods they\u2019re bringing along.",
      "Swifties entering Canada by air can also save time by submitting their customs declaration in advance, according to the agency. And travelers entering by land can plan more efficiently by checking the current wait times at its various border crossings.",
      "\u201cThe CBSA invests significant effort planning and preparing for peak travel periods,\u201d a spokesperson told NBC News in an email. \u201cThe Agency monitors traveller volumes and works hard to minimize border wait times at ports of entry, without compromising safety and security.\u201d",
      "There's no \u2018Tayl-gating\u2019 allowed at the stadium",
      "Ticketless Swifties in Vancouver won\u2019t be gathering outside the stadium to sing along this time. Fans have enjoyed the tradition wherever it was allowed during the Eras Tour, as Swift\u2019s shows have often been accompanied by massive crowds in the stadiums' parking lots hoping to catch a glimpse or to simply absorb the tunes.",
      "But for her final three shows, the areas around BC Place will be off-limits to non-ticket-holders. Chris May, the venue\u2019s general manager, said in a media briefing last week that \u201cif you do not have tickets, there is no reason to Taylgate,\u201d The Canadian Press reported.",
      "\u201cThere is no designated outside gathering zone,\u201d May told reporters. \u201cOur focus is on keeping ticket holders and guests safe.\u201d",
      "BC Place confirmed to NBC News that the stadium will be fenced off around its perimeter, and its website stated that roads around the stadium will be closed from noon to midnight on show days.",
      "Will there be any surprises?",
      "The rumor mill has churned nonstop throughout the Eras Tour, and Swift\u2019s final show is no exception.",
      "As always, fans are clinging onto hope for the long-awaited announcement of one of her only two re-recorded albums still unreleased: \u201cReputation (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d and her debut, \u201cTaylor Swift (Taylor\u2019s Version).\u201d Others are crossing their fingers for the announcement of a behind-the-scenes Eras Tour documentary, or for Swift to add \u201cLong Live\u201d \u2014 a song largely understood as being dedicated to her fans \u2014 back to the setlist for the final shows.",
      "None of the rumors has been confirmed by Swift or her team, however, and it\u2019s common for the zealous speculations to lead nowhere. In the meantime, there\u2019s been some murmur online from fans who are planning their own surprise: singing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to Swift during the last night of the tour, the Sunday just before her  birthday on Dec. 13."

      "Dan Hevia has been laid off before \u2014 but this time feels different.",
      "Hevia, 42, a marketing and business development specialist based in the New York City area, has been out of work since the summer. In a recent LinkedIn post, he claimed he has filled out more than 1,000 job applications, with nothing to show for it.",
      "\u201cIf you had told me when I was laid off in June that I would approach 6 months without a job offer, I would laugh (hooray for confidence!),\u201d Hevia wrote. \u201cBut here it comes and boy does this job market humble you on a regular basis.\u201d",
      "In an interview with NBC News, Hevia said he holds out little hope for what the future brings for his career.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m continuing to apply with shaken confidence \u2014 if not totally broken,\u201d he said.",
      "For many workers, the euphoria of \u201cthe Great Resignation\u201d \u2014 a period following Covid-19 reopenings that brought a massive reshuffling of jobs and substantial wage gains \u2014 has given way to a new, far more uncertain environment.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported this week that even as layoffs remained subdued and job openings increased in October, the hiring rate ticked down to a level not seen since the U.S. was emerging from the financial crisis of the late 2000s.",
      "At 4.1%, the unemployment rate remains historically low. (For context: The unemployment rate never dropped below 5% in the 1970s or the 1980s.)",
      "Yet even as unemployment has fallen somewhat in recent months, it climbed substantially from its pandemic-era low of 3.4% in April 2023.",
      "On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release jobs data for November. Expectations were for the unemployment rate to have climbed from 4.1% to 4.2%, with 214,000 jobs added.",
      "Guy Berger, chief economist at the Burning Glass Institute, a labor market research group, said people who currently have jobs are unlikely to lose them.",
      "But there has rarely been a worse time in recent history to be looking for them.",
      "\u201cI buy arguments that it\u2019s a good job market,\u201d Berger said in a recent interview. But, he added, it is far from great.",
      "\u201cHiring is too low;\u00a0it\u2019s really hard to find a job,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s good that a lot of people are employed, but it\u2019s not obvious that we\u2019re on a good trajectory.\u201d",
      "Part of the problem appears to be a dramatic shift in the labor market back in favor of employers: A Gallup poll released Tuesday found U.S. workers are seeking new opportunities at the highest rate since 2015 as overall satisfaction with current employers has returned to a record low.",
      "In a write-up of the survey, Gallup analysts referred to the current period as \u201cthe Great Detachment,\u201d noting that the widespread disruptive and organizational changes in the wake of the pandemic have left workers feeling burned out.",
      "There are two key observations from the survey:",
      "Fewer than half the workers Gallup surveyed reported \u201cknowing what\u2019s expected of them at work.\u201dAnd just 30% said they \u201cstrongly agree\u201d that the mission or purpose of their companies make them feel their jobs are important.",
      "Fewer than half the workers Gallup surveyed reported \u201cknowing what\u2019s expected of them at work.\u201d",
      "And just 30% said they \u201cstrongly agree\u201d that the mission or purpose of their companies make them feel their jobs are important.",
      "Both of those findings are record lows for the survey.",
      "Meanwhile, many managers are contending with smaller budgets, shifting personnel and new responsibilities, Gallup said.",
      "\u201cAcross the U.S. workforce, people are becoming more disconnected from their employer on critical metrics,\u201d one of the survey\u2019s analysts, Ben Wigert, a director of research and strategy at Gallup, said in an interview.",
      "Gallup\u2019s workplace metrics are similar to where they were in 2015, Wigert said. But the context is different.",
      "\u201cWith the current jobs market cooling down quite a bit from the Great Resignation, and with inflation, people don\u2019t feel secure making the leap\u201d to new roles, Wigert said. \u201cSo they\u2019re stuck with this discontent. It\u2019s a very different situation.\u201d",
      "Voters consistently ranked the U.S. economy as their top concern heading into the November presidential election. But neither Kamala Harris nor Donald Trump offered economic visions that emphasized abundant job growth. Ultimately, voters punished the Biden-Harris administration for creating an uncertain economic environment as they hoped for a return to the one that prevailed during Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Though many voters believe business conditions are likely to improve as Trump moves back into the Oval Office amid promises of looser regulations, it isn\u2019t clear how much the labor market will improve from here. In its 2025 economic outlook, Wells Fargo economists say the unemployment rate is likely to stay at current levels while payroll growth slows.",
      "\u201cThe completion of [pandemic] \u2018catch-up\u2019 hiring in industries that have disproportionately driven payroll growth over the past year (e.g., healthcare, government, and leisure & hospitality), a generally more muted economic growth backdrop due to tariffs, still-restrictive monetary policy and a slower-growing pool of workers are all likely to contribute to the more modest pace of job gains,\u201d the economists wrote.",
      "Essentially, a slowing job market and economic conditions that are still too tight for comfort mean hiring is likely to keep trudging for a while longer.",
      "Not all economists agree that the U.S. labor market is experiencing unusual tensions \u2014 and what frictions do exist have, in certain cases, immediately identifiable causes. In a note last month surveying the state of the U.S. economy, analysts with Goldman Sachs said the immigration surge of the past two years was causing the unemployment rate to increase.",
      "With border apprehensions plummeting, job opportunities in many sectors should begin to ease, they said.",
      "\u201cJob openings are high and the layoff rate is low,\u201d the analysts wrote. \u201cWhile we have yet to see definitive evidence of labor market stabilization, trend job growth appears to be strong enough to stabilize and eventually lower the unemployment rate now that immigration is slowing.\u201d",
      "In a separate note released Wednesday, Thomas Ryan, an analyst with the Capital Economics research group, said recent BLS data showed the labor market was \u201cfinding a floor\u201d and \u201cstabilizing at a healthy level\u201d as firms remain \u201cslow to hire and fire.\u201d",
      "Yet a hiring boom like the one that occurred during the pandemic reopenings may not emerge for some time, according to analysts with Vanguard.",
      "\u201cLarge employers are proceeding with caution in hiring new workers,\u201d they wrote in a recent report. \u201cIn addition, hiring activity for lower-income jobs continues to normalize from the highs of the pandemic recovery.\u201d",
      "While improving labor productivity, in part from gains in artificial intelligence, will remain strong in 2025, it is likely to result in fewer job cuts. \u201cThe rate at which firms hire new workers will likely hold at its current modest level,\u201d the Vanguard analysts said.",
      "For workers like Hevia, that may mean no timetable for an end to job-search anxieties. For now, he has sought consulting work as he continues to submit applications, though he has reduced his expectations for a position and a salary at the senior level he held before.",
      "\u201cAt this point, anything is better than nothing,\u201d he said."

      "The Detroit Lions outlasted the Green Bay Packers on Thursday, clinching a playoff berth and improving to 12-1 by taking one big risk after another.",
      "Those decisions paid off with a 34-31 win against the Packers that keeps the Lions in the running for the top seed in the NFC.",
      "Detroit coach Dan Campbell watched as his team converted twice on fourth down to score touchdowns. He watched as another fourth-down try in the fourth quarter backfired and allowed division rival Green Bay to take the lead. But with 43 seconds left in the fourth quarter and with the opportunity to kick a go-ahead field goal, Campbell took his biggest risk of them all, turning down a chance to win the game with a field goal by going for it again on fourth down.",
      "Convert and Detroit would be able to score and leave the Packers no time on the clock for a rebuttal. Fail and Green Bay quarterback Jordan Love would get the ball and an opportunity to hand the Lions their first loss since Week 2.",
      "The Lions converted, even though quarterback Jared Goff stumbled to the turf while handing the ball off. Two plays later, Detroit\u2019s Jake Bates kicked the game-winning field goal as time expired.",
      "Goff threw for 283 yards, three touchdowns and an interception. David Montgomery, who ran for the crucial first down in the final minute, added a touchdown run.",
      "The win is Detroit's franchise record 11th in a row.",
      "The Packers (9-4) were led by three rushing touchdowns by Josh Jacobs, but they were held to 99 rushing yards overall, more than 40 yards below their season average.",
      "Christian Watson caught four passes for 114 yards from Love, who threw for 206 yards and a touchdown.",
      "Green Bay\u2019s slim hopes to win the NFC North, the NFL\u2019s toughest division, hinged on their knocking off the Lions. Green Bay trailed 17-7 at halftime but took the lead after they scored 14 points in the third quarter. It was one of five lead changes in the game."

      "JERUSALEM \u2014 The ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah appeared on the verge of collapse this week \u2014 something that is not a surprise to many Israelis.",
      "Both sides accused the other of violating last week\u2019s ceasefire arrangement. On Monday night, Israeli strikes on two southern Lebanese villages killed at least 10 people, Lebanon\u2019s Public Health Ministry said. That was a response to an earlier Hezbollah attack on Israeli military positions in the disputed Shebaa Farms, which itself was in retaliation for what the militant group said were multiple ceasefire violations.",
      "While Israel says it has achieved its military goals of weakening Hezbollah, the ceasefire that went into effect Nov. 27 did not resolve, from its perspective, a major systemic issue: how to make sure Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s most powerful proxy group, does not threaten Israel with an incursion like Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were kidnapped.",
      "Limor Ben-Avi, 47, fled her home in the border city of Kiryat Shimona 14 months ago and has been living in hotels in Eilat and Tiberias ever since. Ben-Avi, the mother of twin 6-year-olds, said she had adjusted to the threat from the missiles that had streaked across the sky from Lebanon even before the war.",
      "The Oct. 7 Hamas attack changed her calculation.",
      "\u201cA shelter won\u2019t help. Nothing will help you. The thought that they had a plan to conquer Kiryat Shimon is what scares us more than the missiles,\u201d she said, referring to the fear that Hezbollah will send fighters across the border the way Hamas did. \u201cIt\u2019s the idea that on one fine bright day, they could come into our home and do what they did to the people in the south.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t depend on the Lebanese army to protect us from Hezbollah,\u201d Ben-Avi added, given that the ceasefire relies partly on Lebanon\u2019s beleaguered and weak military to monitor compliance."

    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The head of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s governing party on Friday signaled more openness to his removal as president for plunging the key U.S. ally into chaos with a short-lived declaration of martial law, reversing his position the day before an impeachment vote.",
      "Han Dong-hoon, leader of the conservative People Power Party (PPP), had earlier said he opposed impeaching Yoon because it would only create more turmoil. But on Friday he said he had learned that Yoon ordered the arrest of prominent politicians in addition to declaring martial law, an order that was lifted six hours later after lawmakers voted to reject it.",
      "\u201cIn light of these new revelations, I have come to the conclusion that it is necessary to suspend President Yoon from exercising his mandate to protect the South Korea and its people,\u201d Han said, adding that Yoon was \u201cnot acknowledging his wrongdoings.\u201d",
      "If Yoon continues as president, Han said, \u201cI fear that there will be a great risk of radical actions such as this state of emergency repeating, and he will put South Korea and its people in great danger.\u201d",
      "Han\u2019s comments increased the likelihood that Yoon will be impeached when a vote is held around 7 p.m. local time Saturday (5 a.m. ET). The opposition bloc holds 192 of the unicameral legislature\u2019s 300 seats, just under the two-thirds majority needed for the motion to pass.",
      "The PPP, which repudiated Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration, had asked him to leave the party but said earlier that it opposed the impeachment motion. Before Han changed his position, at least eight lawmakers from the PPP would have had to break with their party in order for it to pass.",
      "Six opposition parties had proposed impeaching Yoon over the martial law order, which banned political activity and censored the media. If Yoon is impeached, he will be suspended from office until the Constitutional Court decides whether to uphold the motion, with a deadline of 180 days.",
      "South Korean police and prosecutors are also investigating claims of insurrection and treason against Yoon, former Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun, whose resignation Yoon accepted on Thursday, and Interior Minister Lee Sang-min.",
      "The deeply unpopular Yoon, 63, whose approval rating was already at 19% before the emergency martial law, had blamed opposition lawmakers in his declaration, accusing them of paralyzing the government by seeking the impeachment of multiple government officials and slashing critical funding from next year\u2019s national budget.",
      "He also accused his opponents of sympathizing with nuclear-armed North Korea, a reclusive communist state with which the South technically remains at war.",
      "Yoon has not made any public appearances since lifting the martial law order on Wednesday. On Friday, lawmakers at the National Assembly, which was swarmed by almost 300 martial law troops on Tuesday after Yoon declared martial law in a surprise late-night TV address, linked arms to block the entrance amid concerns that he might visit.",
      "Opposition lawmakers have expressed concern that Yoon might declare martial law a second time if he is impeached or even earlier.",
      "\u201cI feel that danger is imminent tonight,\u201d Lee Jae-myung, leader of the liberal opposition Democratic Party, said Friday. \u201cI have a gut feeling that something might happen again tonight or early morning tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Acting Defense Minister Kim Seon-ho dismissed such concerns and said that even if Yoon made such an attempt, the Ministry of Defense and the South Korean military \u201cwould categorically reject it.\u201d",
      "Yoon\u2019s special forces commander, Kwak Jong-keun, also said Friday that it would be impossible for Yoon to declare martial law again \u201cbecause I will refuse to comply with any such order.\u201d",
      "Kwak was among three officers the Ministry of National Defense suspended from duty on Friday, along with Lt. Gen. Lee Jin-woo, head of the Capital Defense Command, and Lt. Gen. Yeo In-hyung, head of the Defense Counterintelligence Command.",
      "The ministry also said it had requested overseas travel bans for 10 active-duty officers, including Kwak, Lee, Yeo and Gen. Park Ahn-soo, who as army chief of staff was named martial law commander. All four are accused of treason, the ministry said, adding that three brigadier generals and three commanders who were confirmed to have deployed soldiers made up the other six.",
      "In a call Thursday with his South Korean counterpart, Cho Tae-yul, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed \u201cdeep concerns\u201d about the martial law declaration and welcomed the lifting of the order.",
      "\u201cThe Secretary conveyed\u00a0his confidence in the democratic resilience of the ROK during this period, and noted he expects the ROK\u2019s democratic process to prevail,\u201d the State Department readout said, using an abbreviation for South Korea\u2019s formal name, the Republic of Korea.",
      "Blinken also reaffirmed the \u201cironclad\u201d nature of the U.S. alliance with South Korea, which it views as an important bulwark against North Korea, China and Russia, and which hosts almost 30,000 American troops.",
      "The U.S. confirmed Thursday that meetings of the U.S.-South Korea Nuclear Consultative Group and related tabletop military exercises that were planned in Washington this week had been postponed amid the turmoil in South Korea.",

      "\u201cHong said that such a directive was ridiculous,\u201d Kim said, \u201cand although the key leadership meeting at the NIS was held, the meeting ended without a conclusion.\u201d",
      "Hong was later contradicted by his boss, NIS director Cho Tae-yong, who told reporters that Yoon gave no such direct order.",
      "Yoon\u2019s office has not commented on the allegations.",
      "The accounts by military officers and government officials may have played a role in the PPP\u2019s changing position, said Eun A Jo, a postdoctoral fellow at the\u00a0Dickey Center for International Understanding\u00a0at Dartmouth.",
      "\u201cI think given that kind of evidence, it\u2019s difficult for the ruling party to protect Yoon,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you are seeing more people kind of turning their backs.\u201d",
      "South Korea\u2019s National Election Commission said Friday that after the martial law declaration on Tuesday, about 300 troops infiltrated its headquarters and related facilities in what the commission called \u201ca clear violation of the Constitution and the law.\u201d",
      "The soldiers confiscated the mobile phones of five people on duty and restricted access to the premises, the commission said, occupying its headquarters for about 3 hours and 20 minutes.",
      "\u201cWhile it has been confirmed that no internal materials were taken by the troops thus far, a thorough and continuous review will be conducted to verify any potential damages,\u201d the commission said in a statement.",

      "Probation reports from 2015 and 2022 noted that Litton had severe mental health issues going back to age 16, Butte County District Attorney Michael Ramsey said at the news conference.",
      "Litton had served prison time for identity theft and other theft, and he was described as essentially homeless, splitting his time between Sacramento and the Chico area, according to Honea and other officials.",
      "Litton is believed to have targeted the school of around 35 students because of its affiliation with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Honea said.",
      "He may have been looking at another school to target but ultimately chose the Feather River school. Investigators found he had also researched an Adventist school in Red Bluff, which is northwest of Chico, Honea said.",
      "Litton had attended a Seventh-day Adventist school in the community of Paradise, also in Butte County, as a child. He may also have had a relative who attended the school he attacked many years ago, but Litton had no current involvement or connection with that school, Honea said.",
      "He used a fake ID to schedule an appointment with the school a couple of days before the attack, under the guise of wanting to enroll a grandson there, Honea said.",
      "That was a ruse for Litton, who does not have a grandson, to get onto campus, Honea said. After what was described as a cordial discussion with the school\u2019s principal, Litton left, then turned toward a playground and opened fire, Honea said.",
      "The school called 911 at 1:08 p.m. to report an active shooter. By the time a California Highway Patrol officer arrived at the school, Litton was dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Honea said.",
      "A vigil will be held Friday in nearby Oroville at a tree lighting event downtown.",
      "Laurie Trujillo, director of communication for the Northern California Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, said the school and the conference community are shocked. All of its schools were closed Thursday.",
      "\"We are absolutely devastated by this senseless act of violence,\" she said. \"Our church members here in the Northern California Conference continue to pray for all of those who have been affected by this tragedy.\"",

      "The civil verdict, announced in an Orange County courtroom after roughly an hour of deliberation, was against the Austrian company that manufactured the ride, Funtime Handels GmbH.",
      "\u201cThis verdict is a step forward in holding corporations accountable for the safety of their products,\u201d family attorney Ben Crump said in a statement. \u201cThe jury\u2019s decision confirms what we have long argued: Tyre\u2019s death was the result of blatant negligence and a failure to prioritize safety over profits.\u201d",

      "The University of Michigan Board of Regents did not vote on whether to defund its diversity, equity and inclusion program at its final meeting of the year Thursday following protests on campus to keep the embattled program intact.",
      "The board did, however, decide it will no longer require diversity statements for faculty members during hiring or promotion, a significant reposition for the university.",
      "The board did not directly say it would not vote on disbanding its DEI program, which has reportedly spent $250 million on diversity initiatives since 2016. But members spoke in general terms, warning, \u201cDon\u2019t believe everything you read on the internet.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are no plans to make any cuts to these programs,\u201d board member Michael Behm said.",
      "The board also increased household income requirements in a program that allows qualified students tuition-free admission. The Go Blue Guarantee grants free tuition to high-achieving in-state students with family incomes of less than $125,000 \u2014 up now from $65,000.",
      "University President Santa J. Ono said the increase aims to make education at the school more accessible and equitable for students across the state.",
      "Mark Bernstein, a board member, said the program, which falls under the umbrella of Michigan\u2019s vast DEI program, was important because \u201cintelligence and talent are spread equally across society, but opportunity is not. ... This is an extraordinary commitment to this state and to the future of this state.\u201d",
      "Board member Sandra Hubbard said, \u201cThis means we\u2019re open for business for all walks of life, and people should feel comfortable on this campus expressing diversity of thought and freedom of expression from places throughout the state and the world.\u201d",
      "Some had taken Hubbard\u2019s interview with Fox News after a November campus rally to support DEI to mean the board would vote to defund the massive DEI program. That came after an expansive New York Times Magazine article raised questions about the program\u2019s effectiveness.",
      "The Michigan Daily, the student newspaper, obtained a Nov. 20 letter to the Faculty Senate that indicated the board met privately in early November to discuss defunding DEI initiatives in the next fiscal year.",
      "More than 500 students and faculty and staff members rallied on campus, objecting to the potential disruption of the program for the 51,000-student campus.",
      "While there was no vote to defund the program, the decision on faculty diversity statements did alarm proponents of the program. During the hearing, several students and a few faculty members emphasized their support for DEI to the Board of Regents.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen it all over the nation,\" student Yasin Lowe said. \"DEI has been added to the long list of dog whistles and buzzwords that many bureaucrats are now too scared to touch. Many have DEI completely wrong, instilling terror and fear for a reason I must attribute to ignorance at best, malice at worst.\u201d",
      "Another student, Nicholas Love, challenged Michigan to \u201creflect on who it serves, who it excludes, who it claims to be and create a model where we are consistently improving access to education and prosperity.\u201d",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has already promised to pull back on DEI at colleges that receive federal funding. Some states, like Texas and Florida, have banned DEI programs at state-funded universities.",
      "Keith Riles, a physics professor at Michigan, said he would like all DEI programs eliminated. He used the term \u201cDIE,\u201d popularized by Elon Musk, calling the program \u201cdiscrimination\u201d and the Black Lives Matter Movement a \u201cgrift.\u201d",
      "\u201cI urge you to rip out all DEI industrial complex,\u201d Riles said. He added that affirmative action is \u201crepackaged as DEI. It\u2019s corrosive to this institution. ... DEI is the only systemic racism that has existed on this campus.\u201d"

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 10:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump won't be president for another 45 days, but the president-in-waiting isn't shying away from acting like the president-in-reality.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Foreign leaders have lined up to speak with him. He has rattled Mexico and Canada with threats of steep tariffs and warned there would be \u201chell to pay\u201d for militants in Gaza unless they release the hostages by the time he\u2019s sworn in.",
      "That won't happen for another 45 days, but Donald Trump, the president-in-waiting, isn't shying away from acting like the president-in-reality.",
      "Trump can't sign a bill or issue an executive order yet, but he is crowding out Joe Biden as the sitting president winds down his term and steadily recedes from public view. In two foreign trips since the election, Biden has answered all of two questions from reporters.",
      "He has been left to kibitz about Trump\u2019s pronouncements \u2014 \u201cI hope he rethinks it,\u201d he said of Trump\u2019s plan to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico \u2014 rather than drive an agenda of his own.",
      "As for Trump, \u201chis view is that he\u2019s not going to follow rules that he thinks are stupid rules,\u201d said a former senior White House official in Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cHis view is these are hostages and if he can help bring them home, then why would he follow protocol if it\u2019s going to impact peoples\u2019 lives?\u201d",
      "At this point, Trump is \u201calready basically running things, and he\u2019s not even president yet,\u201d the person added.",
      "Trump\u2019s penchant for plunging into current affairs is testing the one-at-a-time dictum that presidents are supposed to honor but, for reasons of political expediency or practical necessity, usually don\u2019t.",
      "\u201cHe would probably argue, \u2018I\u2019m more than a private citizen at this point; I\u2019m president-elect, and I\u2019m going to have all the powers of the presidency in a couple of months.\u2019 But that doesn\u2019t mean you get to start before you\u2019re inaugurated,\u201d said Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif.",
      "This weekend, Trump will join French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris for the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral five years after it was devastated by fire. Biden was invited but opted not to attend, a White House official said.",
      "Trump\u2019s return to the world stage after a four-year hiatus, coupled with news about his hires, has overshadowed Biden\u2019s trip to sub-Saharan Africa this week, in which he faced fallout from the sweeping pardon he gave his son Hunter.",
      "\u201cGiven the weakness of the current president and the speed at which things develop in the modern world, Trump is, in effect, a presumptive president,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, a Republican former House speaker and a Trump ally. \u201cCertainly, foreign governments are treating him that way.\u201d",
      "If Biden is unhappy about being upstaged, he hasn\u2019t offered any hints. In fact, Trump\u2019s interventions may prove helpful to the degree they complement Biden\u2019s larger goals.",
      "A senior Biden administration official cited Trump\u2019s social media post warning of \u201chell to pay\u201d unless the hostages are freed from Gaza by Inauguration Day. That message doesn\u2019t hurt the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to secure the hostages\u2019 release in exchange for a ceasefire, the official said.",
      "A president-elect\u2019s first and overriding task is to build a Cabinet and a senior White House team ahead of the four-year term. But Trump and a few of his predecessors haven\u2019t hesitated to dip a toe into real-time crises if so moved.",
      "As he prepared to take office in 2016, Trump tried to salvage jobs that the corporate parent of Carrier, a heating and air conditioning company, had planned to move from Indiana to Mexico.",
      "And he weighed in on Boeing\u2019s plans to build the next generation of presidential aircraft, decrying the expense. \u201cCancel order!\u201d he tweeted as president-elect in 2016.",
      "\u201cAfter 10 years, if you think that President Trump is somehow abiding by norms and traditions, you\u2019ve been living under a rock,\u201d Sean Spicer, Trump\u2019s former White House press secretary, said in an interview. \u201cThis is not a guy who is concerned about traditions, norms, etc. He\u2019s a guy who wants to get stuff done. He\u2019s not going to sit back and wait until Inauguration Day. And it works.\u201d",
      "At least one Republican lawmaker questioned whether Trump's approach does, indeed, work. After Trump warned that he would slap tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China unless they cracked down on the movement of migrants and drugs across the U.S. border, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau flew to Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s Florida estate, to see him.",
      "Trudeau\u2019s support in Canada has been slipping. He faces a tough re-election bid, and the spectacle of him racing to Mar-a-Lago for an audience with Trump risked making him look like a supplicant.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s smart for him [Trump] to humiliate Trudeau like he has,\u201d a Republican senator said, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk freely. \u201cCanada is a good friend and is not a problem.\u201d",
      "The senator said: \u201cTrump was elected to break some plates, but he doesn\u2019t have a huge mandate. This is a 50-50 country. We\u2019ve got midterm [elections] coming and we\u2019ve got one year to deliver, and it\u2019s going to be hard to get prices down with these tariffs.\u201d",
      "More than a norm, the idea that a president-elect should defer to the sitting president in the realm of foreign policy has roots in law. A Supreme Court ruling in 1936 held that the president possesses \u201cexclusive power ... as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations.\u201d",
      "Barbara Perry, a professor of presidential studies at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center for Public Affairs, said the ruling confirms the court\u2019s view that \u201cthe Founding Fathers and the Constitution want the United States to speak with one voice, and that voice should be the president of the United States.\u201d",
      "One danger of a president-elect\u2019s injecting himself into an active debate before he takes office is that something could go wrong, raising the question of who would be accountable, Perry said.",
      "If Trump\u2019s warning prompted Hamas to execute the hostages before he took office, for example, \u201cwho would be responsible for that?\u201d she asked.",
      "Still, presidents-elect have been hard-pressed to absent themselves from issues they\u2019ll be inheriting before long. Dwight D. Eisenhower traveled to Korea ahead of his inauguration in 1953 to see for himself whether the war there was winnable. On the ground, he met with South Korean President Syngman Rhee, dismissed scenarios for escalating the war and came away convinced the fighting needed to end.",
      "Barack Obama was selective in how he chose to engage before he took office in the thick of a global financial crisis in 2008. When President George W. Bush invited Obama to a meeting of world leaders devoted to the downturn, Obama declined. An Obama spokeswoman said, \u201cWe really felt strong that there was only one president at a time and George Bush was the president.\u201d",
      "Yet Obama injected himself into legislative debates at the time, calling for extending unemployment benefits. He was more reticent when it came to fighting between Palestinians and Israelis \u2014 an intractable dispute that, of course, continues to this day.",
      "A Washington Post article three weeks before Obama took office quoted a government professor as saying, \u201cIt seems clear he\u2019s just cherry-picking those things that can serve his purpose and staying as far away from Middle East troubles as he can.\u201d"

Now, as a gift ahead of the most wonderful time of year, they are exclusively premiering the music video for their new Christmas song \u201cSanta\u201d on TODAY.com.",
      "The song is a melancholic tune about missing someone on Christmas and hoping to get them back. The accompanying visual is a timeless concept, with Wheeler and Zambrano elegantly dressed as they belt out the emotional lyrics on stage, apart and then together. They're also accompanied by dancers dressed in festive attire.",
      "\u201cWhen people create a great Christmas song, it lasts forever,\u201d Wheeler tells TODAY.com in Spanish about the song's inspiration. \u201cSo I told my wife, let\u2019s make a Christmas song together so that every Christmas, people will play it when they are sad. And because we make sad songs, it had to be a sad Christmas song.\u201d",

      "Zambrano adds that they opted for a different take on a holiday tune, deciding to look at the \u201cdesamor,\u201d or heartbreak that many people experience during this time of year. \u201cIt\u2019s a bittersweet song,\u201d she says, adding she hopes their fans embrace it as much as they have their past collaborations.",
      "The couple, who have yet to show their daughter's face on social media, didn't include Aiunii in the music video \u2014 but they already have an idea of when they might.",

      "They're also looking forward to new and old traditions as a family of three.",
      "\u201cMy parents would always make us believe in El Ni\u00f1o Jes\u00fas and Santa, that they would come at 12 and deliver the gifts,\u201d Zambrano says. \u201cI always thought that was so much fun. When I found out that it wasn\u2019t real, I was really sad because I feel like I kind of lost a little bit of that magic of Christmas. But now I get to live it all over again with my baby, and have a couple of years of making magic for her every year.\u201d",
      "For Wheeler, he wants to make sure his daughter's first Christmas is special and memorable. \u201cSo when she\u2019s older and sees photos, she says, \u2018You did this for me?\u2019 And I can say, \u2018Yes, because it was your first Christmas.'\u201d",
      "Calling each other \u201cmejores amigos,\u201d Wheeler says parenthood has strengthened their relationship because \u201cnos amamos bonitos,\u201d adding in Spanish: \u201cI make sure she\u2019s OK, she makes sure I\u2019m OK... We are always adapting to every change that comes our way.\u201d",
      "Zambrano adds, \u201cWe are more of a team now that we have the baby, because we have to work together in order to get everything running. Right now, we\u2019re doing a bunch of things, but since we\u2019re doing it together, it\u2019s a bit easier. I feel like it has helped us grow as a couple, as a team, and I just think she makes us stronger.\u201d",
      "Fans can expect more music from the twosome, as they teased something in the works.",
      "\u201cWe love making music together,\u201d Zambrano says. \u201cWe have a couple of songs already recorded, but we have something else in the works for that, maybe another project later on. But for now, I hope everyone enjoys this one that we did with so much love.\u201d"

    "summary": "Ariana Grande spoke candidly about the body-shaming she has felt during her career.",
    "story": [
      "Ariana Grande has a message for anyone who will listen: Stop commenting on each other's bodies.",
      "During the London leg of the \"Wicked\" press tour, Grande reflected on the criticism surrounding her body over the course of her career. The conversation took place with French journalist Salima Jeanne Poumbga, known professionally as Sally, in an interview with Grande's co-star Cynthia Erivo.",
      "\"How do you cope with beauty standards to critics?\" Sally asked. \"Because this is something that is so overwhelming for women to always look perfect. How do you deal with that?\"",
      "The question visibly struck an emotional chord with Grande. \"My goodness,\" she replied before taking a pause to collect herself. \"I'm not gonna...\"",
      "The moment set the tone for an intimate discussion on the weight of societal beauty ideals as Grande reflected on her own life.",
      "\"I've been kind of doing this in front of the public and kind of been, you know, a specimen in a petri dish, really, since I was 16 or 17,\" Grande explained, adding that commentary about her appearance has been a constant presence in her life. \"I've heard every version of it, of what's wrong with me, and then you fix it, and then it's wrong for different reasons.\"",
      "This isn't the first time Grande has spoken on this topic. In April 2023, she addressed the mounting speculation she faced about her health and body with a post on TikTok.",
      "\u201cI just wanted to address your concerns about my body and talk a little bit about what it means to a person with a body and to be seen \u2026 to be paid this close attention to,\u201d she explained.\u00a0 \u201cI think we should be gentler and less comfortable commenting on people\u2019s bodies, no matter what.\u201d",

      "\"Even just the simplest thing, your appearance, you know, you're young, and you're hearing all kinds of things, it's hard to protect yourself from that noise,\" she said. \"Even if you go to Thanksgiving dinner and someone's granny says, 'Oh, my God, you look skinnier, what happened?' or 'You look heavier, what happened?' It's like, that is something that is uncomfortable and horrible no matter where it's happening, no matter the scale it's happening on.\"",

      "\u201cIn today\u2019s society, there\u2019s a comfortability that we shouldn\u2019t have at all, commenting on others\u2019 looks, appearance, what they think is going on behind the scenes, or health, or how they present themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a comfortability that people have commenting on that that I think is really dangerous.\u201d",
      "She went on to\u00a0credit her personal support system for keeping her grounded and confident.",
      "\"I'm really lucky to have the support system that I have and to just know and trust that I'm beautiful,\" she said. \"I know what the pressure of that noise feels like. It's been a resident in my life since I was 17, and I just don't invite it in anymore. It's not welcome.\"",
      "The singer also took some credit for herself, noting that she's learned how to focus on what matters to her most when the pressure becomes too loud.",
      "\"I have work to do. I have a life to live. I have friends to love on. I have so much love, and it's not invited, so I don't leave space for it anymore,\"\u00a0she said before encouraging others to do the same for themselves. \"You keep yourself safe, because no one has the right to say shit.\""

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 18:35:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Inspired by Rachel Yoder\u2019s novel, \"Nightbitch,\" recently adapted to a film starring Amy Adams, I transformed into a dog named Sparkles to connect with my son.",
    "story": [
      "In the fall of 2023 two seemingly unrelated events happened to me: I hit a rough patch with my then 4-year-old, and I picked up the novel \u201cNightbitch\u201d by Rachel Yoder. Usually I resisted what I deemed \u201cmommy lit\u201d (obviously a mistake on my part related to ingrained internalized misogyny), but the raw slab of steak on the novel\u2019s cover called to me. At the time I was struggling externally with my son\u2019s behaviors and internally with my identity as a parent.",
      "\u201cMother\u201d wasn\u2019t a label I clamored to claim.",
      "When my firstborn arrived, I was struck by the obvious: overwhelming love, anxiety and a newfound sense of responsibility. Within hours of my son\u2019s birth, another more bizarre feeling cropped up: the urge to hide from my new title of mother. This was likely due to the well-worn knowledge that the label \u201cmother\u201d was the fastest way to detach a woman from herself, more disconnecting even than \u201cwife.\u201d All women, whether or not they are married or have children, are brought up to outstrip themselves from their natural selves. We are taught to adjust our emotions, looks and desires to fit within societal boxes. This push to conform is even more compounded for mothers.",
      "Personal history and pop culture had taught me that mothers were not fully formed people, but rather caricatures with hardened truths. Mothers were supposed to be instinctual,\u00a0self-scarifying, pleasant, asexual and fully devoted at all times.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t want to be or be seen as a reduction of a person, so I kept my distance from mommy-related tropes and hoped my friends without children didn\u2019t see me as \u201cone of those\u201d moms.",
      "I didn\u2019t want to be or be seen as a reduction of a person, so I kept my distance from mommy-related tropes and hoped my friends without children didn\u2019t see me as \u201cone of those\u201d moms.",
      "Other women I knew were also fighting the overshadowing title of \u201cmommy.\u201d One friend confided in me that she didn\u2019t allow her cycling instructor to become Instagram friends with her because she didn\u2019t want him to know she was a mom. She revered this 50-minute space where once a week someone thought she was a mysterious, possibly sexy, unattached woman out in the world. Instinctively she knew his knowledge of her full identity would dissolve this.",
      "And then came \u201cNightbitch.\u201d",
      "I read along as the mother narrator struggled with her own feral son. In the book, it was taking her hours to put him to bed, which brought about a nighttime rage in her that at times turned her so dissimilar and intense that it frightened her son and husband. I was intimately familiar with that particular rage and had never seen it discussed anywhere or with any of my mom friends. I relayed this matching sensation to my wife, who then happily referred to me as Nightbitch during my own bouts of evening anger. In the novel, I read as the nameless mother struggled with feeling disconnected from her old creative self, and with the push and pull of wanting to be with her child while simultaneously far away from the domestic. While it wasn\u2019t a life-changing read at first, I welcomed seeing the reflection of the mundane and exhausting mirrored back.",
      "In my own home, nothing was making my kid happy. Seemingly overnight everything according to him was \u201cstupid\u201d or \u201cboring,\u201d and worse, he was resistant to everyday routines. At night he chucked his toothbrush across the bathroom and screamed in protest, and in the morning he greeted my singsong wake-ups with animal howls (and hurling stuffed animals). I attempted reward charts, talking to him man-to-man, and yelling (and then apologizing because I\u2019m a millennial gentle parent). Finally I gave up hoping it was a phase.",
      "But I kept reading. One night as we sat side by side on the couch, him watching \u201cPeppa Pig,\u201d me consuming \u201cNightbitch,\u201d the following passage jumped out at me: \u201cShe likes the idea of being a dog. She can run free if she wants. She can be a body and instinct and urge. She can be hunger and rage, thirst and fear, nothing more.\u201d",
      "I put down the book and thought about what it would feel like to crawl around on all fours. To bark. To not communicate through words. To not resist hunger, or tamper my rage. Like a dog, what would it be like to allow all the parts of myself to just be, without twisting them into a more presentable package? After all, this was the issue with motherhood (and womanhood, really): We are expected to hide our mess. It might feel great to be an animal \u2014 all id, no ego, I thought. But how silly would that be? I wrangled my kid to bed while the lingering thoughts of trotting around my apartment on my hands and knees played in the backdrop of my mind.",
      "The next morning, with nothing to lose, I decided to go full Nightbitch. When I went into my son\u2019s room, I didn\u2019t sing or give the typical good morning salutation. I turned on the light, dropped to the ground and crawled inside, making high-pitched barking sounds. His sleepy eyes opened. He stared at me, confused, but not mad.",
      "\u201cRuff, ruff,\u201d I barked, climbing into his bed, licking his face and nuzzling him awake. Of course, he was thrilled. I proceeded to carry him his clothes piece by piece using my mouth, and maintained barking sounds as encouragement while he got dressed.",
      "Without questioning what happened to his mom, my son happily pet me. \u201cSparkles,\u201d he quickly decided, inventing my dog name.",
      "The more I read \u201cNightbitch,\u201d it was illuminated that as the narrator mother leaned into her nature, hunger and desires, the more she felt like herself, even with her updated mother identity. Leaning in caused her to feel better. She mothered better. In a favorite scene, Nightbitch and her son sloppily chow down on chunks of raw meat at the playground in front of gobsmacked parents. Finally, they are a team \u2014 a pack. I realized that while I can\u2019t always throw societal norms out the window, the idea of connecting with myself and my kid in ways that felt natural was a good place to start."

      "In a recent episode of the \u201cHow to Fail With Elizabeth Day\u201d podcast, the actor and director of the film said there were moments when he \u201cwould just have to leave\u201d the set.",
      "Baldoni not only brought Colleen Hoover's megahit book to life as director, but he also portrayed the troubled and abusive Ryle, who marries Blake Lively's character, Lily. The actor told host Elizabeth Day that it took him time to process and leave behind his complicated character after filming ended.",
      "\u201cDirecting is a very lonely job, I\u2019ll just be very candid. Because you are kind of at the top of this totem pole. In your moments of quiet, everybody has a thousand questions for you and also nobody wants to disturb you,\u201d Baldoni said. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t really have many people to talk to, and you can\u2019t necessarily share your anxiety or your nervousness about something because you\u2019re also the leader.\u201d",
      "Calling it \u201ca very strange place to be,\u201d he explained how also portraying a tumultuous character like Ryle affected him.",

I mean, I\u2019ve done a lot of somatic therapy so there were times when I was actually just shaking.\u201d",
      "Baldoni recalled having a \u201cnear breakdown\u201d after filming a scene where Ryle has Lily\u2019s phone and finds a phone number from someone else.",
      "While Ryle, he said, is \u201cvery jealous,\u201d heartbroken and angry, \u201che doesn\u2019t harm her, but you can see in his eyes how dangerous he is. After that scene, I had a near breakdown. And I had to leave and just cry and shake because there was so much pain.\u201d",
      "Baldoni shared that it was hard to have Ryle's trauma live in his body, \u201ccreating that insecurity and the pain and the feeling that you shouldn\u2019t actually be (feeling).\u201d",
      "\u201cThat was very hard and that took a few months,\u201d he said of releasing those feelings. \u201cI had dreams as him for a while, and it lived in my body, but I think for the most part, he\u2019s out.\u201d",
      "The release of \"It Ends With Us,\" which will arrive on Netflix Dec. 9, was met with criticisms and controversy surrounding what some called the romanticizing of domestic abuse. Some domestic violence survivors told TODAY.com that their criticisms include the lack of a trigger warning and resources as well as promotional content that seemed to depict the film as lighthearted. (Sony Pictures Entertainment, the film\u2019s distributor, declined to comment on the criticism at the time.)",
      "In the podcast interview, Baldoni briefly touched on how he wanted to approach the film with caution when it came to the subject matter.",
      "\u201cI just didn\u2019t want to re-traumatize the majority of my audience, which is why I was advocating for a trigger warning at the front and things like that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut those are certain battles that you can\u2019t always win.\u201d",
      "It was also rumored that there was cast drama behind the scenes of the making of \"It Ends With Us,\" specifically between Baldoni and Lively, who is credited as a producer. The two co-stars didn't do any press together and didn't take photos together at the premiere.",
      "The \"Jane the Virgin\" star previously told\u00a0TODAY.com\u00a0in an interview published Aug. 9 that directing \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d was an \u201cextreme challenge.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery movie is a miracle,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cAnd then, of course, you\u2019re navigating complex personalities and trying to get everybody on the same page with the same vision. And mistakes are always made, and then you figure out how to move past them.\u201d",
      "He later told \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201c that Lively should be the one to direct a potential film adaptation of the book\u2019s sequel, \u201cIt Starts With Us.\u201d At this time, there's no official word on if there will be a second film."

That's her armor, the same way that Elphaba uses black as her armor. There's nothing accidental about what their styling is. I wanted for each of them to feel and and appear as beautiful as possible, even in how they represent themselves.\"",
      "Tazewell says Erivo and Grande played a role in creating their costumes. For example, Erivo tried on multiple versions of Elphaba's hat before settling on the one she liked best.",
      "\"We had in-depth discussions early on what their emotional arc would be as it was reflected through the clothing,\" he says.",

      "\"Elphaba is caught emotionally at that time. We have her carry that through. It defines why she then gravitates toward black as her defining color,\" Tazewell says.",
      "For the stage production, costume designer Susan Hilferty embedded color into Elphaba's black dresses, a look she told Playbill in 2018 was inspired by \"looking at the stones in earth and gems.\"",
      "Tazewell had a different Easter egg for his Elphaba, leaning more toward texture than color.",

      "In \"The Wizard of Oz,\" Glinda wears a bright pink puffy-sleeved gown, with a giant crown and wand.",

The set of cards features one of Elway on the Yankees, even though he never played a game for them.",

      "JERUSALEM \u2014 The ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah appeared on the verge of collapse this week \u2014 something that is not a surprise to many Israelis.",
      "Both sides accused the other of violating last week\u2019s ceasefire arrangement. On Monday night, Israeli strikes on two southern Lebanese villages killed at least 10 people, Lebanon\u2019s Public Health Ministry said. That was a response to an earlier Hezbollah attack on Israeli military positions in the disputed Shebaa Farms, which itself was in retaliation for what the militant group said were multiple ceasefire violations.",
      "While Israel says it has achieved its military goals of weakening Hezbollah, the ceasefire that went into effect Nov. 27 did not resolve, from its perspective, a major systemic issue: how to make sure Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s most powerful proxy group, does not threaten Israel with an incursion like Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were kidnapped.",

    "summary": "As French President Emmanuel Macron prepared for the reopening of the Notre-Dame Cathedral, he faces calls to step down after his prime minister resigned and the government collapsed.",
    "story": [
      "PARIS \u2014 The reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral should have been a victory lap for French President Emmanuel Macron. Instead, the celebrations are shadowed by calls for him to step down after Prime Minister Michel Barnier handed in his resignation Thursday following a no-confidence vote that collapsed his government.",
      "Barnier\u2019s fragile parliamentary coalition was the first in more than six decades to fall apart in France, the second-biggest economic power in the European Union. The vote against Barnier came just three months after Macron appointed him, making him France's shortest-serving prime minister. Barnier will remain in a caretaker position until Macron appoints a new prime minister.",
      "With the latest development plunging the country into deeper political uncertainty, Macron addressed the nation in a speech Thursday evening.",
      "He thanked Barnier for his dedication and called the no-confidence vote that toppled him \u201cunprecedented,\u201d adding that the \u201cextreme right and extreme left joined in an anti-republican front\u201d and that some political groups had chosen \u201cchaos.\u201d",
      "Macron said he will name a new prime minister \u201cin the coming days,\u201d as he appealed for unity and reiterated that he had no intention of stepping down.",
      "The turn of events came just days before the grand reopening this weekend of the 860-year-old Notre Dame Cathedral, a jewel in Paris' skyline that was destroyed in a fire on April 15, 2019.",
      "The widely anticipated reopening was seen as a major coup for Macron, who faced early skepticism over his vow to restore and reopen the cathedral to the public by 2024.",
      "Heads of state and other dignitaries from around the world \u2014 including President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 are expected to flock to Paris for the reopening, which will be followed by a week of celebrations and ceremonies starting with a \u201creopening service\u201d on Saturday. The visit will be Trump\u2019s first overseas visit since he won the presidential election last month.",
      "Macron took a televised tour of Notre Dame a few days ago, when he said he hoped its reopening would bring a \u201cshock of hope\u201d to the world, French media reported.",
      "Barnier\u2019s government collapsed after far-left and far-right lawmakers in the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, joined forces and voted overwhelmingly against him. A total of 331 lawmakers supported the no-confidence motion, dozens more than the 299 needed for it to pass.",
      "The vote followed growing anger over Barnier\u2019s efforts to push through a controversial 2025 budget by deploying a rarely used constitutional mechanism to circumvent parliamentary approval. He argued that the move, announced Monday, was necessary to ensure stability and address France\u2019s ailing economy at a time of deep political division.",
      "The National Assembly is made up of three major blocs: Macron\u2019s centrist allies, the left-wing New Popular Front coalition and Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally.",
      "While Macron\u2019s position is not technically affected by Barnier\u2019s resignation, his political future has become uncertain as pressure for him to step down grows. And as he now faces the difficult task of finding a prime minister whom a deeply divided parliament could approve, the chaotic fallout is widely seen as having been of Macron\u2019s own making after he called surprise snap elections in June that resulted in a fractious and increasingly dysfunctional government.",
      "\u201cFor the moment Macron\u2019s position is not imperiled,\u201d Douglas Webber, an emeritus professor of political science at INSEAD, told NBC News on Thursday. \u201cBut the longer he cannot put together a government, the more the pressure on him will grow to try to resolve the political impasse by resigning and calling new presidential elections \u2014 in which he could not stand again.\u201d"

      "However, some analysts say the group has \u201cgreatly moderated\u201d its positions, as Robin Yassin-Kassab, author of \u201cBurning Country: Syrians in Revolution and War,\u201d wrote this week. \u201cIt\u2019s still an authoritarian Islamist militia\u201d but \u201chas a much more positive policy towards sectarian and ethnic minorities than ISIS,\u201d he said.",
      "For these anti-Assad observers, the group presents an opportunity to topple the brutality of his regime and its Russian and Iranian benefactors.",
      "But after the rebels\u2019 offensive, Syrian and Russian fighter jets responded by launching airstrikes on the rebel-held areas, with Assad\u2019s government claiming to have killed more than 400 of the \u201cterrorists.\u201d",
      "The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights puts the number of rebels killed in five days of fighting at 244, with 61 civilians killed alongside 141 government troops.",
      "Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi offered his full support to Assad and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia would do likewise. And on Monday, Iran-backed militias based in Iraq crossed the border into Syria to support the government there, according to the Observatory.",
      "Why is this happening now?",
      "Syria\u2019s time on the back burner of international attention is also one  reason it has roared back into prominence, some experts say.",
      "Assad once looked like he might be toppled by the diverse group of rebels that rose up against him after the Arab Spring of 2011. That he has survived was largely because of the intervention of Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s Lebanon-based proxy.",
      "Russia\u2019s indiscriminate bombing, in particular, turned the tide against the rebels. It also transformed then rebel-held cities such as Aleppo and Homs into moonscapes of rubble and rebar. In all, the U.N. has documented more than 350,000 deaths but says this is \u201ccertainly an undercount.\u201d",
      "Today, however, Russia, Iran and Lebanon are distracted and depleted.",
      "Russia\u2019s primary focus is on the war in Ukraine, where it is locked in an attritional battle of trenches, tanks and mud with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s Washington-backed government in Kyiv. In recent years Moscow has withdrawn assets from Syria, potentially weakening Assad\u2019s grip on power, experts say.",
      "Likewise, Iran has taken a hit at the hands of Israel, which has gutted Hezbollah\u2019s leadership and targeted its missile arsenal, while also fighting Hamas in Gaza.",
      "\u201cIranians have also shown that their forces are stretched and perhaps not as powerful as people get them credit for,\u201d said Hellyer, the Russia analyst who was speaking from Cairo. All of this \u201cputs Assad in a much weaker position.\u201d",
      "But \u201cthe Syrian regime, in coordination with the Russians and less so the Iranians, will hit them with everything they\u2019ve got,\u201d he added.",
      "Washington and ISIS",
      "Less clear is what role, if any, the U.S. may play.",
      "As well as the American troops based in Syria, there are another 2,500 in neighboring Iraq that are part of a residual 80-country coalition to prevent ISIS from regrouping.",
      "However, it\u2019s far from certain these forces will remain there after President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. He twice threatened to withdraw these troops during his first term.",
      "But the ISIS threat has not gone away, despite the group being purged in 2017 from the vast swaths of Syria and Iraq over which it had governed.",
      "In July, the Pentagon warned ISIS attacks were on track to double year-on-year.",
      "If HTS were to seize the city of Deir el-Zour \u2014 a former ISIS stronghold \u2014 then ISIS could be freer to expand its influence across the east of the country, some analysts believe.",
      "\u201cAs Assad\u2019s regime moves resources to the northwest\u201d to try to fight off the rebels, \u201cISIS will reap the rewards, filling vacuums\u201d elsewhere,  Charles Lister, director of the Syria program at the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank, said in a post on X.",
      "If Assad were to fall altogether, Iran may no longer be able to use Syria as a pipeline of weapons and other supplies to Hezbollah, the Council on Foreign Relations, a Washington-based think tank, said in a briefing.",
      "However, any hopes for Assad's ouster should be tempered by who or what might replace him.",
      "\u201cMuch as I oppose the Assad regime, its atrocities and abuses, what is happening in Aleppo right now is terrifying. Many will die,\u201d Chris Doyle, director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding, posted on X. \u201cIf there was a chance of a lovely peaceful outcome to the benefit of Syrians, I will be thrilled. This is unlikely.\u201d"

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The head of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s governing party on Friday signaled more openness to his removal as president for plunging the key U.S. ally into chaos with a short-lived declaration of martial law, reversing his position the day before an impeachment vote.",
      "Han Dong-hoon, leader of the conservative People Power Party (PPP), had earlier said he opposed impeaching Yoon because it would only create more turmoil. But on Friday he said he had learned that Yoon ordered the arrest of prominent politicians in addition to declaring martial law, an order that was lifted six hours later after lawmakers voted to reject it.",
      "\u201cIn light of these new revelations, I have come to the conclusion that it is necessary to suspend President Yoon from exercising his mandate to protect the South Korea and its people,\u201d Han said, adding that Yoon was \u201cnot acknowledging his wrongdoings.\u201d",
      "If Yoon continues as president, Han said, \u201cI fear that there will be a great risk of radical actions such as this state of emergency repeating, and he will put South Korea and its people in great danger.\u201d",
      "Han\u2019s comments increased the likelihood that Yoon will be impeached when a vote is held around 7 p.m. local time Saturday (5 a.m. ET). The opposition bloc holds 192 of the unicameral legislature\u2019s 300 seats, just under the two-thirds majority needed for the motion to pass.",
      "The PPP, which repudiated Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration, had asked him to leave the party but said earlier that it opposed the impeachment motion. Before Han changed his position, at least eight lawmakers from the PPP would have had to break with their party in order for it to pass.",
      "Six opposition parties had proposed impeaching Yoon over the martial law order, which banned political activity and censored the media. If Yoon is impeached, he will be suspended from office until the Constitutional Court decides whether to uphold the motion, with a deadline of 180 days.",
      "South Korean police and prosecutors are also investigating claims of insurrection and treason against Yoon, former Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun, whose resignation Yoon accepted on Thursday, and Interior Minister Lee Sang-min.",
      "The deeply unpopular Yoon, 63, whose approval rating was already at 19% before the emergency martial law, had blamed opposition lawmakers in his declaration, accusing them of paralyzing the government by seeking the impeachment of multiple government officials and slashing critical funding from next year\u2019s national budget.",
      "He also accused his opponents of sympathizing with nuclear-armed North Korea, a reclusive communist state with which the South technically remains at war.",
      "Yoon has not made any public appearances since lifting the martial law order on Wednesday. On Friday, lawmakers at the National Assembly, which was swarmed by almost 300 martial law troops on Tuesday after Yoon declared martial law in a surprise late-night TV address, linked arms to block the entrance amid concerns that he might visit.",
      "Opposition lawmakers have expressed concern that Yoon might declare martial law a second time if he is impeached or even earlier.",
      "\u201cI feel that danger is imminent tonight,\u201d Lee Jae-myung, leader of the liberal opposition Democratic Party, said Friday. \u201cI have a gut feeling that something might happen again tonight or early morning tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Acting Defense Minister Kim Seon-ho dismissed such concerns and said that even if Yoon made such an attempt, the Ministry of Defense and the South Korean military \u201cwould categorically reject it.\u201d",

Park Ahn-soo, who as army chief of staff was named martial law commander.

      "Blinken also reaffirmed the \u201cironclad\u201d nature of the U.S. alliance with South Korea, which it views as an important bulwark against North Korea, China and Russia, and which hosts almost 30,000 American troops.",

      "South Korea\u2019s National Election Commission said Friday that after the martial law declaration on Tuesday, about 300 troops infiltrated its headquarters and related facilities in what the commission called \u201ca clear violation of the Constitution and the law.\u201d",

      "French authorities detained Dali when the plane landed in Paris, the FBI complaint said, and she was ultimately denied entry to the country because she didn't have a valid travel document or visa, a spokesperson for France\u2019s border police said.",
      "She was then removed from her return flight to the U.S. on Sunday after she caused a disturbance.",
      "Dali returned to the U.S. on a Delta flight Wednesday and was taken into custody in New York, a senior law enforcement source said.",
      "According to the FBI complaint, agents interviewed Dali at JFK, where she admitted having taken the flight without a boarding pass. She also told agents that she knew her conduct was illegal, the complaint said.",
      "\"Among other things, she stated that she did not have a plane ticket and that she intentionally evaded TSA officials and Delta employees so that she could travel without buying one, including by looking for opportunities to circumvent them when she knew they would ask for her boarding pass,\" the complaint said.",
      "Bypassing airport security 'rarely happens'",
      "TSA Administrator David Pekoske said that while Dali \"did bypass a number of levels\" of security at JFK, \"I would emphasize that she was screened.\"",
      "Still, bypassing security checkpoints is \"not that easy,\" and it \"rarely happens,\" Pekoske said.",
      "He said that judging by security video, it was \"crystal clear\" she was trying to evade security checkpoints on Nov. 26, at the height of the Thanksgiving travel rush \u2014 an \"incredibly busy day.\""

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 16:37:43 GMT",
    "summary": "Adm. Tony Radakin, chief of the defense staff in the United Kingdom, said the world was entering a complex \"third nuclear age.\"",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 The world is entering a \u201cthird nuclear age,\u201d the head of the British armed forces has warned, with world-ending weapons once again spreading globally and international agreements to control them collapsing.",
      "Adm. Tony Radakin, chief of the defense staff in the United Kingdom, on Wednesday accused Russia of issuing \u201cwild threats of tactical nuclear use\u201d and \u201csimulated attacks against NATO countries.\u201d",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly threatened the United States and the West with nuclear retaliation over its support for Ukraine, where his forces have been fighting since their invasion almost three years ago.",
      "But Kremlin saber-rattling was not the only reason for Radakin\u2019s words of caution at a lecture at the Royal United Services Institute think tank in London.",
      "He also cited China\u2019s rapid development to become the world\u2019s second fully-fledged nuclear competitor to the United States, alongside Russia. North Korea and Iran, meanwhile, are upping the ante, all set to the backdrop of collapsing nonproliferation agreements, which sought to reduce the risk posed by nuclear weapons after the Cold War, he said.",
      "\u201cThe world has changed. Global power is shifting and a third nuclear age is upon us,\u201d Radakin said. Describing this new era as \u201caltogether more complex\u201d than before, he said it is \u201cdefined by multiple and concurrent dilemmas, proliferating nuclear and disruptive technologies, and the almost total absence of the security architectures that went before.\u201d",
      "As Radakin defined it, the first nuclear age was during the Cold War, when the U.S. and Soviet Union amassed colossal arsenals and were \u201cgoverned by the risk of uncontrollable escalation and the logic of deterrence.\u201d The second age started after the fall of the Berlin Wall and was an era of \u201cdisarmament efforts and counter-proliferation,\u201d as these nuclear powers expressed willingness to row back from this apocalyptic face-off, he said.",
      "That era is over, he said, replaced by growing arsenals among established powers, development by newcomer upstarts and a backsliding of international agreements.",
      "To be clear, the admiral said that \u201cthere is only a remote chance of a significant direct attack or invasion by Russia\u201d against NATO countries.",
      "Alex Younger, former head of Britain\u2019s MI6 foreign intelligence agency, expressed a similar opinion on \u201cThe World\u201d podcast with NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim, lead world news presenter at NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think Putin is intent on firing a nuclear weapon at us,\u201d Younger said, although he added it did not mean nuclear watchdogs are not alarmed at the current direction of travel.",
      "The total number of nuclear weapons continues to gradually decline from the current number of around 12,000 worldwide, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), a leading organization tracking armaments around the world. But that is only because the U.S. and Russia have been dismantling retired warheads, it said.",
      "There are 2,100 warheads \u201ckept in a state of high operational alert\u201d \u2014 around 100 more than last year, SIPRI said in its 2024 yearbook. As well as China\u2019s \u201csignificant modernization and expansion,\u201d arsenals are also growing or set to grow in India, Pakistan, North Korea and the U.K. itself, SIPRI said.",
      "Meanwhile, \u201cthe entire six decade-long nuclear arms control enterprise is at risk of terminating,\u201d it said.",
      "Last year, Russia suspended its participation from New START, an agreement that sought to put verifiable limits on Washington\u2019s and Moscow\u2019s nuclear arsenals.",
      "And in 2019, then-President Donald Trump withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, or INF, Treaty, accusing Russia of violating the agreement. And a year earlier, Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, which many experts say makes it easier for the theocratic state\u00a0to build such a weapon.",
      "Radakin, the British admiral, said he hoped the world would not have to witness the horrors of nuclear war and do what\u2019s necessary to avoid it, namely \u201cstiffen its resolve.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need to sense the risk of tragedy to ensure we avoid it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that risk of tragedy is growing. The world is more dangerous. The challenges are greater.\u201d"

      "The Summary",
      "Southern giant hornets, sometimes referred to as \"murder hornets,\" have been found in Europe for the first time.A study last month confirmed that two pairs of the hornets have been found in northern Spain since 2022.Scientists are hunting for the hornets' nest.",

      "A study last month confirmed that two pairs of the hornets have been found in northern Spain since 2022.",
      "Scientists are hunting for the hornets' nest.",
      "Researchers in Spain are scrambling to find the nest belonging to the first southern giant hornets found in Europe.",
      "Sometimes referred to as \"murder hornets\" because they are known to kill off beehives, the insects grow to an average length of 2 inches. They are native to parts of Asia including India, China, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "In a study published last month in the journal Ecology and Evolution, five Spanish scientists described two separate sightings of  southern giant hornets, whose scientific name is Vespa soror. Both were in the northern city of Siero in Asturias province: A pair was spotted in March 2022, then another two in October 2023.",
      "Researchers believe the hornets have a nest that dates back at least a year.",
      "Northern giant hornets \u2014\u00a0a closely related species originating in  other parts of Asia \u2014\u00a0were first spotted in the United States in Washington state in late 2019. The northern and southern hornets are similar in behavior and appearance, though the former have shorter nesting periods and produce smaller colonies and nests.",
      "The first northern giant hornet nest found in the U.S. was promptly destroyed in October 2020, but a live hornet was spotted in Washington the following year.",
      "Southern giant hornets are known to send out scouting teams to find prey colonies, and the scouts rub their bodies against hives or nearby vegetation to signal others to join them, according to research published in 2021. They then enter a \"slaughter phase\" in which they can take out entire beehives in a matter of hours.",
      "Neither northern nor southern giant hornets have been found in Europe beyond the four documented in Spain. The scientists behind the recent study think the hornets likely first arrived on a cargo ship.",
      "Omar Sanchez, the study's lead author and a zoology professor at the University of Oviedo in Spain, said he expects the hornets to impact the balance of the local ecosystem because they aggressively hunt native hornets, bees, butterflies, moths and flies. A long-term decline in the bee population can affect the availability of honey and disrupt pollination processes on which many plants and crops rely.",
      "\u201cHere in northern Spain, we have another species of Asian hornets that is called Vespa Veluntina, and it\u2019s causing serious damages to the beekeeping sector, so the presence of another Asian hornet can magnify the bad affects,\u201d he said.",
      "Sanchez added that researchers are trying to find the nest, so they can destroy it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit tricky because this species makes their nest under the ground \u2014 more than 30 meters \u2014 so it is not easy to find,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are trying.\u201d",
      "The researchers have also been canvassing for more hornet sightings, Sanchez said.",
      "Sanchez and his study co-authors found and captured the four hornets after beekeepers in the area told them about seeing unusual-looking wasps. After trapping the hornets, the scientists extracted DNA samples and conducted genetic testing and analysis to confirm the species.",
      "Molly Keck, an entomologist at Texas A&M University, said the genetic study confirming the species is the first step toward mitigation efforts, such as educating the public and beekeepers and alerting local authorities \"so that management plans, education, mapping, distribution can be done.\"",
      "\"Most of these invasive species are going to come in through a port city somewhere,\" she added, \"so whatever quarantines and check measures are done, there are really going to be the way that they\u2019re spotted.\"",
      "Such processes across the globe may need to get beefed up as a precaution if countries want to ensure cargo is free of bugs, Keck said.",
      "Sanchez said that the detection of southern giant hornets in Spain indicates that more are likely on the way.",
      "\u201cProbably in the near future, this species will be detected again in other localities of Spain and probably Europe,\u201d he said."

      "\u201cAll actions carried out by all military soldiers regarding the Emergency Martial Law were following my orders and directives, and so I bear the full responsibility for them,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "He did not directly address whether the emergency martial law was his idea, as opposition lawmakers and South Korean media have alleged.",
      "The National Office of Investigation said Thursday that it had ordered an overseas travel ban for Kim, who might also face insurrection charges, after opposition lawmakers suggested he might try to flee the country.",
      "Yoon\u2019s office said Wednesday that his chief of staff and all senior presidential secretaries had also tendered their resignations. But it defended his declaration of martial law, South Korea\u2019s first since 1980, as necessary in the face of an impasse with opposition lawmakers that Yoon said had paralyzed the government.",
      "Under the martial law declaration, all political activity was banned and media was censored, drawing instant opposition from a public that lived for decades under military-authoritarian rule before South Korea transitioned into a vibrant democracy and the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy.",
      "Yoon, 63, who once served as the country\u2019s chief prosecutor, rescinded the order after lawmakers defied a security cordon to enter the National Assembly in Seoul, the South Korean capital, where they voted unanimously to reject it. Protesters also arrived at the legislature, where some scuffled with security forces.",
      "He has not made any public appearances since announcing the order in a surprise late-night TV address on Tuesday.",
      "Lifting the order did little to dispel public shock and anger in the country of 50 million people. On Wednesday night, protesters in downtown Seoul held a candlelight vigil and marched against Yoon, calling on him to resign.",
      "Protests continued on Thursday, including a marine veteran and his wife who shaved their heads in protest outside the presidential office, a South Korean tradition. There were also some rallies by Yoon\u2019s supporters.",
      "Protests against Yoon, and the calls for him to step down, could grow as people get over the initial shock of the events, said Jean H. Lee, an adjunct fellow and Northeast Asia expert at the East-West Center research organization in Honolulu.",

      "An uncertain vote",
      "Gen. Park Ahn-soo, who as army chief of staff was named martial law commander, told lawmakers that he learned about the order from Yoon\u2019s televised announcement. He said that while he signed and issued the proclamation of martial law, he did not have the expertise to assess its legality and had suggested to the defense minister that it be further reviewed.",
      "\u201cI have never had any intention of turning arms against the people of this nation,\u201d he said, adding that he was focused on setting up the operations room and did not issue or oversee the order to send troops to the National Assembly.",
      "Park said he had offered his resignation on Wednesday, though Yoon did not accept it citing the need for stable management of the military.",
      "Kim Seon-ho, the vice minister of defense, said it was his boss, Kim Yong-hyun, who ordered the deployment of troops. The vice minister, who said he also learned about the order from the news, said he disagreed with it and had expressed his objection to mobilizing military personnel.",
      "On Thursday, he expressed his \u201cdeep regret\u201d to the public, saying he felt \u201cdevastated.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs vice minister of national defense, I acknowledge that I failed to identify and prevent these actions as they unfolded. I take full responsibility and will ensure accountability moving forward,\u201d he said, adding that the soldiers at the National Assembly were not carrying live ammunition.",
      "With the removal of his defense minister, Yoon appears to be \u201cattempting to construct a narrative that takes it out of his hands,\u201d said Rob York, director for regional affairs at\u00a0Pacific Forum, a foreign policy research institute in Honolulu.",
      "But the declaration \u201cwas ultimately his call, and the Korean public is not inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt,\u201d he said.",

      "The main opposition Democratic Party said Thursday that lawmakers would vote on the Yoon impeachment motion on Saturday around 7 p.m. (5 a.m. ET). It was unclear whether lawmakers from Yoon\u2019s People Power Party, or PPP, would vote against the motion or simply not show up for the vote.",
      "A total of 191 lawmakers representing six opposition parties, plus one independent lawmaker, submitted articles of impeachment against Yoon on Wednesday. It takes a two-thirds majority vote in the unicameral National Assembly for the motion to pass.",
      "Though PPP leaders repudiated Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration and have asked him to leave the party, they said the party opposed the impeachment motion. The opposition bloc holds 192 seats, just under two-thirds of the 300-member legislature, meaning the motion could fail unless several PPP lawmakers break with their party and support it.",
      "Opposition lawmakers say that if the motion fails to pass the first time, they will keep trying until Yoon is impeached. If the motion is passed, the Constitutional Court would then hold a trial to determine whether to confirm the impeachment, with a decision required within 180 days.",
      "Though Yoon would remain at the presidential residence, his powers would be temporarily handed to Prime Minister Han Duck-soo until the court delivered its ruling.",
      "U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said Wednesday that Yoon had \u201cbadly misjudged\u201d his decision to declare martial law.",
      "He said the fact that progressives and conservatives swiftly united in opposition to the order despite deep political divisions was a testament to the strength of South Korean democracy.",

      "\u201cWe are certainly not routinely informed of every decision that any partner may be making anywhere around the world at any given time,\u201d he said Wednesday in an interview with Reuters.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s important now is to see this process play out peacefully and according to the constitution and the rule of law,\u201d he added.",
