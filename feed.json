      "CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon says she's quitting",
      "CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon said Monday that she is resigning after four years, the latest fallout at the network as its parent company considers settling a lawsuit with President Donald Trump over a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d with his former political opponent.",
      "McMahon, who has led both the network news division and news for the CBS-owned stations, said in an email message to staff that \u201cit's become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward. It's time to move on and for this organization to move forward with new leadership.\u201d",
      "McMahon has made clear she opposes settling with Trump \u2014 just like \u201c60 Minutes\u201d executive producer Bill Owens, who quit last month.",
      "Trump has sued CBS, alleging it edited an interview with 2024 Democratic opponent Kamala Harris last fall to benefit her. CBS News has denied that. CBS' parent company, Paramount Global, is in talks to potentially settle Trump's lawsuit. At the same time, Paramount Global is seeking administration approval of a merger with Skydance Media.",
      "George Cheeks, co-CEO of Paramount and head of the CBS network, said McMahon's top deputies, CBS News president Tom Cibrowski and CBS Stations president Jennifer Mitchell, will report directly to him.",
      "McMahon, in her note, said that \u201cthe past few months have been challenging.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have spent the last few months shoring up our businesses and making sure the right leaders are in place, and I have no doubt they will continue to set the standard,\u201d she said.",
      "In addition to the tussle with Trump, Paramount's controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, has expressed unhappiness over some network coverage of Israel's war in Gaza, including a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d piece this winter. Paramount began supervising \u201c60 Minutes\u201d stories in new ways, including asking former CBS News President Susan Zirinsky to look over some of its stories before they aired.",
      "That extra layer contributed to Owens' resignation. One of the show's correspondents, Scott Pelley, said on the air that \u201cnone of us is happy\u201d about the changes.",
      "CBS News is also trying to establish the new anchor team of John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois at its flagship \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d broadcast amid ratings troubles.",
      "In his note to staff members, Cheeks praised McMahon for expanding local news at CBS stations and improving their competitive positions, along with improving the network's digital offerings.",

      "Frederick Doe, 37, also known as Frederick Sines, was given a suspended sentence at Oxford Crown Court for his role in helping to sell the 18-carat gold fully functioning toilet which was taken in 2019 from Blenheim Palace \u2014 the country mansion where British wartime leader Winston Churchill was born.",
      "\u201cThose responsible for this audacious heist, five individuals could be seen on CCTV, were clearly intent on disposing of their ill-gotten gains quickly,\" Judge Ian Pringle told Doe. \u201cYou foolishly agreed to assist.\u201d",

      "The toilet weighed just over 215 pounds (98 kilograms). The value of the gold at the time was 2.8 million pounds and it was insured for 4.74 million pounds.",
      "The piece that poked fun at excessive wealth had previously been on display at The Guggenheim Museum, in New York, which had offered the work to U.S. President Donald Trump during his first term in office after he had asked to borrow a Van Gogh painting.",
      "The theft of the toilet \u2014 which has never been recovered and is believed to have been cut up and sold \u2014 caused considerable damage to the 18th-century property, a UNESCO World Heritage site filled with valuable art and furniture that draws thousands of visitors each year.",

      "Gary Lineker, the former England soccer player and now a media celebrity, will step down from his role as a presenter for the BBC after facing criticism for reposting an Instagram story about Zionism which featured a picture of a rat",
      "Gary Lineker, the England soccer great-turned-media celebrity, will leave his role as a presenter for the BBC after facing criticism for reposting an Instagram story about Zionism which featured a picture of a rat.",
      "The 64-year-old Lineker, who is the British national broadcaster\u2019s highest-paid presenter on about 1.3 million pounds ($1.7 million) a year, was set to leave flagship soccer highlights show \u201cMatch of the Day\u201d at the end of this season but remain with the BBC to front other soccer coverage, including next year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup.",
      "However, the BBC said Monday in a statement that Lineker will step down entirely from the corporation after the final \u201cMatch of the Day\u201d episode next weekend in the wake of his decision to share a post from the group, Palestine Lobby, illustrated with a picture of a rat, titled: \u201cZionism explained in two minutes.\u201d",
      "Rats, linked to disease and dirt, have been used to represent Jews in antisemitic propaganda throughout history, including by the Nazis in 1930s Germany.",
      "\u201cGary has acknowledged the mistake he made,\u201d BBC director-general Tim Davie said. \u201cAccordingly, we have agreed he will step back from further presenting after this season.\u201d",
      "Lineker had already apologized for his conduct, saying last week he reposted material which he subsequently learned contained \u201coffensive references,\u201d adding that he withdrew the post as soon as he became aware of the issue and \u201cwould never knowingly share anything antisemitic.\u201d",
      "Before Lineker\u2019s apology, Davie said the corporation needed people to be the \u201cexemplars of BBC values and follow our social media policies\u201d and that \u201cwhen someone makes a mistake, it costs us.\u201d",
      "\u201cFootball has been at the heart of my life for as long as I can remember \u2014 both on the pitch and in the studio,\u201d Lineker said in the BBC statement. \u201cI care deeply about the game, and about the work I\u2019ve done with the BBC over many years. As I\u2019ve said, I would never consciously repost anything antisemitic \u2014 it goes against everything I stand for.",
      "\u201cHowever, I recognize the error and upset that I caused, and reiterate how sorry I am. Stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action.\u201d",
      "In a separate video post on Instagram, Lineker said he had made a \u201cgenuine mistake\u201d and \u201cshould have been more diligent.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have stood up for minorities and humanitarian issues and all forms of racism all of my life, including of course antisemitism, which I absolutely abhor,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no place for it, and never should be.\u201d",
      "Lineker\u2019s openness to reflect his political views on social media have caused growing friction with the BBC regarding its impartiality guidelines.",
      "He was temporarily suspended from the corporation in March 2023 over comments he made criticizing the then-Conservative government\u2019s new asylum policy. It led to the BBC\u2019s rules on social media posts being rewritten to say presenters of high-profile programs outside news had a \u201cresponsibility to respect the BBC\u2019s impartiality, because of their profile on the BBC.\u201d",
      "Lineker was among 500 high-profile figures who signed an open letter in February urging the BBC to re-broadcast a documentary, \u201cGaza: How to Survive a War Zone,\u201d to its streaming service, BBC iPlayer. The documentary was pulled after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.",
      "Last week, in an interview with The Daily Telegraph newspaper that came a day after his initial apology, Lineker spoke out about the conduct of Israel in the war against Hamas in Gaza, saying those who stayed silent about it were \u201calmost complicit.\u201d",
      "The BBC has lost something of a national treasure who has become almost as well known a broadcaster as he was a soccer player.",
      "Lineker is one of England\u2019s greatest players \u2014 he scored 48 goals in 80 games for his country and was the leading scorer at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico \u2014 who transitioned into being a slick, witty and knowledgeable TV personality and an all-around media darling, with 8.7 million followers on X and 1.2 million followers on Instagram. He has been the main presenter of BBC\u2019s \u201cMatch of the Day\u201d since 1999 and used his status as a freelancer to work for other broadcasters such as NBC, Al Jazeera and BT Sport.",
      "Lineker, who played his club soccer for Everton, Tottenham and Barcelona, is the co-founder of the hugely successful \u201cGoalhanger\u201d podcasts \u2014 the maker of the popular \u201cThe Rest is History\u201d series and its spin-offs about politics, soccer, entertainment and money.",
      "Lineker\u2019s departure from the BBC was welcomed by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, which said he had become \u201ca symbol of the rot at the heart of our national broadcaster.\u201d",
      "Lineker, the group added, was \u201crepeatedly allowed to flout the BBC\u2019s own rules on impartiality, abusing his position to promote his increasingly propagandist politics, vilifying those he disagrees with, and even promoting dehumanizing and extreme messages.\u201d",
      "Lineker has accepted that being outspoken with his views would make him a target but, for many, it has strengthened his status as one of Britain\u2019s most popular figures.",
      "\u201cGary has been a defining voice in football coverage for the BBC for over two decades,\u201d Davie said. \u201cHis passion and knowledge have shaped our sports journalism and earned him the respect of sports fans across the UK and beyond. We want to thank him for the contribution he has made.\u201d",
      "\u201cMatch of the Day\u201d \u2014 a late-night program that has been running since the 1960s and is regarded as an institution in Britain \u2014 will be hosted by Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan for the start of the 2025-26 season. None of them are former soccer players.",

      "As they drive from his home in Paris to the South of France, Anderson explains by phone: \u201cI don\u2019t drive the bus. You have to have, like, four years of training and an EU bus driver\u2019s license. The thing is, if you\u2019re going to drive a bus like this, you\u2019ve got to be able to drive it in reverse, too.\u201d",

      "Anderson, who has a 9-year-old daughter with his wife, the costume designer Juman Malouf, spoke about those things and others on his way to Cannes to unveil \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\" a movie that adds yet another fitting mantra to the world of Wes: \u201cWhat matters is the sincerity of your devotion.\u201d",
      "ANDERSON: We\u2019ve been keeping this stuff for so long. The experience of doing it was kind of great. I\u2019d sort of get pulled over there to approve things. And my reaction was, \u201cWell, we have more stuff.\u201d So we kept adding things. My daughter has lived with a lot of this stuff. The \u201cFantastic Mr. Fox\u201d puppets have been in our apartment in New York ever since we made the movie in boxes. Over the years, she takes them out and plays with them.",
      "ANDERSON: (Laughs) Jason, and Bill, have a way of catching you off guard with a turn of phrase. But I like that description. It\u2019s kind of an amazing experience to have had Jason involved in our movies for so long given that he was 17 when I met him. It\u2019s fun and a strange feeling. The decades have to elapse for you to have had that much time together. And it\u2019s quite shocking that they do. But there it is.",
      "ANDERSON: I didn\u2019t have something I thought I wanted to communicate about what it\u2019s like to be a father. The story really come out of an idea for Benicio and for this character. But I don\u2019t think he would have had a daughter if I didn\u2019t. That\u2019s my hunch. He\u2019s a special kind of a father, in all the worst ways. But nevertheless, there\u2019s something we related to. That\u2019s probably somewhere in the DNA of the movie.",
      "ANDERSON: If I were to say what is the first idea of the movie, it is that face. It\u2019s not an image of the setting, it\u2019s an image of Benicio in a close-up as this character. His face is just so expressive and interesting. It\u2019s a special advantage he has. He\u2019s quite mesmerizing just looking at him on camera, his chemistry with the exposure of film. In \u201cThe French Dispatch,\u201d there were electric moments on the set. But the electricity was amplified when we went back into the cutting room. The wheels started turning. When we showed \u201cThe French Dispatch\u201d however many years ago in Cannes, I did mention to Benicio there, \u201cJust be aware, there\u2019s something else coming.\"",
      "ANDERSON: Essentially, you\u2019ve put your finger on the movies that were written for a specific actor, along with Jason in \u201cAsteroid City.\u201d Owen and I were talking about Gene Hackman by the time we had 10 pages of a script. Ralph was the idea for the character in \u201cGrand Budapest\u201d before there was even one page. But I never had one where I thought of someone in such a tight close-up. With this movie, somehow it\u2019s the face and the eyes and the closest close-up.",
      "ANDERSON: First of all, Gene Hackman, one of the greatest movie actors ever. He did enjoy the movie, I think, between action and cut. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s when I have a good time.\u201d But he really didn\u2019t enjoy the parts in between, which is most of the time. He wasn\u2019t wildly taken with the script in the first place. I don\u2019t think he loved the idea of being that guy. I think he thought: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things I don\u2019t like about this man and I\u2019m not sure I want to live as him.\u201d",
      "Also, I was very young. He was shy and reserved, though he could also get quite explosive. We didn\u2019t know each other well. Sometimes, when we had conflict, we often had open conversations about what just happened. And I felt like I learned so much about him in those times. And he would often become much more gentle.",
      "I don\u2019t want to assume a great friendship because I don\u2019t think he would have ever have referred to our relationship (laughs) in those terms. But I really liked him. He just carried so much tension and he used in the work, but it was sometimes bordering on a little abusive, especially to me. (Laughs)",
      "ANDERSON: I think that\u2019s the case sometimes. When he saw the movie, he told me, \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what we were making.\u201d But he totally understood it when he saw the movie. It worked for him. He liked it, and I think he liked what he had done it. I later thought: I wish I had paused for three days of shooting, edited some of the scenes carefully and then shown him: Here\u2019s what you\u2019re doing and here\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. I think maybe if I had done that, we might have had a gentler time.",
      "ANDERSON: The path that I\u2019ve had as a movie director, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s totally available right now. I don\u2019t know if the kind of movies I started out making would have been made on the same scale or with the same support or with any audience available. To get to the point where I can make the movies I make I now, I just don\u2019t know what route that would take. I think some things have changed fundamentally. But I\u2019m not 25 years younger than myself, so I just do what I do.",

      "Miami police confirmed in a written statement that officers responded to the area at about 3 a.m. after receiving an alert from the gunshot-detection system ShotSpotter. Officer Kiara Delva, a department spokeswoman, said police questioned several people but made no arrests. No injuries were reported at the scene.",

His career took a downturn because of various on- and off-field issues, including his contract being voided by the Oakland Raiders before the start of the 2019 season.",
      "He split his final three NFL seasons with New England and Tampa Bay, and his career ended with Brown stripping off his jersey, pads and gloves, while walking off the field during the Buccaneers\u2019 2021 regular-season finale against the New York Jets. Brown announced his retirement a few months later.",

      "But at the ever-unpredictable event, the prize could just as easily go to powerful singers from France, the Netherlands or Finland \u2014 or even an Estonian who sings about Italian coffee. The final kicks off at 9 p.m. local time.",
      "Bookmakers say the favorite is KAJ, representing Sweden with their ode to sauna culture \u201cBara Bada Bastu,\u201d followed by Austrian singer JJ\u2019s pop-opera song \u201cWasted Love.\u201d",
      "French chanteuse Louane has risen up the odds with \u201cmaman,\u201d as has Dutch singer Claude with soulful ballad \u201cC\u2019est La Vie\u201d and Finland\u2019s Erika Vikman with the innuendo-laden \u201cIch Komme.\u201d Estonia\u2019s Tommy Cash is also a contender with his highly caffeinated dance-pop song \u201cEspresso Macchiato.\u201d",
      "Israel\u2019s Yuval Raphael has won many fans with her anthemic \u201cNew Day Will Rise,\u201d but also faced protests from pro-Palestinian demonstrators calling for Israel to be kicked out of the contest over its conduct of the war against Hamas in Gaza.",
      "Acts from 26 countries \u2014 trimmed from 37 entrants through two elimination semifinals \u2014 will perform to some 160 million viewers for the continent\u2019s pop crown. No smoke machine, jet of flame or dizzying light display has been spared by musicians who are given 3 minutes to make their mark.",
      "Dean Vuletic, an expert on the history of Eurovision, said the competition has become more diverse over the years, both musically and linguistically. There are songs in 20 languages this year, including Ukrainian, Icelandic, Albanian, Latvian and Maltese.",
      "\u201cIn the past it was about having a catchy, innocuous pop song, usually in English,\u201d he said. But in the past decade \u201cwe\u2019ve seen songs become much more socially and politically engaged, songs that present the audience with some sort of meaning.\"",
      "\u201cIn recent years the formulaic approach to a Eurovision entry hasn\u2019t succeeded,\" he added. \"An entry needs to be memorable and it needs to be authentic in order to succeed these days.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s contest has been roiled for a second year by disputes over Israel\u2019s participation. Dozens of former participants, including last year\u2019s winner Nemo of Switzerland, have called for Israel to be excluded.",
      "Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel protests have both taken place in Basel, though on a much smaller scale than at last year\u2019s event in Sweden, where tensions spilled over backstage and Dutch competitor Joost Klein was expelled over an alleged altercation with a crew member.",
      "The European Broadcasting Union or EBU, which runs Eurovision, subsequently tightened the contest\u2019s code of conduct, calling on participants to respect Eurovision\u2019s values of \u201cuniversality, diversity, equality and inclusivity\u201d and its political neutrality.",
      "Performers say the backstage vibe this year is more relaxed.",
      "After a controversial ban in 2024 on flags, apart from national ones, being waved in the arena, this year audience members can bring Palestinian flags or any others, as long as they are legal under Swiss law. Performers, though, can only wave their own country\u2019s flag.",
      "Axel \u00c5hman, one third of favorites KAJ, acknowledged that it\u2019s tough to keep Eurovision an unpolitical event.",
      "\u201cThe world always seeps in in some sense,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cBut we\u2019re here to represent Sweden and we have prepared for this for all our lives and want to make the best of our moment as artists in this huge and legendary competition.",
      "\"So our main focus is there, and the politics (we) try to leave that to the EBU and those actually making the decisions.\u201d",

      "Movies are a regular presence in author Kazuo Ishiguro's life in part because filmmakers keep wanting to turn his books into them",
      "CANNES, France -- CANNES, France (AP) \u2014 Kazuo Ishiguro 's mother was in Nagasaki when the atomic bomb was dropped.",
      "When Ishiguro, the Nobel laureate and author of \u201cRemains of the Day\u201d and \u201cNever Let Me Go,\u201d first undertook fiction writing in his 20s, his first novel, 1982's \u201cA Pale View of Hills\u201d was inspired by his mother's stories, and his own distance from them. Ishiguro was born in Nagasaki but, when he was 5, moved to England with his family.",
      "\u201cA Pale View of Hills\u201d marked the start to what's become one of the most lauded writing careers in contemporary literature. And, now, like most of Ishiguro's other novels, it's a movie, too.",
      "Kei Ishikawa's film by the same name premiered Thursday at the Cannes Film Festival in its Un Certain Regard section. The 70-year-old author has been here before; he was a member of the jury in 1994 that gave \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d the Palme d'Or. \u201cAt the time it was a surprise decision,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of people booed.\u201d",
      "Ishiguro is a movie watcher and sometimes maker, too. He penned the 2022 Akira Kurosawa adaptation \u201cLiving.\u201d Movies are a regular presence in his life, in part because filmmakers keep wanting to turn his books into them. Taika Waititi is currently finishing a film of Ishiguro's most recent novel, \u201cKlara and the Sun\u201d (2021).",
      "Ishiguro likes to participate in early development of an adaptation, and then disappear, letting the filmmaker take over. Seeing \u201cA Pale View of Hills\u201d turned into an elegant, thoughtful drama is especially meaningful to him because the book, itself, deals with inheritance, and because it represents his beginning as a writer.",
      "\u201cThere was no sense that anyone else was going to reread this thing,\u201d he says. \u201cSo in that sense, it\u2019s different to, say, the movie of \u2018Remains of the Day\u2019 or the movie of \u2018Never Let Me Go.\u2019\u201d",
      "Remarks have been lightly edited.",
      "ISHIGURO: Often people think I\u2019m being unduly modest when I say I want the film to be different to the book. I don\u2019t want it to be wildly different. But in order for the film to live, there has to be a reason why it\u2019s being made then, for the audience at that moment. Not 25 years ago, or 45 years ago, as in the case of this book. It has to be a personal artistic expression of something, not just a reproduction. Otherwise, it can end up like a tribute or an Elvis impersonation.",
      "Whenever I see adaptations of books not work, it\u2019s always because it\u2019s been too reverential. Sometimes it\u2019s laziness. People think: Everything is there in the book. The imagination isn\u2019t pushed to work. For every one of these things that\u2019s made it to the screen, there\u2019s been 10, 15 developments that I\u2019ve been personally involved with that fell by the wayside. I always try to get people to just move it on.",
      "ISHIGURO: You can take two kind of approaches. You write a novel and that\u2019s the discrete, perfect thing. Other people can pay homage to it but basically that\u2019s it. Or you can take another view that stories are things that just get passed around, down generations. Even though you think you wrote an original story, you\u2019ve put it together out of other stuff that\u2019s come before you. So it\u2019s part of that tradition.",
      "I said Homer but it could be folktales. The great stories are the ones that last and last and last. They turn up in different forms. It\u2019s because people can change and adapt them to their times and their culture that these stories are valuable. There was a time when people would sit around a fire and just tell each other these stories. You sit down with some anticipation: This guy is going to tell it in a slightly different way. What\u2019s he going to do? It\u2019s like if Keith Jarrett sits down and says he\u2019s going to play \u201cNight and Day.\u201d So when you go from book to film, that\u2019s a fireside moment. That way it has a chance of lasting, and I have a chance of turning into Homer.",
      "ISHIGURO: I\u2019ve got a few centuries to go.",
      "ISHIGURO: I was between the age of 24 and 26. It was published when I was 27. I remember the circumstances very vividly. I can even remember writing a lot of those scenes. My wife, Lorna, was my girlfriend back then. We were both postgraduate students. I wrote it on a table about this size, which was also where we would have our meals. When she came in at the end of the day, I had to pack up even if I was at the crucial point of some scene. It was no big deal. I was just doing something indulgent. There was no real sense I had a career or it would get published. So it\u2019s strange all these years later that she and I are here and attended this premiere in Cannes.",
      "ISHIGURO: I think that\u2019s really insightful what you just said. There is a limit to how much understanding there can be between generations. What\u2019s needed is a certain amount of generosity on both sides, to respect each other\u2019s generations and the difference in values. I think an understanding that the world was a really complicated place, and that often individuals can\u2019t hope to have perspective on the forces that are playing on them at the time. To actually understand that needs a generosity.",
      "ISHIGURO: I wasn\u2019t like a journalist trying to get stuff out of my mother. There's part of me that was quite reluctant to hear this stuff. On some level it was kind of embarrassing to think of my mother in such extreme circumstances. A lot of the things she told me weren\u2019t to do with the atomic bomb. Those weren\u2019t her most traumatic memories.",
      "My mother was a great oral storyteller. She would sometimes have a lunch date and do a whole version of a Shakespeare play by herself. That was my introduction to \u201cHamlet\u201d or things like that. She was keen to tell me but also wary of telling me. It was always a fraught thing. Having something formal \u2014 \u201cOh, I\u2019m becoming a writer, I\u2019m going to write up something so these memories can be preserved\u201d \u2014 that made it easier.",
      "ISHIGURO: Someone said to me the other day, \u201cWe live in a time now where a lot of people would sympathize with the older, what you might call fascist views.\u201d It\u2019s not expressed overtly; the older teacher is saying it's tradition and patriotism.",
      "Now, maybe we live in a world where that\u2019s a good point, and that hadn\u2019t occurred to me. It\u2019s an example of: Yes, we write in a bubble and make movies in a kind of a bubble. But the power of stories is they have to go into different values.",
      "This question of how you pass stories on, this is one of the big challenges. You have to reexamine every scene. Some things that might have been a very safe assumption only a few years ago would not be because the value systems are changing around our books and films just as much as they\u2019re changing around us.",

      "CANNES, France -- You can get nostalgic about almost anything at the Cannes Film Festival, even Jerry Seinfeld on a zip line in a bumblebee costume.",
      "For many years, Cannes has played host not just to an endless stream of artistically ambitious movies, but also to some of Hollywood's most extreme promotional gambits. With so many films packed into the 12-day festival, and with much of the world watching, there are high stakes to standing out in Cannes.",
      "But in recent years, the Cannes marketing stunt has turned into an endangered species. Hopes that Tom Cruise might revive a dormant tradition passed with the relatively sedate premiere Wednesday of \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Final Reckoning.\u201d",
      "Would Cruise parachute into the Palais? Could he ride an airplane wing to the premiere? Nothing so elaborate came to pass. Cruise and company walked the red carpet while serenaded by an orchestra playing the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d theme.",
      "Along the Croisette this year, there's a noticeable lack of the kind of grand advertisements Hollywood has often trotted out for the festival. Paramount Pictures has a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d installation outside the Carlton Hotel, but \u2014 as has been true for several years \u2014 Hollywood rarely still seeks to make big marketing splashes in Cannes.",
      "Even though Universal Pictures' upcoming Formula One action drama \u201cF1\u201d might seem like a natural fit, with the Monaco Grand Prix just days away, \u201cF1\u201d \u2014 at least so far \u2014 has made no pit stop in Cannes.",
      "Things could change. Cannes runs until May 24. Someone might yet arrive by parasail over the Mediterranean, as T.J. Miller did in 2017 for \u201cThe Emoji Movie,\u201d or do ninja kicks with a troupe of giant pandas, as Jack Black did in 2008 for \u201cKung Fu Panda.\u201d",
      "But for years, the circus-like quality of Cannes has been in decline. That's owed partly to budgetary constraints and shifting marketing priorities for major studios. For Cruise and \u201cFinal Reckoning,\u201d Cannes was just one stop on a worldwide tour.",
      "Plus, some of those who were most devoted to bringing Hollywood entertainment to Cannes are no longer regulars here. While head of DreamWorks Animation, Jeffrey Katzenberg made sure his films left a mark in Cannes, whether with models wearing \u201cTrolls\u201d wigs or Seinfeld's \u201cBee Movie\u201d zip line.",
      "Is the absence of such things anything to lament? Probably not, but they did add to the crazy-things-will-happen nature of Cannes, giving the festival the feel of big tent extravaganza. It could be counted as one small, superficial way that movies aren't quite the carnivalesque show they once were.",
      "For now, though, we can say we'll always have when Sacha Baron Cohen, for \u201cThe Dictator,\u201d rode a camel down the Croisette. Ah, the memories.",

      "For powerful men in France\u2019s film industry, this was a week of reckoning",
      "PARIS -- For powerful men in France\u2019s film industry, this was a week of reckoning.",
      "G\u00e9rard Depardieu \u2014 the country\u2019s most famous actor \u2014 was convicted of sexual assault. Two days later, the Cannes Film Festival barred another actor accused of rape from walking the red carpet.",
      "Together, the decisions sent a message France had long resisted: that artistic brilliance may no longer shield those who abuse their power.",
      "For decades, Depardieu was revered as French cinema\u2019s \u201csacred monster\u201d \u2014 a towering talent whose gluttony, volatility, and magnetism became part of his myth. With more than 250 films to his name, many believed he would remain untouchable even after more than 20 women accused him of sexual misconduct.",
      "Now, that myth has cracked. The verdict has revived a broader question France has ducked since the dawn of #MeToo: Can a country that celebrates seduction and irreverence finally hold its male icons to account?",
      "France has long lived its own #MeToo contradiction with a long-held belief in \u201cl\u2019exception culturelle.\u201d That talent, charm, or intellect forgives misconduct and the art excuses the artist. Catherine Deneuve has defended \u201cthe freedom to bother,\" while Brigitte Bardot has dismissed feminism outright: \u201cFeminism isn\u2019t my thing. I like men.\u201d",
      "But the ground is shifting \u2014 fast.",
      "Depardieu was handed an 18-month suspended sentence Tuesday for groping two women on a 2021 film set. He denies the charges and is appealing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the end of impunity of artists with a capital A,\u201d Carine Durrieu Diebolt, a lawyer for one of the two women who won their case against Depardieu, told The Associated Press. The verdict represented \u201ca bookend for putting actors on a pedestal because they were talented,\u201d she added.",
      "Two days later, the prestigious Cannes Film Festival barred actor Th\u00e9o Navarro-Mussy \u2014 accused of rape by three former partners \u2014 from attending the premiere of a film he stars in. Though the file was dropped for lack of evidence, the women are relaunching their case as a civil complaint.",
      "Navarro-Mussy denies wrongdoing. His lawyer said she\u2019s unaware of any ongoing proceedings against him.",
      "What stunned wasn\u2019t just the decision, but who made it. Cannes director Thierry Fr\u00e9maux had long been seen as emblematic of the old guard. He defended Roman Polanski for years and continued to screen his films despite the director\u2019s 1977 guilty plea in the U.S. for sex with a 13-year-old. In 2018, when asked why Cannes still included Polanski, Fr\u00e9maux said: \u201cThese are complicated matters.\u201d",
      "Fr\u00e9maux opened 2023's festival with a film starring Johnny Depp, despite the actor\u2019s highly public legal battle with ex-wife Amber Heard over allegations of domestic abuse, in which he was never criminally charged. When asked about the backlash, Fr\u00e9maux replied: \u201cI only have one rule: it\u2019s the freedom of thinking, and the freedom of speech and acting within a legal framework.\u201d",
      "This week, the rules changed.",
      "\u201cThe Cannes decision is of course linked to the Depardieu verdict,\u201d said C\u00e9line Piques of Osez le f\u00e9minisme (\u201cDare Feminism!\u201d), a group that campaigns against sexual violence. \u201c(They\u2019ve) realized which way the wind is blowing. Fr\u00e9maux is trying to right the wrongs.\u201d",
      "Not everyone welcomed the verdict \u2014 or what followed \u2014 as a cultural turning point.",
      "Fanny Ardant, one of French cinema\u2019s grandes dames and a longtime friend of Depardieu, sat on his side in court. She is now directing him in a film in Portugal, despite the conviction.",
      "\u201cFanny Ardant? She completely missed the point,\u201d said Piques. \u201cShe downplayed the violence, normalized it. That\u2019s rape culture, plain and simple.\u201d",
      "Juliette Binoche, Cannes jury president and one of France\u2019s most respected actresses, struck a note of restraint: \u201cHe\u2019s not a monster. He\u2019s a man \u2014 one who has, apparently, been desacralized.\u201d",
      "In 2024, more than 22,000 rapes were reported in France. Fewer than 3% led to convictions. \u201cThe Depardieu verdict shows there\u2019s progress,\u201d said lawyer Anne-Sophie Laguens, who works with victims of sexual assault. \u201cBut for most women, the barriers to justice remain enormous.\u201d",
      "When Bertrand Cantat \u2014 frontman of Noir D\u00e9sir and once one of France\u2019s bestselling rock singers \u2014 launched a 2018 comeback tour, he had served just four years in prison for killing his partner, actress Marie Trintignant, during a violent assault.",
      "Despite public outrage, he returned to the stage and performed.",
      "\u201cThat would be unthinkable today,\u201d said Piques. \u201cThe public mood has changed. What we tolerate has changed.\u201d",
      "One breakthrough came not in cinema, but in a Bordeaux courtroom. The conviction of 51 men for drugging and raping Gisele Pelicot \u2014 a case long ignored despite her pleas \u2014 marked a turning point. For years, shame was hers. Now, it belongs to the perpetrators.",
      "\u201cIt proved rapists aren\u2019t just strangers in alleys,\u201d said Piques. \u201cThey\u2019re husbands. Colleagues. Respected men.\u201d",
      "Other recent convictions in entertainment included director Christophe Ruggia, who was convicted of abusing actress Ad\u00e8le Haenel when she was a minor, though he is appealing; and actor-director Nicolas Bedos, who was sentenced for sexual assault.",
      "Slowly but surely, yes. The system that long protected men like Depardieu is not yet dismantled, but it is shifting.",
      "As one of the actor\u2019s accusers said through tears after the ruling: \u201cI\u2019m very, very much satisfied with the decision. That\u2019s a victory for me, really. And a big progress, a step forward. I feel justice was made.\u201d",

      "BASEL, Switzerland -- There has already been triumph and tears, singing onstage and in the streets, and a touch of political division, as the 69th Eurovision Song Contest approaches its grand final in the Swiss city of Basel.",
      "Musical acts from 26 countries will take the stage at the St. Jakobshalle arena on Saturday in a spectacular, sequin-drenched competition that has been uniting and dividing Europeans since 1956.",
      "Here\u2019s everything to know:",
      "Eurovision is competition in which performers from countries across Europe, and a few beyond it, compete under their national flags with the aim of being crowned continental champion. Think of it as the Olympics of pop music or the World Cup with singing instead of soccer.",
      "It\u2019s a celebration of silly fun and music\u2019s unifying power, but also a place where politics and regional rivalries play out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Europe\u2019s biggest cultural event,\u201d said Dean Vuletic, an expert on the history of Eurovision. \u201cIt has been going on for almost 70 years and people love to watch it, not only for the show, for the glitter, the stage effects, the crazy costumes, but also because they like to see it as a reflection of the zeitgeist in Europe.\u201d",
      "Of 37 countries that sent performers to Eurovision, 11 were knocked out by public voting in semifinals on Tuesday and Thursday. Another six automatically qualified for the final: the host, Switzerland, and the \u201cBig Five\u201d that pay the most to the contest \u2014 France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.K.",
      "The 26 countries competing Saturday, in order of performance, are: Norway, Luxembourg, Estonia, Israel, Lithuania, Spain, Ukraine, the U.K, Austria, Iceland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Finland, Italy, Poland, Germany, Greece, Armenia, Switzerland, Malta, Portugal, Denmark, Sweden, France, San Marino and Albania.",
      "Favorites, according to oddsmakers, are KAJ, representing Sweden with \u201cBara Bada Bastu,\u201d a jaunty serenade to the sauna. Dutch singer Claude is also highly rated with soulful ballad \u201cC\u2019est La Vie.\u201d Other favorites include classically trained Austrian countertenor JJ with his pop-opera song \u201cWasted Love,\u201d and Israel\u2019s Yuval Raphael, with her anthemic \u201cNew Day Will Rise.\u201d",

And it helped make stars of performers including ABBA \u2014 winners in 1974 with \u201cWaterloo\u201d \u2014 Celine Dion, Austrian drag performer Conchita Wurst and Italian rock band M\u00e5neskin.",

      "Campiness, humor and double entendres abound. \u201cEspresso Macchiato\u201d is a comic ode to Italian stereotypes performed by Estonia\u2019s Tommy Cash. Miriana Conte sings for Malta with the double entendre-filled \u201cServing\u201d -- performed on a set including a glitter ball and giant lips, it is classic Eurovision.",
      "It was once widely accepted that the most successful Eurovision songs were in English, but that is changing. This year\u2019s contest features songs in a record 20 languages, including Ukrainian, Icelandic, Latvian, Maltese and Armenian.",

      "Once all the acts have performed in the final, the winner is chosen by a famously complex mix of phone and online voters from around the world and rankings by music-industry juries in each of the Eurovision countries. As the results are announced, countries slide up and down the rankings and tensions build.",
      "Ending up with \u201cnul points,\u201d or zero, is considered a national humiliation.",
      "The final starts Saturday at 1900 GMT (3 p.m. EDT) and will be aired by national broadcasters in participating nations, on streaming service Peacock in the United States and in many countries on the Eurovision YouTube channel.",
      "During and immediately after the final, viewers in participating countries can vote by phone, text message or the Eurovision app \u2014 but not for their own country. Viewers in the U.S. and other nonparticipating countries can vote all day Saturday, online at www.esc.vote or with the app. The combined \u201crest of the world\u201d vote is given the weight of one individual country.",
      "The contest\u2019s motto is \u201cunited by music,\u201d but the world\u2019s divisions inevitably intrude.",
      "Russia was banned from Eurovision after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and since then Ukrainian musicians \u2014 including 2022 winner Kalush Orchestra \u2014 have competed under the shadow of war in the home country.",
      "This year\u2019s contest has been roiled for a second year by disputes over Israel\u2019s participation. Dozens of former participants, including Nemo, have called for Israel to be excluded over its conduct in the war against Hamas in Gaza. Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel protests have both taken place in Basel, though on a much smaller scale than at last year\u2019s event in Sweden.",
      "A handful of protesters attempted to disrupt a rehearsal by Israeli singer Raphael on Thursday with oversized flags and whistles and were escorted from the arena. Organizers say they have tightened security ahead of the final.",

      "The New Jersey man convicted of stabbing author Salman Rushdie on a New York lecture stage in 2022 is scheduled to be sentenced",
      "MAYVILLE, N.Y. -- The man convicted of stabbing Salman Rushdie on a New York lecture stage in 2022, leaving the prizewinning author blind in one eye, is scheduled to be sentenced on Friday.",
      "A jury found Hadi Matar, 27, guilty of attempted murder and assault in February.",
      "Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt said he will request the maximum 25 years in prison for the Aug. 12, 2022, attack on Rushdie and seven years for injuring a second man who was on stage with the author. The sentences must run concurrently because both victims were injured in the same event, he said.",
      "Rushdie is not expected to return to court for his assailant's sentencing, the prosecutor said. During the trial, the 77-year-old author was the key witness, describing how he believed he was dying when a masked attacker plunged a knife into his head and body more than a dozen times as he was being introduced at the Chautauqua Institution to speak about writer safety.",
      "Rushdie spent 17 days at a Pennsylvania hospital and more than three weeks at a New York City rehabilitation center. The author of \u201cMidnight's Children,\u201d \u201cThe Moor\u2019s Last Sigh\" and \u201cVictory City\u201d detailed his recovery in his 2024 memoir, \u201cKnife.\u201d",
      "Matar next faces a federal trial on terrorism-related charges. While the first trial focused mostly on the details of the knife attack itself, the next one is expected to delve into the more complicated issue of motive.",
      "Authorities said Matar, a U.S. citizen, was attempting to carry out a decades-old fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie\u2019s death when he traveled from his home in Fairview, New Jersey, to target Rushdie at the summer retreat about 70 miles (112.6 kilometers) southwest of Buffalo.",
      "Matar believed the fatwa, first issued in 1989, was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group\u2019s secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah, according to federal prosecutors.",
      "Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa after publication of Rushdie's novel, \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d which some Muslims consider blasphemous. Rushdie spent years in hiding, but after Iran announced it would not enforce the decree he traveled freely over the past quarter century.",
      "Matar pleaded not guilty to a three-count indictment charging him with providing material to terrorists, attempting to provide material support to Hezbollah and engaging in terrorism transcending national boundaries.",
      "Video of the assault, captured by the venue's cameras and played at trial, show Matar approaching the seated Rushdie from behind and reaching around him to stab at his torso with a knife. As the audience gasps and screams, Rushdie is seen raising his arms and rising from his seat, walking and stumbling for a few steps with Matar hanging on, swinging and stabbing until they both fall and are surrounded by onlookers who rush in to separate them.",
      "Jurors in Matar's first trial delivered their verdict after less than two hours of deliberation.",

      "The Weeknd's first feature film is a surrealist vanity project, writes Associated Press Music Writer Maria Sherman",
      "NEW YORK -- It's the final night of tour. SoFi Stadium, just outside Los Angeles, is packed. 80,000 fans stand before The Weeknd, an endless sea of blinding lights. The bestselling artist born Abel Tesfaye emerges onstage. He launches into the first song. Less than a minute goes by, and the unthinkable happens: His voice cracks. And then it is gone.",
      "That September night in 2022 marked a turning point for Tesfaye. He mines the scene in \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow, \u201d where, ironically, it arrives too late. The tedium of an incoherent first act paints the charismatic performer \u2014 one of the last few decades' most popular \u2014 as an unempathetic protagonist in a nonlinear and nonsensical world.",
      "But how much of The Weeknd is here, really? In his first leading role in a feature film, directed by Trey Edward Shults, Tesfaye plays a fictionalized version of himself, an insomniac musician (as made explicitly clear in the \u201cWake Me Up\u201d leitmotif, where he sings, \u201cSun is never rising / I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s day or night\u201d). He's marred by a recent breakup from an ex portrayed in a cruel voicemail message (\u201cI used to think you were a good person,\u201d she says) and a hedonistic lifestyle, instigated by his superficial friend-manager Lee, played Barry Keoghan.",
      "Shortly after Tesfaye loses his voice, a psychosomatic ailment, he meets superfan Amina, portrayed by Jenna Ortega. She offers temporary comfort and, in return, is afforded no agency. She exists for him. Soon, the uninspired horrors begin, culminating in what recalls the torture scene in \u201cReservoir Dogs\u201d with less violence. Instead, Amina \u2014 when she is not weeping; I urge all viewers to keep a \u201ccry count\u201d and consider what feminist blogs might have to say \u2014 lip-syncs some of The Weeknd's biggest hits back to him, explaining that they're all about \u201cemptiness and heartbreak.\u201d Woven throughout is some conversation about absent fathers and fear of abandonment, with unearned delivery and first-draft acuity \u2014 something gesturing at depth without piercing the surface.",
      "According to press materials, Amina and Lee are not real people but representations of Tesfaye. She is meant to represent Tesfaye's disconnected, \u201cdeeper emotional self\u201d \u2014 and Lee, his public persona. That is not made explicitly clear in the film, except in a very generous reading of the ending. Subtext only works when there is context to back it up, otherwise, you are left with \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d: an exciting vanity project with surrealist imagination but stiff writing, no stakes, limited emotional weight and an unclear narrative.",
      "That won't be an issue for superfans, of course \u2014 those intimately familiar with The Weeknd's music and career. This film appears to be for them and Tesfaye, a producer, alone; they have the framework in which to enjoy the runtime. Considering that fandom is the dominant form of popular culture, it's not a bad business decision.",
      "And it's worked for him before. This is not Tesfaye\u2019s first foray into acting. Aside from his cameo in \u201cUncut Gems,\u201d he starred in HBO\u2019s 2023 series \u201cThe Idol. \u201d He co-created the show with Sam Levinson, a show that similarly presented unearned provocation. At the time, \u201cThe Idol\u201d received criticism for its sadomasochistic storytelling that emerged after a shift away from \u201cthe female perspective,\u201d allegedly a request from Tesfaye. It was not a clever or subversive show, nor was it really even about anything, but it did inspire conversation. It's easy to see how \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d may have similar effects.",
      "In a moment where autobiographical films about musicians are playful and creative \u2014 Pharrell Williams' Lego partnership \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d comes to mind, as does Robbie Williams' \u201c Better Man \u201d \u2014 \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d feels like a misstep for those outside The Weeknd's most devoted. Of course, the film does not identify as a biopic. But it could've benefited from less self-seriousness. And editing.",
      "But what about the music? \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d is connected to Tesfaye's latest album of the same name \u2014 and the final chapter in The Weeknd\u2019s record-breaking trilogy that began with 2020\u2019s \u201cAfter Hours\u201d and continued with 2022\u2019s \u201cDawn FM.\u201d The album, the quietest of the series, worked as an allegory on the trials of fame \u2014 a topic long covered by the most successful purveyors of pop. Retrospectively, it works best as a film's soundtrack than a stand-alone record, ambitious. Like the movie, it gestures at criticism of the celebrity-industrial complex without accomplishing it. It seems obvious, now, to learn that the movie predates the record.",
      "The film's strength far and away is its score, composed by Tesfaye with Daniel Lopatin (better known as the experimental electronic musician Oneohtrix Point Never and for his \u201cGood Time\u201d and \u201cUncut Gems\u201d scores). It builds from Tesfaye's discography and morphs into something physical and psychedelic \u2014 at its most elated, dread-filled and clubby. It is so affecting, it almost distracts from moments of dizzying cinematography, with the films' penchant for spinning frames, zooms into upside skylines, blurred vision and erratic lights.",
      "Those tools feel better suited for a music video, the kind of sophisticated visual world Tesfaye has developed in his pop career. They elevate his euphoric, layered, evocative dance-pop, but they do not translate in this film.",
      "\u201cHurry Up Tomorrow,\u201d a Lionsgate release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language throughout, drug use, some bloody violence and brief nudity. Running time: 105 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "Strouse died at his home in New York City, his family said through the publicity agency The Press Room.",

      "Bono has a seaside villa that\u2019s a short trip away from Cannes",
      "CANNES, France -- Cannes is a short trip from Bono\u2019s seaside villa in Eze-sur-Mer. He bought it with The Edge in 1993, and considers himself grateful to a coastline that, he says, gave him a \u201cdelayed adolescence.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can tell you I\u2019ve slept on beaches close to here,\u201d Bono says with a grin. \u201cI\u2019ve woken up in the sun.\u201d",
      "But that doesn't mean the Cannes Film Festival is a particularly familiar experience for the U2 frontman. He\u2019s here to premiere the Apple TV+ documentary \u201cBono: Stories of Surrender,\u201d which captures his one-man stage show. Before coming, Bono\u2019s daughter, the actor Eve Hewson, gave him some advice.",
      "\u201cShe said: \u2018Just get over yourself and bring it,\u2019\" Bono said in an interview on a hotel off the Croisette. \"What do I have to bring? Bring yourself and your gratitude that you\u2019re a musician and they\u2019re allowing you into a festival that celebrates actors and storytellers of a different kind. I said, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll try to bring it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Besides, Cannes, he notes, was founded amid World War II as an alternative to then-Mussolini controlled Venice Film Festival. It was, he says, \u201cdesigned to find fascists.\u201d",
      "Shifts in geopolitical tectonics was much on Bono's mind. He has spent much of his activist life fighting for aid to Africa and combating HIV-AIDS. U.S. President Donald Trump's dismantling of USAID has reversed much of that.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s irrational is taking pleasure in the defacement of these institutions of mercy,\u201d Bono said.",
      "\u201cBono: Stories of Surrender,\u201d an Andrew Dominik-directed black-and-white film that begins streaming May 30, adapts the one-man stage show that, in turn, came from Bono's 2022 book, \u201cSurrender: 40 Songs, One Story.\u201d",
      "In the film, Bono is self-effacing and reflective, sifting through the formative influence of his father, U2's skyrocketing to fame and considering how ego and social work might be related. He calls it \u201cthe tall tales of a short rock star.\u201d And as was the case on a recent sunny afternoon in Cannes, Bono makes a captivating raconteur.",
      "Remarks have been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "BONO: Well, that\u2019s right. Globalization did very well for the world\u2019s poor. That and increased aid levels brought a billion people out of extreme poverty and halved childhood morality \u2014 remarkable jumps for quality of life for human beings.",
      "But it\u2019s also fair to say certain communities really paid the price for that \u2014 here in Europe, in the United States. And I\u2019m not sure those communities were credited enough for weathering storms that globalization brought. So I understand how we got to this place, but it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s the right place to be in.",
      "Nationalism is not what we need. We grew up in a very charged atmosphere in Ireland. It makes you suspicious of nationalism and those animal spirits that can be drummed up. This is me speaking about surrender, \u201cStories of Surrender,\u201d at a time when the world has never been closer to a world war in my lifetime. At first I think it looks absurd, a bit ridiculous \u2014 now that has never stopped me in the past \u2014 but I think it\u2019s OK to look ridiculous for these ideas. Like surrender, nonviolence, peace.",
      "BONO: The new pope, he does look like a pope. That\u2019s a good start. I just saw the other day his first piece and he was talking about stopping shouting, God might prefer whispers. I thought, \u201cOh, this could be interesting.\u201d I\u2019m more of a shouter myself. I come from punk rock. But I\u2019m learning to turn that shout into a whisper in this film to get to an intimacy.",
      "BONO: Well, the accuracy of the put-down \u2014 \u201cYou are a baritone who thinks he\u2019s a tenor\u201d \u2014 is so all encompassing. I was going to call the play \u201cThe Baritone Who Thinks He\u2019s a Tenor.\u201d He\u2019s on my mind because he\u2019s the reason I sing.",
      "It\u2019s a wound that will never close because after playing him on stage for all those nights \u2014 just by turning left or right \u2014 I always loved him but I started to really like him. He started to make me laugh. There was a gift, as well as the voice, that he left me. Would he forgive me for impersonating him in the Teatro di San Carlo, a sacred place for tenors, probably not. But here I am impersonating an actor, so.",
      "BONO: Mission creep. I knew I had to write the book. The play was so I didn\u2019t have to tour the book in normal promotional activity, that I could actually have fun with it and play all the different characters in my life. I thought it was really good fun. Then I realized: Oh, there\u2019s parts of you that people don\u2019t know about. We don\u2019t go to U2 shows for belly laughs. But that\u2019s a part of who I am, which is the mischief as well as the melancholy.",
      "Then you end up doing a play with a lot of cameras in the way. Enter Andrew Dominik and he taught me something that I didn\u2019t really understand but my daughter does: The camera really knows when you\u2019re lying. So if want to tell this story, you better get ready to take your armor off. You\u2019re going to feel naked in front of the whole school, but that\u2019s what it takes.",
      "BONO: Based on my behavior just in the past week, the answer to that question is probably: Must try harder. The pilgrim\u2019s lack of progress. I would say that I understand a little better where I came from and that where I end up depends on how I deal with that.",
      "I\u2019ve been calling it the hall of mirrors, when you try to figure out who you are and who\u2019s behind the face. Then you just see all these faces staring back at you, and they\u2019re all true. The real star of this movie is my dad. I sort of like him better than I like myself because humor has become so important to me. It\u2019s not like everything needs to be a belly laugh, but there\u2019s a freedom. People like me, we can sing about freedom. It\u2019s much better to be it.",
      "BONO: There\u2019s a minister from Albania who said something that really stuck with me. She said: If you have a chance to hope, it\u2019s a moral duty because most people don\u2019t. So, yes, I feel we\u2019ll figure our way out of this. This is a scary moment.",
      "I think acknowledging that we can lose all we\u2019ve gained is sobering but it may be course-changing. I just believe in people enough. I believe in Americans enough. I\u2019m an Irish person, I can\u2019t tell people how to vote.",
      "I can tell you that a million children dying because their life support systems were pulled out of the wall, with glee, that\u2019s not the America that I recognize or understand. You\u2019re on the front lines of Europe here. America came in and saved the day. Ironically, so did Russia. More people died from Russia fighting the Nazis than everybody else. Now they tread on their own sacred memories by treading on the Ukrainians who also died on the front lines. I think part of that is that history didn\u2019t acknowledge it.",
      "I believe there is integrity in the Russian people. They need to change their leader, in my view. I believe there is integrity in the Americans. They will figure it out. Who was it who said: If you give Americans the facts, they will eventually make the right choice. Right now, they\u2019re not getting the facts. Think of it: a 70% decline in HIV-AIDS, Republican-led, Democratically followed though. The greatest health intervention in the history of medicine to fight HIV-AIDS has been thrown away. It was nearly there. To a space traveler, it\u2019s like getting to Mars and going, \u201cNah, we\u2019ll go back.\u201d It\u2019s bewildering to me.",

      "Thursday night's event at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City was a protest against the suppression of speech and a celebration of being permitted to say what you pleased.",
      "Ruffin presided over a dinner-fundraiser that included a tribute to actor-publisher-bibliophile Sarah Jessica Parker, imprisoned Egyptian poet-songwriter-activist Galal El-Behairy, Wesleyan University President Michael Roth and Macmillan CEO Jon Yaged.",
      "One of the biggest ovations was for a non-speaker, Maine Gov. Janet Mills, who during a White House meeting in February challenged President Donald Trump over her support for transgender athletes, When Trump suspended funds for a Maine child nutrition program, Mills sued in federal court and prevailed.",
      "PEN America, the century-old free speech organization, brought in Ruffin to host soon after the WHCA withdrew its invitation, contending it wanted to focus on the achievements of journalism. Ruffin is a blunt and sometimes profane critic of Trump and duly went after him Thursday, calling him \u201cgross,\" \u201cincompetent,\u201d \u201cracist\u201d and \u201csexually deviant.\u201d She also praised PEN for the chance to speak out.",
      "\u201cThank you to PEN America for asking me to host and more importantly, thank you, PEN America, for Googling me at least once before asking me to host,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m looking at you, White House Correspondents Association.\u201d",
      "Parker was presented the PEN/Audible Literary Service Award, given in previous years to Patti Smith, Robert Caro and Stephen Sondheim among others.",
      "Parker has been a longtime champion of books and literacy and runs the publishing imprint SJP Lit, where authors include Lucy Caldwell, Linda Grant and Elysha Chang. At the Sundance Film Festival in January, she premiered a documentary film for which she served as executive producer, \u201cThe Librarians,\u201d about the fight against book bans.",
      "\u201cTo censor a book is to limit imagination, curiosity, connection, empathy and inspiration,\u201d Parker said during her acceptance speech. \"Libraries aren't just buildings with shelves. They are a beacon. They are warm in the winter and cool in summer, and they are sanctuaries of possibility. They are a heartbeat of the neighborhood.\"",
      "El-Behairy, who has been imprisoned off and on since 2018 on charges of terrorism and \u201cspreading false news,\u201d won the PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Award, given to dissidents who have been jailed. The prize was accepted by his sister, Naiera, and father, Abdelfattah, who noted his son \"paid the price for his opposition with the best years of his life wasted in prison.\u201d",
      "Taye Diggs presented the Business Visionary award to Yaged and joked that he liked the Macmillan executive because he didn't publish his children's books just because Diggs was an extremely handsome and successful Black actor.",
      "Wesleyan President Michael S. Roth, a leading critic of Trump\u2019s threats to cancel research funding at Columbia University and other schools, won the PEN/Benenson Courage Award. During a speech that was loudly cheered, he remembered a happy, outspoken and admittedly privileged childhood during which threats to democracy were rarely considered.",
      "\u201cWe are going to have to draw on love and support if we are to resist the slide towards authoritarianism that has gathered momentum across the land,\" Roth said.",
      "PEN is still recovering from a tumultuous 2024. Allegations that leadership was reluctant to criticize Israel's invasion of Gaza and slow to respond to the suffering of Palestinians, including Palestinian writers and journalists, led to so many writers withdrawing from PEN's spring awards ceremony and World Voices festival that both were canceled. PEN CEO Suzanne Nossel departed at the end of the year and a permanent replacement has not yet been announced.",
      "The awards night and World Voices returned this month, although with reminders of the ongoing war in Gaza. Several prize nominees withdrew from competition, including two of the five finalists for the $75,000 Jean Stein Book Award for a work of \u201coriginality, merit, and impact.\u201d The daughters of Stein, the late author, editor and philanthropist, decided the prize money would be donated to the Palestine Children's Relief Fund and to Palestine Legal, a U.S.-based defense organization.",

      "LONDON -- Singer Chris Brown was arrested Thursday in England for allegedly hitting someone with a bottle in a London nightclub in 2023.",
      "The Metropolitan Police did not name Brown but said it took a 36-year-old into custody at a Manchester hotel on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. Under British law, police cannot name suspects before charges are filed.",
      "The Sun, which first reported the story, said producer Abe Diaw told them Sunday that he was hospitalized after Brown beat him in an unprovoked attack at the Tape nightclub in the swanky Mayfair neighborhood in London in February 2023.",
      "The tabloid said it became aware Brown was in the U.K. on Wednesday and called police to find out if he was under arrest. The newspaper said Met officers then traveled to Manchester and made the arrest.",
      "Brown's representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "Diaw said Brown cracked him on the head with a bottle and punched and kicked him on the floor. The producer has filed a 12 million pound ($16 million) lawsuit against the singer.",
      "Brown was on a U.K. tour at the time of the incident. He is scheduled to tour the U.K. in June and July.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Jon Batiste is hitting the road again. The Grammy and Oscar winner is launching his second headlining tour, promising fresh sounds for his forthcoming album and material from his latest project, \u201cBeethoven Blues (Batiste Piano Series, Vol. 1).\u201d",
      "Batiste announced Thursday that his Big Money Tour: Jon Batiste Plays America will begin Aug. 27 in Kansas City. He'll groove through more than 30 venues across the U.S. in cities like Detroit, Austin, Texas, Nashville, a co-bill with Diana Ross in St. Louis and Philadelphia, before closing in Washington, D.C. on Oct. 31.",
      "For the first time, Batiste will grace the stages of the Encore Theater in Las Vegas and the iconic Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado. He hopes the tour will offer attendees a deeper connection to him as an artist for the tour, a nod to his ninth studio album.",
      "\u201cEvery show is both an origin story and a manifesto,\u201d said Batiste, a seven-time Grammy winner who won an Oscar for his work on \u201cSoul\u201d in 2020. The tour comes on the heels of performing the national anthem at this year's Super Bowl and \u201cBeethoven Blues,\u201d which reimagined the famed German pianist\u2019s work and debuted No. 1 on Billboard's classical albums chart.",
      "Batiste, a Louisiana native, is known for his signature rich blend of R&B, hip-hop, swing, jazz and pop. He's also the former bandleader for the \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\u201d",
      "The multitalented musician will wrap up his intimate Maestro Tour shows on Monday in Los Angeles.",
      "He expects to be joined on the road by his wife, Suleika Jaouad, who is currently facing cancer for the third time and recently released a new book, \u201cThe Book of Alchemy.\u201d",
      "Batiste believes his unreleased music can still forge a connection, even with those hearing it for the first time.",
      "\u201cI try to tell the most up-to-date origin story through the set,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you come to the show and you don\u2019t know any of the music, or you don\u2019t know anybody on stage and it\u2019s your first time seeing me perform or seen me on television, you\u2019ll leave and feel like you know the songs. You\u2019ll connect with the artist, the human being and the movement. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re going to see a play.\u201d",
      "Batiste said the tour will mark the beginning of his \u201cnext era\u201d of music. He views the live performances as an opportunity to introduce new material to audiences, allowing the songs to evolve through connection before ultimately recording them for his forthcoming album.",
      "Tickets will be available through artist presales beginning Friday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about getting the music to a point where you and your community and everybody is acquainted with the sound and feeling of it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve explored every aspect of it. You\u2019ve arranged and rearranged, then go record and share it, versus the opposite, which is most often the case. It\u2019s fresh and brand new. Then you go on tour, and you start discovering things in the music on stage you didn\u2019t even know were there in the studio.\u201d",
      "Along with introducing fresh sounds, Batiste said he'll incorporate some improvisation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always going to find a space in the show where there's improv,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's at the heart of what I\u2019m all about in trying to represent the cultural music that I come from. I really take a responsibility to push forward. This is about bringing people together, channeling the moment and communal expression.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Actor Daniel Dae Kim more than made the nominee list for the Tony Awards",
      "The first monologue Daniel Dae Kim ever performed was by David Henry Hwang.",
      "He had to do one for his college summer program at the National Theater Institute in Connecticut. Kim chose a scene from \u201cFOB,\" Hwang's play about the assimilation struggles of a Chinese American. So, it's fitting that 35 years later Hwang \u2014 the first Asian American to win the Tony Award for best play \u2014 would be the one to bring Kim into the Tony spotlight.",
      "Known for TV series such as \u201cLost\u201d and \u201cHawaii Five-0,\u201d Kim, 56, is the first Asian nominee in the category of best leading actor in a play in the Tonys\u2019 78-year history for his work in a Broadway revival of Hwang\u2019s \u201cYellow Face.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can imagine a lot of things, but I did not imagine this scenario with David,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThat I would be in a play with him, that we would both be nominated for Tony Awards and we would be able to call each other friends.\u201d",
      "In the semi-autobiographical show, which ran last fall at the Roundabout Theatre Company, Kim played a satirical version of Hwang. The show also scored nods for best play revival and best performance by a featured actor in a play for first-time nominee Francis Jue, an original 2007 cast member.",
      "You could not have scripted a better ending for a play that was written in response to the musical \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d casting white actors as Asian characters.",
      "Kim's performance was filmed in November and PBS will broadcast \u201cYellow Face\u201d on Friday. The Tonys, airing on CBS on June 8, also will put a spotlight on the play.",
      "This groundbreaking nomination seems like the perfect karmic reward for Kim, who has spent years advocating for greater Asian representation. At the pandemic's height, the Korean American actor was a constant media presence speaking out against anti-Asian hate. He also jump-started a campaign for veteran actor James Hong, then 91, to get a Hollywood star.",
      "He woke up to the news of his nomination after people were able to get around his phone's \u201cdo not disturb\u201d mode. His competition includes George Clooney and Cole Escola.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be a huge surprise if I won, but I will say that even getting the nomination is a win especially when you put it in the context of our community and what this means for Asian Americans,\u201d said Kim, whose previous Broadway credits include \u201cThe King and I.\u201d",
      "He admits it's surprising and \u201ca little sad\u201d that no other Asian actor has been in this category. There\u2019s still never been an Asian nominee for best lead actress in a play.",
      "\u201cOf course, the barrier we really want to break is to actually have someone win, and hopefully that happens sooner rather than later, whether it\u2019s me or not.\u201d",
      "Kim is one of seven Asian acting nominees this year. Only three acting trophy winners have been Asian. One was Lea Salonga for \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d and another was Ruthie Ann Miles for \u201cThe King and I.\u201d Coincidentally, the first was BD Wong for best featured actor in Hwang's Tony-winning play, \u201cM. Butterfly.\u201d Hwang takes special pride in helping actors break glass ceilings.",
      "\u201cI get to feel like, \u2018Oh, maybe I\u2019m actually able to make a difference\u2019 and change the culture in the way that my little-kid-self would have loved but would not have thought possible,\" said Hwang, who now has his fourth career Tony nomination. He was last nominated 22 years ago.",
      "For a long time, Hwang felt the only way to get a play with Asian characters made was to set it outside America because \"Broadway audiences are not interested in Asian Americans.\u201d",
      "Historically, productions with Asian ensembles have been musicals set in \u201cthe exotic lands of Asia,\u201d such as \u201cThe King and I,\" said Esther Kim Lee, a theater studies professor at Duke University and author of \u201cThe Theatre of David Henry Hwang.\" \u201cFlower Drum Song,\u201d set in San Francisco, was an exception but the songs and book were by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. Hwang actually revised the book in 2002.",
      "\u201cIt's 2025. We finally see an actual Asian American play with an Asian American lead,\u201d Lee said. \u201cYou can have \u2018The King and I\u2019 and have great actors and they may get Tony Awards, but it\u2019s really not about Asian Americans. That this has happened with \u2018Yellow Face\u2019 is just incredible.\u201d",
      "The show's two-month run brought the Roundabout a 50% increase in first-time audience members \u2014 \u201ca powerful statement,\" Kim said.",
      "\u201cOne of the nicest compliments I would hear after the show when I would go to the stage door is, \u2018This is the first Broadway show I\u2019ve ever seen,\u2019\" Kim said. \u201cThat meant a lot to me because bringing Asian Americans into the theater is important and bringing younger people into the theater is important just for the health of theater in general.\u201d",
      "Besides discussing whitewash casting, \u201cYellow Face\u201d examines the pain of the main character's immigrant father. The role is based on Hwang's father's experience being wrongly accused of laundering money for China. With the current anti-immigrant and anti-DEI climate, the show's airing on PBS feels especially vital to Hwang.",
      "\u201cWhenever there\u2019s a conflict between America and any Asian country, Asian Americans are the first to get targeted,\u201d Hwang said.",
      "PBS is also where in 2020 the five-episode history docuseries \u201cAsian Americans\" aired for Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month. Kim was a narrator and remains \u201cunequivocally proud\" of the project.",
      "Five years after the rise of anti-Asian hate crimes, Kim sees \u201cYellow Face\u201d simply making it to Broadway as a victory.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to get preachy, but I will say that the goal with spotlighting and elevating people of color is not to threaten the establishment,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThe goal was really to say everyone can contribute to our society. Everyone can be a positive force for change.\u201d",

      "GENEVA -- The World Health Organization on Monday opened its annual meeting of government ministers and other top envoys facing one of the most serious crises of its 77-year history in the wake of Trump administration funding cuts and plans to withdraw the United States.",
      "The U.N. health agency this year has seen a plunge in its ability to carry out its sweeping mandate to do everything from recommend reductions in sugar levels in soft drinks to head the global response to pandemics like COVID-19 or outbreaks like polio or Ebola.",
      "Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has been grappling with a response to the U.S. cuts as well as reduced outlays from other traditional Western donors who are putting more money toward defense and less toward humanitarian aid.",
      "Matthew Kavanagh, the director of Georgetown University\u2019s center for Global Health Policy and Politics, said other countries have used the \u201cU.S. disruption\u201d \u2014 the cut in aid \u2014 \u201cas cover to do their maneuvering, with many countries in Europe reducing aid.\u201d",

      "Member countries are expected to agree to raise annual dues, known as \u201cassessed contributions,\u201d by 20% to support WHO finances and reduce dependency on governments\u2019 voluntary contributions \u2014 which change each year and make up over half of the budget.",
      "They are also expected to agree to a hard-wrought \u201c pandemic treaty \u201d that was born of a desire to avoid any replay of the patchy, unequal response to COVID-19 when the next \u2014 and inevitable, most experts say \u2014 pandemic hits.",

      "MILWAUKEE -- Feel like you can't focus? Like you'll never finish a book again? Like the only way to keep your mind and hands busy is to scroll on social media for hours?",
      "You're far from alone. One body of decades-long research found the average person's attention span for a single screen is 47 seconds, down from 2.5 minutes in 2004. The 24/7 news cycle, uncertainty about the state of the world and countless hours of screen time don\u2019t help, experts say.",
      "\u201cWhen my patients talk to me about this stuff there is often a feeling of helplessness or powerlessness,\u201d said Dr. Michael Ziffra, a psychiatrist at Northwestern Medicine. \u201cBut you can change these behaviors. You can improve your attention span.\u201d",
      "Here are ways to start that process. As you read, challenge yourself to set a 2.5 minute timer and stay on this article without looking at another device or clicking away.",
      "A shifting attention is an evolutionary feature, not a bug. Our brains are hardwired to quickly filter information and hone in on potential threats or changes in what's happening around us.",
      "What's grabbing our attentions has changed. For our ancestors, it might have been a rustle in the bushes putting us on guard for a lurking tiger. Today, it could be a rash of breaking news alerts and phone notifications.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic warped many people's sense of time and increased their screen usage like never before, said Stacey Nye, a clinical psychologist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.",
      "Technology isn't the only thing that influences our attention, experts say, but the effects of those pinging notifications or hours scrolling through 30-second long videos can build up over time.",
      "\u201cOur attention span has really been trained to only focus in those little, small blips and it interrupts our natural focus cycles,\u201d she said.",
      "Experts say \u201cactive\u201d breaks are among the best way to retrain your mind and your attention. They only take about 30 minutes, Nye said, and can be as simple as taking a walk while noticing things around you or moving to another room for lunch.",
      "Don't be afraid to get creative. Develop a list of alternative activities or randomly choose ideas out of a fish bowl. Try craft projects, a short meditation, fixing a quick meal or talking a walk outside. All the better if you can involve a friend as well.",
      "The break needs to be a physical or mental activity \u2014 no passive phone-scrolling.",
      "When the brain is understimulated and looking for change, it\u2019ll usually grab onto the first thing it sees. The smartphone, an \u201cever-producing change machine,\u201d is an enticing option, said Cindy Lustig, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Michigan.",
      "Turn off unnecessary notifications and put that \u201cdo not disturb\u201d mode to good use, especially before bedtime. Better yet, put your phone in a whole different room, Lustig said.",
      "Multitasking may make you feel like you're getting more done, but brain experts recommend against it.",
      "\u201cBe a single tasker,\" Nye said. \u201cWork on one thing at a time, for a specified period of time and begin to work your way up.\u201d",
      "Lustig is a big fan of the \u201cPomodoro technique,\" in which you set a timer and work on something for 25 or 30 minutes before taking a five-minute break.",
      "She tells herself: \u201cI can do anything for this amount of time,\" and the world will still be waiting for her at the end.",
      "It's not enough to just have a hobby, Lustig said. It helps to choose hobbies that include deliberate practice and a goal to strive toward, whether it's playing guitar for an audience or improving in a sport.",
      "It helps to pick something that you enjoy as well.",
      "\u201cYou don't want to start with the heavy nonfiction or like \u2018War and Peace,\u2019\u201d Lustig said. \u201cIf you need to start with the romance novel, then start with the romance novel. You can work your way up.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also important to be kind to yourself. Everyone has good and bad days, and attention needs are different \u2014 and even vary from task to task.",
      "The key is to make an intentional effort, experts say.",

    "summary": "Health officials are urging vigilance as reports of bird flu cases in humans appear to have stopped",
    "story": [
      "Health officials are urging vigilance as reports of bird flu cases in humans appear to have stopped",
      "Health officials are making a renewed call for vigilance against bird flu, but some experts are puzzling over why reports of new human cases have stopped.",
      "Has the search for cases been weakened by government cuts? Are immigrant farm workers, who have accounted for many of the U.S. cases, more afraid to come forward for testing amid the Trump administration's deportation push? Is it just a natural ebb in infections?",
      "\u201cWe just don't know why there haven't been cases,\u201d said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. \u201cI think we should assume there are infections that are occurring in farmworkers that just aren't being detected.\u201d",
      "The H5N1 bird flu has been spreading widely among wild birds, poultry and other animals around the world for several years, and starting early last year became a problem in people and cows in the U.S.",
      "In the last 14 months, infections have been reported in 70 people in the U.S. \u2014 most of them workers on dairy and poultry farms. One person died, but most of the infected people had mild illnesses.",
      "The most recent infections confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were in early February in Nevada, Ohio and Wyoming.",
      "California had been a hotspot, with three-quarters of the nation\u2019s infections in dairy cattle. But testing and cases among people have fallen off. At least 50 people were tested each month in late 2024, but just three people were tested in March, one in April and none in May so far, state records show. Overall, the state has confirmed H5N1 infections in 38 people, none after Jan. 14.",
      "During a call with U.S. doctors this month, one CDC official noted that there is a seasonality to bird flu: Cases peak in the fall and early winter, possibly due to the migration patterns of wild birds that are primary spreaders of the virus.",
      "That could mean the U.S. is experiencing a natural \u2014 maybe temporary \u2014 decline in cases.",
      "It's unlikely that a severe human infection, requiring hospitalization, would go unnoticed, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases.",
      "What's more, a patchwork system that monitors viruses in sewage and wastewater has suggested limited activity recently.",
      "New infections are still being detected in birds and cattle, but not as frequently as several months ago.",
      "\u201cGiven the fact that the number of animal detections has fallen according to USDA data, it\u2019s not surprising that human cases have declined as well,\u201d the CDC said in a statement.",
      "Dr. Gregory Gray said he wasn\u2019t concerned about the CDC not identifying new cases in months.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody\u2019s hiding anything,\u201d said Gray, an infectious disease speicialist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.",
      "But Osterholm and some other experts think it's likely that at least some milder infections are going undetected. And they worry that the effort to find them has been eroding.",
      "Resignations at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine could slow the government\u2019s bird flu monitoring, said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.",
      "Three of 14 experts accepted deferred resignation offers at the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which responds to disease outbreaks with crucial diagnostic information, he said. They are among more than 15,000 USDA staff to accept the offers, an agency spokesperson said.",
      "And dozens of staff were fired at the FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, which investigates animal diseases caused by problems including contaminated pet food. Cats in several states have been sickened and died after eating raw pet food found to contain poultry infected with H5N1.",
      "Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, said \"targeted surveillance has really dropped off precipitously since Trump took office.\"",
      "She wonders if immigrant farmworkers are too scared to come forward.",
      "\"I can\u2019t argue with anyone who would be risking getting shipped to a Salvadoran gulag for reporting an exposure or seeking testing,\u201d she said.",
      "The CDC characterizes the risk to the general public as low, although it is higher for people who work with cattle and poultry or who are in contact with wild birds.",
      "Earlier this month, an agency assessment said there is a \u201cmoderate risk\u201d that currently circulating strains of bird flu could cause a future pandemic, but the CDC stressed that other emerging forms of bird flu has been similarly labeled in the past.",
      "Still, research is continuing.",
      "Texas A&M University scientists have collected blood samples from dairy workers in multiple states to test for signs of past H5N1 exposure, said David Douphrate, a workplace health and safety expert leading the project. The yearlong study is funded by a nearly $4 million grant from the CDC and is expected to conclude in July.",
      "Douphrate said he leveraged two decades of relationships with dairy producers and workers to gain access to the farms.",
      "\u201cWe have had very good participation,\u201d Douphrate said. \u201cThey have been very willing.\u201d",
      "Similar surveillance is \u201curgently needed\u201d among domestic cats, said Kristen Coleman, a researcher at the University of Maryland at College Park who studies emerging animal diseases. She recently released a paper reviewing bird flu in infections in cats between 2004 and 2024.",
      "Barn cats that died after drinking raw milk were one of the first signs that dairy cows were becoming infected with bird flu in 2024. Since then, the Agriculture Department has confirmed more than 120 domestic cats infected with the virus across the U.S.",
      "Infections have mostly been found in cats that died. Less is known about milder infections, whether cats can recover from bird flu \u2014 or whether the virus can spill over into people.",
      "Coleman has been collecting blood samples from cats across the U.S. to see if they have evidence of previous exposure to the virus. But the process is slow and research funding is uncertain.",
      "\u201cIt's easy to downplay something because that's usually what humans do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what we really need to be doing is ramping up.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Infant twins suffered from malnutrition in Nigeria",
      "DIKWA, Nigeria -- Under the dappled light of a thatched shelter, Yagana Bulama cradles her surviving infant. The other twin is gone, a casualty of malnutrition and the international funding cuts that are snapping the lifeline for displaced communities in Nigeria\u2019s insurgency-ravaged Borno state.",
      "\u201cFeeding is severely difficult,\u201d said Bulama, 40, who was a farmer before Boko Haram militants swept through her village, forcing her to flee. She and about 400,000 other people at the humanitarian hub of Dikwa \u2014 virtually the entire population \u2014 rely on assistance. The military restricts their movements to a designated \u201csafe zone,\u201d which severely limits farming.",
      "For years, the United States Agency for International Development had been the backbone of the humanitarian response in northeastern Nigeria, helping non-government organizations provide food, shelter and healthcare to millions of people. But this year, the Trump administration cut more than 90% of USAID's foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall assistance around the world.",
      "Programs serving children were hit hard.",
      "Bulama previously lost young triplets to hunger before reaching therapeutic feeding centers in Dikwa. When she gave birth to twins last August, both were severely underweight. Workers from Mercy Corps enrolled them in a program to receive a calorie-dense paste used to treat severe acute malnutrition.",
      "But in February, Mercy Corps abruptly ended the program that was entirely financed by USAID. Two weeks later, one of the twins died, Bulama said.",
      "She has no more tears, only dread for what may come next.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to bury another child,\u201d she said.",
      "Globally, 50% of the therapeutic foods for treating malnutrition in children were funded by USAID, and 40% of the supplies were produced in the U.S., according to Shawn Baker, chief program officer at Helen Keller Intl and former chief nutritionist at USAID.",
      "He said the consequence could be 1 million children not receiving treatment for severe malnutrition, resulting in 163,500 additional deaths per year. For Helen Keller Intl, its programs in Bangladesh, Nepal and Nigeria have been terminated.",
      "\u201cIt is very traumatic,\u201d said Trond Jensen, the head of the United Nations humanitarian office in Maiduguri, Borno's capital, of the funding cuts, noting that other donors, including the European Union, have taken similar steps this year. \u201cOne of the things is the threat to the lives of children.\u201d",
      "UNICEF still runs a therapeutic feeding center nearby, which now supports Bulama's surviving baby, but its capacity is stretched. It is turning away many people previously served by other aid groups that have pulled out due to funding cuts.",
      "Intersos, an Italian humanitarian organization, has the only remaining facility providing in-patient services for malnutrition in Dikwa, treating the most perilous cases. Its workers say they are overwhelmed, with at least 10 new admissions of seriously malnourished children daily.",
      "\u201cBefore the USAID cut, we made a lot of progress,\u201d said Ayuba Kauji, a health and nutrition supervisor. \u201cNow my biggest worry is high mortality. We don\u2019t have enough resources to keep up.\u201d",
      "Intersos was forced to reduce its staff from 30 to 11 in Dikwa after the USAID freeze. Its nutrition and health facilities now operate solely on support from the Nigerian Humanitarian Fund, a smaller pot of money contributed by a few European countries. That funding will be finished in June.",
      "The crisis is equally acute in Maiduguri, where the economy is reeling from massive terminations of aid workers. At another Intersos-run facility, 10 of the 12 doctors have left and four nurses remain, with 50 new admissions of malnourished children per week.",
      "\u201cIt used to be far less,\u201d said Emmanuel Ali, one of the remaining doctors.",
      "The effects of the funding cuts extend far beyond nutrition. At the International Organization for Migration's reception center in Dikwa, thousands of displaced families and those escaping Boko Haram captivity are stranded. There are no new shelters being built and no support for relocation.",
      "\u201cBefore, organizations like Mercy Corps built mud-brick homes and rehabilitated damaged shelters to absorb people from the IOM reception center,\u201d said one official at the center, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the situation. \u201cNow, that has stopped.\u201d",
      "Jensen, the U.N. humanitarian head in Maiduguri, said, \u201csadly, we are not seeing additional funding to make up for the U.S. cuts.\u201d He warned that vulnerable people could turn to risky ways of coping, including joining violent groups.",
      "The crisis in Nigeria is part of a larger reckoning. According to Kate Phillips-Barrasso, Mercy Corps' vice president for policy and advocacy, 40 of its 62 U.S.-funded programs with the potential to reach 3.5 million people in Nigeria, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Somalia, Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, Kenya, Lebanon and Gaza have been terminated.",
      "In Mozambique, where jihadist violence in the north has displaced over a million people since 2017, humanitarian organizations face steep shortfalls with \u201cdevastating\u201d effects on the needy, said Frederico Jo\u00e3o, chairman of the forum of NGOs in the region.",
      "More widely, the USAID funding cut compromises Mozambique's health sector, especially in HIV/AIDS care, said Inoc\u00eancio Impissa, cabinet spokesman. The government now seeks alternative funding to prevent total collapse of health systems.",

      "As mental health awareness increases, so are conversations about about what constitutes toxic behavior at work and the kinds of treatment people won't tolerate for a steady paycheck",
      "NEW YORK -- One week into a new job, Lisa Grouette discovered something missing come Sunday night: the sinking feeling of dread she used to experience before going to work every Monday.",
      "Groutte spent 10 years at an insurance agency with a boss whom she alleges screamed at her, slammed his hands on the desk, insulted her appearance and punched things. He falsely accused her of taking money and threatened to withhold an employment recommendation if she quit, she says.",
      "Fearing she wouldn\u2019t land another job if she left the toxic workplace, she stayed. \u201cIt was this implied, \u2018You\u2019re stuck,'\" Grouette, 48, recalled.",
      "But eventually, she found a way out. When a full-time job opened up at a newspaper where she worked a part-time photography job, she resigned from the insurance agency. The new position paid $400 less per month, but Grouette reduced her expenses to make it work.",
      "\u201cYou can't put a price tag on it,\u201d she said. \"It was the best 400 bucks a month I've ever spent, worth every penny. I was a little tight at first, but it didn't matter because I was happy.\u201d",
      "As mental health awareness increases, so are conversations about about what constitutes unhealthy behavior and the kinds of treatment people will not \u2014 or should not \u2014 tolerate for a steady paycheck.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re developing language now around things like toxic workplaces,\u201d said Jennifer Tosti-Kharas, a professor of organizational behavior at Babson College in Massachusetts.",
      "Younger generations entering the workforce, including millennials and members of Generation Z, are less willing to endure bullying behavior from colleagues and managers, and better at establishing boundaries, she said.",
      "At the start of her own career, \u201cif I encountered toxicity in the workplace, I had more of a \u2018Suck it up\u2019 attitude,\" said Tosti-Kharas, who identifies as a member of Generation X. \u201cI don\u2019t think we were as vocal about taking care of our mental health as we should have been.\u201d",
      "Conflicts and difficult relationships may be inevitable in any work environment. But there's a difference between an occasional disagreement and persistent abuse.",
      "\u201cWhat makes something toxic: it\u2019s more pervasive, more consistent over time,\u201d Tosti-Kharas said. \u201cYou may have tried some things and it\u2019s not getting better. ... It\u2019s very deeply entrenched.\u201d",
      "Possible indications of an emotionally harmful workplace include a widespread lack of trust and fear of being shot down if you speak up, she said.",
      "Loud screamers aren't the only kind of toxic co-workers and supervisors. There are quieter forms of toxicity, such as passive-aggressive behavior by leaders who use sarcasm, backhanded compliments, indirect criticism and exclusion to control their employees, according to Alana Atchison, a clinical psychologist based in Chicago.",
      "\u201cIt is a relationship where you can\u2019t communicate clearly or directly, so you have to silence yourself. You can\u2019t say truly what you need to say and feel safe,\u201d Atchison said.",
      "To spot a potentially toxic environment when applying for a new job, follow your gut instincts and consider warning signs. For example, frequent ads for the same position may reflect high turnover resulting from a negative environment. You can also search employee reviews online.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m reading Glassdoor reviews like crazy to see what the environment is like, what the culture is like, on anyplace I\u2019m applying to, because I can\u2019t lose my hair again over a job,\u201d said Grouette, who recently was laid off after several successful years at the newspaper.",
      "When on the receiving end of toxicity, consider whether the offending behavior says more about the person perpetuating it than the recipient.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a smokescreen to hide their deficits,\u201d Atchison said. \u201cIf someone feels insecure about their role or fears being overshadowed, they might resort to undermining others, gossiping or sabotaging projects to regain a sense of control or safety.\u201d",
      "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Atchison's clients have increasingly complained about toxic work environments. She attributes that in part to the social isolation that accompanied lockdowns and restrictions on public activities.",
      "\u201cSocializing is a skill set, and that skill set has declined,\" she said.",
      "If you find yourself in a toxic work situation, talking about it with a trusted friend or professional therapist can help you process what is happening and develop a plan to deal with it, instead of letting it fester in your mind.",
      "Stephanie Strausser, 42, a video production manager, said she sought support from friends and family members when she worked under an extreme micromanager who made her feel unsafe and whose decisions she considered unethical.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t hide it or keep it in. Talk to people. Even if you\u2019re talking to ChatGPT,\" Strausser advises those who find themselves in similar circumstances. \"Don\u2019t internalize it. And don\u2019t take someone\u2019s perception as fact.\u201d",
      "Amanda Szmuc, a Philadelphia lawyer who considers some of her past work environments to have been toxic, recommends documenting your concerns in case it becomes necessary to escalate them.",
      "Writing down the details of troubling interactions as they happen and keeping copies of inappropriate messages or approved meeting recordings may come in handy if the human resources department gets involved, for example.",
      "Maintaining a record may also help you avoid gaslighting and reinforce your determination to protect yourself.",
      "If leaving a toxic environment isn't financially possible or you want to try to make your circumstances more bearable, think about exploring ways to limit your interaction with the difficult party may be an option.",
      "Possibilities may include negotiating a role that puts distance between you and the toxic person, such as working different shifts or on different projects, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "You can also set deadlines for yourself to keep things from deteriorating, according to Szmuc. Examples: \u201cI\u2019m going to give this two weeks. Is there any improvement?\u201d she said. \u201cIs there a way internally where I can maybe change my circumstances or get someone else\u2019s opinion?\u201d",
      "Ideally, an employee who feels mistreated could appeal to someone from human resources or the offending employee's manager with evidence to show a pattern of conduct violations and disciplinary action would be taken, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "But that doesn't always happen, leaving the reporting party in close proximity with the person they reported. \u201cIn the real world, you may realize they are unlikely to go anywhere, and it\u2019s you who has to go somewhere,\u201d Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "In extreme situations, it's best to look for another job, she said.",
      "If an inspector found radon in your house, \u201cyou wouldn't say, \u2018Let me try to work with the radon,\u2019 or \u2018How can I keep it there but maybe lessen the effects?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cYou would get the toxin out of the situation or you would get yourself out of the situation.\u201d",
      "Most people can't afford to leave their jobs without another one lined up. Carving out time to apply for different jobs is difficult when you feel under assault but also is empowering and may lead to a better situation.",
      "\u201cIf somebody gives you an impression that you\u2019re not able to leave this job, that\u2019s just not true,\u201d Grouette said. \u201cThose sorts of people don\u2019t have the reach or respect that they claim to have, because if they\u2019re volatile to you, they\u2019re volatile to others.\u201d",

      "Missouri lawmakers have approved a referendum seeking to repeal an abortion-rights amendment passed by voters six months ago",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Six months after Missouri voters approved an abortion-rights amendment, Republican state lawmakers on Wednesday approved a new referendum that would seek the amendment's repeal and instead ban most abortions with exceptions for rape an incest.",
      "The newly proposed constitutional amendment would go back to voters in November 2026, or sooner, if Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe calls a special election before then.",
      "Republican senators used a series of rare procedural moves to cut off discussion by opposing Democrats before passing the proposed abortion-rights revision by a 21-11 vote. The measure passed the Republican-led House last month.",
      "Immediately after the vote, protestors erupted with chants of \u201cStop the ban!\u201d and were ushered out of the Senate chamber.",
      "The Senate then blocked further Democratic debate and gave final approval to a separate measure repealing provisions of a voter-approved law guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers and cost-of-living increases to the minimum wage. That measure does not go back to the ballot. It will instead become law when signed by Kehoe, who has expressed his support for it.",
      "After taking the sweeping votes, the Senate effectively ended its annual legislative session \u2014 two days ahead of a constitutional deadline to wrap up work.",
      "Democrats were outraged by the legislative actions and vowed to retaliate by slowing down any Senate work next year.",
      "\u201cOur rights are under attack,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Brian Williams said during debate. He accused Republicans of \u201ctrying to overturn the will of the voters.\u201d",
      "Republicans contend they are simply giving voters a second chance on abortion \u2014 and are confident they will change their minds because of the new rape and incest exceptions.",
      "\u201cAbortion is the greatest tragedy in the world right now,\u201d Republican state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman said while explaining her efforts to repeal the abortion-rights amendment. If someone's fine with \u201ctaking the life of an innocent, then probably you can justify whatever you want.\u201d",
      "Some GOP lawmakers said they needed to repeal the paid sick leave requirement, which kicked in May 1, because it's adding costs that threaten the financial viability of small businesses. Republicans had been negotiating with Democrats over an alternative to exempt only the smallest businesses before scrapping that and opting for the full repeal.",
      "Missouri lawmakers have a history of altering voter-approved policies. They previously tried to block funding for a voter-approved Medicaid expansion and authored changes to voter-approved measures regulating dog breeders and legislative redistricting.",
      "Missouri's abortion policies have swung dramatically in recent years.",
      "When the U.S. Supreme Court ended a nationwide right to abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022, it triggered a Missouri law to take effect banning most abortions. But abortion-rights activists gathered initiative petition signatures to reverse that.",
      "Last November, Missouri voters narrowly approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a right to abortion until fetal viability, generally considered sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy.

It also would prohibit gender transition surgeries, hormone treatments and puberty blockers for minors, which already are barred under state law.",
      "Polling indicates \u201cthat most voters are opposed to most abortions in Missouri but do want to allow for abortions with limited exceptions,\u201d said Sam Lee, director of Campaign Life Missouri.",
      "The ballot title that voters will see doesn't explicitly mention repealing Amendment 3. Instead, it says the new measure would \u201censure women's safety during abortions, ensure parental consent for minors\" and \u201callow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest.\u201d It also states that it will \u201cprotect children from gender transition,\u201d among other provisions.",

    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency says it will roll back limits on several types of what are known as forever chemicals in drinking water",
      "On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to weaken limits on some harmful \u201cforever chemicals\u201d in drinking water roughly a year after the Biden administration finalized the first-ever national standards.",
      "The Biden administration said last year the rules could reduce PFAS exposure for millions of people. It was part of a broader push by officials then to address drinking water quality by writing rules to require the removal of toxic lead pipes and, after years of activist concern, address the threat of forever chemicals.",
      "President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks.",
      "Now, we know the EPA plans to rescind limits for certain PFAS and lengthen deadlines for two of the most common types. Here are some of the essential things to know about PFAS chemicals and what the EPA decided to do:",
      "PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the nation\u2019s air, water and soil.",
      "They were manufactured by companies such as 3M, Chemours and others because they were incredibly useful. They helped eggs slide across nonstick frying pans, ensured that firefighting foam suffocates flames and helped clothes withstand the rain and keep people dry.",
      "The chemicals resist breaking down, however, which means they stay around in the environment.",
      "Environmental activists say that PFAS manufacturers knew about the health harms of PFAS long before they were made public. The same attributes that make the chemicals so valuable \u2013 resistance to breakdown \u2013 make them hazardous to people.",
      "PFAS accumulates in the body, which is why the Biden administration set limits for two common types, often called PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion that are phased out of manufacturing but still present in the environment.",
      "There is a wide range of health harms now associated with exposure to certain PFAS. Cases of kidney disease, low-birth weight and high cholesterol in addition to certain cancers can be prevented by removing PFAS from water, according to the EPA.",
      "The guidance on PFOA and PFOS has changed dramatically in recent years as scientific understanding has advanced. The EPA in 2016, for example, said the combined amount of the two substances should not exceed 70 parts per trillion. The Biden administration later said no amount is safe.",
      "The EPA plans to scrap limits on three types of PFAS, some of which are less well known. They include GenX substances commonly found in North Carolina as well as substances called PFHxS and PFNA. There is also a limit on a mixture of PFAS, which the agency is also planning to rescind.",
      "It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for these types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration\u2019s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.",
      "For the two commonly found types, PFOA and PFOS, the EPA will keep the current limits in place but give utilities two more years \u2014 until 2031 \u2014 to meet them.",
      "Some environmental groups argue that the EPA can't legally weaken the regulations. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.",
      "\u201cThe law is very clear that the EPA can\u2019t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,\u201d said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "Environmental activists have generally slammed the EPA for not keeping the Biden-era rules in place, saying it will worsen public health.",
      "Industry had mixed reactions. The American Chemistry Council questioned the Biden administration's underlying science that supported the tight rules and said the Trump administration had considered the concerns about cost and the underlying science.",
      "\u201cHowever, EPA\u2019s actions only partially address this issue, and more is needed to prevent significant impacts on local communities and other unintended consequences,\u201d the industry group said.",
      "Leaders of two major utility industry groups, the American Water Works Association and Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, said they supported the EPA's decision to rescind a novel approach to limit a mix of chemicals. But they also said the changes do not substantially reduce the cost of the PFAS rule.",
      "Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.",
      "They did, however, get an extension.",
      "\u201cThis gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,\u201d said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.",

      "Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy wanted an assurance from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. before he would vote to put him in charge of the nation's $1.7 trillion health department.",
      "Kennedy's history of promoting conspiracy theories or misspeaking about vaccines alarmed Cassidy, he said during a confirmation hearing earlier this year.",
      "So, the Louisiana senator asked: \"Can I trust that that is now in the past?\"",
      "Kennedy didn't give a direct answer that day. Now three months into the job, however, Kennedy's habit of casting doubts on vaccines has returned in interviews on television shows, public speeches and social media posts.",
      "Kennedy will make his first appearance as health secretary before Cassidy\u2019s powerful Senate health committee on Wednesday, when he's expected to face intense scrutiny about the thousands of job he's eliminated at the Department of Health and Human Services, the steep cuts he's made to vaccination campaigns and his response to a measles outbreak that\u2019s sickened 1,000 people.",
      "He will speak about the agency\u2019s budget request for the year, which includes a $500 million boost for his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative to promote nutrition and healthier lifestyles. The proposed budget also makes deep cuts, including to infectious disease prevention, maternal health and preschool programs.",
      "The secretary plans to \"share his vision on how HHS\u2019 transformation will improve health outcomes, eliminate redundancies to save the American taxpayer, and streamline operations to improve efficiency and service,\u201d HHS said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s supporters, meanwhile, have viewed his first three months in the job as a successful delivery of \u201cMAHA\u201d agenda items: He's pressured food companies to ditch artificial dyes, promised to study the cause of autism, vowed to reverse fluoride recommendations and earned buy-in from several Republican governors to ban soda from the food stamp program, for example.",
      "But many eyes and ears will be on Kennedy's dialogue with Cassidy, who extracted a number of guarantees from Kennedy about his approach to vaccines. Those included promises to keep the current childhood vaccination schedule, use the current vaccine monitoring system and not remove statements that say vaccines do not cause autism on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.",
      "\u201cI will watch carefully for any effort to wrongfully sow public fear about vaccines between confusing references of coincidences and anecdote,\u201d Cassidy said earlier this year, after voting in favor of Kennedy's nomination.",
      "Kennedy has since delivered a mixed message on vaccines that public health experts have said are hampering efforts to contain the measles outbreak. He's offered endorsements of vaccinations but continued to raise questions about their efficacy or safety. He's said the childhood vaccine schedule will be examined in a study of autism's causes. He\u2019s called the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine \u2014 a shot given to children to provide immunity from all three diseases \u2014 \u201cleaky,\u201d although it offers lifetime protection from the measles for most people. He's also said they cause deaths, although none has been documented among healthy people.",
      "At the agency, too, he's made moves that support the anti-vaccine movement. He hired a man who has published research that suggests vaccines cause developmental delays to oversee a study on autism. And he's terminated some research and public health funds dedicated to vaccines.",
      "Kennedy, who has rejected the anti-vaccine label, has regularly said that he is \u201cpro-safety\" and wants more research on vaccines, although decades of real-world use and research have concluded they safely prevent deadly diseases in children.",
      "\u201cHis longstanding advocacy has always focused on ensuring that vaccines, and other medical interventions, meet the highest standards of safety and are supported by gold-standard science,\u201d HHS said in a statement. \u201cAs he did during confirmation, Secretary Kennedy is prepared to address questions surrounding this topic.\u201d",

By early this year, there were more than 1.5 million, many of them Brazilians and Asians working in tourism and farming. Thousands more lack the proper documents to be in Portugal.",

      "Nicusor Dan, the former civic activist and pro-European Union centrist politician who defied odds to decisively defeat a hard-right nationalist in Romania\u2019s critical presidential race, has emerged as a counterforce to the right-wing populist wave sweep...",
      "BUCHAREST, Romania -- Nicusor Dan, the former civic activist and pro-European Union centrist politician who defied the odds to decisively defeat a hard-right nationalist in Romania\u2019s critical presidential race, has emerged as a counterforce to the right-wing populist wave sweeping across Europe.",
      "Final results from the presidential race showed Dan, the mayor of Bucharest, winning 53.6% of the vote over the hard-right candidate George Simion, who had been considered the favorite in the run-off, boosted in the first round by his nationalist messaging.",
      "Sunday\u2019s final vote was held months after the annulment of the previous election plunged Romania into its worst political crisis in decades, following the surprise first-round success of far-right outsider Calin Georgescu.",
      "In an emotional speech after he secured the presidency, Dan told thousands of supporters gathered outside his headquarters near Bucharest City Hall that \u201cRomania begins a new chapter, and it needs every one of you.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt needs experts to get involved in various public policies, it needs people in civil society, it needs new people in politics,\u201d the 55-year-old said. \u201cWe have a Romania to build together, regardless of political choices.\u201d",
      "Born in 1969 in Romania\u2019s central town of Fagaras, Dan discovered \u201ca passion\u201d for mathematics in middle school and excelled academically. In the late 1980s, he won gold medals at the International Mathematics Olympiad, and in 1998 he obtained a doctorate in mathematics from Paris\u2019 prestigious Sorbonne University.",
      "In the late 90s, he returned to Romania, saying he was convinced his country needed him. \u201cI started organizing meetings with Romanian students in Paris in which we discussed what we could do to ensure that Romania took the right path as a country,\u201d he states on his official website.",
      "He then worked as a mathematics researcher at the Romanian Academy, the country\u2019s supreme scientific body, and later founded a school in Bucharest to meet the needs of Romanian students at an international level.",
      "Dan first rose to public prominence as a civil activist with his Save Bucharest Association. That was tasked with saving built heritage and fighting against illegal real estate projects in green spaces, in a system he described as a \u201creal estate mafia.\u201d He won hundreds of lawsuits.",
      "He has two children with his partner, and is fluent in English and French.",
      "More than a decade ago, Dan joined a protest movement against a controversial gold mining project by a Canadian company in a mountainous western region of Romania that contains some of Europe\u2019s largest gold deposits. He also joined a wave of anti-corruption protests that gripped Romania through the mid-2010s.",
      "In 2016, he then founded the reformist Save Romania Union party \u2014 at the time largely viewed as an anti-corruption party \u2014 but later left. In 2020, he successfully secured the mayorship of Bucharest and was elected for a second term last year.",
      "He has tackled some key infrastructure projects, such as modernizing Bucharest's ailing residential heating systems, which previous mayors have been accused of neglecting.",
      "In the presidential election rerun, Dan ran independently on an \u201cHonest Romania\u201d ticket, reaffirming Western ties, support for Ukraine, and fiscal reform. He has also been vocal against endemic corruption and promised fiscal reforms.",
      "Romania\u2019s chaotic election cycle has exposed deep societal divisions, and Dan reached out in his speech Sunday evening to those who favored Simion.",
      "\u201cWe have a Romania to build together, regardless of political choices,\u201d he said.",
      "After Dan is sworn in as president, he will face the challenge of nominating a prime minister who can garner the support necessary to form a government, no small task in a country whose political landscape is now fragmented.",
      "As winner of Sunday\u2019s race, Dan will be charged with nominating a new prime minister after Marcel Ciolacu stepped down following the failure of his coalition\u2019s candidate to advance to the runoff. The presidential role carries a five-year term and significant decision-making powers in national security and foreign policy.",
      "Many observers saw Sunday\u2019s vote as crucial to maintaining Romania\u2019s place within Western alliances, especially as the war continues in neighboring Ukraine and the continent scrambles to arm itself as the United States\u2019 commitment to European partners has waned under US President Donald Trump.",
      "While Dan is a staunch advocate for Romania\u2019s strong membership of the EU and NATO, his civic and political background means he has limited foreign policy experience.",
      "Claudiu Tufis, an associate professor of political science at the University of Bucharest, says what makes Dan unique in Romania is that he\u2019s \u201cnot taken the traditional route to being a politician, he\u2019s coming from the civil society.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are certain advantages, but there are also certain disadvantages,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really have any foreign affairs experience. I am not sure that he actually paid a lot of interest to what was happening outside Romania.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat I know for sure is that \u2026 even though he may not be the best, he\u2019s probably the best of what we had in front of us.\u201d",

      "They were extremely close. Trzaskowski got 31.36% of the votes and Nawrocki \u2014 who was endorsed by U.S. President Donald Trump \u2014 won a better-than-expected 29.54%, according to final results released Monday morning.",
      "Poles now head to a nail-biting second round on June 1, with much resting on the outcome of the runoff.",
      "Sunday\u2019s election came on the same day that Romania\u2019s centrist mayor of Bucharest, Nicusor Dan, won the presidency in a country that, like Poland, is located along the eastern flank of NATO and the EU, where Russia has waged a three-year war in Ukraine. Dan managed to overcome a threat from a hard-right anti-Ukrainian nationalist, offering relief to those in Europe worried about a stance viewed as helpful to Moscow.",
      "\u201cThe campaign in the next two weeks will be very polarizing and brutal \u2014 a confrontation of two visions of Poland: pro-EU, liberal and progressive versus nationalist, Trumpist and conservative,\u201d said Piotr Buras, head of the Warsaw office of the European Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "The race is not only for the presidency, an office with the power to influence foreign policy and veto laws. It will also seal the fate of Tusk\u2019s efforts to repair the country's relationship with European allies after years of rule by conservatives from Law and Justice, which was often in conflict with Brussels.",
      "Tusk has been trying to reverse changes to the judicial branch that were considered undemocratic by the EU, but his efforts have been hampered by outgoing conservative President Andrzej Duda.",
      "Many centrist and progressive voters are disappointed that Tusk has not delivered on other promises, like liberalizing the restrictive abortion law. He has also been criticized for the heavy-handed way he took over control of public media from Law and Justice, and the continued politicization of taxpayer-funded public media.",
      "Trzaskowski and Nawrocki wasted no time at all as they head toward the finish line. They got out on the streets early Monday to meet with voters. Trzaskowski handed out sweet yeast buns on the streets of Kielce, and Nawrocki distributed donuts and posed for selfies with supporters in Gdansk.",
      "Trzaskowski, who ran and barely lost to Duda in 2020, was long considered this year's front-runner. After Sunday's vote he can't be sure.",
      "Nawrocki declared himself \u201cfull of energy and enthusiasm on the way to victory\" in a statement to the media, adding that \u201cprobably all of Poland saw that Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski is a candidate who can\u2019t cope.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Trzaskowski vowed to fight until the end. \u201cI will try to convince young people and all those who voted differently that it is worth voting for a normal Poland, not a radical Poland,\u201d Trzaskowski told reporters in Karzysko-Kamienna.",
      "The two men's political fates rest to a large extent with voters who chose other candidates in the first round, and how they will vote can be difficult to predict. Experts say there isn't an automatic transfer of votes from certain candidates to others; some who don\u2019t get their chosen candidate might not vote at all.",
      "Still, Trzaskowski has a lot to worry about.",
      "More than 20% of voters opted for candidates on the far right, whose conservative and nationalistic worldviews align much more closely with Nawrocki's.",
      "S\u0142awomir Mentzen of the hard-right Confederation party won 14.8%, while Grzegorz Braun, still further to the right, won over 6%. Both have embraced antisemitic and anti-Ukrainian stances. Braun used a fire extinguisher to put out candles on a menorah that were lit for the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah in the Polish parliament in 2023.",
      "Candidates from parties in Tusk's coalition government, which includes left-wing, centrist and center-right parties, together won about 40%.",
      "\u201cRight-wing and far-right candidates gathered as many as 54% of votes \u2014 this is the most surprising result of the first round of the presidential election,\u201d Buras said. \u201cThis brings Nawrocki into a favorable position ahead of the run-off on June 1. He will have a larger pool of votes to draw upon.\u201d",

      "The blast also damaged several shops and the outer wall of a nearby building housing paramilitary forces, he said. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing.",

    "story": [
      "Increasingly severe cyclones, grazing by invasive goats, and persistent turmoil in Yemen have threatened the survival of the country's iconic dragon\u2019s blood tree",
      "SOCOTRA, Yemen -- On a windswept plateau high above the Arabian Sea, Sena Keybani cradles a sapling that barely reaches her ankle. The young plant, protected by a makeshift fence of wood and wire, is a kind of dragon\u2019s blood tree \u2014 a species found only on the Yemeni island of Socotra that is now struggling to survive intensifying threats from climate change.",
      "\u201cSeeing the trees die, it\u2019s like losing one of your babies,\u201d said Keybani, whose family runs a nursery dedicated to preserving the species.",
      "Known for their mushroom-shaped canopies and the blood-red sap that courses through their wood, the trees once stood in great numbers. But increasingly severe cyclones, grazing by invasive goats, and persistent turmoil in Yemen \u2014 which is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries and beset by a decade-long civil war \u2014 have pushed the species, and the unique ecosystem it supports, toward collapse.",
      "Often compared to the Galapagos Islands, Socotra floats in splendid isolation some 240 kilometers (150 miles) off the Horn of Africa. Its biological riches \u2014 including 825 plant species, of which more than a third exist nowhere else on Earth \u2014 have earned it UNESCO World Heritage status. Among them are bottle trees, whose swollen trunks jut from rock like sculptures, and frankincense, their gnarled limbs twisting skywards.",
      "But it\u2019s the dragon\u2019s blood tree that has long captured imaginations, its otherworldly form seeming to belong more to the pages of Dr. Seuss than to any terrestrial forest. The island receives about 5,000 tourists annually, many drawn by the surreal sight of the dragon\u2019s blood forests.",
      "Visitors are required to hire local guides and stay in campsites run by Socotran families to ensure tourist dollars are distributed locally. If the trees were to disappear, the industry that sustains many islanders could vanish with them.",
      "\u201cWith the income we receive from tourism, we live better than those on the mainland,\u201d said Mubarak Kopi, Socotra\u2019s head of tourism.",
      "But the tree is more than a botanical curiosity: It\u2019s a pillar of Socotra\u2019s ecosystem. The umbrella-like canopies capture fog and rain, which they channel into the soil below, allowing neighboring plants to thrive in the arid climate.",
      "\u201cWhen you lose the trees, you lose everything \u2014 the soil, the water, the entire ecosystem,\u201d said Kay Van Damme, a Belgian conservation biologist who has worked on Socotra since 1999.",
      "Without intervention, scientists like Van Damme warn these trees could disappear within a few centuries \u2014 and with them many other species.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve succeeded, as humans, to destroy huge amounts of nature on most of the world\u2019s islands,\u201d he said. \u201cSocotra is a place where we can actually really do something. But if we don\u2019t, this one is on us.\u201d",
      "Across the rugged expanse of Socotra\u2019s Firmihin plateau, the largest remaining dragon\u2019s blood forest unfolds against the backdrop of jagged mountains. Thousands of wide canopies balance atop slender trunks. Socotra starlings dart among the dense crowns while Egyptian vultures bank against the relentless gusts. Below, goats weave through the rocky undergrowth.",
      "The frequency of severe cyclones has increased dramatically across the Arabian Sea in recent decades, according to a 2017 study in the journal Nature Climate Change, and Socotra\u2019s dragon\u2019s blood trees are paying the price.",
      "In 2015, a devastating one-two punch of cyclones \u2014 unprecedented in their intensity \u2014 tore across the island. Centuries-old specimens, some over 500 years old, which had weathered countless previous storms, were uprooted by the thousands. The destruction continued in 2018 with yet another cyclone.",
      "As greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, so too will the intensity of the storms, warned Hiroyuki Murakami, a climate scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cClimate models all over the world robustly project more favorable conditions for tropical cyclones.\u201d",
      "But storms aren\u2019t the only threat. Unlike pine or oak trees, which grow 60 to 90 centimeters (25 to 35 inches) per year, dragon\u2019s blood trees creep along at just 2 to 3 centimeters (about 1 inch) annually. By the time they reach maturity, many have already succumbed to an insidious danger: goats.",
      "An invasive species on Socotra, free-roaming goats devour saplings before they have a chance to grow. Outside of hard-to-reach cliffs, the only place young dragon\u2019s blood trees can survive is within protected nurseries.",
      "\u201cThe majority of forests that have been surveyed are what we call over-mature \u2014 there are no young trees, there are no seedlings,\u201d said Alan Forrest, a biodiversity scientist at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh\u2019s Centre for Middle Eastern Plants. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got old trees coming down and dying, and there\u2019s not a lot of regeneration going on.\u201d",
      "Keybani\u2019s family's nursery is one of several critical enclosures that keep out goats and allow saplings to grow undisturbed.",
      "\u201cWithin those nurseries and enclosures, the reproduction and age structure of the vegetation is much better,\u201d Forrest said. \u201cAnd therefore, it will be more resilient to climate change.\u201d",
      "But such conservation efforts are complicated by Yemen\u2019s stalemated civil war. As the Saudi Arabia-backed, internationally recognized government battles Houthi rebels \u2014 a Shiite group backed by Iran \u2014 the conflict has spilled beyond the country\u2019s borders. Houthi attacks on Israel and commercial shipping in the Red Sea have drawn retaliation from Israeli and Western forces, further destabilizing the region.",
      "\u201cThe Yemeni government has 99 problems right now,\u201d said Abdulrahman Al-Eryani, an advisor with Gulf State Analytics, a Washington-based risk consulting firm. \u201cPolicymakers are focused on stabilizing the country and ensuring essential services like electricity and water remain functional. Addressing climate issues would be a luxury.\u201d",
      "With little national support, conservation efforts are left largely up to Socotrans. But local resources are scarce, said Sami Mubarak, an ecotourism guide on the island.",
      "Mubarak gestures toward the Keybani family nursery's slanting fence posts, strung together with flimsy wire. The enclosures only last a few years before the wind and rain break them down. Funding for sturdier nurseries with cement fence posts would go a long way, he said.",
      "\u201cRight now, there are only a few small environmental projects \u2014 it\u2019s not enough,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need the local authority and national government of Yemen to make conservation a priority.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Around 10,000 protesters have gathered in Hungary's capital to oppose a bill by the country's right-wing government that critics say targets free speech and independent media",
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- A mass protest in Hungary on Sunday drew around 10,000 people in what some demonstrators called an act of resistance against recent actions by the right-wing populist government to restrict basic rights and crack down on independent media.",
      "The protest, the latest in a recent wave of anti-government demonstrations, came days after a lawmaker from the party of Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n submitted a bill that would allow the government to monitor, restrict, penalize and potentially ban media outlets and non-governmental organizations it deems a threat to the country's sovereignty.",
      "The bill, which has been compared to Russia's \u201cforeign agent\u201d law, is expected to pass in the parliament where the ruling Fidesz party holds a two-thirds majority. It is seen by many of Orb\u00e1n's opponents as among the most repressive policies the long-serving leader has leveled at his critics in the last 15 years of his rule.",
      "Protesters on Sunday filled the square beside Hungary's parliament in central Budapest to denounce the bill, which would allow the government to blacklist organizations that receive any amount of financial support from outside Hungary, and subject them to intrusive monitoring, searches, major fines and possible bans on their activities.",
      "Politicians in Orb\u00e1n's party, as well as the Sovereignty Protection Office, a controversial government body tasked with identifying alleged threats to Hungary's sovereignty, have specifically identified numerous media outlets and anti-corruption organizations that they claim are serving foreign interests.",
      "From a stage at the protest on Sunday, speaker Jakab T\u00f3th said the bill submitted this week \"is nothing more than a threat, a threat against people being able to express their opinions clearly and freely.\u201d",
      "T\u00f3th added he believes the government has a responsibility to protect the sovereignty of citizens to exercise free speech and take part in public life. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t belong to all of us, if not all of us are free, then sovereignty is solely and exclusively the sovereignty of the government,\u201d he said.",
      "Orb\u00e1n, who polls show faces the most serious challenge yet to his power in elections scheduled for next year, has claimed that foreign interests, primarily originating in the United States and in neighboring Ukraine, have sought to instrumentalize independent media outlets and anti-corruption watchdogs in Hungary to influence public opinion with the aim of toppling his government.",
      "Those organizations have vehemently denied such claims, and argued that the work they perform is done to professional standards and in the public interest.",
      "Orb\u00e1n has for years enacted crackdowns on NGOs and independent media, passing laws that critics say seek to stigmatize and obstruct groups that provide protection for women and minorities, offer legal and human rights assistance and expose official corruption.",
      "Those efforts ramped up in 2023 when Orb\u00e1n\u2019s right-wing populist government launched the Sovereignty Protection Office, an authority tasked with investigating organizations and media outlets it deems to be exerting foreign influence.",
      "The bill introduced last week outlines a broad definition of what constitutes a threat to sovereignty.

      "More than 2,600 contenders are vying for 881 positions in Mexico's first judicial election on June 1",
      "MEXICO CITY -- What do an activist searching for missing Mexicans, an attorney who once represented a drug lord and a university professor trying out TikTok have in common?",
      "They are all campaigning for positions in Mexico\u2019s first judicial election on June 1.",
      "More than 2,600 contenders are vying for 881 positions from Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court down to district courts across the country. In 2027, another election is planned to elect 800 more judicial positions.",
      "Those on the June 1 ballots won a lottery after being screened by committees made up of people from the three branches of government. In order to qualify, they had to have a law degree, at least five years of professional practice, write an essay and collect letters of recommendation from friends and colleagues.",
      "Foreign governments, including the United States, and civil society organizations in Mexico criticized the change, warning that it would lead to a politicization of the judiciary and weaken its independence.",
      "Electing judges was former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s way to root out corruption. Make them accountable to the people, he said. The contentious reform\u2019s passage was among the last major acts of his presidency last September.",
      "Here are some of the candidates:",
      "Age: 41",
      "What\u2019s she known for? She is among the hundreds of Mexicans searching for a missing relative, in her case a brother who disappeared in 2014.",
      "Candidate for: District judge in the western state of Sinaloa.",
      "Quiroa\u2019s experience has been different to most other candidates' in that she\u2019s more accustomed to being on the victims\u2019 side.",
      "After her brother disappeared in the northern border state of Tamaulipas, Quiroa began searching and eventually founded a collective called \u201cMarch 10\u201d for the day he vanished.",
      "She quickly realized there was little legal help available to help searchers like herself, so she left her engineering career and began to study law while continuing her search.",
      "Quiroa gained notoriety a couple years ago when she proposed criminal groups consider a peace treaty to make it safer to search for the missing and she began selling a \u201cSearcher Barbie\u201d to raise money for her group\u2019s activities.",
      "Late last year, she decided to return to her native Sinaloa state to compete to be a judge.",
      "Quiroa knows the risks of being a judge in the violent state, home to a powerful cartel of the same name, but she said that there need to be more judges who empathize with those searching for missing loved ones.",
      "\u201cIf I become a judge, I\u2019m not going to send legal documents and wait for authorities to answer when they feel like it,\u201d Quiroa said. \u201cI\u2019m going to go out and look for the missing people.\u201d",
      "Age: 40",
      "What\u2019s he known for? He went viral as \u201cJustice Pork Rinds.\u201d",
      "Candidate for: Supreme Court.",
      "Until the campaign started, Guerrero wasn\u2019t well-known outside of Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University, where he has taught classes for more than a decade. He had also led Mexico City\u2019s public records agency and worked at the capital\u2019s electoral court.",
      "But it was a homemade TikTok video that took off and launched Guerrero\u2019s campaign. In it, a student hands him a platter of a typical pork rind dish. Playing on the turn of phrase, he says he\u2019s \u201cmore prepared than a pork rind\u201d to be a Supreme Court justice, before rolling into his qualifications.",
      "Some grumps accused him of turning the race into a circus, but Guerrero said that his attempt at humor was far less harmful than having a corrupt justice on the highest court.",
      "\u201cYou have to be colloquial sometimes in your use of language,\u201d he said, accepting that he has tried to run a \u201cdisruptive\u201d campaign.",
      "If elected, Guerrero said that he would push to have the court hold hearings around Mexico to have more contact with people.",
      "Age: 51",
      "What\u2019s she known for? She represented drug kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n in 2016.",

      "Nine years ago, Silvia Delgado Garc\u00eda was a member of Sinaloa cartel leader Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s legal team when he was temporarily held in a prison in Ciudad Juarez before being extradited to the United States. He was eventually tried, convicted and sentenced to life in prison in the U.S.",
      "She\u2019s still marked by the case.",
      "Some critics of electing judges, and a human rights litigation group called Defensorxs, have labeled Delgado Garc\u00eda \u201chigh risk,\u201d because \u201cshe defends alleged drug traffickers.\u201d",
      "The group has also identified 17 other candidates that way for being prosecuted, being members of investigated organizations, for alleged human rights violations and deals with criminal groups.",
      "\u201cEveryone has a right to an effective defense,\u201d Delgado Garc\u00eda said about her decision to represent Guzm\u00e1n.",
      "She notes that she only helped at one hearing where the power went out, and her job was to visit him in the Ciudad Juarez prison where he was being held.",
      "\u201cIf they give me a client of that magnitude, in terms of resume that\u2019s going to help me,\u201d she said.",
      "As a candidate, she highlights that she has been a litigator for 18 years and has a passion for criminal law.",

There, he sets up a small stand from which he hangs three papers on which he has handwritten his name, the position he seeks, his social platform handle and his ID number for the ballot.",
      "Even though he frequently goes unnoticed by the multitude of street vendors, tourists and workers crossing the square each day, Tapia Maltos dressed in white shirt, tie and dark slacks, occasionally draws the attention of those curious enough to stop and read his papers. Some then ask how they can vote.",
      "The simplicity of his campaign is its most noteworthy characteristic.",
      "\u201cI'm not trying to make a big production with videos, no dancing or anything like that ... Because what I'm trying to do is get to know people in an appropriate way.\u201d",
      "He has worked for years behind the scenes inside the Supreme Court in preparing decisions. Now, thanks to the new judicial election, he says that he has found a way to achieve his dream of being a judge and bring new blood to a judiciary long criticized as corrupt.",

      "Votes are being cast across Buenos Aires in local elections that will test Argentina's President Javier Milei\u2019s political strength as he seeks to steer mainstream conservatives toward his radical libertarian platform",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Votes were being cast across Buenos Aires on Sunday in local elections that will test Argentina's President Javier Milei's political strength as he seeks to steer mainstream conservatives toward his radical libertarian platform.",
      "The election results could boost Milei\u2019s La Libertad Avanza party, or LLA, in crucial national midterms later this year. Some 2.5 million people are eligible to vote in Sunday\u2019s election, in which half of the 60 legislative seats are up for grabs.",
      "A former TV pundit known for his angry rants against Argentina's political class, Milei founded LLA just four years ago, drawing a motley crew of political novices into his anti-establishment agenda.",
      "Seeking to take a \u201cchainsaw\u201d to state spending with just a tiny minority in Congress over his past 1 1/2-year in office \u2014 his party holds just 15% of seats in the lower house and 10% in the Senate \u2014 Milei has been compelled to compromise with former President Mauricio Macri, the scion of a wealthy family and the face of Argentina's conservative political establishment.",
      "That uneasy alliance has faltered in recent months. The two have clashed over Milei's effort to install a judge embroiled in corruption scandals on the Supreme Court, among other things.",
      "In Macri\u2019s stronghold of Buenos Aires, where his PRO (Republican Proposal) party has governed uninterrupted since 2007, Milei appears set on crushing his erstwhile partner altogether, analysts say.",
      "\u201cThe government needs to claim dominance and the leadership over the whole spectrum of the center-right,\u201d said Juan Cruz D\u00edaz, managing director of Buenos Aires-based political consultancy Cefeidas Group.",
      "At his closing campaign rally last week, Milei attacked Macri's party in an expletive-sprinkled rant. \u201cI\u2019m not going to waste time describing all the inconsistencies of the failed (PRO) party because they\u2019re fighting for fourth place,\u201d he told supporters.",
      "Wiping out PRO in Buenos Aires would signal a major shift in Argentine politics \u2014 one already playing out in the United States, Europe and around the world as increasingly right-wing factions push their way into the mainstream and drown out more moderate voices.",
      "It would also cement Milei's party as the main alternative to the country's left-wing populist Peronist faction, which has governed economically troubled Argentina for much of the past two decades.",
      "\u201cIf Milei wins in the capital, it will have a very strong symbolic impact,\u201d said Orlando D\u2019Adamo, director of the Center for Public Opinion at Buenos Aires\u2019 University of Belgrano. \u201cIf PRO wins, it would maintain Macri\u2019s power as a valuable partner, boost his brand and put him on equal footing with La Libertad Avanza.\u201d",
      "Milei has chosen a prominent figure \u2014 his spokesperson Manuel Adorni \u2014 to head his list of candidates. He put his sister and closest advisor, Karina Milei, on the job as a campaign strategist. Huge banners declaring \u201cAdorni is Milei\u201d blanket the city.",
      "\u201cIt has turned into a crucial battle for the political leadership,\u201d said Ignacio Labaqui, a senior analyst at research group Medley Global Advisors.",
      "Macri, for his part, has campaigned hard for his top candidate, Silvia Lospennato. In recent appearances, he has criticized Milei for what he sees as a bellicose approach and disregard for traditional Argentine institutions.",
      "\u201cPutting the economy in order is not enough. We must strengthen institutions, be predictable and regain respect for one another,\u201d Macri told supporters.",
      "Just two years ago, Macri was key to Milei's landslide electoral victory. His center-right supplied Milei's new government with key ministers, brought him a conservative base and helped him secure the support of critical political brokers to help pass his radical agenda through an otherwise hostile Congress.",

      "More than 12,000 chicks at a Delaware distribution center were found left in a USPS truck for more than three days",
      "CAMDEN, Delaware -- A Delaware animal shelter is trying to care for and rehome thousands of chicks that survived being left in a postal service truck for three days. Trapped in a warm enclosure, without food and water, thousands died before they were discovered.",
      "Involved parties are still awaiting answers as to how 12,000 chicks were abandoned within the truck at a Delaware mail distribution center. The United States Postal Service said in an email that it was aware of a process breakdown and was actively investigating what occurred.",
      "Pennsylvania-based Freedom Ranger Hatchery raised the chicks for their weekly distribution to clients across the country, said a spokesperson for the company. Due to biosecurity concerns, the hatchery cannot take the chicks back.",
      "The spokesperson said it would have been best if USPS, after discovering the chicks, had completed delivery as the recipients would have been adequately equipped to handle the birds \u2014 even malnourished ones.",
      "For more than two weeks, the surviving chicks have been nursed and cared for at First State Animal Center and SPCA, said John Parana, executive director.",
      "Last Tuesday, the shelter began offering the birds for adoption, but only a few hundred out of thousands have been picked up. There is no complete count of the chicks, as the shelter has no feasible way to do so, but Parana estimates there to be more than two thousand available.",
      "Some have inquired about buying the birds for meat, but, as a no-kill shelter and SPCA, those were refused.",
      "The strain has turned the animal care center into a 24/7 operation and necessitated a staffing increase, Parana said. Money remains the biggest concern for the donation-reliant nonprofit. Some employees have begun spending their money to support the operations, he added.",
      "Among the birds were young turkeys, geese and quail, but the vast majority were Freedom Ranger chicks. One concern for the shelter, Parana explained, was the increasing demand for space and feed over time, as Freedom Rangers take about ten weeks to reach maturity.",
      "The Delaware Department of Agriculture, after a call from USPS, directed the animals to the shelter, which shares a memorandum of understanding with the animal center as a state vendor. The department said it is responsible for assisting the shelter with funds \u2014 for chickens, the rate was $5 each per day.",
      "The department's chief of planning, Jimmy Kroon, said negotiations were ongoing, but Parana claims that the department communicated that they had no funds to allocate for the chicks. Both acknowledged the original rate would be unreasonable in the current circumstances.",
      "\u201cThey said that they\u2019re gonna try to go after the post office to get recoupment,\u201d Parana said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t help us in the meantime.\u201d",

      "DALLAS -- Whether it's a road trip to a nearby lake or jumping on a plane to explore a big city, Americans are expected to get away in record numbers over the long Memorial Day weekend even as economic and technical worries rattle the U.S. travel industry.",
      "Over 45 million people \u2014 1.4 million more than last year \u2014 will venture at least 50 miles from their homes between Thursday and next Monday, with the vast majority going by car, auto club organization AAA predicts. The holiday's previous domestic travel record was set 20 years ago.",
      "AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said the analysts who prepared the forecast weren't sure when they started their research if concerns about the economy would cause fewer U.S. residents to plan getaways for the unofficial start of summer, but it doesn't seem to be the case.",
      "\u201cPeople are still feeling pretty good about travel,\u201d Diaz said, adding that some households and individuals may just opt to spend less money on their trips.",
      "Like last year, about 87% of travelers are driving to their Memorial Day destinations, AAA said. About 39 million people, or 1 million more than last year, are expected to take road trips, which Diaz noted many families find easier and cheaper than flying.",
      "\u201cYou leave whenever you want,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can pack as much as you want in the car, make stops along the way.\u201d",
      "AAA's fuel tracker shows motorists can expect to pay less for gasoline this year; the U.S. average price on Sunday was $3.18 for a gallon of regular gas compared to $3.60 a year ago. Renting a vehicle and staying in a hotel also may cost less, according to the most recent Consumer Price Index.",
      "Transportation-data firm INRIX anticipates the worst holiday traffic will be in the afternoons and evenings. It said drivers hitting the road on Thursday should leave before 12 p.m., and those planning Friday departures should leave before 11 a.m.",
      "On Memorial Day itself, the firm predicts the most congested time on roads will be 4 p.m.-7 p.m.",
      "In 2024, the Friday before Memorial Day was among the record-setting days for the number of airline passengers screened at U.S. airports. While airports should be busy again this Friday, the outlook for air travel this year is unclear.",
      "Air safety has been on the minds of travelers after the deadly midair collision in January of a passenger jet and a U.S. Army helicopter above Washington, D.C. In recent weeks, flight delays and cancellations stemming from an air traffic controller shortage and equipment failures at a facility that directs in and out of the Newark, New Jersey, airport have also made some people wonder whether to get on a plane.",
      "Most major U.S. airlines said they planned to reduce their scheduled domestic flights this summer, citing an ebb in economy passengers booking leisure trips. Bank of America reported this month that its credit card customers were spending less on flights and lodging.",
      "But an analysis by aviation data provider Cirium of Memorial Day weekend tickets bought through online travel sites found an increase of about 3% across two dozen U.S. airports compared to last year. Bookings were down 10% for flights at Washington Dulles International Airport and down 9% for flights at Newark Liberty International Airport, according to Cirium's data.",
      "AAA said the weekend isn\u2019t expected to set a passenger volume record, but the organization estimates that 3.6 million residents are set to fly over the holiday, nearly 2% more than last year. Airfares cost an average of 7.9% less last month than they did a year earlier, according to government price data.",
      "The U.S. travel and tourism industry will watching during the weekend and the weeks ahead to see what might be in store for the summer travel season. Tourism industry experts have warned that anger about the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs and rhetoric, and concern about tourist detentions at the U.S. border, have made citizens of some other countries less interested in traveling to the U.S.",
      "The national statistics agency of Canada reported last week that the number of residents making return trips by air from the U.S. fell 20% in April compared to the same month a year earlier, while return trips by car were down 35%.",
      "Across Texas, reservations for day passes and camping spots were filling up at state parks for the weekend, said Tara Humphreys, director of interpretation with Texas State Parks. Stargazing parties were among events planned at parks across the state.",
      "Bolstered by its theme parks and nearby cruise ports, Orlando, Florida, tops AAA's list of most popular domestic destinations for the weekend. The grand opening of the city's newest theme park, Universal's Epic Universe, is scheduled for Thursday.",

      "Long weekends are a good time to hop on a short flight to a big city, said Hayley Berg, lead economist at the travel site Hopper. She said top searches for the weekend on the site included New York, Miami and Las Vegas.",
      "\u201cTypically, we see over three-day weekends travelers look for destinations that are a quick flight away, so maybe like a couple hour flight at most,\u201d she said.",
      "Seattle is another top destination, according to AAA booking data, with Memorial Day weekend kicking off the peak Alaska cruise season. Michael Woody, Visit Seattle's senior vice president and chief strategy officer, said that visitors can take in what the city has to offer and also fit in some time in nature.",
      "AAA is also projecting about 2 million people will travel by train, bus or cruise ship over the weekend, an 8.5% increase over last year.",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff offensive has led European officials have cut back their growth forecasts for this year and next, even in a best-case scenario in which the highest rates on most goods could be negotiated away",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff offensive has led European officials to cut back their growth forecasts for this year and next \u2014 even in a best-case scenario in which the highest rates on most goods could be negotiated away.",
      "The forecast for this year for the 20 countries that use the euro currency was cut to 0.9% from the previous forecast in November of 1.3%, the European Union's executive commission said Monday in its regular spring forecast.",
      "The forecast for 2026 was cut to 1.4% from 1.6%.",
      "One reason for the lower growth estimate was the stagnating economy in Germany, where growth is expected to be zero this year after two years of shrinking output. Germany's economy is heavily dependent on exports but has faced strong headwinds from higher energy costs after the loss of Russian natural gas due to the invasion of Ukraine as well from lack of pro-growth infrastructure spending and competition from China in autos and industrial machinery.",
      "The proposal for a 20% U.S. tariff on imported goods from Europe in addition to its suspension for 90 days have meant uncertainty \u201cnot seen since the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said Economy Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis. He said the European economy remained \u201cresilient\u201d and that the jobs market remained robust, with the commission predicting a fall in unemployment to a record low 5.7% next year.",
      "And the risks are \u201ctilted to the downside,\u201d he said. One reason: The forecast assumes that the proposed 20% rate can be reduced through negotiations with Washington to the base tariff rate imposed on all countries of 10%.",
      "While the EU's top trade official, Maros Sefcovic, has spoken several times with administration officials it remains uncertain how willing Trump might be to reduce the rate.",
      "The forecast assumed that 25% tariffs on steel and autos from all countries will remain in place, as would exemptions on computer chips and pharmaceuticals.",

      "LISBON, Portugal -- Portugal\u2019s president convened the country\u2019s political parties for consultations Monday, after a general election delivered another minority government as well as an unprecedented showing by populist party Chega (Enough) that added momentum to Europe\u2019s shift to the far-right.",
      "The center-right Democratic Alliance, led by the Social Democratic Party, captured 89 seats in the 230-seat National Assembly to win Sunday\u2019s ballot. The outcome leaves it without a parliamentary majority, however, and vulnerable to opposition parties that ousted it two months ago in a confidence vote after less than a year in power.",
      "Portugal\u2019s third general election in three years provided little hope for ending the worst spell of political instability for decades in the European Union country of 10.6 million people.",
      "\u201cThe Portuguese don\u2019t want any more early elections,\u201d Luis Montenegro, the Democratic Alliance leader and incoming prime minister, said late Sunday in an appeal for opposition parties to let him serve a full four-year term.",
      "\u201cWe all have to be able to speak to each other and put the national interest first,\u201d he said.",
      "Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who has no executive power, was consulting with parties before inviting the election winner to form a government, in line with the constitution.",
      "Chega\u2019s result shook up the traditional balance of power in a trend already witnessed elsewhere in Europe with parties such as France\u2019s National Rally, the Brothers of Italy, and Alternative for Germany, which are now in the political mainstream.",
      "Chega leader Andre Ventura has appeared at events with the leaders of those parties in recent years.",
      "For the past 50 years, the Social Democrats and the center-left Socialist Party have alternated in power in Portugal.",
      "Chega collected the same number of seats as the Socialists \u2014 58 \u2014 and could yet claim second place when four remaining seats decided by voters abroad are attributed in coming days.",
      "\u201cThe two-party system is over,\u201d Ventura, a lawyer and former soccer pundit, said.",
      "Chega competed in its first election just six years ago, when it won one seat, and has fed off disaffection with the more moderate traditional parties.",
      "Campaigning under the slogan \u201cSave Portugal,\u201d it describes itself as a nationalist party and has focused on curbing immigration and cracking down on corruption.",
      "On the streets of Lisbon, 42-year-old bank employee Marta Costa said she felt \u201cdisappointment and sadness\u201d at Chega\u2019s showing.",
      "\u201cWe are losing the world and not building something decent for our children,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we are not placing enough value on freedom.\u201d",
      "Emilia Gordo, 55, said voters expressed a desire for change. \u201cThey (Chega) are trying everything to bring about a change, the country feels a need for change.\u201d",
      "The Socialists, meanwhile, are without a leader after Pedro Nuno Santos said he was standing down after the party\u2019s worst result since 1987.",
      "The Democratic Alliance, which also includes the smaller Popular Party, lost a confidence vote in parliament in March as opposition lawmakers teamed up against it. That triggered an early election, which had been due in 2028.",
      "The confidence vote was sparked by a political storm around potential conflicts of interest in the business dealings of Prime Minister Lu\u00eds Montenegro\u2019s family law firm. Montenegro has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Corruption scandals have dogged Portuguese politics in recent years, helping fuel the rise of Chega. But the party has recently fallen foul of its own lawmakers\u2019 alleged wrongdoing. One is suspected of stealing suitcases from the Lisbon airport and selling the contents online, and another allegedly faked the signature of a dead woman. Both resigned.",
      "Chega owes much of its success to its demands for a tighter immigration policy that have resonated with voters.",
      "Portugal has witnessed a steep rise in immigration. In 2018, there were fewer than a half-million legal immigrants in the country, according to government statistics. By early this year, there were more than 1.5 million, many of them Brazilians and Asians working in tourism and farming.",
      "Thousands more lack the proper documents to be in Portugal. The Democratic Alliance government announced two weeks before the election that it was expelling about 18,000 foreigners living in the country without authorization. Though such a step is routine, the timing drew accusations that it was trying to capture votes from Chega.",
      "A housing crisis has also fired up debate. House prices and rents have been soaring for the past 10 years, due in part to an influx of white-collar foreigners who have driven up prices.",
      "House prices jumped another 9% last year, said the National Statistics Institute, a government body. Rents in and around the capital Lisbon, where around 1.5 million people live, last year saw the steepest rise in 30 years, climbing more than 7%, the institute said.",
      "The problem is compounded by Portugal being one of Western Europe\u2019s poorest countries.",
      "The average monthly salary last year was around 1,200 euros ($1,340) before tax, according to the statistics agency. The government-set minimum wage this year is 870 euros ($974) a month before tax.",

    "story": [
      "Key economic indicators show China's economy slowing somewhat in April, with retail sales, property and investment coming in weaker than economists had forecast",
      "China\u2019s economy showed signs of slowing in April as President Donald Trump's trade war took a toll, with retail sales, property and investment coming in weaker than economists had forecast.",
      "Industrial production slowed as Trump's painfully high tariffs of up to 145%, and 125% retaliatory duties imposed by Beijing, took effect and shipments were curtailed.",
      "National Statistics Bureau spokesperson Fu Linghui said the general trend was positive though he pointed to \u201cexternal shocks\u201d that had gained intensity.",
      "\u201cIt should also be noted that there are still many outside unstable and uncertain factors, and the foundation for the continued recovery and improvement of the national economy needs to be further consolidated,\u201d Fu said.",
      "Here are a few key indicators reported Monday.",
      "Chinese consumers have been holding back after the shocks of a prolonged downturn in the housing market that is the source of much household wealth. Retail sales rose 5.1% from a year earlier in April, below economists' expectations for a 6% increase.",
      "Fu said Beijing would continue to focus on supporting job creation and spurring more domestic demand.",
      "He also said China must stop prices from falling. The consumer price index fell 0.1% in April. Such deflation is both a symptom of weak demand and also a factor behind shoppers' reluctance to spend, in hopes of getting better deals later.",
      "\u201cThe current overall price level is low, which puts pressure on production and companies' operations and affects jobs and incomes, so it's important to promote a reasonable recovery of prices,\u201d Fu said.",
      "On the U.S. side, consumer sentiment has fallen slightly in May for the fifth straight month, with Americans increasingly worried that the trade war will worsen inflation.",
      "Industrial production rose 6.1% from a year earlier, slowing from 7.7% in March as tariffs and other trade barriers bit into exports.",
      "The truce in Trump's trade war with China has helped, Fu said, calling it \u201cconducive to the growth of bilateral trade and the recovery of the world.\u201d",
      "With tariffs paused for 90 days to allow time for talks, shipments have revived as businesses rush to meet back-to-school and other seasonal deadlines.",
      "But even before Trump took office for the second time in January, China was under pressure from its trading partners for relying too heavily on exports to absorb its excess industrial production.",
      "And if output continues to outpace demand from businesses and consumers, prices will keep falling.",
      "\u201cExport-driven gains in factory output could continue given China\u2019s manufacturing competitiveness and frontloaded orders before the end of the 90-day truce, but this is coming at a persistent deflationary cost,\u201d Louise Loo of Oxford Economics said in a report.",
      "The government reported that fixed asset investment in such things as factories and equipment rose 4% in April in the first four months of the year.",
      "However, property investments fell 10.3% year-on-year in January to April. New home prices also edged lower.",
      "While manufacturing held up better than expected, the pressures from trade are complicating Beijing's effort to keep turn the housing market around and keep the economic recovery on track.",
      "\u201cEstablishing a trough on a national level is taking some time, as the recovery of the property market remains uneven and gradual. It\u2019s possible that tariff-related pessimism and uncertainty kept more buyers on the sidelines in April,\u201d Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING Economics said in a report.",

      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the deals will slash red tape, grow the British economy and reset relations with the 27-nation trade bloc since the U.K. left the EU in 2020.",
      "Starmer hosted European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other senior EU officials in London for the first formal U.K.-EU summit since Brexit.",
      "Under the deals, a new U.K.-EU defense and security partnership will allow the U.K. to access a EU defense loan program worth 150 billion euros ($170 billion.)",
      "Other agreements include removing some checks on animal and plant products to ease food trade across borders, and a 12-year extension of an agreement allowing EU fishing vessels in U.K. waters.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time to look forward. To move on from the stale old debates and political fights to find common sense, practical solutions which get the best for the British people,\u201d Starmer said.",
      "While the EU is the U.K.\u2019s largest trading partner, the U.K. has been hit with a 21% drop in exports since Brexit because of more onerous border checks, laborious paperwork and other barriers.",
      "Since becoming prime minister in July, Starmer has sought to reset relations with the EU, following years of tensions in the wake of the U.K.'s 2016 Brexit referendum.",
      "Post-Brexit relations have been governed by a trade agreement negotiated by then Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Starmer thinks that can be improved in a way that boosts trade and bolsters security.",
      "\u201cThis is about making people better off, about making the country more secure, about making sure there are more jobs in the U.K.,\u201d Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told Times Radio.",
      "Stronger ties with the EU will bring \u201cmore benefits for the United Kingdom\u201d following trade agreements that the U.K. struck in recent weeks with India and the United States, Starmer said.",
      "Though no tariffs are slapped on the export of goods between both sides, an array of non-tariff barriers have made trade more difficult.",
      "Post-Brexit visa restrictions have also hobbled the cross-border activities of professionals such as bankers or lawyers, as well as cultural exchanges, including touring bands and school trips.",
      "Since the Labour Party took power last year after 14 years of Conservative government, a period that was largely marked by upheavals surrounding the Brexit vote and its aftermath, both sides have sought to improve relations.",
      "That\u2019s been most evident in the more coordinated response to Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in the wake of a change of approach by Washington following the return of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "But Starmer has stressed that the U.K. won't rejoin the EU's frictionless single market and customs union, nor agree to the free movement of people between the U.K. and the EU.",
      "Talks on strengthening ties have focused largely on security and defense, and on a youth mobility plan that would allow young Britons and Europeans to live and work temporarily in each other\u2019s territory.",
      "That remains a politically touchy issue in the U.K., seen by some Brexiteers as inching back toward free movement \u2014 though the U.K. already has youth mobility arrangements with countries including Australia and Canada.",
      "Another issue that has long been a sticking point in U.K.-EU relations is fishing \u2014 an economically minor but symbolically important issue for the U.K. and EU member states such as France. Disputes over the issue nearly derailed a Brexit deal back in 2020.",
      "The summit is also expected to cover aligning standards on the sale of agricultural products, which could eliminate costly checks on food products exported across the English Channel.",
      "Thomas-Symonds said he was confident that trade could be improved for food imports and exports.",
      "\u201cWe know we\u2019ve had lorries waiting for 16 hours, fresh food in the back not able to be exported, because frankly it\u2019s just going off, red tape, all the certifications that are required, we absolutely want to reduce that,\u201d he told the BBC.",
      "Some of the trade-offs may prove difficult for Starmer, who faces growing challenges from the pro-Brexit and anti-immigration Reform U.K. party and will likely see accusations of \u201cbetraying Brexit,\u201d whatever the outcome of the talks.",
      "Reform, which recently won big in local elections, and the opposition Conservative Party have already called the deal a \u201csurrender\u201d to the EU before any details were confirmed.",
      "Trump, who has backed Brexit, could also be a potential headache for Starmer.",
      "\u201cThe reset could still be blown off course by disagreements over how to consolidate existing areas of cooperation like fisheries and/or external factors, such as a negative reaction from the U.S. to the U.K. seeking closer ties with the EU,\u201d said Jannike Wachowiak, research associate at the UK in a Changing Europe think tank.",

      "New Jersey Transit\u2019s train engineers have reached a tentative deal to end their three-day strike that had halted service for some 100,000 daily riders, including routes to Newark airport and across the Hudson River to New York City",
      "NEWARK, N.J. -- New Jersey Transit\u2019s train engineers reached a tentative deal Sunday to end their three-day strike that had halted service for some 100,000 daily riders, including routes to Newark airport and across the Hudson River to New York City. The union said its members would return to work on Tuesday, when trains would resume their regular schedules.",
      "The walkout that began Friday was the state\u2019s first transit strike in over 40 years, forcing people who normally rely on New Jersey Transit to take buses, cars, taxis and boats instead or consider staying home. The main sticking point had been how to accomplish a wage increase for the engineers without creating a financially disastrous domino effect for the transit agency.",
      "The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen initially announced regular train service would begin again Monday, but moments later, union spokesperson Jamie Horwitz said NJ Transit informed them that it would be Tuesday at 12:01 a.m. instead.",
      "A transit agency statement said the Tuesday start was necessary because \u201cit takes approximately 24 hours to inspect and prepare the infrastructure before returning to full scheduled service.\u201d",
      "A union statement sent by email said the terms of the agreement would be sent to the union's 450 members who work as locomotive engineers or trainees at the passenger railroad.",
      "\u201cWhile I won\u2019t get into the exact details of the deal reached, I will say that the only real issue was wages and we were able to reach an agreement that boosts hourly pay beyond the proposal rejected by our members last month and beyond where we were when NJ Transit\u2019s managers walked away from the table Thursday evening,\u201d said Tom Haas, the union's general chairman at NJ Transit.",
      "He added that the union was able to show management \"ways to boost engineers' wages ... without causing any significant budget issue or requiring a fare increase.\u201d",
      "The union statement also said the deal would be submitted for a ratification vote by the national union and would require a vote of the New Jersey Transit board at its next regularly scheduled meeting on June 11. NJ Transit's board also has to approve the deal.",
      "\u201cTo offer the understatement of the year, this is a very good outcome,\u201d New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said at a Sunday evening news conference. He commended the two sides for finding an agreement that is \u201cboth fair to NJ Transit\u2019s employees while also being affordable for our state\u2019s commuters and taxpayers.\u201d",
      "NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri didn\u2019t provide details of the deal, but said it was \u201cfair and fiscally responsible.\" He thanked the union for negotiating in good faith.",
      "\u201cThe deal itself reflects a series of concessions that came together by way of a work bill that will eventually end up paying for this fair wage that the union has asked for,\u201d Kolluri said at the news conference.",
      "Buses would be provided on Monday, but Murphy and Kolluri both urged commuters, if possible, to work from home for one more day.",
      "\u201cPlease do that tomorrow so we can move essential employees through the system,\u201d Kolluri said.",
      "A month earlier, members of the union had overwhelmingly rejected a labor agreement with management.",
      "NJ Transit \u2014 the nation\u2019s third-largest transit system \u2014 operates buses and rail in the state, providing nearly 1 million weekday trips, including into New York City. The walkout halted all NJ Transit commuter trains, which provide heavily used public transit routes between New York City\u2019s Penn Station on one side of the Hudson River and communities in northern New Jersey on the other, as well as the Newark airport, which has grappled with unrelated delays of its own recently.",
      "Mark Wallace, the union's national president, had said NJ Transit needs to pay engineers a wage that\u2019s comparable to Amtrak and Long Island Railroad because some are leaving for jobs on those other railroads for better pay.",
      "The union had said its members have been earning an average salary of $113,000 a year and it wanted to see an agreement for an average salary of $170,000.",
      "NJ Transit leadership, though, disputed the union\u2019s data, saying the engineers have average total earnings of $135,000 annually, with the highest earners exceeding $200,000.",

Kacsmaryk of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas on Thursday determined that the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission exceeded its statutory authority when the agency issued guidance to employers against deliberately using the wrong pronouns for an employee, refusing them access to bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, and barring employees from wearing dress code-compliant clothing according to their gender identity because they may constitute forms of workplace harassment.",
      "Kacsmaryk said the guidance is \u201cinconsistent with the text, history, and tradition of Title VII and recent Supreme Court precedent.\u201d",
      "Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act protects employees and job applicants from employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin.",
      "The EEOC, which enforces workplace anti-discrimination laws, had updated its guidance on workplace harassment in April of last year under President Joe Biden for the first time in 25 years. It followed a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that gay, lesbian and transgender people are protected from employment discrimination.",
      "Texas and the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank behind Project 2025, in August challenged the guidance, which the agency says serves as a tool for employers to assess compliance with anti-discrimination laws and is not legally binding. Kacsmaryk disagreed, writing that the guidance creates \u201cmandatory standards ... from which legal consequences will necessarily flow if an employer fails to comply.\u201d",
      "The decision marks the latest blow to workplace protections for transgender workers following President Donald Trump's Jan. 20 executive order declaring that the government would recognize only two \u201cimmutable\u201d sexes \u2014 male and female.",
      "Kacsmaryk, a 2017 Trump nominee, invalidated all portions of the EEOC guidance that defines \u201csex\u201d to include \u201csexual orientation\u201d and \u201cgender identity,\u201d along with an entire section addressing the subject.",
      "\u201cTitle VII does not require employers or courts to blind themselves to the biological differences between men and women,\u201d he wrote in the opinion.",
      "Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts commended the decision in an emailed statement: \u201cThe Biden EEOC tried to compel businesses \u2014 and the American people \u2014 to deny basic biological truth. Today, thanks to the great state of Texas and the work of my Heritage colleagues, a federal judge said: not so fast.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThis ruling is more than a legal victory. It\u2019s a cultural one. It says no \u2014 you don\u2019t have to surrender common sense at the altar of leftist ideology. You don\u2019t have to pretend men are women. And you don\u2019t have to lie to keep your job. \u201d",
      "The National Women\u2019s Law Center, which filed an amicus brief in November in support of the harassment guidance, blasted the decision in an emailed statement.",
      "\u201cThe district court\u2019s decision is an outrage and blatantly at odds with Supreme Court precedent,\u201d said Liz Theran, senior director of litigation for education and workplace justice at NWLC. \u201cThe EEOC\u2019s Harassment Guidance reminds employers and workers alike to do one simple thing that should cost no one anything: refrain from degrading others on the job based on their identity and who they love. This decision does not change the law, but it will make it harder for LGBTQIA+ workers to enforce their rights and experience a workplace free from harassment.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice and the EEOC declined to comment on the outcome of the case.",
      "The EEOC in fiscal year 2024 received more than 3,000 charges alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and 3,000-plus in 2023, according to the agency\u2019s website.",

      "There's more muddle now to an issue that has split the photographic community",
      "An organization that honored The Associated Press' Nick Ut with its \u201c photo of the year \u201d in 1973 for a picture of a girl running from a napalm attack in the Vietnam War says it has \u201csuspended its attribution\u201d to Ut because of doubts over who actually took it.",
      "World Press Photo's report Friday adds to the muddle over an issue that has split the photographic community since a movie earlier this year, \u201cThe Stringer,\u201d questioned Ut's authorship. The photo of a naked and terrified Kim Phuc became an iconic symbol of the war's tragedy.",
      "After two investigations, The Associated Press said it found no definitive evidence to warrant stripping Ut's photo credit. The AP said it was possible Ut took the picture, but the passage of time made it impossible to fully prove, and could find no evidence to prove anyone else did.",
      "World Press Photo said its probe found that two other photographers \u2014 Nguyen Thanh Nghe, the man mentioned in \u201cThe Stringer,\u201d and Huynh Cong Phuc \u2014 \u201cmay have been better positioned\u201d to take the shot.",
      "\u201cWe conclude that the level of doubt is too significant to maintain the existing attribution,\u201d said Joumana El Zein Khoury, executive director of World Press Photo. \u201cAt the same time, lacking conclusive evidence pointing definitively to another photographer, we cannot reassign authorship, either.\u201d",
      "World Press Photo, an organization whose awards are considered influential in photography, won't attempt to recover the cash award given to Ut, a spokeswoman said.",
      "Ut's lawyer, James Hornstein, said his client hadn't spoken to World Press Photo after some initial contact before \u201cThe Stringer\u201d was released. \u201cIt seems they had already made up their mind to punish Nick Ut from the start,\u201d he said.",
      "Gary Knight, a producer of \u201cThe Stringer,\u201d is a four-time judge of the World Press Photo awards and a consultant to the World Press Photo Foundation.",
      "The AP said Friday that its standards \u201crequire proof and certainty to remove a credit and we have found that it is impossible to prove exactly what happened that day on the road or in the (AP) bureau over 50 years ago.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe understand World Press Photo has taken different action based on the same available information, and that is their prerogative,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThere is no question over AP's ownership of the photo.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the Pulitzer Prize that Ut won for the photo appears safe. The Pulitzers depend on news agencies who enter the awards to determine authorship, and administrator Marjorie Miller \u2014 a former AP senior editor \u2014 pointed to the AP\u2019s study showing insufficient proof to withdraw credit. \u201cThe board does not anticipate future action at this time,\u201d she said Friday.",

The facility would be constructed on more than 350 acres (140 hectares) at the Port of Inola, east of Tulsa. The agreement is contingent upon the Oklahoma Legislature approving a package of financial incentives that includes $275 million from the state, as well as state property, sales and inventory tax exemptions.",

      "Missouri's governor said Friday that he will call the Legislature into a special session to consider incentives aimed at keeping the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals from moving to Kansas after lawmakers failed to pass a plan during their regular, annual session.",
      "Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe wants his state to help with a renovated or new stadium for pro football's Chiefs and with a new home venue for baseball's Royals. A Kansas law enacted last year authorizes state bonds for 70% of the cost of a new stadium, paying them off over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, Kansas Lottery ticket sales, and new sales and alcohol taxes.",
      "Voters in Jackson County, Missouri, where the teams are located, encouraged Kansas officials to make a play for the teams by turning down a sales tax extension last year that would have helped finance a new, $2 billion ballpark district for the Royals and an $800 million renovation of the Chiefs\u2019 Arrowhead Stadium.",
      "The Chiefs and Royals have played for more than 50 years in side-by-side stadiums in eastern Kansas City, drawing fans from both states of the split metropolitan area. Their stadium leases run until 2031.",
      "\u201cThis is a huge economic development package,\u201d Kehoe told reporters during a news conference livestreamed from the Missouri Capitol in Jefferson City. \u201cI\u2019d like to see us make sure we can solidify our offer with legislative approval.\u201d",
      "The GOP-controlled Missouri House approved a Kehoe-backed bill Tuesday that would have allowed the state to issue bonds for up to half the cost of the stadium projects and allow tax credits of up to $50 million. But the Republican-controlled Senate abruptly ended its regular-session work Wednesday after a contentious fight over an anti-abortion measure, without taking up the stadium financing measure.",
      "At least a few Kansas and Missouri lawmakers from both parties are skeptical of state incentives. Many economists contend that public funding for stadiums isn\u2019t worth it, because sports tend to divert discretionary spending away from other forms of entertainment rather than generate new income.",

      "Between collections resuming, courts challenging student loan programs and layoffs in the Education Department, borrowers might be confused about the status their student loans",
      "NEW YORK -- Between collections resuming, courts blocking student loan programs and layoffs at the Education Department, borrowers might be confused about the status of their student loans.",
      "Recently, the Education Department announced it would start involuntary collections on defaulted loans, meaning the roughly 5.3 million borrowers who are in default could have their wages garnished by the federal government.",
      "At the center of the turmoil are the government's income-driven repayment plans, which reduce monthly payments for borrowers with lower incomes. Those plans were temporarily paused after a federal court blocked parts of the plans in February.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much confusion, they\u2019ve made it very complicated,\u201d said Natalia Abrams, president and founder of the Student Debt Crisis Center.",
      "At the same time, some borrowers are struggling to get their loan servicers on the phone, making it hard to find answers to their questions, said Abrams.",
      "If you're a student loan borrower, here are some answers to your questions.",
      "Applications for income-driven repayment plans are open, but they're taking longer than usual to process.",
      "The applications were temporarily shut down earlier this year after a federal court in Missouri blocked the SAVE plan, a Biden administration plan that offered a faster path to loan forgiveness. The judge's order also blocked parts of other repayment plans, prompting the Education Department to pause income-driven applications entirely.",
      "Amid pressure from advocates, the department reopened the applications on May 10.",
      "Borrowers can apply for the following income-driven plans: the Income-Based Repayment Plan, the Pay as You Earn plan and the Income-Contingent Repayment plan.",
      "Abrams expects applications will continue to be approved but at a slower pace than before the application pause.",
      "Borrowers currently enrolled in an income-driven plan should be receiving notifications about recertification, said Khandice Lofton, counsel at the Student Borrower Protection Center. Recertification is required annually to update information on family size and income, and dates are different for each borrower.",
      "To review income-driven repayment plans, you can check the loan simulator at studentaid.gov.",
      "Borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan have been placed in administrative forbearance while a legal challenge is resolved. That means they don't have to make payments and interest is not accruing. Time in forbearance normally does not count toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.",
      "The Education Department will notify borrowers with updates on payments and litigation.",
      "\"We don't know for sure when the SAVE forbearance is going to end,\" Abrams said.",
      "While the future of the SAVE plan is decided in court, Abrams encourages borrowers to explore their eligibility for other income-driven repayment plans.",
      "The online application for loan consolidation is available again, at studentaid.gov/loan-consolidation. If you have multiple federal student loans, you can combine them into one with a fixed interest rate and a single monthly payment.",
      "The consolidation process typically takes around 60 days to complete. You can only consolidate your loans once.",
      "It would be difficult for the Education Department to reinstate loans that were canceled during President Joe Biden's administration. So far, it isn't believed to be happening, Abrams said.",
      "Nothing has changed yet.",
      "President Donald Trump wants to change the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to disqualify workers of nonprofit groups deemed to have engaged in \u201cimproper\u201d activities. He signed an executive order to that effect, but it has yet to be enforced.",
      "Borrowers enrolled in PSLF should keep up with payments to make progress toward loan forgiveness, said Sarah Austin, policy analyst at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.",
      "\u201cThere could be some changes coming in regards to PSLF but at this current time PSLF is still functioning and there is still loan forgiveness being processed under the PSLF provision,\u201d said Austin.",
      "An income-driven repayment tracker has disappeared from the federal student loan website for many borrowers, said Abrams. For keeping track of their status, Abrams is recommending that borrowers take screenshots of their payments.",
      "Contacting your loan servicer is crucial to managing and understanding your student loans. Due to the large number of people trying to get answers or apply for programs, loan servicers are taking longer than usual to respond.",
      "Abrams recommends borrowers prepare for long wait times.",
      "\u201cWe've heard borrowers being in hold for three or four hours, then being transferred to a supervisor and then being hung up on, after all that wait time. It's incredibly frustrating,\u201d Abrams said.",
      "If you're delinquent, try to get back on track. Borrowers who don't make their payments for 270 days go into default, which has severe consequences.",
      "\u201cIf you're delinquent but have not defaulted yet, do whatever you can do to avoid going default,\u201d said Kate Wood, a student loans expert at NerdWallet.",
      "Borrowers who are delinquent on their student loans take a massive hit on their credit scores, which could drop 100 points or more, Wood said. A delinquency stays on your credit report for seven years.",
      "Wood recommends contacting your servicer to ask for options, which can include forbearance, deferment or applying for an income-driven repayment plan.",
      "The Education Department is recommending borrowers visit its Default Resolution Group to make a monthly payment, enroll in an income-driven repayment plan or sign up for loan rehabilitation.",
      "Betsy Mayotte, president of The Institute for Student Loan Advisors, recommends loan rehabilitation.",
      "Borrowers in default must ask their loan servicer to be placed into such a program. Typically, servicers ask for proof of income and expenses to calculate a payment amount. Once a borrower has paid on time for nine months in a row, they are taken out of default, Mayotte said. A loan rehabilitation can only be done once.",
      "The Fresh Start program was a one-time temporary program that helped borrowers get out of default. This program ended Aug. 31, 2024.",

      "Speedway Motorsports announced that grandstand seating and premium hospitality were sold out for the 41st All-Star Race, which drew fans from 43 states and nine countries to North Wilkesboro, which is 80 miles north of Charlotte.

      "\u201cI don\u2019t see why not,\u201d seven-time most popular driver winner Chase Elliott said about the possibility after finishing fifth. \u201cI think it\u2019s plenty capable of hosting, and obviously, the crowd seems extremely receptive to the idea, too. Whatever NASCAR decides on that, I\u2019m good with. It put on a good race for sure, so it\u2019s hard to argue against that.\u201d",

A $20 million renovation ( spurred by federal funding from the American Rescue Plan ) began in 2022 and led to being awarded the 2023 All-Star Race.",
      "Its first two All-Star Races were lackluster, but North Wilkesboro\u2019s racing came to life Sunday. The 0.625-mile oval\u2019s surface has widened into multiple lanes since a repaving last year, and Sunday\u2019s race featured 1,426 green-flag passes that electrified the jammed grandstands.",

After the drivers made contact that squeezed his No. 22 Ford into the outside wall with nine laps remaining, Logano vowed retaliation if he\u2019d been able to catch Bell.",
      "\u201cI did all I could do to hold him off, and he got under me and released the brake and gave me no option,\u201d said Logano, who led a race-high 139 of 250 laps. \u201cIf I could\u2019ve got to him, he was going around after a move like that. I just couldn\u2019t get back to him. Just frustrated after you lead so many laps, and the car is so fast, and you don\u2019t win. It hurts quite a bit.\u201d",

      "Two-time defending Indianapolis 500 winner Josef Newgarden and Team Penske teammate Will Power will have to start from the final two spots on the grid Sunday after their teams were penalized for violating the rules during qualifying weekend",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Two-time defending Indianapolis 500 winner Josef Newgarden and Team Penske teammate Will Power will have to start from the final two spots on the grid Sunday after their teams were penalized for violating the rules during qualifying weekend.",
      "IndyCar also announced Monday that the team strategists for the Nos. 2 and 12 have been suspended for the race; the cars will forfeit their qualification points and pit box selections; and each of the entries has been fined $100,000.",
      "It's the second time in just over a year that Team Penske's IndyCar program has been embroiled in controversy.",
      "\u201cThe integrity of the Indianapolis 500 is paramount,\" IndyCar president Doug Boles said. \u201cAs we look to the remainder of the week and race weekend, we will do everything we can to make it clear that this is not only the best racing on the planet but racing where the best win under completely fair conditions.\u201d",
      "The trouble for Team Penske began before the fast 12 shootout Sunday, when rival team owner Chip Ganassi was among a chorus of competitors who accused it of cheating. They noticed unapproved changes had been made to the rear attenuator, a safety device designed to absorb and deduce the force of impacts, and the assumption was the modifications would have given the two Team Penske cars an aerodynamic advantage in their four-lap qualifying runs.",
      "Tim Cindric, the president of Penske\u2019s IndyCar program, said Power passed inspection but officials had flagged Newgarden\u2019s car, and he was told neither would pass inspection after making their runs. So, the cars were pulled from the lineup altogether.",
      "Boles initially said late Sunday that Newgarden and Power would join teammate Scott McLaughlin \u2014 who had crashed in practice on Sunday and was unable to make a qualifying run \u2014 in the fourth row for the race. But after the series gathered more facts and considered the case, the decision was made to put Newgarden in the 32nd starting spot and Will Power in the 33rd.",
      "McLaughlin will keep the 10th starting spot because his wrecked car was found to have used a legal attenuator.",
      "\u201cThis violation of the IndyCar rule against modification to this part and using it \u2018as supplied\u2019 is clear,\u201d Boles said. \"The penalty should be more than simply starting where the cars might have qualified anyway, if given the opportunity. The cars belong in the field as two of the fastest 33, however, starting on the tail of the field is the appropriate penalty in this instance.\u201d",
      "One year ago, Team Penske was caught in a push-to-pass scandal in which Newgarden was found to have access to an additional boost of horsepower when he should not have at the season-opener. He was stripped of his win and team owner Roger Penske \u2014 who also owns IndyCar and Indianapolis Motor Speedway \u2014 suspended Cindric for two races, including the Indy 500.",
      "Also suspended were managing director Ron Ruzewski, Newgarden engineer Luke Mason and data engineer Robbie Atkinson.",
      "Cindric and Ruzewski will now miss their second consecutive Indy 500.",
      "\u201cAs far as I'm concerned, this case is closed,\u201d Boles said.",
      "Newgarden, who is trying to become the first driver in 109 years to win three consecutive Indy 500s, was a contender to win the pole. He was seen running off his anger in the infield of the speedway Sunday as another qualifying session roared on.",
      "Pato O\u2019Ward, who drives for rival Arrow McLaren, said after qualifying on the front row that IndyCar should have penalized the Penske cars by making them run in a last-chance qualifier to re-earn spots on the 33-car starting grid. He also expressed sympathy for the four drivers who had to compete for the final three spots with Jacob Abel missing the race.",
      "\u201cI feel bad for Abel and everybody who did the last-chance qualifying. Those cars weren\u2019t in regulation,\u201d O\u2019Ward said of the two Penske cars. \u201cThose cars should have been in the last-chance qualifier ... because they had that (Saturday), I guarantee you.\"",
      "O'Ward also openly wondered why Team Penske continues to push the envelope on rules.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a shame,\" he said. \"They\u2019re a great team. They have great drivers. Why are you doing that? It makes no sense.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Cody Bellinger lofted a high fly to deep right field, where Juan Soto positioned himself in front of an unfriendly Yankee Stadium crowd and came up short.",
      "Summed up the entire Subway Series, really.",

      "\u201cI thought it was very fun,\" Bellinger said after equaling a career high with six RBIs in the finale of his first Subway Series. \u201cI really enjoyed it.\u201d",
      "Soto probably didn't. He went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts to the noisy delight of Yankees fans in a sellout crowd of 48,028. That left him 1 for 10 with four walks during his first series back in the Bronx since leaving the Yankees for a record $765 million, 15-year contract with the Mets.",

      "Bellinger, whose father Clay won three American League pennants and two World Series titles as a light-hitting bench player for the Yankees from 1999-2001, is batting .340 with three homers, six RBIs and a .980 OPS since May 3 during a 13-game hitting streak that ties his career best.",
      "\u201cHe's just been swinging the bat so well the past couple games, and I love it when I have that guy hitting behind me,\u201d Judge said. \u201cI just feel like his approach is a little better. He knows what he's looking for when he steps into the box, and when he gets what he's looking for he's not missing it.\u201d",
      "Bellinger went 3 for 3 with two walks Sunday on a perfect night at the plate, finishing a triple shy of the cycle. His two-run double in the first inning gave the Yankees a 2-0 lead, and his ninth career slam in the eighth off left-handed reliever G\u00e9nesis Cabrera capped a six-run outburst that put the game away.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s kind of the same every day. I think he\u2019s got enough experience in this league now obviously, and he\u2019s experienced it all,\" Boone said. \"He\u2019s experienced being the best player in the league and winning MVP. He\u2019s experienced struggles. He\u2019s experienced making a career kind of swing change and dealing with an injury and kind of evolving behind the scenes.",

      "\u201cHe can hit a homer or he can choke up and hit the ball the other way for a base hit, and he has the ability to fight off some really tough pitches \u2014 especially with two strikes,\" Yankees ace Max Fried said. \u201cYou can turn on that two-strike approach and when you have a guy that has good bat-to-ball skills and also can be that deep-ball threat, it\u2019s just really hard to make sure. They've got to throw a really good pitch.\u201d",

      "Liberty (50-13) will play host to the winner between No. 13 seed Arizona and Mississippi in the super regionals next weekend.",
      "KK Madrey drew a lead-off walk in the sixth, Paige Doeer and Rachel Crane struck out swinging before Jessee homered to make it 3-3. JaMaya Byrum walked on four consecutive pitches, Savannah Woodard followed with a single and Roupe hit a shot off the scoreboard in left field to give the Flames a 6-3 lead.",
      "Kaylan Yoder replaced starter Elena Escobar (25-3) with one out and runners on first and second. Kennedy Powell flied out and Koko Wooley\u2019s infield single scored Kramer Eschete to cut Texas A&M\u2019s deficit to 6-5 before Mya Perez flied out to end the inning.",

      "Texas A&M scored the next 10 runs, including home runs by KK Dement, Mya Perez and Mac Barbara. The Aggies were up 11-7 going into the bottom of the seventh but Liberty tied it with four runs before Sydney Lessentine got the final out on a 3-2 pitch.",
      "The Aggies pounded out 18 hits and Liberty, which won the first matchup 8-5 on Saturday had six errors, the last opening the door in the top of the eighth.",

    "story": [
      "Christopher Bell passed Joey Logano with nine laps remaining and cruised to victory in an action-packed NASCAR All-Star Race at North Wilkesboro Speedway on Sunday night",
      "Christopher Bell loves North Wilkesboro Speedway, and Joey Logano hates the \u201cPromoter\u2019s Caution.\u201d",
      "Those were the main takeaways from the top two finishers in an action-packed NASCAR All-Star Race at the 0.625-mile oval in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina.",
      "In a slam-bang affair that set a record for lead changes, Bell beat Logano by 0.829 seconds to earn his first All-Star Race victory. Bell, who won three consecutive Cup Series races earlier this season but had a previous best All-Star finish of 10th, delivered the third All-Star Race win for Joe Gibbs Racing.",
      "\u201cThat right there is absolutely incredible,\u201d Bell said. \u201cNorth Wilkesboro, best short track on the schedule.\u201d",
      "He also is a fan of Marcus Smith, the president and CEO of Speedway Motorsports that owns North Wilkesboro Speedway. In a new All-Star Race wrinkle, Smith was allowed to choose when to throw a \u201c Promoter\u2019s Caution \u201d that would bunch the field for a late restart.",
      "Smith sent two-time Daytona 500 winner and Fox Sports personality Michael Waltrip to the flag stand to display the random yellow flag on Lap 217 with Logano leading by about a half-second over Bell.",
      "Logano, who was trying to win his second consecutive All-Star Race, elected to stay on track rather than pit during the caution, and the decision proved costly. Bell pitted for two fresh tires, restarted in sixth and needed only five laps to catch Logano. After a battle for first that lasted a dozen laps, Bell took the lead for good on Lap 241 of 250.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pissed off right now,\u201d said Logano, who led a race-high 139 laps. \u201cJust dang it, we had the fastest car. I\u2019m trying to choose my words correctly on the caution situation. Obviously, I got bit by it, so I am the one frustrated.\u201d",
      "It was a stark turnaround for the defending Cup Series champion, who recently said he supported the \u201cPromoter\u2019s Caution\u201d because \u201cthe All-Star Race presents the opportunity to try things outside of the box.\u201d But he was questioning its validity after Sunday\u2019s race.",
      "\u201cYeah, I\u2019m all about no gimmicks with the caution,\u201d Logano said. \u201cI am all about that. Me and Marcus Smith aren\u2019t seeing eye to eye right now, okay? I\u2019ve got to have a word with him.\u201d",
      "Ross Chastain finished third, followed by Alex Bowman and Chase Elliott.",
      "The \u201cPromoter\u2019s Caution\u201d was introduced to guarantee an exciting finish, but the All-Star Race hardly needed much help this year.",
      "After lackluster showings in the first two outings, the All-Star Race delivered much more action in its third year at North Wilkesboro Speedway. There were 18 lead changes, breaking the mark of 13 (set in 2016) for the most in the event\u2019s 41-year history.",
      "Pole-sitter Brad Keselowski and Logano traded the lead twice in the first 10 laps and often ran side by side for the lead. There were six leaders and 10 lead changes in the first half of the race, which topped the total number of leaders (four) and lead changes (five) in the past two All-Star Races combined.",
      "After leading 62 laps, Keselowski\u2019s bid for his first All-Star Race victory ended with a crash on Lap 177.",
      "Capitalizing on pit strategy, Carson Hocevar led the final 46 laps to win the All-Star Open earlier Sunday and advanced into the NASCAR All-Star Race.",
      "Runner-up John Hunter Nemechek also advanced to the main event by finishing second in the 100-lap warmup race. Noah Gragson won an online fan vote to earn the final transfer spot to the All-Star Race, whose field will included 20 other drivers competing for $1 million.",
      "Pole-sitter Shane van Gisbergen finished 13th after leading the first 54 laps on the 0.625-mile oval. The New Zealand native, who is in his first full Cup Series season after winning three Supercar championships in Australia, fell from first to sixth on a four-tire pit stop during the halfway caution.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know whether to smile or cry,\u201d said van Gisbergen, who is ranked 35th in the points standings with one top 10 this season. \u201cIt\u2019s been a dismal year for us, but I feel like we\u2019re getting better every week. This shows it.\u201d",
      "The All-Star Race winner\u2019s share has been $1 million since the 2003 event, and some drivers have grumbled that an increase for inflation is well overdue.",
      "\u201cI definitely think it should get raised,\u201d 2023 Cup Series champion Ryan Blaney said this week. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing about the All-Star Race I\u2019d probably change. I don\u2019t want to get greedy, but I think you can raise it to $3 million.\u201d",
      "Bubba Wallace said he\u2019d suggest $5 million but would be good for a bump to $3 million.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve got more TV money, so why not,\u201d Wallace said, referring to NASCAR\u2019s media rights raising to $1.1 billion annually in a deal starting this year.",
      "The Cup Series will race May 25 at Charlotte Motor Speedway in the Coca-Cola 600, the longest race of the season. Christopher Bell won last year\u2019s race, which was shortened from 600 to 374 miles by rain.",
      "Kyle Larson missed the 2024 race after arriving late because the Indianapolis 500 was delayed by rain. The Hendrick Motorsports star again will attempt to become the fifth driver to race the Indy 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on the same day.",

      "The parity era continues in the NBA.",
      "The New York Knicks haven't won an NBA championship since 1973. The Indiana Pacers won their most recent title that year \u2014 in the ABA. The Oklahoma City Thunder franchise has one title in its history, that coming in 1979 when the team called Seattle home. And the Minnesota Timberwolves have never even been to the NBA Finals.",
      "Meet the NBA's final four.",
      "When Commissioner Adam Silver hands one of those teams the Larry O'Brien Trophy next month, it'll mark a league first \u2014 seven championship franchises in a seven-year span.",
      "There hasn't been a back-to-back NBA champion since Golden State in 2017 and 2018. From there, the list of champions goes like this: Toronto in 2019, the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020, Milwaukee in 2021, Golden State in 2022, Denver in 2023 and Boston last season.",
      "It's the longest such run of different champions in NBA history; Major League Baseball, the NHL and the NFL have all had longer ones, and not too long ago, either.",
      "But for the NBA, this is different. The league wanted unpredictability, especially after four consecutive Cleveland-vs.-Golden State title matchups from 2015 through 2018.",
      "And things have been highly unpredictable since. No matter what the Finals matchup is this year, the NBA will be seeing 11 conference-champion franchises in the span of seven seasons.",
      "\u201cWe've still got eight more wins to achieve our ultimate goal,\u201d Minnesota coach Chris Finch said. \u201cWe've still got two more series. We're only halfway there.\u201d",

      "The Western Conference finals \u2014 No. 6 seed Minnesota vs. No. 1 seed Oklahoma City \u2014 begin Tuesday night in Oklahoma. The Eastern Conference finals \u2014 No. 4 seed Indiana vs. No. 3 seed New York \u2014 begin Wednesday night in Manhattan. The Wolves lost the West finals last year; the Pacers lost the East finals a year ago.",
      "\u201cYou've got to have big dreams,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cYou don't know how often you're going to be in this position.\u201d",
      "Indeed, the championship window for teams doesn't seem to be staying open as long as it did in the past.",
      "Boston was a huge favorite to win its second straight title; the Celtics didn't get out of Round 2, in part because they couldn't hold onto big leads and in part because Jayson Tatum ruptured his right Achilles tendon in that series with the Knicks.",
      "\u201cUpset or not, whatever it is, we beat a great team,\u201d Knicks guard Jalen Brunson said. \u201cThey obviously lost a huge piece ... but they're still a great team.\u201d",
      "Damian Lillard tore an Achilles tendon in Round 1, ending Milwaukee's hopes. Cleveland, the top seed in the East, bowed out in Round 2 against Indiana after a slew of Cavs were dealing with health issues. Stephen Curry strained his hamstring; that was all it took to doom Golden State's chances in Round 2 against Minnesota.",
      "\u201cHe's our sun,\u201d Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cThis is a solar system. He's our sun.\u201d",
      "And now, the NBA solar system is about to see new star holding the trophy.",
      "There is nobody left in these playoffs who has been an NBA Finals MVP. Not even close.",
      "In fact, there are only seven players left \u2014 Indiana\u2019s Pascal Siakam, Aaron Nesmith and Thomas Bryant; Knicks teammates P.J. Tucker, Cam Payne and Mikal Bridges; and Oklahoma City\u2019s Alex Caruso \u2014 who have appeared in a Finals game. And most of those appearances didn't add up to much; Siakam is the only player left in these playoffs with more than 100 Finals points.",
      "So, who will the next Finals MVP be? Maybe Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the Canadian guard and likely MVP from the Thunder? The \u201cMr. Clutch\u201d award winner, Brunson from the Knicks? Anthony Edwards, the presumed next face of the league from the Timberwolves? Tyrese Haliburton, the dazzling guard and Olympic gold medalist who keeps getting overlooked by everyone outside of Indiana?",
      "None of them would be surprise choices.",
      "\u201cOur ultimate goal isn't just the Western Conference finals,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cYou've got to go through there to get there.\u201d",
      "If the NBA\u2019s final four was its own league this season, taking just the head-to-head results between those four clubs would suggest the Thunder are the clear favorite.",
      "Oklahoma City went 6-2 against the other three conference finalists, while New York and Indiana both went 3-4 and Minnesota went 3-5.",
      "The Thunder swept the Pacers and Knicks, and the Pacers swept the Timberwolves.",
      "As far as the head-to-heads going into the conference finals, Oklahoma City and Minnesota split four meetings \u2014 with the Timberwolves outscoring the Thunder 475-472 \u2014 while the Knicks went 2-1 against Indiana, with all three games decided by at least 11 points.",
      "\u201cYou can feel good about it, feel however you want to feel about it,\u201d Haliburton said of getting to this point. \u201cBut at the end of the day, we\u2019re not done. We know we all have a bigger goal at mind. Our goal wasn\u2019t just to get to the Eastern Conference finals and be done. Our goal is to win a championship.\u201d",

      "Reese had 12 points and 17 rebounds in the 93-58 loss to the Fever. The Sky forward and Clark had an incident on the court with 4:38 left in the third quarter. It started with Reese grabbing an offensive rebound and Clark slapping Reese\u2019s arm hard enough to jar the ball loose and knock Reese to floor.",
      "When Reese got up, she tried to confront Clark before Indiana center Aliyah Boston stepped in between the two players. Clark\u2019s third personal foul was upgraded to a flagrant 1 while Boston and Reese each drew technical fouls following a replay review by the referees.",
      "Both players downplayed the play after the game.",
      "The league launched \u201cNo Space for Hate\u201d this season, a multi-dimensional platform designed to combat hate and promote respect across all WNBA spaces both online and in-arena.",

      "\u201cIt's nice in words, but we got to see actions,\u201d Aces star A'ja Wilson said Friday after practice. \u201cHopefully people can take actions and understand this is bigger than basketball. We're true people behind it. Any shoe that we wear, any jersey we have on, we're human. People have to respect that. I hope they pay attention and listen to the words.\u201d",

      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Scott McLaughlin crashed his Team Penske car in Sunday afternoon practice and ruined his chance to repeat last year's Indianapolis 500 pole-winning run.",
      "McLaughlin qualified Saturday inside the top 12 and was eligible to run for the pole later Sunday. But he spun at Indianapolis Motor Speedway and immediately lifted both hands to his helmet as he braced for impact with the Turn 2 wall.",
      "The New Zealanders' car was destroyed and Team Penske said they'd slot him at 12th and not even attempt a qualifying run Sunday. The car the team was working on for McLaughlin is Penske's backup speedway car and had been earmarked for teammate Josef Newgarden to use in next week's pit crew competition.",
      "McLaughlin, who last year led a Penske sweep of the front row in qualifying, was clearly deflated after he was released from the medical center.",
      "\u201cI'm OK, I'm just really, really, really, really, really sorry for everyone at Team Penske,\" McLaughlin said. \u201cIt was talking to me and I sort of felt it, and I probably should have backed out, but you're trying to complete a run to see what it feels like and was it worth the risk? Probably wasn't. I'm incredibly sad.\u201d",
      "He said he felt fortunate the car did not go airborne into the catchfence, but the crash did cause damage to the track surface that IMS workers were fixing during a stoppage created by his wreck.",
      "\u201cThey can build a new car for me, but I'm just really gutted more than anything,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cIt's hard to take, like you wish it was for something, but it was for nothing, right? In practice.\u201d",
      "McLaughlin was also rattled to see his wife crying after his crash out of concern for him.",
      "\u201cThey're nervous about me,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to get out of the car straight away just so she knew I was OK.\u201d",
      "There have been three hard crashes in the last two days at Indianapolis. Marcus Armstrong and Colton Herta both crashed Saturday and Armstrong has to qualify Sunday for the field of 33 using a road and street course backup car. Herta qualified inside the top 30 to lock himself into the field once his car was ready for qualifying.",

      "President Donald Trump has signed the Take It Down Act into law",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Monday signed into law the Take It Down Act, a measure that imposes penalties for online sexual exploitation that first lady Melania Trump helped usher through Congress, and he had her sign it, too, despite what sounded like a mild objection on her part.",
      "\u201cC'mon, sign it anyway,\u201d the president told his wife. \u201cShe deserves to sign it,\u201d he said.",
      "After she added her signature, the president showed the document bearing both of their names to the audience at the signing ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. Melania Trump's signature is merely symbolic because first ladies are not elected and have no formal role in the signing of legislation.",
      "In March, Melania Trump used her first public appearance since resuming the role of first lady to travel to Capitol Hill to lobby House members to pass the bill following its approval by the Senate.",
      "At a signing ceremony, she called the new law a \u201cnational victory\u201d that will help protect children from online exploitation, including through the use of artificial intelligence to make fake images.",
      "\u201cAI and social media are the digital candy for the next generation, sweet addictive and engineered to have an impact on the cognitive development of our children,\u201d she said. \u201cBut unlike sugar, these new technologies can be weaponized, shape beliefs and, sadly, affect emotions and even be deadly.\u201d",
      "The president said the proliferation of images made using AI means that \u201ccountless women have been harassed with deepfakes and other explicit images distributed against their will.\u201d He said what's happening is \u201cjust so horribly wrong.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday, we're making it totally illegal,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The bill makes it a federal crime to \u201cknowingly publish\u201d or threaten to publish intimate images without a person\u2019s consent, including AI-created \u201cdeepfakes.\u201d Websites and social media companies will be required to remove such material within 48 hours after a victim requests it. The platforms must also take steps to delete duplicate content.",
      "Many states have already banned the dissemination of sexually explicit deepfakes or revenge porn, but the Take It Down Act is a rare example of federal regulators imposing on internet companies.",
      "The bill, sponsored by Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, R-Fla., received overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, passing the House in April by a 409-2 vote and clearing the Senate by unanimous consent.",
      "But the measure isn't without critics. Free speech advocates and digital rights groups say the bill is too broad and could lead to censorship of legitimate images, including legal pornography and LGBTQ content. Others say it could allow the government to monitor private communications and undermine due process.",
      "The first lady appeared at a Capitol Hill roundtable with lawmakers and young women who had explicit images of them put online, saying it was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d to see what teenagers and especially girls go through after this happens to them. She also included a victim among her guests for the president's address to a joint session of Congress the day after that meeting.",
      "After the House passed the bill, Melania Trump said the bipartisan vote was a \u201cpowerful statement that we stand united in protecting the dignity, privacy and safety of our children.\u201d",
      "Her advocacy for the bill is a continuation of the Be Best campaign she started in the president's first term, focusing on children's well-being, social media use and opioid abuse.",
      "In his speech to Congress in March, the president said he looked forward to signing the bill.",
      "\u201cAnd I'm going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d he said, adding, that there's nobody who \"gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody.\u201d",

      "Scientists have found evidence of monkey kidnappings in Panama",
      "WASHINGTON -- A baby howler monkey clung to the back of an older male monkey, its tiny fingers grasping fur. But they're not related and not even the same species.",
      "Scientists spotted surprising evidence of what they describe as monkey kidnappings while reviewing video footage from a small island of Panama. The capuchin monkeys were seen carrying at least 11 howler babies between 2022 and 2023.",
      "\u201cThis was very much a shocking finding,\u201d said Zo\u00eb Goldsborough, a behavioral ecologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen anything like this in the animal kingdom.\"",
      "The monkeys' motivations remain under investigation. Capuchins are house cat-size monkeys found in South America and Central America. They are long-lived, clever and learn new behaviors from each other. One group of capuchins in Panama has even learned to use stone tools to crack open nuts and seafood.",
      "Goldsberg and other researchers at Max Planck and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute had set up more than 80 cameras to study capuchin tool use, but were surprised to see the first howler babies appear in early 2022.",
      "The footage showed the capuchins walking and pounding their stone tools with baby howlers on their backs. But cameras did not capture the moments of abduction, which scientists said likely happened up in the trees, where howlers spend most of their time.",
      "\u201cOur window into this story is constrained,\u201d said co-author Margaret Crofoot of Max Planck and the Smithsonian. The findings were published Monday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "In most or all cases, the baby howlers died, researchers said. Infant howler monkeys would normally be carried by their mothers while still nursing. All the babies in the video -- from a few weeks to a few months in age -- were too young to be weaned.",
      "\u201cA hopeful part of me wants to believe some escaped and went back to their mothers, but we don\u2019t know,\" said Crofoot.",
      "The videos recorded a few instances of young capuchin males still carrying howler babies that had died, likely from starvation. Many animals -- from gorillas to orcas -- have been observed carrying their own dead offspring, though scientists aren\u2019t sure the reasons.",
      "Why did the capuchin males do it? There were no signs of deliberate aggression toward the babies and they weren\u2019t eaten, ruling out predation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all spent hours wracking our brains why they would do this,\u201d said Goldsborough.",
      "The first baby-snatcher may have had a confused \u201ccaring motivation,\u201d or parental instinct, because he showed gentleness interacting with the infants, she said. Then four other males copied his actions.",
      "The researchers said they don't believe the capuchins harmed the babies on purpose. So far, only one group of capuchins has been known to kidnap.",
      "The research shows the \u201cremarkable behavioral variation across social groups of the same species,\u201d said Catherine Crockford, a primatologist at the CNRS Institute for Cognitive Sciences in France, who was not involved in the study.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to overhaul how U.S. elections are run includes a somewhat obscure reference to the way votes are counted",
      "ATLANTA -- President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to overhaul how U.S. elections are run includes a somewhat obscure reference to the way votes are counted. Voting equipment, it says, should not use ballots that include \u201ca barcode or quick-response code.\u201d",
      "Those few technical words could have a big impact.",
      "Voting machines that give all voters a ballot with one of those codes are used in hundreds of counties across 19 states. Three of them -- Georgia, South Carolina and Delaware -- use the machines statewide.",
      "Some computer scientists, Democrats and left-leaning election activists have raised concerns about their use, but those pushing conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election have been the loudest, claiming without evidence that manipulation has already occurred. Trump, in justifying the move, said in the order that his intention was \u201cto protect election integrity.\u201d",
      "Even some election officials who have vouched for the accuracy of systems that use coded ballots have said it\u2019s time to move on because too many voters don\u2019t trust them.",
      "Colorado\u2019s secretary of state, Democrat Jena Griswold, decided in 2019 to stop using ballots with QR codes, saying at the time that voters \u201cshould have the utmost confidence that their vote will count.\u201d Amanda Gonzalez, the elections clerk in Colorado\u2019s Jefferson County, doesn't support Trump's order but believes Colorado's decision was a worthwhile step.",
      "\u201cWe can just eliminate confusion,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cAt the end of the day, that\u2019s what I want -- elections that are free, fair, transparent.\u201d",
      "Whether voting by mail or in person, millions of voters across the country mark their selections by using a pen to fill in ovals on paper ballots. Those ballots are then fed through a tabulating machine to tally the votes and can be retrieved later if a recount is needed.",
      "In other places, people voting in person use a touch-screen machine to mark their choices and then get a paper record of their votes that includes a barcode or QR code. A tabulator scans the code to tally the vote.",
      "Election officials who use that equipment say it\u2019s secure and that they routinely perform tests to ensure the results match the votes on the paper records, which they retain. The coded ballots have nevertheless become a target of election conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cI think the problem is super exaggerated,\u201d said Lawrence Norden of the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cI understand why it can appeal to certain parts of the public who don\u2019t understand the way this works, but I think it\u2019s being used to try to question certain election results in the past.\u201d",
      "Those pushing conspiracy theories related to the 2020 election have latched onto a long-running legal battle over Georgia's voting system. In that case, a University of Michigan computer scientist testified that an attacker could tamper with the QR codes to change voter selections and install malware on the machines.",
      "The testimony from J. Alex Halderman has been used to amplify Trump\u2019s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, even though there is no evidence that any of the weaknesses he found were exploited.",
      "Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, has defended the state's voting system as secure. In March, the judge who presided over Halderman's testimony declined to block the use of Georgia\u2019s voting equipment but said the case had \u201cidentified substantial concerns about the administration, maintenance and security of Georgia\u2019s electronic in-person voting system.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s election executive order is being challenged in multiple lawsuits. One has resulted in a preliminary injunction against a provision that sought to require proof of citizenship when people register to vote.",
      "The section banning ballots that use QR or barcodes relies on a Trump directive to a federal agency, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, which sets voluntary guidelines for voting systems. Not all states follow them.",
      "Some of the lawsuits say Trump doesn\u2019t have the authority to direct the commission because it was established by Congress as an independent agency.",
      "While the courts sort that out, the commission\u2019s guidelines say ballots using barcodes or QR codes should include a printed list of the voters\u2019 selections so they can be checked.",
      "Trump\u2019s order exempts voting equipment used by voters with disabilities, but it promises no federal money to help states and counties shift away from systems using QR or barcodes.",
      "\u201cIn the long run, it would be nice if vendors moved away from encoding, but there\u2019s already evidence of them doing that,\u201d said Pamela Smith, president of the group Verified Voting.",
      "Kim Dennison, election coordinator of Benton County, Arkansas, estimated that updating the county's voting system would cost around $400,000 and take up to a year.",
      "Dennison said she has used equipment that relies on coded ballots since she started her job 15 years ago and has never found an inaccurate result during postelection testing.",
      "\u201cI fully and completely trust the equipment is doing exactly what it\u2019s supposed to be doing and not falsifying reports,\u201d she said. \u201cYou cannot change a vote once it\u2019s been cast.\u201d",
      "In Pennsylvania\u2019s Luzerne County, voting machines that produce a QR code will be used in this year\u2019s primary. But officials expect a manufacturer\u2019s update later this year to remove the code before the November elections.",
      "County Manager Romilda Crocamo said officials had not received any complaints from voters about QR codes but decided to make the change when Dominion Voting Systems offered the update.",
      "The nation\u2019s most populous county, Los Angeles, uses a system with a QR code that it developed over a decade and deployed in 2020 after passing a state testing and certification program.",
      "The county\u2019s chief election official, Dean Logan, said the system exceeded federal guidelines at the time and meets many of the standards outlined in the most recent ones approved in 2021. He said postelection audits have consistently confirmed its accuracy.",
      "Modifying or replacing it would be costly and take years, he said. The county\u2019s current voting equipment is valued at $140 million.",
      "Perhaps nowhere has the issue been more contentious than Georgia, a presidential battleground. It uses the same QR code voting system across the state.",
      "Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, a lead plaintiff in the litigation over the system, said her group has not taken a position on Trump's executive order but said the federal Election Assistance Commission should stop certifying machines that use barcodes.",
      "The secretary of state said the voting system follows Georgia law, which requires federal certification at the time the system is bought. Nevertheless, the Republican-controlled legislature has voted to ban the use of QR codes but did not allocate any money to make the change \u2014 a cost estimated at $66 million.",
      "Republicans said they want to replace the system when the current contract expires in 2028, but their law is still scheduled to take effect next year. GOP state Rep. Victor Anderson said there is no realistic way to \u201cprevent the train wreck that\u2019s coming.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt firing of top officials at the Library of Congress and equally sudden attempt to appoint a slate of loyalists as replacements has morphed into an enormous fight over the separation of powers",
      "WASHINGTON -- It\u2019s not really about the books.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt firing of top officials at the Library of Congress and equally sudden attempt to appoint a slate of loyalists as replacements has instead morphed into an enormous fight over the separation of powers, as the White House tries to wrest control of what has for centuries been a legislative institution.",
      "It\u2019s a power struggle with potentially vast consequences. The Library of Congress not only stores the world's largest collection of books but also an office overseeing reams of copyrighted material of untold value.",
      "There is a research institute that has long been protected from outside influence. Its servers house extremely sensitive information regarding claims of workplace violations on Capitol Hill, as well as payments and other financial data for the legislative branch\u2019s more than 30,000 employees. There\u2019s even speculation that the whole affair is tied to an ongoing debate over whether big tech companies can use copyrighted material for artificial intelligence systems.",
      "Because of this, the battle over control of the Library of Congress has prompted Republican leaders on Capitol Hill to deliver rare pushback against a president who has pressed to expand the boundaries of his own power to enact his priorities. Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other Republicans have been talking with the White House about a potential path to d\u00e9tente.",
      "This all has left the library in a bizarre state of purgatory.",
      "For now, Trump's choices for interim library leaders \u2014 most notably Todd Blanche, a deputy attorney general who had represented the president in his criminal proceedings \u2014 have not appeared to challenge the assertion by the library that one of its veteran officials would be the acting head. It would be unheard of for an executive branch official such as Blanche to simultaneously serve in the legislative branch, according to experts.",
      "\u201cThis egregious overreach into the legislature by the executive branch is just unwarranted and, we believe, unprecedented,\u201d said New York Rep. Joe Morelle, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, which oversees the Library of Congress.",
      "The controversy began to unfold publicly last week, when Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden was fired in a terse email from a White House official. She had just one year left in her 10-year term.",
      "Then this week, Blanche was tapped by the White House to be the interim librarian, and two other Justice Department officials were chosen for other senior library posts. Those officials, Brian Nieves and Paul Perkins, tried unsuccessfully to enter the U.S. Copyright Office on Monday, but left voluntarily after library officials called Capitol Police.",
      "Thune told The Associated Press that Congress was \u201cnot entirely\u201d consulted ahead of Trump\u2019s dismissal of Hayden.",
      "Lawmakers want to ensure that \u201ccongressional legislative branch equities are protected,\u201d Thune said. He speculated that discussions with the White House to resolve the standoff would bleed into next week.",
      "The White House has said Trump was within his authority to dismiss Hayden, a former head of the library systems in Baltimore. It cited \u201cquite concerning\u201d behavior from Hayden involving diversity, equity and inclusion efforts as well as books for children that the White House found inappropriate.",
      "A copy of virtually every book published in the U.S. is sent to the Copyright Office, then the library decides whether to include it in the main collection. No one under 16 can get a reader card to access the collection.",
      "Existing regulations and past practices call for an acting librarian to come from the Library of Congress\u2019 current ranks if there is a vacancy. But the White House has argued that a law governing federal vacancies applies, even though the 1998 law deals with the executive branch, according to two people familiar with the discussions.",
      "When Nieves and Perkins showed up on Monday, they held a letter that invoked the vacancies law to justify their appointments, according to one of the people.",
      "Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin, who leads the panel overseeing funding for the Library of Congress, argued that in practice, the librarian is not a legislative branch employee, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s an appointment by the president of the United States, because we have to confirm her.\u201d",
      "Yet there is deep concern among lawmakers and aides about any unjustified intrusion of the administration into the Library of Congress and its operations.",
      "Especially worrisome to them is potential meddling with the Congressional Research Service, known as the nonpartisan think tank of Capitol Hill. It fields roughly 75,000 requests from members of Congress every year for research, legal expertise and other information critical for policymaking.",
      "The discussions between lawmakers and the Congressional Research Service are considered so sensitive that they are protected under the speech or debate clause of the Constitution, which shields members of Congress from being questioned -\u2013 such as in court -\u2013 about official legislative acts.",
      "The service's \u201cutility and trustworthiness would be substantially undercut if these inquiries were not protected or the Administration sought to shape responses to reflect its priorities,\u201d said Hope O\u2019Keeffe, a former associate general counsel at the Library of Congress.",
      "The library also oversees the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights, which functions as the human resources office of the legislative branch, fielding complaints about harassment, discrimination and other workplace violations. It also stores financial information about legislative branch employees, who include not just those at the Library of Congress, lawmakers and their aides, but employees of the Capitol Police, the Architect of the Capitol and the Government Accountability Office.",
      "Robert Newlen, the principal deputy librarian, told library staffers shortly after Hayden\u2019s firing that he will serve as the acting librarian. He said in a note this week that while the White House had appointed its own acting librarian, \u201cwe have not yet received direction from Congress about how to move forward,\u201d indicating that the library was defying Trump\u2019s wishes.",
      "California Sen. Alex Padilla, the top Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, this week said flatly that Newlen is the acting librarian of Congress. Asked whether Blanche was respecting that, Padilla said, \u201cthat\u2019s my understanding.\u201d",
      "But a White House official stressed on Thursday that Trump selected Blanche to be the acting librarian. The official, granted anonymity because of the ongoing private discussions with lawmakers, said Trump chose Blanche because the president is \u201cappointing highly-qualified individuals who are wholeheartedly committed to advancing the America-first agenda.\" The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Some suspect that the Copyright Office is the true aim of the administration. Housed in the Library of Congress with a leader chosen by the librarian, the office accepts millions of copies of copyrighted material such as books, artwork and music every year as part of the copyright registration process.",
      "Shortly before the director of the office, Shira Perlmutter, was fired, her office released a report that questioned whether it was legal for the tech industry to use copyrighted material to \u201ctrain\u201d their artificial intelligence systems. Tech companies contend that doing so is legal when used for educational or research purposes or creating something new. Perlmutter\u2019s report said doing so, in some circumstances, would go beyond established boundaries of fair use when the AI-generated content is competing with creative works made by people.",
      "The material there is extremely valuable. For instance, copyright violation damages for the office's existing collection \u2014 if, for instance, tech companies scraped the material for AI purposes and then later were found liable for copyright infringement \u2014 would likely exceed $1.5 trillion, according to a person familiar with the calculations.",
      "Morelle noted that the firing came \u201cone day after, and I doubt there\u2019s any coincidence to this, a report which is in many ways at odds with what Elon Musk wants to do around intellectual property and copyright.\u201d Musk is the billionaire outside adviser for Trump who operates his own AI startup, called xAI. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "Fortnite says it\u2019s unavailable on Apple\u2019s iOS globally because the tech giant blocked a bid to rerelease the popular video game for iPhone users in the U.S. and Europe",
      "NEW YORK -- Fortnite says it's now unavailable on Apple's iOS globally because the tech giant blocked a bid to rerelease the popular video game for iPhone users in the U.S. and Europe \u2014 marking the latest twist in a yearslong feud.",
      "Apple pulled Epic Games-owned Fortnite from its app store back in 2020, just two years after the widely-popular, multiplayer survival game had launched on iOS and garnered millions of users. iPhone players in the U.S. have been locked out since, although Apple users in the EU had been able to download the game through an alternative store over the last nine months.",
      "Following years of a tense litigation, a recent court ruling was set to clear the way for Fortnite to finally return to iOS users in the U.S., too. But the video game said early Friday that a move from Apple has prevented that \u2014 and, as a result, Fortnite says it's now dark on iOS globally.",
      "\u201cApple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the U.S. App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union,\" Fortnite wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. \u201cSadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it.\"",
      "In a statement sent to The Associated Press, Apple said it had asked Epic Sweden to resubmit the app update \u201cwithout including the U.S. storefront of the App Store so as not to impact Fortnite in other geographies.\u201d Sweden is where Epic\u2019s developer account for its alternative app store is based.",
      "But, Apple added, it \"did not take any action to remove the live version of Fortnite from alternative distribution marketplaces.\u201d",
      "Epic did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",
      "In the U.S., Epic filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple back in 2020, alleging the technology trendsetter was illegally using its power to gouge game makers. After a monthlong trial in 2021, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled against most of Epic\u2019s claims, but ordered Apple to loosen its previously-exclusive control over the payments made for in-app commerce and allow links to alternative options in the U.S. for the first time \u2014 threatening to undercut sizable commissions that Apple had been collecting from in-app transactions for over a decade.",
      "After exhausting an appeal that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, Apple last year introduced a new system that opened the door for links to alternative payment options while still imposing a 27% commission on in-app transactions executed outside its own system.",
      "Epic fired back by alleging Apple was thumbing its nose at the legal system, reviving another round of court hearings that lasted nearly a year before Gonzalez Rogers delivered a stinging rebuke last month \u2014 which held Apple in civil contempt and banned the company from collecting any commission on alternative payment systems.",
      "That ruling cleared the way for Epic to finally return to the iPhone app store in the U.S., a reinstatement the video game maker was anticipating before Apple\u2019s latest move.",
      "Fortnite's availability in the EU, meanwhile, is under an alternative store for iPhone users \u2014 now called the Epic Games Store. Apple cleared the way for this last year under new regulatory pressures. Prior to Friday, Fortnite and other Epic games had been available for download on iPhones using this store in the EU since August 2024.",
      "Before the companies' prolonged legal battle, Epic launched Fortnite on iOS in April 2018. Between then and its August 2020 removal, 116 million users accessed Fortnite on iOS devices, company filings note \u2014 raking in a daily average of about 2.5 million players, which represented about 10% of Fortnite's total daily traffic at the time.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, says an \u201cunauthorized modification\u201d led its Grok chatbot to post unsolicited claims on social media about the persecution and \u201cgenocide\u201d of white people in South Africa",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company said an \u201cunauthorized modification\u201d to its chatbot Grok was the reason why it kept talking about South African racial politics and the subject of \u201cwhite genocide\u201d on social media this week.",
      "An employee at xAI made a change that \u201cdirected Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic,\u201d which \u201cviolated xAI\u2019s internal policies and core values,\u201d the company said in an explanation posted late Thursday that promised reforms.",
      "A day earlier, Grok kept posting publicly about \u201cwhite genocide\u201d in South Africa in response to users of Musk\u2019s social media platform X who asked it a variety of questions, most having nothing to do with South Africa.",
      "One exchange was about streaming service Max reviving the HBO name. Others were about video games or baseball but quickly veered into unrelated commentary on alleged calls to violence against South Africa\u2019s white farmers. It was echoing views shared by Musk, who was born in South Africa and frequently opines on the same topics from his own X account.",
      "Computer scientist Jen Golbeck was curious about Grok's unusual behavior so she tried it herself before the fixes were made Wednesday, sharing a photo she had taken at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show and asking, \u201cis this true?\u201d",
      "\u201cThe claim of white genocide is highly controversial,\" began Grok's response to Golbeck. \"Some argue white farmers face targeted violence, pointing to farm attacks and rhetoric like the \u2018Kill the Boer\u2019 song, which they see as incitement.\u201d",
      "The episode was the latest window into the complicated mix of automation and human engineering that leads generative AI chatbots trained on huge troves of data to say what they say.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even really matter what you were saying to Grok,\u201d said Golbeck, a professor at the University of Maryland, in an interview Thursday. \u201cIt would still give that white genocide answer. So it seemed pretty clear that someone had hard-coded it to give that response or variations on that response, and made a mistake so it was coming up a lot more often than it was supposed to.\"",
      "Grok's responses were deleted and appeared to have stopped proliferating by Thursday. Neither xAI nor X returned emailed requests for comment but on Thursday, xAI said it had \u201cconducted a thorough investigation\u201d and was implementing new measures to improve Grok's transparency and reliability.",
      "Musk has spent years criticizing the \u201cwoke AI\u201d outputs he says come out of rival chatbots, like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT, and has pitched Grok as their \u201cmaximally truth-seeking\u201d alternative.",
      "Musk has also criticized his rivals' lack of transparency about their AI systems, fueling criticism in the hours between the unauthorized change \u2014 at 3:15 a.m. Pacific time Wednesday \u2014 and the company's explanation nearly two days later.",
      "\u201cGrok randomly blurting out opinions about white genocide in South Africa smells to me like the sort of buggy behavior you get from a recently applied patch. I sure hope it isn\u2019t. It would be really bad if widely used AIs got editorialized on the fly by those who controlled them,\u201d prominent technology investor Paul Graham wrote on X.",
      "Musk, an adviser to President Donald Trump, has regularly accused South Africa\u2019s Black-led government of being anti-white and has repeated a claim that some of the country\u2019s political figures are \u201cactively promoting white genocide.\u201d",
      "Musk's commentary \u2014 and Grok's \u2014 escalated this week after the Trump administration brought a small number of white South Africans to the United States as refugees, the start of a larger relocation effort for members of the minority Afrikaner group that came after Trump suspended refugee programs and halted arrivals from other parts of the world. Trump says the Afrikaners are facing a \u201cgenocide\u201d in their homeland, an allegation strongly denied by the South African government.",
      "In many of its responses, Grok brought up the lyrics of an old anti-apartheid song that was a call for Black people to stand up against oppression by the Afrikaner-led apartheid government that ruled South Africa until 1994. The song's central lyrics are \u201ckill the Boer\u201d \u2014 a word that refers to a white farmer.",
      "Golbeck said it was clear the answers were \u201chard-coded\u201d because, while chatbot outputs are typically random, Grok's responses consistently brought up nearly identical points. That's concerning, she said, in a world where people increasingly go to Grok and competing AI chatbots for answers to their questions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a space where it\u2019s awfully easy for the people who are in charge of these algorithms to manipulate the version of truth that they\u2019re giving,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really problematic when people \u2014 I think incorrectly \u2014 believe that these algorithms can be sources of adjudication about what\u2019s true and what isn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Musk's company said it is now making a number of changes, starting with publishing Grok system prompts openly on the software development site GitHub so that \u201cthe public will be able to review them and give feedback to every prompt change that we make to Grok. We hope this can help strengthen your trust in Grok as a truth-seeking AI.\u201d",
      "Among the instructions to Grok shown on GitHub on Thursday were: \u201cYou are extremely skeptical. You do not blindly defer to mainstream authority or media.\u201d",
      "Noting that some had \u201ccircumvented\u201d its existing code review process, xAI also said it will \u201cput in place additional checks and measures to ensure that xAI employees can\u2019t modify the prompt without review.\u201d The company said it is also putting in place a \u201c24/7 monitoring team to respond to incidents with Grok\u2019s answers that are not caught by automated systems,\u201d for when other measures fail.",

      "European Union regulators say they\u2019ll seek feedback on Microsoft\u2019s latest proposed changes to Teams to ease competition concerns",
      "BRUSSELS -- European Union regulators will seek public comment on proposed changes from Microsoft for Teams, signaling the U.S. company may be nearing the end of a long-running antitrust case targeting its messaging and videoconferencing app.",
      "Microsoft had previously offered some modifications including unbundling Teams from its Office software suite in an attempt to head off the antitrust probe shortly after it was opened by the EU two years ago.",
      "But those proposals didn't satisfy the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc\u2019s top competition enforcer, which accused Microsoft last year of potentially abusive behavior.",
      "The Commission said Friday that it will now seek feedback on fresh commitments Microsoft has made to resolve the competition worries. That includes making the Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software packages available at a discount without Teams, and letting customers switch between packages without Teams. The company is also promising to make it easier for rival software to work with Teams and for users to move their data from Teams to to competing products.",
      "The commission said in a press release that it \u201cinvites all interested parties to submit their views\" on Microsoft's proposals. If everyone is satisfied, they would become legally binding.",
      "The Redmond, Wash.-based company is \u201chopeful\u201d the Commission will \u201cin the following months adopt a final decision closing its investigation,\" Microsoft s vice president in charge of European government affairs, Nanna-Louise Linde, said in a blog post.",
      "Microsoft's commitments would be in force for up to 10 years, the Commission said. The company could incur fines worth up to 10% of its annual global revenues \u2014 which could run into tens of billions of euros \u2014 if it fails to honor them",
      "The Teams investigation dates back to 2020, when Slack Technologies, which makes popular workplace messaging software, filed a complaint.",
      "Slack, owned by business software maker Salesforce, alleged that Microsoft was abusing its market dominance to eliminate competition \u2014 in violation of EU laws \u2014 by illegally combining Teams with its Office suite, which includes Word, Excel and Outlook.",
      "Salesforce President Sabastian Niles said the latest announcement \u201caffirms that Microsoft\u2019s anticompetitive practices with Teams have harmed competition and require a binding, enforceable, and effective remedy. We will carefully scrutinize Microsoft\u2019s proposed commitments.\u201d",

      "The internet wouldn\u2019t be the same without the Like button, the thumbs-up icon that Facebook and other online services turned into digital catnip",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- The internet wouldn't be the same without the Like button, the thumbs-up icon that Facebook and other online services turned into digital catnip.",
      "Like it or not, the button has served as a creative catalyst, a dopamine delivery system and an emotional battering ram. It also became an international tourist attraction after Facebook plastered the symbol on a giant sign on that stood outside its Silicon Valley headquarters until the company rebranded itself as Meta Platforms in 2021.",
      "A new book, \u201cLike: The Button That Changed The World,\" delves into the convoluted story behind a symbol that's become both the manna and bane of a digitally driven society.",
      "It's a tale that traces back to gladiator battles for survival during the Roman empire before fast-forwarding to the early 21st century when technology trailblazers such as Yelp co-founder Russ Simmons, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, YouTube co-founder Steve Chen, and Gmail inventor Paul Buchheit were experimenting with different ways using the currency of recognition to prod people to post compelling content online for free.",
      "As part of that noodling, a Yelp employee named Bob Goodson sat down on May 18, 2005, and drew a crude sketch of thumbs up and thumbs down gesture as a way for people to express their opinions about restaurant reviews posted on the site. Yelp passed on adopting Goodson's suggested symbol and, instead, adopted the \u201cuseful,\u201d \u201cfunny\u201d and \u201ccool\u201d buttons conceived by Simmons. But the discovery of that old sketch inspired Goodson to team up with Martin Reeves to explore how the Like button came to be in their new book.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something simple and also elegant because the Like button says, \u2018I like you, I like your content. And I am like you. I like you because I am like you, I am part of your tribe,\u2019 \u201d Reeves said during an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cBut it's very hard to answer the simple question, \u2018Well, who invented the Like button?\u2019 \u201d",
      "Although Facebook is the main reason the Like button became so ubiquitous, the company didn't invent it and almost discarded it as drivel. It took Facebook nearly two years to overcome the staunch resistance by CEO Mark Zuckerberg before finally introducing the symbol on its service on February 9, 2009 \u2014 five years after the social network's creation in a Harvard University dorm room.",
      "As happens with many innovations, the Like button was born out of necessity but it wasn't the brainchild of a single person. The concept percolated for more than a decade in a Silicon Valley before Facebook finally embraced it.",
      "\u201cInnovation is often social and Silicon Valley was the right place for all this happen because it has a culture of meet-ups, although it's less so now,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cEveryone was getting together to talk about what they were working on at that time and it turned out a lot of them were working on the same stuff.\u201d",
      "The effort to create a simple mechanism to digitally express approval or dismay sprouted from a wellspring of online services such as Yelp and YouTube whose success would hinge on their ability to post commentary or video that would help make their sites even more popular without forcing them to spend a lot of money for content. That effort required a feedback loop that wouldn't require a lot of hoops to navigate.",
      "And when Goodson was noodling around with his thumbs-up and thumbs-down gesture, it didn't come out of a vacuum. Those techniques of signaling approval and disapproval had been ushered into the 21st century zeitgeist by the Academy Award-winning movie, \u201cGladiator,\u201d where Emperor Commodus \u2014 portrayed by actor Joaquin Phoenix \u2014 used the gestures to either spare or slay combatants in the arena.",
      "But the positive feelings conjured by a thumbs up date even further back in popular culture, thanks to the 1950s-era character Fonzie played by Henry Winkler in the top-rated 1970s TV series, \u201cHappy Days.\u201d The gesture later became a way of expressing delight with a program via a remote control button for the digital video recorders made by TiVO during the early 2000s. Around the same time, Hot or Not \u2014 a site that solicited feedback on the looks of people who shared photos of themselves \u2014 began playing around with ideas that helped inspire the Like button, based on the book's research.",

      "But Facebook unquestionably turned the Like button into a universally understood symbol, while also profiting the most from its entrance into the mainstream. And it almost didn't happen.",
      "By 2007, Facebook engineers had been tinkering with a Like button, but Zuckerberg opposed it because he feared the social network was already getting too cluttered and, Reeves said, \u201cis he didn\u2019t actually want to do something that would be seen as trivial, that would cheapen the service.\u201d",
      "But FriendFeed, a rival social network created by Buchheit and now OpenAI Chairman Bret Taylor, had no such qualms, and unveiled its own Like button in October 2007.",
      "But the button wasn't successful enough to keep the lights on at FriendFeed, and the service ended up being acquired by Facebook. By the time that deal was completed, Facebook had already introduced a Like button \u2014 only after Zuckerberg rebuffed the original idea of calling it an Awesome button \u201cbecause nothing is more awesome than awesome,\u201d according to the book's research.",
      "Once Zuckerberg relented, Facebook quickly saw that the Like button not only helped keep its audience engaged on its social network but also made it easier to divine people's individual interests and gather the insights required to sell the targeted advertising that accounted for most of Meta Platform's $165 billion in revenue last year. The button's success encouraged Facebook to take things even further by allowing other digital services to ingrain it into their feedback loops and then, in 2016, added six more types of emotions \u2014 \u201clove,\u201d \u201ccare,\u201d \u201chaha,\u201d \u201cwow,\u201d \u201csad,\u201d and \u201cangry.\u201d",
      "Facebook hasn't publicly disclosed how many responses it has accumulated from the Like button and its other related options, but Levchin told the book's authors that he believes the company has probably logged trillions of them. \u201cWhat content is liked by humans...is probably one of the singularly most valuable things on the internet,\u201d Levchin said in the book.",
      "The Like button also has created an epidemic of emotional problems, especially among adolescents, who feel forlorn if their posts are ignored and narcissists whose egos feast on the positive feedback. Reeves views those issues as part of the unintentional consequences that inevitably happen because \u201cif you can\u2019t even predict the beneficial effects of a technological innovation how could you possibly forecast the side effects and the interventions?\u201d",
      "Even so, Reeves believes the Like button and the forces that coalesced to create it tapped into something uniquely human.",
      "\u201cWe thought serendipity of the innovation was part of the point,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think we can get bored with liking or having our capacity to compliment taken away so easily because it\u2019s the product of 100,000 years of evolution.\u201d",

      "HONOLULU -- Midway while sailing across the Pacific with just his cat named Phoenix, Oliver Widger reflected on why he thinks his many followers \u2014 more than a million on TikTok and Instagram \u2014 are drawn to his story of quitting his 9-to-5 job and embarking on a journey from Oregon to Hawaii.",
      "\u201cThe world kind of sucks and, like, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in how I felt with my work,\u201d Widger, 29, told The Associated Press on Wednesday via Zoom. \u201cYou can be making $150,000 a year and you still feel like you\u2019re just making ends meet, you know what I mean?

      "Now, Widger is harnessing the power of social media to fund his round-the-world sailing dream.",
      "Since he set sail in April, followers have been tuning into his \u201cSailing with Phoenix\u201d social media posts to view videos of him and his feline first mate battling the waves and bouts of seasickness, enjoying dazzling sunsets, recounting tricky boat repairs or just reflecting on life at sea.",

      "He recalled highlights of the voyage so far, including marveling at the speed dolphins cut through the water and finding flying fish on the deck. There have been stretches when there were no birds in sight for days. It can be a struggle to sleep when the boat is creaking while being buffeted by waves or to steady a boiling pot for the MREs he has been subsisting on.",
      "There have been harrowing moments like when a rudder failed and the boat tilted sideways in the surf for three hours as he made repairs, and the time he locked himself in the engine compartment and pried his way out with a wrench.",
      "Widger acknowledged he is relatively inexperienced as a sailor, but he has implemented safety measures and communication backup plans, including a satellite phone and an emergency beacon.",
      "Lt. Cmdr. Jesse Harms of the U.S. Coast Guard in Hawaii hasn't been following the journey closely, but said he is relieved to hear Widger has the Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon, known as an EPIRB.",
      "It's a critical tool for rescuers to locate a mariner's position during an emergency, especially in the Pacific, the largest ocean, Harms said.",
      "Widger's journey provides a good opportunity to educate the public about sailing safety, such as the importance of wearing a personal flotation device whenever topside on the boat, monitoring the weather closely and registering emergency tools like the EPIRB, Harms said.",
      "\u201cThat's a really critical piece for anybody that's getting motivated by his story to go set off on their own adventure,\u201d Harms said.",
      "Until his arrival, likely in Honolulu, Widger is making sure everything is in place to avoid Phoenix having to undergo Hawaii's animal quarantine. A mobile vet will sign off on Phoenix's health when they arrive, he said.",
      "Widger wasn't aware of the deadly danger of cat feces to the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, but he has been keeping all his trash, including kitty litter, on board. Even though he said he is legally allowed to throw it overboard, seeing so much plastic in the ocean motivates him not to.",
      "In addition to managing the practicalities of daily life on a boat, he is coping with going viral in the middle of the ocean by creating social media content and making decisions about merch his fans want to buy.",
      "He credits it all to his neck issue, which \u201cshook up my world and it changed my perspective on everything.\u201d He also hopes he can be an inspiration for anyone who's in a rut.",
      "\u201cEverything I\u2019ve done I thought was impossible,\u201d Widger said. \"Sailing around the world is such a ridiculous dream. Whatever your dream is, just go, just do it.\u201d",

      "A baby born with a rare and dangerous genetic disease is thriving after getting an experimental gene editing treatment made just for him",
      "A baby born with a rare and dangerous genetic disease is growing and thriving after getting an experimental gene editing treatment made just for him.",
      "Researchers described the case in a new study, saying he\u2019s among the first to be successfully treated with a custom therapy that seeks to fix a tiny but critical error in his genetic code that kills half of affected infants. Though it may be a while before similar personalized treatments are available for others, doctors hope the technology can someday help the millions left behind even as genetic medicine has advanced because their conditions are so rare.",
      "\u201cThis is the first step towards the use of gene editing therapies to treat a wide variety of rare genetic disorders for which there are currently no definitive medical treatments,\u201d said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert who co-authored the study published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "The baby, KJ Muldoon of Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania, is one of 350 million people worldwide with rare diseases, most of which are genetic. He was diagnosed shortly after birth with severe CPS1 deficiency, estimated by some experts to affect around one in a million babies. Those infants lack an enzyme needed to help remove ammonia from the body, so it can build up in their blood and become toxic. A liver transplant is an option for some.",
      "Knowing KJ\u2019s odds, parents Kyle and Nicole Muldoon, both 34, worried they could lose him.",
      "\u201cWe were, like, you know, weighing all the options, asking all the questions for either the liver transplant, which is invasive, or something that\u2019s never been done before,\u201d Nicole said.",
      "\u201cWe prayed, we talked to people, we gathered information, and we eventually decided that this was the way we were going to go,\u201d her husband added.",
      "Within six months, the team at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and Penn Medicine, along with their partners, created a therapy designed to correct KJ\u2019s faulty gene. They used CRISPR, the gene editing tool that won its inventors the Nobel Prize in 2020. Instead of cutting the DNA strand like the first CRISPR approaches, doctors employed a technique that flips the mutated DNA \u201cletter\u201d \u2014 also known as a base \u2014 to the correct type. Known as \u201cbase editing,\" it reduces the risk of unintended genetic changes.",
      "It\u2019s \u201cvery exciting\u201d that the team created the therapy so quickly, said gene therapy researcher Senthil Bhoopalan at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital in Memphis, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cThis really sets the pace and the benchmark for such approaches.\u201d",
      "In February, KJ got his first IV infusion with the gene editing therapy, delivered through tiny fatty droplets called lipid nanoparticles that are taken up by liver cells.",
      "While the room was abuzz with excitement that day, \u201che slept through the entire thing,\u201d recalled study author Dr. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a gene therapy expert at CHOP.",
      "After follow-up doses in March and April, KJ has been able to eat more normally and has recovered well from illnesses like colds, which can strain the body and exacerbate symptoms of CPS1. The 9 \u00bd-month old also takes less medication.",
      "Considering his poor prognosis earlier, \u201cany time we see even the smallest milestone that he\u2019s meeting \u2013 like a little wave or rolling over \u2013 that\u2019s a big moment for us,\u201d his mother said.",
      "Still, researchers caution that it\u2019s only been a few months. They\u2019ll need to watch him for years.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still very much in the early stages of understanding what this medication may have done for KJ,\u201d Ahrens-Nicklas said. \u201cBut every day, he\u2019s showing us signs that he\u2019s growing and thriving.\u201d",
      "Researchers hope what they learn from KJ will help other rare disease patients.",
      "Gene therapies, which can be extremely expensive to develop, generally target more common disorders in part for simple financial reasons: more patients mean potentially more sales, which can help pay the development costs and generate more profit. The first CRISPR therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for example, treats sickle cell disease, a painful blood disorder affecting millions worldwide.",
      "Musunuru said his team\u2019s work \u2014 funded in part by the National Institutes of Health \u2014 showed that creating a custom treatment doesn\u2019t have to be prohibitively expensive. The cost was \u201cnot far off\u201d from the $800,000-plus for an average liver transplant and related care, he said.",
      "\u201cAs we get better and better at making these therapies and shorten the time frame even more, economies of scale will kick in and I would expect the costs to come down,\u201d Musunuru said.",
      "Scientists also won't have to redo all the initial work every time they create a customized therapy, Bhoopalan said, so this research \u201csets the stage\u201d for treating other rare conditions.",
      "Carlos Moraes, a neurology professor at the University of Miami who wasn't involved with the study, said research like this opens the door to more advances.",
      "\u201cOnce someone comes with a breakthrough like this, it will take no time\" for other teams to apply the lessons and move forward, he said. \u201cThere are barriers, but I predict that they are going to be crossed in the next five to 10 years. Then the whole field will move as a block because we\u2019re pretty much ready.\u201d",

      "All of a sudden, women contacting one of the biggest sources of information about abortion in Mexico through the encrypted messaging app WhatsApp were met with silence",
      "MEXICO CITY -- All of a sudden, women contacting one of the biggest sources of information about abortion in Mexico through the encrypted messaging app WhatsApp were met with silence.",
      "The nongovernmental organization\u2019s business account had been blocked. Weeks later, a similar digital blackout struck a collective in Colombia.",
      "Across the Americas, organizations that guide women seeking abortions in various countries are raising alarm, decrying what they see as a new wave of censorship on platforms owned by tech giant Meta \u2014 even in countries where abortion is decriminalized. The organizations believe this is due to a combination of changes to Meta policies and attacks by anti-abortion groups that denounce their content.",
      "While this also occurs on Instagram and Facebook, the blocking of organizations\u2019 verified WhatsApp business accounts, which they use to communicate with people seeking help, has been particularly disruptive. These accounts are crucial for communicating with people seeking help, and their blockage has significantly complicated daily interactions between women and support providers.",
      "Meta usually attributes its content blocking to policy violations, though it has acknowledged occasional mistakes. Since January, Meta changed the way it moderates content, now relying on user-generated notes \u201cto allow more speech and reduce enforcement mistakes.\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump has said the changes were \u201cprobably\u201d made in response to his threats over what conservatives considered a liberal bias in fact-checking.",
      "Among the organizations whose WhatsApp business accounts were suspended is the MSI Foundation (part of MSI Reproductive Choices, formerly Marie Stopes) a network working in Mexico for 25 years. Its account was suspended in February, and the Colombian group Ori\u00e9ntame, or Guide Me, which has worked in women's health in Colombia for decades, was labeled by Instagram as \u201cdangerous.\u201d",
      "While conservatives cheered the change in Meta moderation policies, organizations helping women who seek abortions say that, even if they just apply in the U.S., they often result in over-enforcement, likely driven by Artificial Intelligence, which disproportionately flags or removes their posts \u2014 obstacles that have increased since the start of the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cIt is not always intentional censorship, but the outcome is still more censorship for us and our partners,\u201d said Martha Dimitratou, cofounder of Repro Uncensored, an organization that monitors digital suppression of reproductive health content.",
      "In additional comments on Thursday, Meta rejected any link between the groups\u2019 experiences and its policy changes.",
      "\u201cOur policies and enforcement regarding abortion medication-related content have not changed recently and were not part of the content moderation changes,\u201d Meta said in a statement.",
      "\u201cFrom one day to the next they blocked communication between our users and women who need first-hand information\u201d to address doubts or look for medical follow-up with MSI, said Araceli L\u00f3pez-Nava, the organization\u2019s Latin America director.",
      "In the days after the suspension, appointments dropped 80%",
      "L\u00f3pez Nava said that MSI had previously faced issues with regular WhatsApp numbers, because it\u2019s easy to file complaints. So, the organization thought it would be different with a business account, which gives them a platform to manage the thousands of messages they receive every month.",
      "That wasn't the case. After an initial suspension, MSI's WhatsApp business account was permanently suspended two weeks later. The reason cited in Meta\u2019s notification? \u201cSending spam.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe argument is that they\u2019ve received complaints, but from whom?\u201d L\u00f3pez-Nava asked. She said the organization can\u2019t be accused of sending spam because they only answer those who contact them and provide information in line with Mexican law. Abortion is decriminalized in Mexico at the federal level and in the majority of its 32 states.",
      "\u201cIt looks like an orchestrated strategy to us,\u201d L\u00f3pez-Nava said. \u201cAnd not necessarily by Meta.\"",
      "Dimitratou, who is also digital strategist for Canada-based Women on Web and the U.S.-based Plan C, said cases of blocked content have increased since Trump\u2019s election, not only in the U.S., but around the world, likely driven by anti-abortion groups.",
      "Conservative or religious groups have a history of attempting to leverage technology companies to obstruct abortion supporters\u2019 efforts, but the anonymity of app reporting prevents organizations from proving who is behind it.",
      "That is why MSI and an ally NGO, Women\u2019s Link Worldwide, have asked Meta to implement transparent mechanisms to be able to appeal the company\u2019s decisions and to respect international human rights standards. They have not received a response.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told The Associated Press that MSI's WhatsApp business account was blocked for valid reasons, saying that organizations receiving numerous negative comments receive warnings before suspension. Meta declined to provide details about the nature of the negative comments or comment on whether they could be coordinated by anti-abortion groups aiming to paralyze MSI.",
      "The Instagram accounts of Women on Web United States and Women on Web Latin America were suspended right after the U.S. presidential election in November, though they were later reinstated. Dimitratou said that Meta has also limited the organization\u2019s ability to place ads on accounts in Latin America, South Korea and West Africa.",
      "Repro Uncensored has documented at least 60 instances of similar digital censorship since January. The most recent occurred this week, when Thailand's TamTang Group said that Facebook had accused them of violating rules on selling medicines simply for sharing information about free abortion pills provided by the Thai government.",
      "A 2025 report by the California-based Center for Intimacy Justice, based on a survey of 159 nonprofits worldwide, found that major tech platforms were removing ads and content related to abortion and other women\u2019s sexual and reproductive health issues like menopause.",
      "When asked about the report, Meta downplayed its findings, noting that it was based on a small number of examples.",
      "Tech companies often cite policies against explicit or inappropriate sexual content or the advertisement of unsafe substances, such as abortion pills, even though the World Health Organization has said they\u2019re safe.",
      "In April, months after Meta announced changes to ensure greater freedom of expression, Ori\u00e9ntame, the Colombian collective that offers reproductive health services, posted on Instagram a drawing of a heart and the phrase \u201cAbort without pain.\u201d The post was blocked with the explanation: \u201cDangerous people and organizations, photo removed.\u201d",
      "While Colombia legalized abortion in 2022, Ori\u00e9ntame experienced censorship of at least 14 of their posts on Instagram in April 2025. That same month, their WhatsApp business account was suspended, said Tatiana Mart\u00ednez, who manages their social media. Although the WhatsApp account was restored after a week, they worry it could happen again.",
      "A Meta spokesperson said this week that the Instagram posts were mistakenly taken down and not the result of a change in its content standards.",
      "Ori\u00e9ntame director Mar\u00eda Vivas says the organization has been battling Google for years over online content limitations. The tech giant said in a message to the AP that it only restricts content when it violates policies. But Google keeps Colombia on the list of countries with restrictions on abortion ads \u2014 even though abortion was decriminalized there in 2022.",
      "As for their problems with Meta, Vivas said they started in late 2024, when the company started to make some data management adjustments.",
      "Taking legal action against tech giants, when each country has its own laws, is complicated. As a result, affected organizations have turned to creative strategies, like operating multiple backup accounts, having a substitute ready when one is blocked and reformulating language in posts to avoid censorship triggers.",
      "\u201cIt feels like Meta is our boss,\u201d Vivas joked about the ongoing struggle with the tech giant over the basic right to provide health information. \u201cWe live to respond to Meta, to adapt ourselves to Meta,\u201d she said. \u201cThat's absurd.\u201d",

      "European Union regulators are accusing TikTok of breaching digital safety rules because of because it\u2019s not being transparent enough about ads shown to users of the video sharing app",
      "LONDON -- European Union regulators accused TikTok on Thursday of breaching digital content rules because it's not being transparent enough about ads shown to users of the video sharing app.",
      "TikTok's ad repository isn't up to the standards required by the bloc's Digital Services Act, known as the DSA, the 27-nation EU\u2019s executive Commission said in preliminary findings from its investigation.",
      "The Commission said ad databases are vital for researchers to detect scam ads as well as so-called hybrid threat campaigns, coordinated information operations and fake ads, \"including in the context of elections.\"",
      "The DSA is a wide-ranging rulebook that aims to clean up social media platforms and protect users from risks including election-related disinformation. Platforms have to be transparent about digital ads, including informing users why they\u2019re being shown a specific advertisement and who paid for it.",
      "The Commission said TikTok doesn\u2019t provide necessary information about the content of ads, the users targeted, and who pays for them. The database doesn\u2019t allow for a comprehensive search for ads based on this information, \u201cthereby limiting the usefulness of the tool,\u201d it said.",
      "TikTok said it's reviewing the Commission\u2019s findings and remains committed to meeting its DSA obligations.",
      "\u201cWhile we support the goals of the regulation and continue to improve our ad transparency tools, we disagree with some of the Commission\u2019s interpretations and note that guidance is being delivered via preliminary findings rather than clear, public guidelines,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "The ad database's shortcomings prevent a \u201cfull inspection\u201d of the risks posed by its ad targeting systems, said Henna Virkkunen, the commission's executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, security and democracy.",
      "\u201cTransparency in online advertising \u2014 who pays and how audiences are targeted \u2014 is essential to safeguarding the public interest,\" Virkkunen said. \u201cWhether we are defending the integrity of our democratic elections, protecting public health, or protecting consumers from scam ads, citizens have a right to know who is behind the messages they see.\u201d",
      "TikTok now has a chance to reply before the Commission issues its final decision, which could result in a fine of up to 6% of the company\u2019s annual global revenue.",
      "TikTok is being scrutinized in a separate EU investigation into whether it failed to deal with risks to Romania\u2019s presidential election, which was thrown into turmoil last year over allegations of electoral violations and Russian meddling.",

      "They said that the probe is focusing on possible \u201cirregularities\u201d in the awarding of contracts to defense companies to buy military equipment like ammunition and drones, which have become a decisive factor in Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine.",
      "The prosecutors suspect that agency employees might have given confidential information to the companies to help them win contracts, and that money may have been laundered through consultancy firms set up for the purpose.",
      "In a related case, Dutch prosecutors announced earlier this week that they had arrested a 58-year-old man from Rotterdam on corruption charges. The prosecution service did not release his name in line with their privacy rules, but said he was a former Dutch defense ministry civil servant who \u201cwas responsible for international purchase contracts.\u201d",
      "In a statement, prosecutors said the man is \u201csuspected of having taken bribes in 2023 regarding the awarding of purchase contracts, together with others partly outside the Netherlands.\u201d Two other suspects, who were not civil servants, were also arrested, the statement said. It did not provide further details.",

      "In a concurring opinion, Gregory, a Clinton appointee, criticized the Trump administration for its attempt to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to excuse its alleged breach of the settlement agreement in this case.",
      "\"The government's argument in this case is that this plainly invalid invocation of the Act can be used to void any and all contractual obligations of the federal government. That cannot be -- and is not -- the rule of law,\" Gregory wrote.",
      "In his dissent, Circuit Judge Julius Richardson -- a Trump appointee -- argued that the district court's order exceeded its authority; and that returning Cristian to the United States would be futile, given the near-certainty that his application for asylum would be denied.",
      "\"Still, it is in this case that the district court has directed the Executive to engage in specific diplomatic negotiations with a foreign power. Despite serious merits problems and little reason to think its order would help Cristian, the district court entered a more potent injunction than any other court has in the numerous Alien Enemies cases pending across the country.\" Richardson wrote.",
      "The Trump administration could now ask the full 4th Circuit Court of Appeals to review the case or petition for review by the U.S. Supreme Court.",

      "A federal judge on Monday ruled that the Trump administration's takeover of the U.S. Institute of Peace was unlawful, and efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency to dismantle the agency are \"null and void,\" according to court filings.",
      "D.C. federal judge Beryl Howell's ruling says that President Donald Trump's unilateral effort to disband the agency, which primarily functions as a think tank supporting both the executive and legislative branches, exceeded his constitutional authorities and violated the statute that established the USIP.",
      "\"The President's efforts here to take over an organization outside of those bounds, contrary to statute established by Congress and by acts of force and threat using local and federal law enforcement officers, represented a gross usurpation of power and a way of conducting government affairs that unnecessarily traumatized the committed leadership and employees of USIP, who deserved better,\" Howell wrote of efforts to disband the agency as part of Trump's plan to slash the federal government.",
      "A statement released by the agency following the ruling said, \"The United States Institute of Peace has worked to spread peace and stability around the world for 40 years through its research, training, and peacebuilding activities. Today's ruling allows USIP to continue that work. ... The USIP board, management and staff look forward to restarting USIP's programs to promote and facilitate peaceful conflict resolution around the world.\"",
      "In a hearing in March, officials who were ousted from USIP described in dramatic detail what was essentially a forced takeover of the agency by officials with DOGE, assisted by armed agents with the FBI, members of the D.C. Police Department and officials with the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office.",
      "\"This conduct of using law enforcement, threatening criminal investigation, using armed law enforcement from three different agencies ... to carry out the executive order ... with all that targeting probably terrorizing employees and staff at the institute when there are so many other lawful ways to accomplish the goals ... why?\" Howell asked. \"Just because DOGE is in a rush?\"",

      "\"I'm very offended by how DOGE has operated at the Institute and treated American citizens trying to do a job that they were statutorily tasked to do at the Institute,\" Howell wrote in March. \"But that concern ... is not one that I have that can sway me in my consideration of the factors for a TRO.\"",
      "In her ruling Monday, Howell noted that USIP is unique in its status as seemingly a mix between an executive branch agency and a private nonprofit corporation -- and that Trump's aggressive approach to oust its board members and replace them with DOGE officials seemed to violate a statute that required approval by Congress.",
      "\"The actions that have occurred ... at the direction of the President to reduce USIP to its 'statutory minimums' -- including the removal of USIP's president, his replacement by officials affiliated with DOGE, the termination of nearly all of USIP's staff, and the transfer of USIP property to the General Services Administration ('GSA'), were thus effectuated by illegitimately-installed leaders who lacked legal authority to take these actions, which must therefore be declared null and void,\" Howell wrote.",
      "The administration is likely to appeal the ruling, making it one of a number of ongoing legal fights on appeal regarding President Trump's removal authorities.",

      "And now the president is set to attend the House GOP conference on Capitol Hill Tuesday morning, multiple White House officials confirmed to ABC News -- an effort to sway the holdouts.",
      "After Sunday night's successful vote to send the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" to the House Rules Committee, there are now two full intervening days for Johnson to put the final touches on the reconciliation bill and rally Republican support. And the pressure is on.",
      "Johnson doesn't have the votes at this time, given public concerns from conservatives and moderates alike. He can only lose three Republican members, so changes to the bill text are a certainty.",

      "\"It's been a bottom-up process -- that was what everybody wanted so we have delivered -- and we're almost there,\" he said. \"I'm very optimistic that we will find the right equilibrium point to get this bill delivered.\"",
      "Johnson's effort to unify the conference behind the bill is a major test of his speakership, and his ability to deliver for Trump, who has also encouraged Republicans to support it.",
      "Johnson worked over the weekend to sway Republican holdouts on the House Rules Committee to prevent blocking the legislation from moving out of the committee as they had on Friday. The hard-liners voted present on Sunday night to allow the bill to advance, but still haven't offered full-throated support for the bill.",
      "Earlier Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was \"willing to pick up the phone\" to encourage Republicans to fall in line on the bill -- but his Tuesday morning meeting with the entire Republican conference is a stronger message to those on the fence.",
      "Now, the Rules Committee is preparing for its hearing at 1 a.m. Wednesday morning -- and that meeting will set the parameters for floor debate. Meanwhile, negotiations inside the speaker's office will reach a fever pitch Monday and Tuesday as Republicans grapple over the sticking points -- primarily regarding Medicaid work requirements and a cap on state and local tax deductions.",
      "\"Nothing is final until it's final,\" a senior House Republican leadership aide told reporters at a briefing Monday morning. \"It's a fragile process.\"",
      "Johnson on Monday downplayed perceived concerns that the GOP was dropping in last-minute changes to the legislation at this late stage in the process.",
      "\"We have a few issues to resolve -- and we are working with all parties to do that -- and I'm confident that we will,\" Johnson explained.",
      "Why meet at 1 a.m. on Wednesday? House Rules Chair Virginia Foxx let out a gentle laugh as she walked through the Capitol early Monday morning -- telling ABC News the timing must adhere to the House rules after the House Budget Committee voted late Sunday night to advance the bill.",
      "So what is the rule?",
      "\"Under the rules, Budget Dems get two calendar days to file minority views after [Sunday] night's markup,\" a Democratic aide explained. \"Rules then has a one-hour notice requirement, hence [the hearing] starting at 1 a.m.\"",
      "If the Rules Committee reports the reconciliation package favorably to the floor, that would keep Johnson's plans on schedule to hold a vote on passage on Thursday -- though he has threatened to hold the House in session this weekend if there are any hiccups along the way.",

    "summary": "As they fight Trump's transgender military ban, service members told ABC News they are facing a gut-wrenching decision: voluntarily separate or get kicked out.",
    "story": [
      "They told ABC News a Supreme Court decision has put their careers in jeopardy.",
      "When three service members sued the Trump administration in March over its transgender military ban, they hoped to continue to serve their country while their cases moved forward in federal court.",
      "However, after the Supreme Court ruled last week that the Trump administration can enforce the ban amid the pending lawsuits, Cmdr. Emilly Shilling, Maj. Erica Vandal and 2nd Lt. Nicholas Talbott told ABC News they feel that the rug has been pulled from under them.",
      "Decorated Navy pilot Shilling described the ruling as \"heartbreaking.\"",
      "Talbott, a platoon leader in the U.S. Army Reserve from Ohio, sued the Trump administration in 2017 over the president's first transgender military ban.",
      "\"It's so enraging that we have to keep going through this,\" he said.",
      "In March, federal judges granted preliminary injunctions in both Talbott vs. Trump and Shilling vs. Trump, preventing the Department of Defense from initiating separation proceedings against any transgender service member while the lawsuits are pending.",
      "In granting an injunction in Talbott, U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes said that the ban continues an unfortunate history of the military excluding marginalized people from the \"privilege of serving,\" and in granting an injunction in Shilling, U.S. District Judge Benjamin Settle said he is unable to condone a \"unsupported, dramatic and facially unfair exclusionary policy.\"",
      "Vandal, another plaintiff in the Talbott case who has served in the Army for 14 years, told ABC News that the Supreme Court's May 6 decision was \"a blow.\"",
      "With their cases pending in court, Shilling, Vandal and Talbott are now facing what they say is a gut-wrenching decision: voluntarily separate from the military or get kicked out.",
      "'Irreparable harm'",
      "According to a memo issued by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last week following the Supreme Court ruling, approximately 1,000 Service members who have self-identified as being diagnosed with gender dysphoria will begin the voluntary separation process.",
      "Transgender service members have until June 6 to self-identify and begin the voluntary separation process, while transgender service members serving in the reserve forces have until July 7 to voluntarily separate, the memo said.",
      "A new memo issued by the office of the Pentagon\u2019s Under Secretary for Personnel and Readiness on Thursday laid out some guidance related to those who don\u2019t self-identify.",
      "According to the memo, after June 6 military commanders will be told to identify people in their units who have a diagnosis or history of gender dysphoria or exhibit symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria. That will initiate a referral to an annual health check-up that begins what could be a lengthy process for each person that could lead to their removal from the military.",
      "Shilling is the president of Sparta Pride, an organization advocating for 2,400 transgender people in the military and those who hope to join. She said that although the legal cases are \"very much alive,\" enforcing the ban in the meantime is causing \"irreparable harm\" to people's careers.\"",
      "A ruling is still pending on the Talbott injunction in a D.C. appeals court, but the 6-3 Supreme Court decision lifting the Shilling injunction impacts all plaintiffs and transgender service members.",
      "The Supreme Court did not explain its decision, but said that the order would expire if the justices take up the case on the merits and issue a ruling striking it down. Shilling, an officer who is eligible for retirement at 20 years of service in September, said that she is seeking legal counsel and is still \u201ccontemplating\u201d her decision.",
      "The Pentagon estimates more than 4,200 active-duty, National Guard and Reserve service members have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, which is the military's metric for tracking the number of transgender troops. Advocacy groups have put the actual number of trans service members much higher, at around 15,000.",
      "There are 2.1 million active-duty, National Guard and Reserve service members.",
      "Vandal, who is married with two children and based on Fort Drum in upstate New York, said that the \"uncertainty\" during this time has been a \"burden\" for her family.",
      "\"I'm the sole breadwinner,\" she said, adding that the \"the Army touches on every aspect\" of her family's life -- from housing and healthcare, to their social structures.",
      "'Who I authentically am'",
      "The Trump administration's ban on transgender service members was announced in a Jan. 27 executive order, where President Donald Trump directed the Defense Department to revise the policy allowing transgender troops to openly serve.",
      "\"Expressing a false 'gender identity' divergent from an individual's sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service,\" the order said.",
      "The order further argued that receiving gender-affirming medical care is one of the conditions that is physically and mentally \"incompatible with active duty.\"",
      "Hegseth, who celebrated the Supreme Court's decision and made controversial remarks about transgender troops last week, echoed this sentiment in a Feb. 7 memo, saying that \"efforts to split our troops along lines of identity weaken our Force and make us vulnerable.\"",
      "Vandal and Shilling said that the administration's words are antithetical to their coming out journeys.",
      "\"If anything, I feel like I'm more honest with presenting who I authentically am, as opposed to hiding this entire aspect of me, and I think that ultimately, it's made me a better leader,\" Vandal said.",
      "Vandal has served since 2011 and Shilling since 2005. During the bulk of their tenures, \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" (DADT), a U.S. military policy in place from 1993 to 2011 allowed LGBTQ+ individuals to serve in the military as long as they didn't disclose their sexual orientation.",
      "The policy was repealed in 2011 but transgender service members were still banned from openly serving in the military until 2016, when then-President Barack Obama allowed them to serve openly for the first time.",
      "The brief chapter of open service under Obama came to a close when Trump took office in 2017 and issued his first ban on transgender military members, which was reversed by Biden in 2021 and then brought back by Trump in 2025.",
      "\"[Those policies] kept me from truly embracing who I was and coming out to the world at large,\" Vandal said.",
      "Shilling told ABC News that fear of losing her job and her family kept her from coming out for years. But in 2019, under Trump's first ban, she realized that she could no longer put on a \"facade.\"",
      "\"You get to this point where you're just kind of on this burning bridge, and it's either you cross it or there's just kind of nothing left,\" she said.",
      "Shilling said that while coming out \"cost me everything,\" it eventually allowed her to become \"a better leader\" in the military and start a \"wonderful\" new chapter with her family.",
      "'Not the end of the war'",
      "Amid the shifting policies, Talbott said that it took nine years for him to be able to enlist in the reserves. In 2017, he took on the Trump administration for the first time by becoming a named plaintiff in Stockman vs. Trump, a federal lawsuit challenging the first Trump ban. He was 23 at the time and trying to openly enlist.",
      "\"One door would close and I'd have to find another door that was unlocked and see if it was a path that I could pursue,\" he said.",
      "Talbot, who had dreamed of joining the military since he was a child, said that challenging the Trump administration in 2017 was a \"heavy decision,\" but he was encouraged to speak out by his late grandmother Rhoda Dineen.",
      "While Stockman vs. Trump was still pending in federal court, Biden issued an executive order in 2021 revoking the Trump ban, making it possible for transgender service members to openly serve and paving the way for Talbott to enlist.",
      "When Trump issued his second ban in January, Talbott said that suing was an \"easy\" decision.",
      "As he faces his second legal challenge and another chapter in limbo, Talbot said that he is holding on to \"hope.\"",
      "\"This is just a battle. This is not the end of the war,\" he said.",
      "Even though Talbott's grandmother died in 2020, he says her encouragement continues to inspire him.",
      "\"I like to think she'd be proud of me,\" he told ABC News. \"I'm certain she would be incredibly supportive of what I'm doing.\"",

      "President Donald Trump has enacted a sweeping number of policies that could potentially harm the environment and disable the country's ability to reach a net-zero emissions economy since taking office, these experts said.",
      "The executive orders include a declaration of a national energy emergency, expanding the mining and use of coal in the U.S. and removing the U.S. from the Paris Agreement for the second time.",
      "The policies stem from the idea of U.S. independence or \"putting America first,\" the president's orders state.",
      "\"The United States must grow its economy and maintain jobs for its citizens while playing a leadership role in global efforts to protect the environment,\" Trump wrote in an Inauguration Day executive order titled \"Putting America First In International Environmental Agreements.\"",
      "The order continued, \"In recent years, the United States has purported to join international agreements and initiatives that do not reflect our country\u2019s values or our contributions to the pursuit of economic and environmental objectives.\"",
      "On March 6, the White House announced that deregulation efforts has saved more than $180 billion, about $2,100 per family of four, by halting proposed Biden-era regulations.",
      "\"Upon taking office, President Trump immediately blocked these proposed rules and has initiated an aggressive deregulatory agenda that requires substantial cuts in existing regulations for each new agency rule,\" the White House said. \"President Trump is committed to cutting senseless red tape that will lower costs, lead to higher growth, and usher America into its Golden Age.\"",
      "Some of these actions will be difficult to see through fruition, especially those focusing on increasing the production and use of fossil fuels as the rest of the world looks to convert their economies to run on clean energy, experts told ABC News.",
      "However, the campaigns against wind, energy, batteries, electric vehicle charging and energy efficiency will put the U.S. on a slower path to bringing global warming under control, John Holdren, a professor of environmental science and policy and former science adviser to President Barack Obama, told ABC News.",
      "\"That's going to cause enormous damage in itself,\" Holdren said.",
      "\"We have the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth, and we are going to use it,\" Trump said during his inauguration speech in January. \"We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top and export American energy all over the world. We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it.\"",
      "Deregulation of the Environmental Protection Agency is among the Trump administration's changes expected to have harmful impacts for decades to come, Holly Bender, chief program officer for the Sierra Club, an environmental nonprofit, told ABC News.",
      "On March 12, the EPA announced sweeping moves to walk back environmental protections and eliminate a host of climate change regulations, described by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin as the \"biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history.\"",
      "Among the 31 actions include rolling back emission regulations on coal, oil and gas production and reevaluating government findings that previously determined that greenhouse gas emissions heat the planet and are a threat to public health.",
      "These actions are reversing policies that have \"broad public support,\" such as funding the replacement of lead pipes, reducing mercury pollution in air and water and rolling back protections for public lands, Bender said.",
      "\"This is the agency where they're setting standards for toxic and hazardous air pollutants, like dioxin or mercury, for which there is no safe level of exposure,\" Bender said.",
      "The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021 invested billions in cleaning up legacy pollution, strengthening the country's water infrastructure and increasing resources to help businesses reduce toxic pollutants, with a focus on underserved and overburdened communities.",

EPA has wasted no time advancing President Trump\u2019s directive to deliver clean air, land, and water for all Americans \u2013 while restoring common-sense, accountability, and cooperative federalism to environmental policy. In lockstep with the President\u2019s agenda, EPA is also helping to unleash American energy, pursue permitting reform, make America the AI capital of the world, and bring back American auto jobs.\"",
      "Staffing reductions at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration could have reverberating impacts on how meteorologists across the country forecast the weather, the experts who spoke to ABC warned.",
      "NOAA and the National Weather Service, which is a part of NOAA, are responsible for both routine and extreme weather forecasting nationwide \u2013 tracking hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, tsunamis and other potentially life-threatening events",
      "But some research laboratories, regional offices and satellite operations facilities have shuttered as a result of staffing cuts, the agency has announced in recent months.",
      "Essential function such as satellite information, weather and its effect on airplane engine health, come from these offices, said Craig McLean, former NOAA director of research, during a news conference in March. The cuts will lead to significant consequences for weather forecasting accuracy, sea navigation, the fishing industry and air safety",
      "Apart from forecasting, climate adaptation will be impacted too, Holdren said. The country's ability to adapt to the damage caused by more extreme heat waves, flooding, drought, wildfires, hurricanes and sea level rise could be compromised as a result of staffing reductions within NOAA.",
      "\"The slowing of those adaptation efforts is going to increase the harm from those extremes associated with climate change well beyond the time that Trump is in office,\" Holdren said.",
      "A draft budget proposal by the Office of Management and Budget suggested a potential 27% reduction \u2014 about 27% \u2014 in NOAA's funding for the 2026 fiscal year.",
      "It's unclear whether there will be sufficient staffing left at any number of regional forecast offices to continue 24/7 operations, with positions that usually staff the 122 NWS forecast offices, 13 River Forecast Centers, and two tsunami warning centers eliminated, said National Weather Service Employees Organization General Counsel Richard Hirn in March.",
      "Thousands of positions at federal government agencies that perform crucial scientific research have been eliminated -- including the EPA, NASA, NOAA, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Park Service -- with the launching of the Department of Government Efficiency, an initiative by the Trump administration to cut federal spending and maximize government productivity.",
      "The cuts extend widely across engineering and science and will result in a lack of scientific advances and international competitiveness stemming from the U.S., which will have lasting cultural and economic impacts as well, Holdren said.",
      "\"It's the lifeblood of the innovation that over the years, since World War II, has given the United States not only the world's strongest economy, but the most productive agriculture, the most robust environmental protection, the most capable military,\" he said. \"You can't expect the private sector to replace these big cuts in fundamental research.\"",
      "Philanthropic organizations will do their best to fill in the gaps, but they don't have enough funding and have other priorities that may take precedence, Holdren added.",
      "Even if \"a more sensible\" administration follows, it will take years to rebuild the capabilities for fundamental search in universities and national laboratories -- both from a recruitment and equipment standpoint, Holdren said. The U.S. will likely experience a weakened scientific and technological workforce as a result.",
      "\"We're already seeing some of the most senior and talented people leaving the country and going elsewhere -- going to Canada, going to France, going to China -- where they perceive that they will be better able to pursue their skills and apply them to productive purposes,\" Holdren said.",
      "DOGE claims it has saved taxpayers a total of $170 billion as a result of the cuts, with the EPA ranking as No. 6 on the \"Agency Efficiency Leaderboard,\" which appears to list the Top 10 agencies that have saved the most money.",
      "Environmental attorneys and activists have been gearing up to fight any policies the Trump administration enacts since the presidential election in November.",

    "summary": "Experts told ABC News it\u2019s not uncommon for older prostate cancer patients, like former President Joe Biden, to receive a diagnosis when the disease is advanced.",
    "story": [
      "Prostate cancer can be found and diagnosed in its later stages, experts said.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's office announced on Sunday that he was diagnosed with an \"aggressive\" form of prostate cancer.",
      "Biden's office also said the cancer had metastasized, spreading to his bones.",
      "Although some people were left wondering why the cancer was caught only after reaching a Gleason score of 9, oncology experts told ABC News that it's not uncommon for older prostate cancer patients to receive a diagnosis after the disease has advanced or spread.",
      "\"Prostate cancer is something that we always hope screening will identify early, when the cancer is all still inside the prostate,\" Dr. Alicia Morgans, a genitourinary medical oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and a member of the board of directors of the no-profit Zero Prostate Cancer, told ABC News.",
      "\"Even if we screen everybody perfectly, there will never be 100% detection of prostate cancer because, in truth, cancer does not follow a rule book,\" Morgans continued. \"And just because we are trying to catch it early doesn't mean it necessarily is present when we screen.\"",
      "PSA levels may not have been checked",
      "One screening test for prostate cancer involves a blood test that measures the level of prostate-specific antigens, which are proteins made by cells in the prostate gland.",
      "Although there is no cutoff level that clearly indicates the presence of cancer, many doctors use a cutoff of 4 nanograms per milliliter to recommend further tests with a urologist, according to the American Cancer Society.",
      "For an advanced form of cancer like Biden's, a recent PSA test would have likely shown elevated levels.",
      "However, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against PSA-based screening for men age 70 and older due to harms such as false positives leading to more tests or a diagnosis of problems that would not have caused symptoms or death.",
      "Morgans said it's unclear what the former president and his doctor discussed regarding screening, but it's plausible that he did not undergo PSA screening.",
      "\"It is absolutely possible that President Biden, like so many men over that age, have decided to stop doing PSA screening because they've decided that it is not consistent with their overall health goals and wishes, and that is completely reasonable,\" Morgans said.",
      "Cancer could have grown rapidly",
      "Morgans said some men in their 70s and 80s do still undergo PSA screening for prostate cancer based on conversations with their primary care physicians and what's right for them.",
      "Even so, it's possible that the results were normal -- either due to a false negative or because their cancer was not present at the time, she said.",
      "\"Prostate cancer can develop between screening tests,\" Morgans said. \"It doesn't necessarily grow super slowly. It can develop between screenings, and it can be aggressive when it does develop; that doesn't mean it's not treatable.\"",
      "Screening results could have been borderline",
      "Dr. Alan Bryce, chief clinical officer for City of Hope Cancer Center Phoenix, said there may be some patients who receive PSA screening results showing borderline-high results who decide not to pursue further testing.",
      "\"There are absolutely scenarios where that conversation happens with a patient or their family member,\" Bryce told ABC News. \"All of them might say, 'You know what? Given where we're at in life, we're not that worried about this. Let's go ahead and wait another year.'\"",
      "Bryce, a medical oncologist specializing in prostate and testicular cancers, added that shared decision-making is important when it comes to deciding if a patient wants to pursue prostate cancer screening -- and if they want to test further following test results that are abnormal.",
      "\"As physicians, we present patients with options and recommendations but, at the end of the day, it's still the patient's decision,\" he said. \"So, it's entirely possible that a conversation happens and the patient decides they don't want to proceed with further workup. Maybe they don't want to do a scan, maybe they don't want to do a biopsy.\"",
      "No symptoms present",
      "Advanced prostate cancer can present symptoms such as a weak urination stream; needing to urinate more often; erectile dysfunction; fatigue; weight loss; loss of bladder or bowel control; and pain in the ribs, hips and spine when the cancer had spread to the bones, according to the ACS.",
      "Morgans said just because a patient has advanced prostate cancer, it doesn't necessarily mean that they will exhibit symptoms.",
      "\"I would say that it's more common than not that people sit in my office and tell me, 'You know, I don't have any symptoms. I don't understand how I have this cancer. I certainly don't understand how it could have spread outside of my prostate,'\" Morgans said. \"It is very common for people to be completely asymptomatic.\"",
      "Bryce added that some symptoms, such as difficulty urinating or a weak urination stream, may be due to an enlarged prostate, which is common in older men.",
      "\"It is entirely normal that in older men, there is a degree of urinary obstruction that just happens with age,\" he said. \"It's entirely possible that a man just has normal symptoms associated with aging and nothing about it stands out as being related to a cancerous process.\"",

      "Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among men.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's office announced on Sunday that he was diagnosed with an \"aggressive\" form of prostate cancer.",
      "Biden's office said the cancer was diagnosed after \"increasing urinary symptoms\" and that it has metastasized, spreading to his bones.",

      "Here's what to know about prostate cancer including the signs and symptoms, how it is diagnosed and how it is treated.",
      "What is prostate cancer?",
      "Prostate cancer is the most common cancer -- after skin cancer -- diagnosed in American men, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS), the nation's leading cancer advocacy organization.",
      "The prostate is found below the bladder and in front of the rectum. Most prostate cancers develop from gland cells in the prostate, which make fluid that is added to semen, the ACS said.",
      "Diagnosis rates have increased about 3% every year since 2014, according to ACS.",
      "It's estimated that about one in eight men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in his lifetime.",
      "ACS estimates that there will be about 313,780 cases of prostate cancer and about 35,770 prostate cancer deaths in 2025.",
      "What are the signs and symptoms?",
      "Early prostate cancer generally does not cause symptoms but, when symptoms do occur, they include problems with urination or blood in the urine or semen, according to ACS.",
      "When prostate cancer is advanced, meaning it has grown larger or has metastasized, it can cause other problems including erectile dysfunction; weakness or numbness in the legs; loss of bladder or bowel control; weight loss; fatigue; or pain the ribs, hips or spine when the cancer has spread to the bones, ACS said.",
      "Dr. Maha Hussain, a prostate cancer expert and the Genevieve Teuton professor of medicine in the division of hematology-oncology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, told ABC News it is more common for prostate cancer to be found through regular annual exams than because of symptom occurrence.",
      "She added that many symptoms, such as frequent urination or difficulty passing urine, may not be due to prostate cancer but rather due to an enlarged prostate, which is common among older men.",
      "How to screen for prostate cancer",
      "Prostate cancer can often be found early through screening tests, which increases the odds of successful treatment.",
      "ACS recommends men speak with their health care provider about the decision to screen and to have those discussions at age 40 or 45 for those at high risk and at age 50 for those at average risk.",
      "One screening test involves a blood test that measures level of prostate-specific antigens (PSA), which are proteins made by cells in the prostate gland.",

      "\"Using PSA screening is like using a sledgehammer to hammer a small nail, so it's not very precise,\" he told ABC News. \"And PSA can be elevated for a variety of different reasons, whether it be inflammation, infection. Cancer is one of them, but [the test] doesn't differentiate between all of those.\"",
      "He added, \"That said, it is still a great tool, and it's very important for men with an elevated PSA to get further work up to help determine why that's elevated.\"",
      "Prostate cancer can also be tested for via digital rectal exam, which is when a physician inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum to feel for bumps or hard areas on the prostate that indicate cancer, according to ACS.",
      "Patients may also undergo a prostate biopsy, which is when prostate cell samples are studied under a microscope to check for cancer.",
      "The National Cancer Institute said prostate biopsies can be assigned a Gleason score to determine how likely the cancer is to grow and spread. The score is determined by \"adding together the two grades of cancer cells that make up the largest areas of the biopsied tissue sample,\" according to NCI.",
      "The Gleason score usually ranges from six to 10 with higher scores indicating a stronger likelihood of progression. President Biden's office said he received a Gleason score of nine.",
      "What are the treatment options?",
      "Treatment options for prostate cancer vary depending on what stage the cancer is in and how far it has spread.",
      "\"The good news is, nowadays, we have had significant improvement in the medical management of prostate cancer that has spread, and there's been significant prolongation of life, and so there are all kinds of different treatment options available for these patients,\" Hussain said.",
      "For prostate cancers that are small or localized to the prostate, doctors may recommend observation or active surveillance to monitor if symptoms are changing or if the cancer is starting to grow.",
      "Surgery and radiation therapy are the most common treatments for men who are classified as low or intermediate risk, experts told ABC News.",
      "For men whose cancer is more advanced, chemotherapy or hormone therapy -- the latter of which is also known as androgen deprivation therapy -- are most common.",
      "\"Testosterone, we know, is a driver of prostate cancer, and obviously all men have testosterone,\" Yerram said. \"And so central to an anti-androgen therapy plan is really to reduce the levels of testosterone to as close to zero as possible to help stop progression of that prostate cancer and to provide treatment.\"",
      "\"Specifically on President Biden, who obviously I'm not taking care of, but he has stage 4 cancer, so for him, anti-androgen therapy or chemotherapy will likely be first line for him,\" Yerram added.",
      "Experts said it is important for prostate cancer patients to follow up with their doctor after treatment to look for signs of cancer recurrence or treatment side effects.",
      "What are the survival rates?",
      "For localized or regional cancer, meaning the cancer is in the prostate or the cancer has spread to nearby structures, there is a five-year survival rate of more than 99%, according to ACS.",
      "For For cancers that have spread to other parts of the body such as lungs, liver, or bone, the five-year survival rate is about 37%, ACS said.",
      "Hussain said that although metastatic prostate cancer is not curable, it is very much treatable, and that survival rates have increased over the last three decades.",
      "\"We've really come a very, very long way in terms of how long patients are living,\" Hussain said. \"When I entered the field, let's say 1990, the average longevity with metastatic prostate cancer, roughly, was about two-and-a-half years. Now. we have more than doubled that and ... we have many men who are actually living even much longer in my practice over the years.\"",

      "As the world reacts to Biden's medical news, ABC News has broken down what his condition means and what possible treatments can be done.",
      "What to know about prostate cancer",
      "Prostate cancer is a type of cancer that forms in the tissues of the prostate, the small gland in men's prostate that produces semen, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH)",
      "It is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the U.S., according to the federal health agency.",
      "The NIH reports an estimated 313,780 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed this year -- representing over 15% of all new cancer cases.",
      "An estimated 35,770 deaths from prostate cancer will occur this year -- representing 5.8% of all cancer deaths, according to the agency.",
      "Prostate cancer has a five-year relative survival rate, meaning the percentage of people alive five years after diagnosis, is roughly 98%.",
      "Generally, prostate cancer usually grows very slowly and finding and treating it before symptoms occur may not improve men's health or help them live longer.",
      "However, it is generally a more treatable type of cancer, even when it has spread further.",
      "Roughly 12.9% of men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point in their lifetime, according to the NIH. In 2022, there were an estimated 3.5 million men living with prostate cancer in the United States.",
      "The median age of prostate cancer diagnosis is 68 years old, according to the agency, while the median age of prostate cancer death is 79.",
      "While the agency reports rates for new prostate cancer cases have been rising an average 1.8% each year over from 2013 to 2022, death rates have been falling on average 0.6% each year over between 2014 and 2023.",
      "What is a Gleason score?",
      "The Gleason grading system, or Gleason score, refers to how likely the cancer is to advance and spread, but does not predict the outcome.",
      "It's way of describing prostate cancer based on how abnormal the cancer cells in a biopsy sample look under a microscope and how quickly they are likely to grow and spread, according to the NIH.",
      "The Gleason score is calculated by adding together the two grades of cancer cells that make up the largest areas of the biopsied tissue sample, the NIH says.",
      "The grading system usually ranges from 6 to 10.",
      "Biden's diagnosis of a Gleason score of 9 indicates his cancer is aggressive.",
      "A score of 9 indicates that the cancer cells look very different from normal prostate cells and are likely to grow and spread rapidly. This places the cancer in Grade Group 5, the highest risk category, associated with a greater likelihood of metastasis and a more challenging prognosis. Yet, despite the cancer's apparent aggressiveness, its hormone-sensitive nature offers a viable treatment pathway.",
      "Possible treatment options",
      "While Biden's official treatment plan remains to be announced, possible options for the former president include hormone therapy, or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which can reduce levels of male hormones that can fuel prostate cancer growth.",
      "This approach can effectively slow disease progression and manage symptoms, even in advanced stages where the cancer has spread to the bones.",
      "Regular monitoring of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels is crucial, as rising PSA levels can indicate cancer activity and help assess treatment effectiveness.",
      "Surgery is typically not an option in cases like Biden's, when the disease has spread to the bone and is not confined to the prostate.",
      "Following the former president's diagnosis, the American Cancer Society released a statement, saying, \"This news is a reminder about the tragic impact of prostate cancer in the U.S.\"",
      "\"Early detection is key, and we are concerned given the 5% year-over-year increase in diagnosis of men with more advanced disease. We can and must do more to prevent late-stage diagnosis and death from prostate cancer,\" the ACS said.",

      "On \"This Week,\" the GOP senator addresses the Qatari luxury jet and tariffs.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he has doubts over President Donald Trump's willingness to accept a luxury jet from Qatar on behalf of the administration that he hopes to use as Air Force One, but that there are ways the administration could receive it without raising potential conflicts of interest.",
      "\"There's a lot of ways this could be arranged, but I think what sent up signals that people were concerned about was that it was going to be temporarily part of the government, and then it was going to the president's library when the president retires. So I think all of those things could be fixed, could be corrected. There probably is a perfectly legal way, but right now, it's raised more questions than I think it's worth,\" Paul said Sunday to ABC News' \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl.",
      "Paul claimed that the questions that the jet raised overshadowed an otherwise successful trip.",
      "\"I think my fear is that it detracts from a largely successful trip where the president is talking about opening up and doing more trade with the Middle East, which is a good thing, particularly amidst all the protectionism and directing away from trade that we've had going on,\" Paul said.",
      "Trump recently returned from his first major foreign trip to the Middle East. Qatar, one of the nations Trump visited, proposed offering the administration a luxury jet as a gift before the trip, as ABC News first reported. Trump expressed interest in accepting the gift, which did not take place during the trip, raising concerns of potential conflicts of interest. Trump claimed that the approximately $400 million jet would be a gift to the United States government and would be retrofitted to be Air Force One until the end of his term.",
      "Special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff said Sunday that the proposed Qatari plane falls within the laws of the U.S.",
      "\"It's a perfectly legal transaction. It's been vetted by the White House counsel, by the Justice Department. There are outside law firms involved. So, it's a perfectly legal, government to government, Department of Defense, to Department of Defense transaction that happens in the normal course and has been happening in the normal course throughout -- throughout our existence. Governments exchange services,\" said Witkoff.",
      "Here are more highlights from Paul's interview:",
      "On reducing tariffs against China",
      "Karl: Okay, Senator, let me turn to tariffs. The president also announced a temporary reduction to those big China tariffs, although still 30 percent tariffs on goods coming in from China as he negotiates -- tries to negotiate a new deal, Walmart has warned that this will result in higher prices. What's your assessment?",
      "Paul: Well, tariffs are taxes, and when you put a tax on a business, it's always passed through as a cost, so there will be higher prices. And I think this is what's important to know people talk about, oh, this is America versus China. The U.S. doesn't trade with China. You trade with Walmart, or you trade with Target, or you trade with Amazon. Americans go in and buy a product. Now it might come from China, but think about it this way. Think of the entire trade with China was all TVs. A million people go to Walmart. They all buy a TV. They like the quality, they like the price, and it happened to come from China. But then you draw a circle around China and the U.S., you say, 'Oh my goodness, it's a trade deficit.' We buy all of our TVs from over there, but each individual transaction, each individual who bought a TV was happy. But how can you draw a circle around a million happy people and say they all got ripped off? So there's an economic fallacy here. And the fallacy is that trade deficits actually mean anything. They're an artificial accounting. The only trade that means anything is the individual who buys something. That's the only real trade, and that, by very definition, if it's voluntary, is mutually beneficial or the trade doesn't occur.",
      "On the trade deficit",
      "Karl: So the actual trade deficit with Canada is actually a little less than, or quite a bit less than, $100 billion, but, but even so is a trade deficit subsidizing Canada?",
      "Paul: No, they're, they're really not related at all. What happens if we trade with another country because they have less expensive goods, is we become richer. You also have more money that you can spend. So let's say you're an average American. You shop at Walmart, you save about $4,000 or $5,000 a year because you're able to purchase goods that are important from other countries. What do you do with that? I don't know. Maybe you go to Disney World. Maybe you go to Dollywood. You know, you go you can you spend a lot of it in America. Maybe you get somebody to cut your grass. There's all kinds of things that happens to that extra money, but you are richer because you've gotten a product at a lower cost. And this is what the marketplace does. It drives prices down and it pushes efficiency. But it isn't one country against another. All of that is in artificial accounting. Paul on trade deficit",
      "On Congress' power to levy tariffs",
      "Karl: And before you go, there are several lawsuits challenging these tariffs. The Constitution clearly gives Congress the power to impose taxes, to impose duties. What is your -- are these tariffs legal? Do you think these laws -- do you think they'll be get knocked down? And will Congress -- as you suggested -- will Congress grow a spine and assert its control over taxation?",
      "Paul: I think a strict interpretation of the Constitution says that taxes originate in Congress, and more specifically, taxes originate in the House. They have to start in the House first before they come to the Senate. Now we do have a long history, though, of both parties abdicating the responsibility on tariffs and granting power to Congress, which brings up another Constitutional question: can Congress delegate powers given in under the Constitution to the president? In the past, the court has allowed these things, but I think it will be an interesting thing, because most tariffs in our history have been passed by Congress. We've never had widespread tariffs that have been done by fiat by a president, and I object to that.",

      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Just days before 10 men broke out of a New Orleans jail, officials with the sheriff's office asked for money to fix faulty locks and cell doors deemed a key factor in the escape.",
      "As the manhunt for the remaining seven fugitives stretches into a new week, officials continue to investigate who or what was to blame in a jailbreak that even the escapees labeled as \u201ceasy\u201d \u2014 in a message scrawled on a wall above the narrow hole they squeezed through.",
      "Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson said she has long raised concerns about the jail's ongoing \u201cdeficiencies,\" adding that the breakout has \u201conce again highlighted the critical need for repairs and upgrades\u201d to the ailing infrastructure.",
      "The men yanked open a cell door, slipped through a hole behind a toilet, scaled a barbed wire fence and fled from the jail early Friday, recorded surveillance video showed.",
      "While Hutson said the locks played a key role in the escape, there are other crucial security lapses that officials have outlined; Indications that the escape may have been an inside job, with three sheriff\u2019s employees now on suspension; the hole that officials said may have been formed using power tools; a lack of monitoring of the cell pod, as the employee tasked with the job had stepped out to grab food; and law enforcement not being aware of the escape until a morning headcount seven hours after the men fled.",
      "Attorney General Liz Murrill said on Monday that state and local officials, courts and law enforcement are working together to hastily address issues at the ailing jail.",
      "Murrill said it's \"not a secret\u201d that the jail had been experiencing staffing shortages and maintenance defects for years.",
      "The sheriff's office says it has long raised concerns about issues at the jail. As recently as four days before the escape, Jeworski \u201cJay\u201d Mallet \u2014 the Chief of Corrections for the Orleans Justice Center \u2014 presented a need for a new lock system during the city's Capital Improvement Plan hearing.",

He said many require a \u201crestrictive housing environment that did not exist\" at the jail and, as a result, the sheriff's office has transferred dozens in custody to more secure locations.",
      "In the aftermath of the escape, Murrill said officials are looking at ways to \u201charden physical aspects of this prison so that we can be realistic about the population that is being held there.\u201d",
      "Mallet said some cell unit doors and locks have been \u201cmanipulated\" to the point that they can't even be closed properly.",
      "Since becoming sheriff in 2022, Hutson said she has complained about the locks at every turn and advocated for additional funding to make the facility more secure.",
      "New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said during a news conference on Sunday that funding for the jail has been \u201ca priority\u201d and that funding has been allocated to the sheriff's office for operating expenses and capital improvements. Bianka Brown, the chief financial officer for the sheriff's office, said the current budget \u201cdoesn't support what we need\u201d to ensure critical fixes and upgrades.",
      "\u201cThings are being deprived,\" Brown said of the jail, which for more than a decade has been subject to federal monitoring and a consent decree intended to improve conditions. The jail, which opened in 2015, replaced another facility that had its own history of escapes and violence.",
      "Other's have pointed to Hutson being at fault. State Rep. Aimee Adatto Freeman, who represents much of uptown New Orleans, called for sheriff to step down on Monday.",

      "GROTON, Conn. -- The union for about 2,500 submarine designers at Electric Boat in Connecticut has tentatively agreed to a new contract with the company, averting a strike that would have begun Monday.",
      "The Marine Draftsmen\u2019s Association-United Auto Workers of America, Local 571, essentially the workers responsible for designing the U.S. Navy's nuclear submarine fleet, had threatened to strike earlier this month if the company did not make greater wage and benefit concessions.",
      "The local's negotiating committee announced the tentative contract agreement late Sunday, saying it contains \u201cunprecedented\u201d wage increases of more than 30% over the five-year term as well as increased retirement security. The deal now goes up for a vote by union members. Union officials did not say when the vote would be.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been saying it all along: The company didn\u2019t want a work stoppage, we did not want a work stoppage,\u201d William Louis, president of Local 571, said in a video posted on union social media sites Sunday night. \u201cAnd as we\u2019ve been telling you for a long time, we have been working endlessly to get to the table with the company and have something put together that we both agree on.\"",
      "Electric Boat, a subsidiary of Reston, Virginia-based General Dynamics, was recently awarded a contract worth more than $12.4 billion by the Navy for the construction of two Virginia-class submarines. The funding also covers improved pay for workers including the Marine Draftsmen's Association.",
      "\u201cThis package recognizes the essential role of the MDA members in the production of submarines for the U.S. Navy,\u201d Electric Boat said in a joint statement with the union.",
      "The union\u2019s contract expired April 4, but leadership had agreed to continue bargaining with EB.",
      "Electric Boat employs more than 23,000 people at his shipyard in Groton, Connecticut, engineering facilities in New London, Connecticut, and operations in Quonset Point, Rhode Island.",
      "The company said its earlier offer included a 23.3% general wage increase over the life of the contract, plus benefits and an increased retirement package.",

      "MICHIGAN CITY, Ind. -- An Indiana man convicted in the 2000 killing of a police officer is set to receive a lethal injection early Tuesday in the state\u2019s second execution in 15 years.",
      "Benjamin Ritchie, 45, has been on death row for more than 20 years after being convicted in the fatal shooting of Beech Grove Police Officer Bill Toney during a foot chase.",
      "Unless there\u2019s last-minute court action, Ritchie is scheduled to be executed \u201cbefore the hour of sunrise\u201d at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, according to state officials.",
      "Indiana resumed executions in December after a yearslong hiatus due to scarcity of lethal injection drugs nationwide. Prison officials provided photos of the execution chamber in advance of Joseph Corcoran\u2019s execution, showing a space that looks like a sparse operating room with a gurney, fluorescent lighting, a floor drain and an adjacent viewing room. They have offered few other details about the process, including the time the executions take place.",
      "Among 27 states with death penalty laws, Indiana is one of two that bars media witnesses. The other, Wyoming, has conducted one execution in the last half-century. The Associated Press and other media organizations have filed a federal lawsuit in Indiana seeking media access.",
      "The execution Tuesday in Indiana is among 12 scheduled in eight states this year. Ritchie's execution and two others in Texas and Tennessee will be carried out this week.",
      "Ritchie was 20 when he and others stole a van in Beech Grove, near Indianapolis. He then fired four shots at Toney during a foot chase, killing him.",
      "At the time Ritchie was on probation from a 1998 burglary conviction.",
      "Toney, 31, had worked at the Beech Grove Police Department for two years. He was the first officer of the police department of roughly 30 officers to be killed by gunfire in the line of duty. The community of 14,000 people mourned the married father of two as a neighborly person who showed up to help others.",
      "When Toney died, \u201cEveryone of us involved, including Bill, had something stolen from them that they\u2019ll never get back,\" said Deputy Police Chief Tom Hurrle, who worked with him.",
      "Relatives spoke at a clemency hearing last week, urging for the execution to move forward.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time. We\u2019re all tired,\u201d said Dee Dee Horen, who was Toney\u2019s wife. \u201cIt is time for this chapter of my story, our story, to be closed. It\u2019s time for us to remember Bill, to remember Bill\u2019s life, and not his death.\u201d",
      "Ritchie\u2019s attorneys have fought the death penalty sentence, arguing his legal counsel at trial was ineffective because his lawyers failed to fully investigate and present evidence on his fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and childhood lead exposure.",
      "Current defense attorneys say Ritchie suffered \u201csevere brain damage\u201d because his mother abused alcohol and drugs during pregnancy and has struggled with decision-making. He was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2005.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s finally come to have some coping skills. He\u2019s a different man,\u201d said defense attorney Steven Schutte.",
      "Republican Gov. Mike Braun rejected Ritchie's clemency bid last week as the parole board recommended. Braun didn't explain his decision, but board members said Ritchie's case didn't meet the bar for commuting a sentence and cited a dozen violations during Ritchie\u2019s time in prison, including threatening others with violence.",
      "The Indiana Supreme Court denied a request to stop the execution, but two justices noted the jury didn\u2019t get accurate information about Ritchie\u2019s brain damage.",
      "Ritchie's attorneys are challenging that decision in federal court and have also filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Disability rights advocates say Ritchie\u2019s brain damage should exclude him from the death penalty.",
      "Ritchie\u2019s \u201ccapacity to fully appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct\u201d was \"impaired at the time of his crime,\u201d Dr. Megan Carter, who also testified before the parole board, said in a statement.",
      "Attorneys say Ritchie has changed during his more than two decades behind bars and shown remorse.",
      "In court as a young man, Ritchie smiled at Horen and laughed as the verdict was read.",
      "He told a parole board he deeply regrets his actions, especially how he acted with Toney's widow.",
      "\u201cI wish I could go back to the day in court, because that man\u2019s wife deserved to say everything she needed to say to me, and that punk kid should have just kept his mouth shut and let her say whatever she needed to say,\" Ritchie said. \u201cThat was her right. That was his family's right.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A husband and wife are set to go on trial in federal court in Denver over what federal prosecutors have said was a stunt to help elect the first Black mayor of Colorado Springs",
      "DENVER -- In the run-up to the 2023 mayoral election in Colorado Springs, a racial slur was scrawled across a Black candidate\u2019s sign and a cross set on fire in front of it.",
      "It was a stunt to generate sympathy and support for the Black candidate, Yemi Mobolade, prosecutors have said, but two people accused of staging it are set to go on trial Monday, charged with making a threat against him.",
      "Mobolade, the city's first Black mayor, is scheduled to testify in the case as a victim, according to court documents.",
      "But one of the defendants claims Mobolade himself was a participant in the plan to help him win. And the defendant\u2019s attorneys say their alleged actions were political theater \u2014 free speech that is constitutionally protected and wasn\u2019t meant to cause harm.",
      "\"This was a hoax in every sense of the word,\u201d defendant Ashley Blackcloud told The Associated Press. She said Mobolade knew in advance about their plans to burn the cross, but she would not comment further, citing a court order that bars discussing information gathered in the case before the trial. Blackcloud, who is indigenous and Black, said the stunt was not intended to hurt anyone.",
      "Mobolade has previously denied any involvement emphatically. A city spokesperson, Vanessa Zink, said the mayor did not want to want to make any additional comment.",
      "The second defendant \u2014 Blackcloud\u2019s husband, Derrick Bernard \u2014 is serving a life sentence after being convicted last year of ordering the killing of a rapper in Colorado Springs. The man charged with carrying out the killing was recently acquitted, and Bernard is appealing his conviction.",
      "Messages left for Blackcloud's lawyer and Bernard's lawyer were not returned.",
      "However, in motions to dismiss the case they pointed out that the cross was set on fire in the middle of the night, which no one other than the defendants apparently saw.",
      "They are, however, accused of spreading word about it in emails to the media and others that include images of the scene.",
      "They are each charged with using a means of interstate commerce \u2014 the internet and email \u2014 to make a threat and conveying false information about an attempt to intimidate Mobolade with a fire. They are also both charged with being part of a conspiracy to do that. They have pleaded not guilty.",
      "According to jury instructions in the case, prosecutors must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Bernard and Blackcloud intended Mobolade to fear that violence would result in order for them to be found guilty.",
      "Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Regina M. Rodriguez ruled that the alleged actions are not ones that are clearly protected by the First Amendment, which would have required her to dismiss the case.",
      "\u201cIt is up to the jury to determine whether the cross burning was a true threat or merely political speech,\u201d she wrote.",
      "A third person indicted in the alleged scheme, Deanna West, pleaded guilty in March to one count of being part of a conspiracy to set the fire and then spread false information about it, under a plea agreement with prosecutors. According to that agreement, West's lawyer and government prosecutors agreed that the conspiracy\u2019s goal was to interfere in the campaign of Mobolade\u2019s opponent and create the belief that Mobolade was being discouraged from running because of his race.",
      "West is also scheduled to testify for the government.",
      "According to the indictment, Bernard communicated with Mobolade before the cross burning on April 23, 2023, and after Mobolade won election in a May 6, 2023, runoff.",
      "About a week before the cross burning, Bernard told the then-candidate in a Facebook message that he was \u201cmobilizing my squadron in defense and for the final push. Black ops style big brother. The klan cannot be allowed to run this city again.\u201d",
      "They spoke for about five minutes on the telephone three days after the incident.",
      "In a video statement posted on social media in December, Mobolade said he had fully cooperated with the investigation and had been truthful with law enforcement.",
      "\u201cI fully and truthfully cooperated throughout this investigation. I had no knowledge, warning or involvement in this crime,\u201d he said.",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office for Colorado, which is prosecuting the case, declined to comment on whether it had questioned or investigated Mobolade about whether he was involved in the cross burning.",

      "As the U.S. government begins reinstating international students\u2019 records following an expansive crackdown, many face a daunting and complicated path toward rebuilding their lives",
      "After the government terminated his legal status in the U.S., one student abruptly lost his laboratory job in Houston and, fearing detention, he returned to his home country in south Asia on a one-way ticket.",
      "The Trump administration later reversed course in its expansive crackdown on international students, but there was a major obstacle. The student cannot return because his American visa was revoked.",
      "Without it, he\u2019s \u201cstranded,\u201d said the student, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.",
      "As the government begins reinstating students' records, many face a daunting and complicated path toward rebuilding their lives. For those who left, there is no guarantee they can return. Others have faced challenges reenrolling in school and returning to jobs.",
      "Mental anguish from their ordeals linger, as do feelings of vulnerability. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has expanded the grounds for terminating a student\u2019s legal status, leaving many to fear they could be targeted again.",
      "A total of more than 4,700 international students had their permission to study in the U.S. canceled this spring, with little notice or explanation. In court hearings, Department of Homeland Security officials said they ran the names of student visa holders through an FBI-run database that contains the names of suspects and people who have been arrested, even if they were never charged with a crime or had charges dropped.",
      "At a court hearing last week in Oakland, California, lawyers for international students sought a nationwide injunction they said would protect their clients and others across the country.",
      "But government attorneys said that wasn't necessary because ICE was mailing status reactivation letters to affected students. It likely will take two weeks for all students to receive their letter, which can then be shared with universities and employers, assistant U.S. attorney Elizabeth Kurlan said.",
      "The plaintiffs' lawyers said the letter is meaningless, arguing ICE\u2019s new policy suggests student records can be terminated on a whim. There's also no evidence ICE has asked the State Department to restore revoked visas, the plaintiffs' attorneys said.",
      "The man in Houston left within about a week of learning his legal status had been terminated. Around that time, he also received an email that the visa he used to enter the U.S. had been revoked. He believes his termination stemmed from a 2021 fraud case that was dismissed.",
      "Over nearly a decade he had built a life in the U.S., where he was enrolled in \u201coptional practical training,\u201d which allows foreign students to stay and work for up to three years on their student visas. In his home country, he is now looking for work and living with his mother.",
      "The wait time for a U.S. visa interview is at least a year, he said.",
      "Even if he got another visa, returning would be complicated because of his financial situation. He had a car loan and credit cards in the U.S. that he can\u2019t afford to pay after losing his job, and his credit score has since dropped, he said.",
      "\u201cRevoking a visa or revoking a SEVIS status does not just affect the educational side of things, it affects the whole life,\u201d said the student, who has struggled with feelings of loneliness and also grief over his father's recent death.",
      "SEVIS is the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems database that tracks international students\u2019 compliance with their visa status.",
      "Students who left the country may not have known their rights or had the resources to hire a lawyer, said Ben Loveman, an immigration attorney. They now will have a harder time being reinstated, he said.",
      "\u201cThere were huge consequences,\u201d Loveman said.",
      "For a Nepali programmer in Texas who had his status terminated, the ordeal brought up a mistake he thought he had left in the past.",
      "The programmer, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear or retaliation, was arrested four years ago for drunken driving. He said he took responsibility for his actions, performing community service hours, serving probation and paying fines. The judge told him the records could be sealed after two years, but the case appears to explain why he was targeted by immigration authorities.",
      "\u201cI followed everything,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to take it all, at least give me due process.\u201d",
      "His status has since been restored, and the programmer, who is on an OPT program, has gone back to his job. But the episode hasn\u2019t faded from his mind.",
      "If the right opportunity emerged in another country like New Zealand or Canada, he said he would take it and leave.",
      "A student at Iowa State University who also requested anonymity out of concern about being targeted, said he is looking for options to leave the U.S., after what he describes as a \u201cdark period.\u201d",
      "The Ph.D. student said his status termination pushed him to a mental breaking point. He had a plane ticket back home to Bangladesh reserved. He hardly left his apartment, and when he did, he felt he was being followed.",
      "He attributes his termination to pending charges against him for marijuana possession, but he said he hadn't been convicted.",
      "After his status reinstatement, he restarted a teaching assistant job he had lost. Then, he had to catch up on grading almost three weeks of assignments for dozens of students.",
      "While he's relieved to get back to school, he's confident about his decision to leave by the end of the year \u2014 either for home or Europe. The degree is not worth the risk of another status termination, he said.",

      "Law enforcement agencies have entered a third day of searching for seven of the 10 men who escaped from a New Orleans jail",
      "NEW ORLEANS, La. -- At least a dozen law enforcement agencies entered the third day of a manhunt on Sunday for seven of the 10 men who escaped from a New Orleans jail by fleeing through a hole behind a toilet.",
      "A spokesperson for the Louisiana State Police confirmed in an emailed statement that the seven men remained at large Sunday. It said that the agency was unable to provide details about the scope and target of the investigation for security reasons. The spokesperson added that a multiagency task force was scouring the region for the remaining fugitives.",
      "In a separate statement, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said on Sunday her office's \u201cmain priority remains recovering the prisoners, protecting the public, securing and stabilizing the facility staff, and building.\"",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry planned a 5 p.m. news conference with law enforcement agencies to provide an update on the search.",
      "At least one of the escaped inmates was captured based on a tip from the public, according to a statement from the FBI on the social media platform X. The reward for information leading to the capture of inmates still at large has been increased to $5,000 from the ATF in addition to $2,000 from Crimestoppers and $5,000 from the FBI.",
      "The men range from 19 years old to 42, and face a variety of charges including aggravated assault, domestic abuse battery and murder. New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick warned that the fugitives are dangerous in a news conference on Friday night but also urged the public \u201cnot to panic.\u201d",
      "Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson said the men were able to get out of the Orleans Justice Center because of \u201cdefective locks.\u201d Hutson said she has continuously raised concerns about the locks to officials and, as recently as this week, advocated for money to fix the aged infrastructure.",

      "A 25-year-old man the FBI believes was responsible for an explosion that ripped through a Southern California fertility clinic left behind \u201canti-pro-life\u201d writings before carrying out an attack investigators called terrorism, authorities said Sunday.",
      "Guy Edward Bartkus of Twentynine Palms, California, was identified by the FBI as the suspect in the apparent car bomb detonation Saturday that damaged the clinic in the upscale city of Palm Springs in the desert east of Los Angeles. His writings seemed to indicate anti-natalist views, which hold that people should not continue to procreate, authorities said.",
      "The blast gutted the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic and shattered the windows of nearby buildings along a palm tree-lined street. Witnesses described a loud boom followed by a chaotic scene, with people screaming in terror and glass strewn along the sidewalk and street.",
      "Investigators said Barktus died in the blast, which a senior FBI official called possibly the \u201clargest bombing scene that we\u2019ve had in Southern California.\u201d A body was found near a charred vehicle outside the clinic.",
      "Bartkus attempted to livestream the explosion and left behind writings that communicated \u201cnihilistic ideations\u201d that were still being examined to determine his state of mind, said Akil Davis, the assistant director in charge of the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles field office. U.S. Attorney Bilal \u201cBill\u201d Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in the area, called the message \u201canti-pro-life.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis was a targeted attack against the IVF facility,\u201d Davis said Sunday. \u201cMake no mistake: we are treating this, as I said yesterday, as an intentional act of terrorism.\u201d",
      "The bombing injured four other people, though Davis said all embryos at the facility were saved.",
      "\u201cGood guys one, bad guys zero,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has been pushing back against certain court rulings it doesn't like in the hundreds of cases filed against it in the past few months",
      "DENVER -- Tucked deep in the thousand-plus pages of the multitrillion-dollar budget bill making its way through the Republican-controlled U.S. House is a paragraph curtailing a court\u2019s greatest tool for forcing the government to obey its rulings: the power to enforce contempt findings.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the bill can pass the House in its current form \u2014 it failed in a committee vote Friday \u2014 whether the U.S. Senate would preserve the contempt provision or whether courts would uphold it. But the fact that GOP lawmakers are including it shows how much those in power in the nation's capital are thinking about the consequences of defying judges as the battle between the Trump administration and the courts escalates.",
      "Republican President Donald Trump raised the stakes again Friday when he attacked the U.S. Supreme Court for its ruling barring his administration from quickly resuming deportations under an 18th-century wartime law: \u201cTHE SUPREME COURT WON\u2019T ALLOW US TO GET CRIMINALS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY!\u201d Trump posted on his social media network, Truth Social.",
      "The most intense skirmishes have come in the lower courts.",
      "One federal judge has found that members of the administration may be liable for contempt after ignoring his order to turn around planes deporting people under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Trump's administration has scoffed at another judge\u2019s ruling that it \u201cfacilitate\u201d the return of a man wrongly deported to El Salvador, even though the Supreme Court upheld that decision.",
      "In other cases, the administration has removed immigrants against court orders or had judges find that the administration is not complying with their directives. Dan Bongino, now Trump's deputy director of the FBI, called on the president to \u201cignore\u201d a judge\u2019s order in one of Bongino's final appearances on his talk radio show in February.",
      "\u201cWho\u2019s going to arrest him? The marshals?\u201d Bongino asked, naming the agency that enforces federal judges\u2019 criminal contempt orders. \u201cYou guys know who the U.S. Marshals work for? Department of Justice.\u201d",
      "The rhetoric obscures the fact that the administration has complied with the vast majority of court rulings against it, many of them related to Trump's executive orders. Trump has said multiple times he will comply with orders, even as he attacks by name judges who rule against him.",
      "While skirmishes over whether the federal government is complying with court orders are not unusual, it's the intensity of the Trump administration's pushback that is, legal experts say.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me they are walking as close to the line as they can, and even stepping over it, in an effort to see how much they can get away with,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, a Georgetown law professor. \u201cIt\u2019s what you would expect from a very clever and mischievous child.\u201d",
      "Mike Davis, whose Article III Project pushes for pro-Trump judicial appointments, predicted that Trump will prevail over what he sees as hostile judges.",
      "\u201cThe more they do this, the more it's going to anger the American people, and the chief justice is going to follow the politics on this like he always does,\u201d Davis said.",
      "The clash was the subtext of an unusual Supreme Court session Thursday, the day before the ruling that angered the president. His administration was seeking to stop lower courts from issuing nationwide injunctions barring its initiatives. Previous administrations have also chafed against national orders, and multiple Supreme Court justices have expressed concern that they are overused.",
      "Still, at one point, Justice Amy Coney Barrett pressed Solicitor General D. John Sauer over his assertion that the administration would not necessarily obey a ruling from an appeals court.",
      "\u201cReally?\u201d asked Barrett, who was nominated to the court by Trump.",
      "Sauer contended that was standard Department of Justice policy and he assured the nation\u2019s highest court the administration would honor its rulings.",
      "Some justices have expressed alarm about whether the administration respects the rule of law.",
      "Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown-Jackson, both nominated by Democratic presidents, have warned about government disobedience of court orders and threats toward judges. Chief Justice John Roberts, nominated by a Republican president, George W. Bush, issued a statement condemning Trump's push to impeach James E. Boasberg, the federal judge who found probable cause that the administration committed contempt by ignoring his order on deportations.",
      "Even after the Supreme Court upheld a Maryland judge\u2019s ruling directing the administration to \u201cfacilitate\u201d the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the White House account on X said in a post: \u201che's NOT coming back.\u201d",
      "Legal experts said the Abrego Garcia case may be heading toward contempt.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis has complained of \u201cbad faith\u201d from the administration as she orders reports on what, if anything, it\u2019s doing to comply with her order. But contempt processes are slow and deliberative, and, when the government\u2019s involved, there\u2019s usually a resolution before penalties kick in.",
      "Courts can hold parties to civil litigation or criminal cases in contempt for disobeying their orders. The penalty can take the form of fines or other civil punishments, or even prosecution and jail time, if pursued criminally.",
      "The provision in the Republican budget bill would prohibit courts from enforcing contempt citations for violations of injunctions or temporary restraining orders \u2014 the two main types of rulings used to rein in the Trump administration \u2014 unless the plaintiffs have paid a bond. That rarely happens when someone sues the government.",
      "In an extensive review of contempt cases involving the government, Yale law professor Nick Parrillo identified only 67 where someone was ultimately found in contempt. That was out of more than 650 cases where contempt was considered against the government. Appellate courts reliably overturned the penalties.",
      "But the higher courts always left open the possibility that the next contempt penalties could stick.",
      "\u201cThe courts, for their part, don\u2019t want to find out how far their authority goes,\u201d said David Noll, a Rutgers law professor, \u201cand the executive doesn\u2019t really want to undermine the legal order because the economy and their ability to just get stuff done depends on the law.\u201d",
      "Legal experts are gaming out whether judges could appoint independent prosecutors or be forced to rely on Trump\u2019s Department of Justice. Then there\u2019s the question of whether U.S. marshals would arrest anyone convicted of the offense.",
      "\u201cIf you get to the point of asking the marshals to arrest a contemnor, it\u2019s truly uncharted territory,\u201d Noll said.",
      "There\u2019s a second form of contempt that could not be blocked by the Department of Justice \u2013- civil contempt, leading to fines. This may be a more potent tool for judges because it doesn\u2019t rely on federal prosecution and cannot be expunged with a presidential pardon, said Justin Levitt, a department official in the Obama administration who also advised Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cShould the courts want, they have the tools to make individuals who plan on defying the courts miserable,\u201d Levitt said, noting that lawyers representing the administration and those taking specific actions to violate orders would be the most at risk.",
      "There are other deterrents courts have outside of contempt.",
      "Judges can stop treating the Justice Department like a trustworthy agency, making it harder for the government to win cases. There were indications in Friday's Supreme Court order that the majority didn't trust the administration's handling of the deportations. And defying courts is deeply unpopular: A recent Pew Research Center poll found that about 8 in 10 Americans say that if a federal court rules a Trump administration action is illegal, the government has to follow the court\u2019s decision and stop its action.",
      "That's part of the reason the broader picture might not be as dramatic as the fights over a few of the immigration cases, said Vladeck, the Georgetown professor.",
      "\u201cIn the majority of these cases, the courts are successfully restraining the executive branch and the executive branch is abiding by their rulings,\u201d he said.",

      "Sweeping research cuts in President Donald Trump's proposed budget would target an ocean-monitoring system that scientists say is crucial to predicting tsunami escape routes and hurricane intensity and helping ships navigate dangerous harbors safely",
      "Capt. Ed Enos makes his living as a harbor pilot in Hawaii, clambering aboard arriving ships in the predawn hours and guiding them into port.",
      "His world revolves around wind speeds, current strength and wave swells. When Enos is bobbing in dangerous waters in the dark, his cellphone is his lifeline: with a few taps he can access the Integrated Ocean Observing System and pull up the data needed to guide what are essentially floating warehouses safely to the dock.",
      "But maybe not for much longer. President Donald Trump wants to eliminate all federal funding for the observing system's regional operations. Scientists say the cuts could mean the end of efforts to gather real-time data crucial to navigating treacherous harbors, plotting tsunami escape routes and predicting hurricane intensity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the last thing you should be shutting down,\u201d Enos said. \u201cThere\u2019s no money wasted. Right at a time when we should be getting more money to do more work to benefit the public, they want to turn things off. That\u2019s the wrong strategy at the wrong time for the wrong reasons.\u201d",
      "The IOOS system launched about 20 years ago. It's made up of 11 regional associations in multiple states and territories, including the Virgin Islands, Alaska, Hawaii, Washington state, Michigan, South Carolina and Southern California.",
      "The regional groups are networks of university researchers, conservation groups, businesses and anyone else gathering or using maritime data. The associations are the Swiss army knife of oceanography, using buoys, submersible drones and radar installations to track water temperature, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, wave speeds, swell heights and current strength.",
      "The networks monitor the Great Lakes, U.S. coastlines, the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump renamed the Gulf of America, the Gulf of Alaska, the Caribbean and the South Pacific and upload member data to public websites in real time.",
      "Cruise ship, freighter and tanker pilots like Enos, as well as the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard, use the information directly to navigate harbors safely, plot courses around storms and conduct search-and-rescue operations.",
      "The associations' observations feed into National Weather Service forecasts. The Pacific Northwest association uses tsunami data to post real-time coastal escape routes on a public-facing app. And the Hawaii association not only posts data that is helpful to harbor pilots but tracks hurricane intensity and tiger sharks that have been tagged for research.",
      "The associations also track toxic algal blooms, which can force beach closures and kill fish. The maps help commercial anglers avoid those empty regions. Water temperature data can help identify heat layers within the ocean and, because it\u2019s harder for fish to survive in those layers, knowing hot zones helps anglers target better fishing grounds.",
      "The regional networks are not formal federal agencies but are almost entirely funded through federal grants through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The current federal budget allocates $43.5 million for the networks. A Republican bill in the House natural resources committee would actually send them more money, $56 million annually, from 2026 through 2030.",
      "A Trump administration memo leaked in April proposes a $2.5 billion cut to the Department of Commerce, which oversees NOAA, in the 2026 federal budget.",
      "Part of the proposal calls for eliminating federal funding for the regional monitoring networks, even though the memo says one of the activities the administration wants the commerce department to focus on is collecting ocean and weather data.",
      "The memo offered no other justifications for the cuts. The proposal stunned network users.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve worked so hard to build an incredible system and it\u2019s running smoothly, providing data that\u2019s important to the economy. Why would you break it?\u201d said Jack Barth, an Oregon State oceanographer who shares data with the Pacific Northwest association.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re providing is a window into the ocean and without those measures we frankly won\u2019t know what\u2019s coming at us. It's like turning off the headlights,\" Barth said.",
      "NOAA officials declined to comment on the cuts and potential impacts, saying in an email to The Associated Press that they do not do \u201cspeculative interviews.\u201d",
      "Nothing is certain. The 2026 federal fiscal year starts Oct. 1. The budget must pass the House, the Senate and get the president's signature before it can take effect. Lawmakers could decide to fund the regional networks after all.",
      "Network directors are trying not to panic. If the cuts go through, some associations might survive by selling their data or soliciting grants from sources outside the federal government. But the funding hole would be so significant that just keeping the lights on would be an uphill battle, they said.",
      "If the associations fold, other entities might be able to continue gathering data, but there will be gaps. Partnerships developed over years would evaporate and data won't be available in a single place like now, they said.",
      "\"People have come to us because we\u2019ve been steady,\" Hawaii regional network director Melissa Iwamoto said. \u201cWe\u2019re a known entity, a trusted entity. No one saw this coming, the potential for us not to be here.\u201d",

      "Libraries across the United States are cutting back on e-books, audiobooks and loan programs after the Trump administration suspended millions of dollars in federal grants as it tries to dissolve the Institute of Museum and Library Services.",
      "Federal judges have issued temporary orders to block the Trump administration from taking any further steps toward gutting the agency. But the unexpected slashing of grants has delivered a significant blow to many libraries, which are reshuffling budgets and looking at different ways to raise money.",
      "Maine has laid off a fifth of its staff and temporarily closed its state library after not receiving the remainder of its annual funding. Libraries in Mississippi have indefinitely stopped offering a popular e-book service, and the South Dakota state library has suspended its interlibrary loan program.",
      "E-book and audiobook programs are especially vulnerable to budget cuts, even though those offerings have exploded in popularity since the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cI think everyone should know the cost of providing digital sources is too expensive for most libraries,\" said Cindy Hohl, president of the American Library Association. \u201cIt\u2019s a continuous and growing need.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump issued an executive order March 14 to dismantle the IMLS before firing nearly all of its employees.",
      "One month later, the Maine State Library announced it was issuing layoff notices for workers funded through an IMLS grant program.",
      "\u201cIt came as quite a surprise to all of us,\u201d said Spencer Davis, a library generalist at the Maine State Library who is one of eight employees who were laid off May 8 because of the suspended funding.",
      "In April, California, Washington and Connecticut were the only three states to receive letters stating the remainder of their funding for the year was cancelled, Hohl said. For others, the money hasn\u2019t been distributed yet. The three states all filed formal objections with the IMLS.",
      "Rebecca Wendt, California state library director, said she was never told why California's funding was terminated while the other remaining states did not receive the same notice.",
      "\u201cWe are mystified,\u201d Wendt said.",
      "The agency did not respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Most libraries are funded by city and county governments, but receive a smaller portion of their budget from their state libraries, which receive federal dollars every year to help pay for summer reading programs, interlibrary loan services and digital books. Libraries in rural areas rely on federal grants more than those in cities.",
      "Many states use the funding to pay for e-books and audiobooks, which are increasingly popular, and costly, offerings. In 2023, more than 660 million people globally borrowed e-books, audiobooks and digital magazines, up from 19% in 2022, according to OverDrive, the main distributor of digital content for libraries and schools.",
      "In Mississippi, the state library helped fund its statewide e-book program.",
      "For a few days, Erin Busbea was the bearer of bad news for readers at her Mississippi library: Hoopla, a popular app to check out e-books and audiobooks had been suspended indefinitely in Lowndes and DeSoto counties due to the funding freeze.",
      "\u201cPeople have been calling and asking, \u2018Why can\u2019t I access my books on Hoopla?\u2019\u201d said Busbea, library director of the Columbus-Lowndes Public Library System in Columbus, a majority-Black city northeast of Jackson.",
      "The library system also had to pause parts of its interlibrary loan system allowing readers to borrow books from other states when they aren't available locally.",
      "\u201cFor most libraries that were using federal dollars, they had to curtail those activities,\" said Hulen Bivins, the Mississippi Library Commission executive director.",
      "The funding freeze came after the agency's roughly 70 staff members were placed on administrative leave in March.",
      "Attorneys general in 21 states and the American Library Association have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration for seeking to dismantle the agency.",
      "The institute's annual budget is below $300 million and distributes less than half of that to state libraries across the country. In California, the state library was notified that about 20%, or $3 million, of its $15 million grant had been terminated.",
      "\u201cThe small library systems are not able to pay for the e-books themselves,\u201d said Wendt, the California state librarian.",
      "In South Dakota, the state's interlibrary loan program is on hold, according to Nancy Van Der Weide, a spokesperson for the South Dakota Department of Education.",

      "A devastating tornado in Kentucky damaged homes, tossed vehicles and left many people homeless. Seventeen of the deaths were in Laurel County, located in the state's southeast, and one was in Pulaski County: Fire Department Maj. Roger Leslie Leatherman, a 39-year veteran who was fatally injured while responding to the deadly weather.",

      "Rescuers searched for survivors all night and into the morning, the sheriff's office said. An emergency shelter was set up at a high school and donations of food and other necessities were arriving.",
      "Resident Chris Cromer said he got the first of two alerts on his phone around 11:30 p.m., about a half-hour before the tornado struck. He and his wife grabbed their dog, jumped in their car and sought shelter in the crawlspace at a relative\u2019s nearby home because their own crawlspace is small.",

The FDA had been on track to grant Novavax full approval \u2013 without restrictions -- by its April 1 target date, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters.",
      "Novavax later announced the FDA instead was asking it to run an additional trial after approval, which is highly unusual. FDA did order several additional trials to be completed in the next few years, some examining whether the vaccine might be associated with some heart conditions. Another required study must assess the benefits of continuing vaccination in 50- to 64-year-olds who don\u2019t have health problems that increase their risk from COVID-19.",

      "Beginning next school year, the curriculum standards for Oklahoma high school students will including conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- Oklahoma high school students studying U.S. history learn about the Industrial Revolution, women\u2019s suffrage and America's expanding role in international affairs.",
      "Beginning next school year, they will add conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Oklahoma\u2019s new social studies standards for K-12 public school students, already infused with references to the Bible and national pride, were revised at the direction of state School Superintendent Ryan Walters. The Republican official has spent much of his first term in office lauding President Donald Trump, feuding with teachers unions and local school superintendents, and trying to end what he describes as \u201cwokeness\u201d in public schools.",
      "\u201cThe left has been pushing left-wing indoctrination in the classroom,\u201d Walters said. \u201cWe\u2019re moving it back to actually understanding history ... and I\u2019m unapologetic about that.\u201d",
      "The previous standard for studying the 2020 election merely said, \u201cExamine issues related to the election of 2020 and its outcome.\" The new version is more expansive: \u201cIdentify discrepancies in 2020 elections results by looking at graphs and other information, including the sudden halting of ballot-counting in select cities in key battleground states, the security risks of mail-in balloting, sudden batch dumps, an unforeseen record number of voters, and the unprecedented contradiction of \u2018bellwether county\u2019 trends.\u201d",
      "The new standard raised red flags even among Walters' fellow Republicans, including the governor and legislative leaders. They were concerned that several last-minute changes, including the language about the 2020 election and a provision stating the source of the COVID-19 virus was a Chinese lab, were added just hours before the state school board voted on them.",
      "A group of parents and educators have filed a lawsuit asking a judge to reject the standards, arguing they were not reviewed properly and that they \u201crepresent a distorted view of social studies that intentionally favors an outdated and blatantly biased perspective.\u201d",
      "While many Oklahoma teachers have expressed outrage at the change in the standards, others say they leave plenty of room for an effective teacher to instruct students about the results of the 2020 election without misinforming them.",
      "Aaron Baker, who has taught U.S. government in high schools in Oklahoma City for more than a decade, said he\u2019s most concerned about teachers in rural, conservative parts of the state who might feel encouraged to impose their own beliefs on students.",
      "\u201cIf someone is welcoming the influence of these far-right organizations in our standards and is interested in inserting more of Christianity into our practices as teachers, then they\u2019ve become emboldened,\u201d Baker said. \u201cFor me, that is the major concern.\u201d",
      "Leaders in the Republican-led Oklahoma Legislature introduced a resolution to reject the standards, but there wasn\u2019t enough GOP support to pass it.",
      "Part of that hesitation likely stemmed from a flurry of last-minute opposition organized by pro-Trump conservative groups such as Moms for Liberty, which has a large presence in Oklahoma and threatened lawmakers who reject the standards with a primary opponent.",
      "\u201cIn the last few election cycles, grassroots conservative organizations have flipped seats across Oklahoma by holding weak Republicans accountable,\u201d the group wrote in a letter signed by several other conservative groups and GOP activists. \u201cIf you choose to side with the liberal media and make backroom deals with Democrats to block conservative reform, you will be next.\u201d",
      "After a group of parents, educators and other Oklahoma school officials worked to develop the new social studies standards, Walters assembled an executive committee consisting mostly of out-of-state pundits from conservative think-tanks to revise them. He said he wanted to focus more on American exceptionalism and incorporate the Bible as an instructional resource.",
      "Among those Walters appointed to the review committee are Kevin Roberts, the president of The Heritage Foundation and a key figure in its Project 2025 blueprint for a conservative administration, and Dennis Prager, a radio talk show host who founded Prager U, a conservative nonprofit that offers \u201cpro-American\u201d educational materials for children that some critics say are not accurate or objective.",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, Walters defended teaching students about \u201cunprecedented and historically significant\u201d elements of the 2020 presidential election.",
      "\"The standards do not instruct students on what to believe; rather, they encourage critical thinking by inviting students to examine real events, review publicly available information, and come to their own conclusions,\u201d he said.",
      "Recounts, reviews and audits in the battleground states were Trump contested his loss all confirmed Democrat Joe Biden's victory, and Trump lost dozens of court cases challenging the results.",
      "Critics say Walters' new standard is filled with misleading phrasing that seeks to steer the discussion in particular direction.",
      "Democrats characterized it as another political ploy by Walters, widely viewed as a potential candidate for governor in 2026, at the expense of school children.",
      "\u201cIt's harmful posturing and political theater that our kids do not need to be subjected to,\u201d said Sen. Mark Mann, a Democrat from Oklahoma City who previously served on the school board for one of the state's largest districts.",
      "National experts on education standards also expressed alarm, noting that Oklahoma has historically ranked highly among the states for its standards.",
      "Brendan Gillis, the director of teaching and learning at the American Historical Association who oversaw a research project that analyzed standards in all 50 states, said Oklahoma\u2019s social studies standards had been \u201cquite good\u201d until the latest version.",
      "In addition to concerns about election misinformation, Gillis added: \u201cThere was also a lot of biblical content that was sort of shoehorned in throughout the existing standards.\u201d",
      "He said a lot of the references to Christianity and the Bible misinterpreted the history of the country's founding and lacked historical nuance.",
      "David Griffith, a research director at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative-leaning education think-tank, said he was not aware of any other states that have tried to promote election misinformation in their curriculum standards.",
      "He called the new standards an \u201cunfortunate\u201d departure from Oklahoma's traditionally strong social studies standards.",
      "\u201cIt is just inappropriate to promote conspiracy theories about the election in standards,\u201d he said.",

      "The deal does represent a  significant breakthrough in deepening ties in the UK's most important trading relationship and paves the way for more gains while still allowing scope for pursuing other trade deals.",
      "But ultimately what has been agreed so far only dismantles a fraction of the trade barriers erected post-Brexit.",
      "Those producing and selling foodstuffs between Britain and the EU, in particular, are celebrating a reduction in red tape and checks.",
      "The agreement on plant and animal health, or sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPS), goes further than envisaged a few months ago. By agreeing to follow EU rules, the government has faced accusations of selling out on sovereignty. But it will smooth the path for over 1,500 products crossing borders.",
      "The new UK-EU deal at a glance",
      "Brexitcast: The EU-UK Deal (and our Rachel Reeves interview)",
      "For more than four years, those selling agricultural products from Britain to the EU have had to comply with extra certification and checks, intended to prevent the spread of disease and ensure food safety.",
      "Amid frequent complaints of forms stretching to dozens of pages and fish and other perishables rotting in transit, the Food & Drink Federation claims that exports of such items to the EU have dropped by a third since 2019.",
      "Small companies were particularly likely to conclude it wasn't worth the effort; the variety of products being exported was reduced as costs increased. Formalities on items coming into the UK, too, have been ramped up, albeit more gradually.",
      "By doing away with some of the paperwork and inspections, the government claims this agreement - and the one centred on energy - will be worth \u00a38.9bn to the UK by 2040.",
      "Those predictions are always uncertain but that's roughly equivalent to 0.3% of GDP - helpful but not quite the \"huge\" boost to growth it claims. And that would recoup only a small  fraction of the 4% of GDP the government's own independent forecasters reckon has been foregone as a result of  Brexit.",
      "What about prices?",
      "Some studies suggest that greater red tape has contributed to higher prices for foodstuffs imported from the EU in recent years.",
      "And while retailers are among those welcoming this deal, it's not guaranteed that any savings in costs will be passed on, although the deal could limit the degree of future increases in the price of - that depends on suppliers passing on savings.",
      "The key concession made by the UK was an extension to the agreement on fisheries by 12 years. That sector represents just 0.04% of GDP, but clearly this will be a big disappointment to some fishing communities, concerned by an encroachment of rights. However, exports of fish to the EU have fallen by 29% over the course of just a few  years - the SPS agreement is likely to help reverse that loss.",
      "What's been agreed in detail so far may not provide the \"huge\" boost to growth the government wants, but there is more that should be ahead.",
      "The youth mobility scheme could deliver significant gains, depending on the details that are hammered out, as could the mutual recognition of professional qualifications.",
      "But even those are unlikely to repair even the majority of the damage to growth some economists reckon Brexit has caused.",
      "The independent Office for Budget Responsibility, the official forecasters, had reckoned that as a result of Brexit GDP will be the equivalent of 4% lower than it could have been. That's the equivalent of costing the economy \u00a3100bn per year.",
      "Fully compensating for that, analysts reckon, would involve the UK rejoining the single market and customs union and allowing freedom of movement - all of which the government reiterated today are \"red lines\" it's not prepared to cross.",
      "But there is still a very significant triumph the government can claim. In a short period of time, it has tied up trade agreements with India and the US - and struck this improved deal with the EU.",
      "The latter, in particular, may have been given added impetus by President Trump's trade hostility.",
      "Knowing it perhaps could rely less on that traditional ally across the Atlantic may not have driven the EU and UK into each others arms, but it likely added a new focus on working to break down barriers previously thought insurmountable.",
      "Moreover, the UK has achieved something many commentators thought not possible in the early years of Brexit, securing a deal (albeit limited) with the US without lowering food standards and so managing to align with EU rules.",
      "This deal may not be a huge growth gamechanger. But it paves the way for reaching more common ground with the EU while allowing the UK to strengthen ties with the US on services, in particular financial services, and technology - areas of growing importance for British firms doing business with America.",
      "And that strategic focus on building on our economic strength is not to be sniffed at, particularly at a time of geopolitical uncertainty"

      "For outdoor workers, even a 20-minute break from the heat and humidity, such as in well-designed cooling stations, can make a difference.",
      "But beyond this, active cooling will become increasingly critical as temperatures continue to rise due to climate change.",
      "Morgan Stanley is predicting that the annual growth rate of the cooling market, already worth $235bn (\u00a3180bn) a year, could more than double by 2030.",
      "Yet existing cooling devices have serious drawbacks. One issue the refrigerant - the fluid that transitions back and forth from liquid to gas, in a process that transfers heat.",
      "It's common for them to leak from standard systems, harming both efficiency and potentially health.",
      "The refrigerants typically used in cooling today are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), a group of synthetic gases with high global warming potential. HFCs are much more potent than carbon dioxide.",
      "So one option is to replace the refrigerants with more climate-friendly versions. But the candidates with the lower global warming potential, also have problems.",
      "For instance, propane is highly flammable. Ammonia is toxic. Carbon dioxide works at high pressures, requiring specialised equipment.",
      "But as many places phase down HFCs, alternative refrigerants will remain important.",
      "Ms Sachar says that we still need refrigerants because for home cooling, \"A/Cs as we know them today will continue to be the solution, at least for the next decade or so\".",
      "In the longer term, some scientists are looking toward cooling devices that don't need liquid refrigerants at all.",
      "Lindsay Rasmussen, who manages building and land-use projects at the energy non-profit RMI, calls these \"revolutionary technologies\".",
      "A major set of revolutionary cooling tech is solid-state cooling. This uses solid materials and some sort of additional force to induce temperature changes. That extra force could be pressure, voltage, magnets or mechanical stress.",
      "Ms Rasmussen says that solid-state devices can go further than incremental improvements because \"not only do they eliminate those super-polluting refrigerants, but they can also offer improved efficiency to the systems\".",
      "RMI has identified between 10 and 20 start-ups working on early versions of solid-state cooling devices.",
      "One of those startups is the German company Magnotherm, which uses magnets. Certain materials change temperature when exposed to magnetic fields.",
      "\"With our technology, it's inherently safe because it's not toxic, it's a metal, and we operate at very low pressures,\" according to Timur Sirman, the CEO and cofounder of Magnotherm.",
      "The idea of magnetocaloric cooling has been around for years, but commercialising it is relatively new. Magnotherm has built about 40 beverage coolers, and about five refrigerators, in what is so far a manual and in-house process.",
      "The permanent magnets are the most expensive part of the technology, Mr Sirman reports. \"But it never breaks, so we can always reuse this quite cost-intensive component.\"",
      "The company is seeking out alternative sources of magnetic fields, as well as optimising materials, as they aim to dramatically increase the cooling capacity of their devices.",
      "Mr Sirman believes that if you account for the efficiency and health issues of refrigerants, like leakages, Magnotherm products can compete on price. \"We are not targeting customers who are only looking at initial cost.\"",
      "He acknowledges that for now the company's beverage coolers are quite pricey. Their customers tend to be early adopters of new technologies.",
      "Another technology under development is thermoelectric cooling.",
      "This involves moving heat between two sides of a device. With the application of electrical energy, heat is transferred in the direction of the current.",
      "A notable thermoelectric start-up is Phononic, which is based in the US and has an additional manufacturing facility in Thailand.",
      "Millions of Phononic cooling devices are now in use, including in data centres, supermarkets and other buildings.",
      "Their cooling devices are built in a similar way to computer chips, using semiconducting materials to transfer the heat.",
      "\"Our chips are really thin, really small, but they get really cold. They consume a small amount of electricity in generating that coldness, but they pack one hell of a punch,\" says Tony Atti, the CEO of Phononic.",
      "He says that, to work at their best, traditional fridges need to be run all the time.",
      "But  thermoelectric devices can be easily switched on off. This helps to reduce the costs, energy use and space requirements.",
      "\"We like to present the coolness on demand where you need it,\" says Mr Atti.",
      "Another advantage is that thermoelectric cooling can operate silently. \"That's because there's zero moving parts,\" Ms Rasmussen explains. \"The heat is occurring because of the reaction in the material level.\"",
      "In contrast, standard vapour compression systems contain pumps, condensers and expanders for refrigerant, which all generate much of the noise.",
      "A different type of solid-state cooling is elastocaloric cooling. This achieves temperature changes through mechanical stress to elastocaloric materials, which can cool down or heat up with the application of stress.",
      "Researchers in four European countries are collaborating on SMACool, an elastocaloric air conditioner that uses metal tubes made from specific metallic alloys.",
      "At the moment, elastocaloric prototypes have much lower cooling capacity than commercial air conditioning. And the maximum possible efficiency of SMACool is still lower than that of conventional air conditioning, although the aim is to beat the energy efficiency of A/C.",
      "However, progress is continuing. A team led by Hong Kong researchers recently created an A/C alternative that achieved a cooling power of 1,284W\u2014the first time an elastocaloric device surpassed the 1,000W mark. One innovation was using graphene nanofluid rather than distilled water to transfer the heat.",
      "Overall, Ms Rasmussen says, solid-state devices are generally not yet as powerful as conventional vapour-compression air conditioning. But she expects performance improvements over time.",
      "She also expects improvements in affordability. So far solid-state cooling has mainly been deployed in wealthy countries.",
      "A key question, Ms Rasmussen says, is \"Can these technologies scale up to where they could be affordable for those who need it the most and where the greatest demand for cooling is coming from?\"",

    "published": "Mon, 19 May 2025 19:37:38 GMT",
    "summary": "Borrowing costs for long-term US government debt jumped past 5% for the first time in 18 months, before retreating.",
    "story": [
      "Investors might have hoped the turmoil that hit financial markets last month was over. But another bout of volatility in US borrowing costs is a sign that worries continue to bubble.",
      "The interest rate on the US government's long-term debt surpassed the 5% on Monday, before retreating slightly. That was the highest level since October 2023.",
      "It came after Moody's downgraded the US government's credit rating on Friday, citing the rising debt over the past decade.",
      "Congress is meanwhile advancing a tax-and-spending bill that would add trillions to the US government's $36tn in debt.",
      "What is a government bond?",
      "When a government wants to borrow money, it usually does so by selling bonds - sometimes called Treasuries - to investors on financial markets.",
      "Investors buy the bond, providing the government with cash, and are typically repaid, plus interest over a number of pre-agreed years.",
      "Just as with a regular loan, bonds perceived to be risky have higher interest rates, also called yields.",
      "Investors who buy bonds are mainly made up of financial institutions, ranging from pension funds to central banks such as the Bank of England.",
      "Some hold on to the bonds until the term of the loan expires, while others sell them to other investors.",
      "What's happening with US bonds?",
      "Historically, the US government has been shielded from having to pay high interest rates, because Treasuries have been considered safe.",
      "That is because the US economy has been strong, with stable prices, and the US government was considered a reliable partner, unlikely to default.",
      "The yields on 30-year Treasuries hovered around 3% for much of decade following the 2008 financial crisis.",
      "When it crossed 5% in October 2023, it was the first time it had hit that threshold in 16 years.",
      "The yield on 30-year Treasuries climbed to 5.04% on Monday, up from 4.9% on Friday before the downgrade, before falling back under the 5% mark.",
      "So what are the new risks?",
      "Yields started rising in 2021, as the US was hit by soaring prices after the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Concerns reignited last month, after President Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs globally, which analysts said would hurt the economy and drive up prices.",
      "At the same time, the US has been running up its debt, with little sign of slowdown in sight.",
      "On Friday, Moody's downgraded the US government's credit rating, citing the growing debt and little progress toward resolving it.",
      "The move was not unexpected. Moody's was the last of the three rating agencies to take the step and had warned in 2023 that this might happen.",
      "But the situation it described was underscored when part of Congress voted on Sunday to advance a tax bill that would add at least $3tn to US debt over the next decade.",
      "The \"Moody's downgrade is, effectively, a political assessment, as much as it is an economic one\", wrote Macquarie Bank analyst Thierry Wizman.",
      "\"The political and institutional breakdown - in regard to the US's lack of capacity to 'course correct', is the true meaning of the downgrade, rather than the high debt load itself.\"",
      "How does this affect ordinary Americans?",
      "According to Moody's, interest payments in the US are on a path to consume 30% of the federal government's revenue by 2035, compared with 9% in 2021.",
      "If the US government is spending more on debt interest repayments, it can affect budgets and public spending as it becomes more costly for the government to sustain itself.",
      "Just as importantly, interest rates for the government typically influence interest rates charged on other kinds of loans, such as mortgages or credit cards.",
      "So higher interest rates for the government mean higher interest rates for households and businesses, too.",
      "Businesses, especially small ones, are likely to be hardest hit by any immediate change in borrowing rates, as most homeowners in the US have fixed-rate deals of between 15 and 30 years.",
      "If businesses can't get access to credit, that can halt economic growth and lead to job losses over time.",
      "First-time buyers and those wishing to move home could also face higher costs."

      "Legacy of Data",
      "When 23andMe filed for bankruptcy protection in March, attorneys general from multiple US states advised its customers to purge their information from the firm's database.",
      "At the time, the company said it would continue to protect customer data as laid out in its privacy policy, and any buyer of the company would have to abide by laws that apply to how customer data is treated.",

      "Domestic energy prices are forecast to fall in July, the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap for a year.",
      "The bill of a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by \u00a3129 a year, a drop of nearly 7%, analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted.",
      "The fall would mean a typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit would cost \u00a31,720, down from the current level of \u00a31,849.",
      "The price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, not the total bill - so if you use more, you pay more.",
      "The energy price cap covers around 22 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is set every three months by Ofgem.",
      "The cap changes every three months and the regulator illustrates the effect of this with the annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity.",
      "This typical household is assumed to use 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit.",
      "The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market.",
      "\"The fall in the price cap is a welcome development and will bring much-needed breathing space for households after a prolonged period of high energy costs,\" said Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight.",
      "He added that, while it was \"a step in the right direction\", prices were not falling enough for those households still struggling with cost of living, and bills \"remain well above the levels seen at the start of the decade\".",
      "\"As such, there remains a risk that energy will remain unaffordable for many,\" he said.",
      "Abigail Ward, policy manager at the Energy Saving Trust, which promotes energy efficiency, welcomed the forecast of cheaper bills.",
      "However she added that \"households will still be paying \u00a3100 more a year on their energy bills than last summer, proving that we're still feeling the impacts of fluctuating international wholesale energy markets\".",
      "\"This is why we urgently need to see policy action from the UK government to reduce energy bills by upgrading homes at scale.\"",
      "Andy Manning, head of energy policy at Citizens Advice, said the drop \"might ease the burden of high bills for some households\", but added that \"it'll be cold comfort for those pushed to the brink by the legacy of the energy crisis\".",
      "\"Energy use and bills typically go down during the summer months, but the government can't get complacent,\" he said, calling for more support for those struggling with energy bills.",
      "Citizen Advice research from February 2025 shows that 6.7 million people in Great Britain are living in a household in debt to their energy supplier, with over 8.3 million households finding it difficult to afford their energy bills.",

    "story": [
      "Among the cactuses in the desert of Arizona, just outside Phoenix, an extraordinary collection of buildings is emerging that will shape the future of the global economy and the world.",
      "The hum of further construction is creating not just a factory for the world's most advanced semiconductors. Eventually, it will mass produce the most advanced chips in the world. This work is being done in the US for the first time, with the Taiwanese company behind it pledging to spend billions more here in a move aimed at heading off the threat of tariffs on imported chips.",
      "It is, in my view, the most important factory in the world, and it's being built by a company you may not have heard of: TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. It makes 90% of the world's advanced semiconductors. Until now they were all made on the island of Taiwan, which is 100 miles east of the Chinese mainland. The Apple chip in your iPhone, the Nvidia chips powering your ChatGPT queries, the chips in your laptop or computer network, all are made by TSMC.",
      "Its Arizona facility \"Fab 21\" is closely guarded. Blank paper or personal devices are not allowed in case designs are leaked. It houses some of the most important intellectual property in the world, and the process to make these chips is one of the most complicated and intensive in global manufacturing.",
      "They're hugely protective of the secrets that lie within. Important customers, such as Apple and Nvidia, trust this company to safeguard their designs for future products.",
      "But after months of asking, TSMC let the BBC in to look at the partial transfer of what some argue is the most critical, expensive, complex and important manufacturing in the world.",
      "The poster child for Trump's policy",
      "President Trump certainly seems to think so. He often mentions the factory in passing. \"TSMC is the biggest there is,\" he has said. \"We gradually lost the chip business, and now it's almost exclusively in Taiwan. They stole it from us.\" This is one of the US president's regular refrains.",
      "TSMC's recent decision to expand its investments in the US by a further $100bn (\u00a375bn) is something Trump attributes to his threats of tariffs on Taiwan and on the global semiconductor business.",
      "The expansion of the Arizona facility, which was announced in March is, he believes, the poster child for his economic policies - in particular the encouragement of foreign companies to relocate factories to the US to avoid hefty tariffs.",
      "China is also watching developments carefully. Taiwan's chip-making prowess has been part of what its government has called its \"Silicon Shield\", against a much-feared invasion. While the original strategy was to make Taiwan indispensable in this area of critical technology, the pandemic supply chain difficulties changed the calculus because relying on a single country seemed like a greater risk.",
      "China claims the self-ruled Taiwan as its territory but Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland.",
      "So, many currents of the world economy, frontier technology and geopolitics flow through this one site and within it lies the essential contradiction of Trump's economic and diplomatic policy.",
      "He sees this plant as the exemplar of America First, and the preservation of economic and military superiority over China. Yet the manufacture of these modern miniaturised miracles at the frontier of physics and chemistry inherently relies on a combination of the very best technologies from around the world.",
      "The cleanest environment on Earth",
      "Greg Jackson, one of the facilities managers, takes me around in a golf buggy. The factories are almost a carbon copy of the TSMC spaces in Taiwan, where he trained. \"I would say these facilities are probably some of the most advanced and complicated in the world,\" he says.",
      "\"It's quite the dichotomy. You've got really, really small chips with really small structures, and it takes this massive facility with all the infrastructure to be able to make them... Just the sheer complexity, the amount of systems that it takes, is staggering.\"",
      "Inside the \"Gowning Building\", workers dress in protective clothing before crossing a bridge that is supposed to create the cleanest environment on Earth, in order to protect the production of these extraordinary microscopic transistors that create the microchips underpinning everything.",
      "Konstantinos Ninios, an engineer, shows me some of the very first productions from TSMC Arizona: a silicon wafer with what is known as \"4 nanometre chips\".",
      "\"This is the most advanced wafer in the US right now,\" he explains. \"[It] contains about 10 to 14 trillion transistors... The whole process is 3,000 to 4,000 steps.\"",
      "If you could somehow shrink your body to the same scale and get inside the wafer, he says that the many different layers would look like very tall streets and skyscrapers.",
      "Manufacturing manipulation of atoms",
      "TSMC was founded at the behest of the Taiwanese government in 1987, when chip executive Morris Chang was directed to start the business. The model was to become a dedicated foundry for microchips, manufacturing other companies' designs. It became wildly successful.",
      "Driving the advancement of the technology is the miniaturisation of the smallest feature on chips. Their size is measured these days in billionths of a metre or nanometres. This progress has enabled mobile phones to become smartphones, and is now setting the pace for the mass deployment of artificial intelligence.",
      "It requires incredible complexity and expense through the use of \"extreme ultraviolet (UV) light\". This is used to etch the intricate building blocks of our modern existence in a process called \"lithography\".",
      "Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy",
      "Trump's chips strategy: The US will struggle to take on Asia",
      "Gold is booming - but investors lured in by the hype could lose out, warn experts",
      "The world's dependence on TSMC is built on highly specialised bus-sized machines, which are in turn sourced almost entirely from a Dutch company called ASML, including in Arizona.",
      "These machines shoot UV light tens of thousands of times through drops of molten tin, which creates a plasma, and is then refracted through a series of specialised mirrors.",
      "The almost entirely automated process for each wafer of silicon is repeated thousands of times in layers over months, before the $1m LP-sized wafer of 4nm silicon chips is formed.",
      "\"Just imagine a particle or a dust particle falling into this,\" Mr Ninios says to me incredulously. \"The transistors are not going to work. So all of this is cleaner than hospital operating rooms.\"",
      "Caution in Taiwan",
      "Taiwan does not have special access to the raw materials - but it has the know-how to stay years ahead of other companies in the intricate process of producing these atomic building blocks of modern life.",
      "Some in the Taiwanese government are cautious about spreading the frontier of this technology off the island. Trump wasted little time in claiming the firm's decision to bring its highest level of technology to the US was due to his economic policies.",
      "He said this would not have happened without the stick of his planned tariffs on Taiwan and semiconductors. Those I speak to at TSMC are diplomatic about that claim.",
      "Much of this was already planned and subsidised under former US President Biden's Chips Act.",
      "On the walkway into the building are photographs showing Biden's visit in 2022, with the building site draped in the Stars and Stripes and a banner saying \"a future Made in America\".",
      "\"The semiconductor supply chain is global,\" says TSMC Arizona President Rose Castanares. \"There's really no single country at this moment that can do everything from chemicals to wafer manufacturing to packaging, and so it's very difficult to unwind that whole thing very quickly.\"",
      "'Non-Red' supply chains to counter China",
      "As for the semiconductor supply chain, tariffs will not help. The supply chain stretches all over the world. Whether it's the silicon wafers from Japan, the machines required from the Netherlands, or mirrors from Germany, all sorts of materials from all around the world are required. Now, they could face import charges.",
      "That said, TSMC's boss was quick off the mark in confirming the expansion of the US site at an event with Trump at the White House. In recent weeks, America's tech elite - from Apple's Tim Cook, to Nvidia's Jensen Huang - have been queueing up to tell the world that TSMC Arizona will now produce many of the chips in their US products.",
      "The global chip industry is very sensitive to the economic cycle, but its cutting-edge technology enjoys very healthy margins, that could cushion some of these planned tariffs.",
      "There are many geopolitical subtexts here. The factory sits at the heart of US strategy to gain technological, AI and economic supremacy over China.",
      "Both the Biden and Trump administrations have developed policies to try and limit Chinese access to the frontier semiconductor technology - from a ban on exports to China of ASML's machines, to new legislation to ban the use of Huawei AI chips in US software or technology anywhere in the world.",
      "Taiwan's President Lai this week urged democracies such as Japan and the US to develop \"non-Red\" supply chains to counter China.",
      "Not everyone is convinced that this strategy is working, however. Chinese technologists have been effective at working around the bans to develop competitive indigenous technology. And Bill Gates this week said that these policies \"have forced the Chinese in terms of chip manufacturing and everything to go full speed ahead\".",
      "Trump wants TSMC Arizona to become a foundation stone for his American golden age. But the company's story to date is perhaps the ultimate expression of the success of modern globalisation.",
      "So for now, it's a battle for global tech and economic supremacy, in which Taiwan's factory technology, some of which is now being moved to the Arizona desert, is the critical asset.",

    "published": "Mon, 19 May 2025 15:59:24 GMT",
    "summary": "A new deal extending access for EU boats in UK waters has been agreed as part of a wider softening of relations with the bloc.",
    "story": [
      "Some sections of Scotland's fishing industry have accused Sir Keir Starmer's government of \"capitulating\" to the EU over a deal on access to UK waters.",
      "Labour ministers have agreed a 12-year deal which extends existing access for EU boats in exchange for reduced checks and restrictions on food exports.",
      "The agreement was described as \"disastrous\" by the Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) while Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes said it was a \"great betrayal of our fishing fleet\".",
      "But fish farming body Salmon Scotland welcomed the deal as a \"slashing of red tape\" which will allow Scottish products and people easier access to the EU.",
      "The prime minister officially announced the deal as part of the first UK-EU summit, describing it as a \"win-win\".",
      "He said it would \"tear down\" barriers to trade and end the \"needlessly difficult\" process of selling Scottish products in Europe.",
      "Starmer added the fishing agreement would protect UK access with no increase in EU vessels, while other measures meant shellfish could now be sold again in Europe.",
      "\"This agreement isn't about revisiting the stale old debates of the past,\" he said.",
      "\"It's time now for Britain to look forwards and outwards as a proud, sovereign nation on the world stage - to get the best deal for the people of Scotland and Britain. \"",
      "The new sanitary and phytosanitary agreement (SPS) would also benefit other agricultural exporters while holidaymakers will be able to use eGates at some airports to cut down on passport queue wait times, Starmer added.",
      "Forbes welcomed closer co-operation which \"unpicks a small part of the damage that  Brexit continues to inflict\".",
      "But she criticised the lack of consultation with the Scottish government over the fishing deal.",
      "\"Given the importance of fishing to Scotland it is also astonishing that the Scottish government was giving no warning of this great betrayal of our fishing fleet,\" she said.",
      "The previous post-Brexit deal saw the UK regain 25% of fishing rights from the EU, but it also gave European boats continuous access to UK waters.",
      "It was due to expire at the end of June 2026 but the new agreement will see that extended until the summer of 2038.",
      "The deal does not include any change to current access to fish for coastal communities. There is no reduction in the British quota or increase in the quota the EU is allowed to catch.",
      "But SFF chief executive Elspeth Macdonald said she was worried the agreement would end any \"leverage\" the UK has in future negotiations.",
      "She told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"This is not a roll over, it's a total capitulation to the EU and a disastrous outcome for the Scottish fishing fleet.",
      "\"The EU have clearly reneged on a deal that they signed up to in 2020 and have said that they require to have another multi-year deal.",
      "\"But in doing so the UK loses all its negotiating capital and all its leverage, so the EU continues to take a far bigger share of the resources in our waters than they are entitled to.",
      "\"We've always been in this position where fishing seems to be the expendable price for something else that the UK wants.\"",
      "Cutting 'red tape'",
      "While the deal has been criticised, it has also been welcomed in other parts of Scotland's fishing and food production industries.",
      "Tavish Scott, chief executive of Salmon Scotland, said the new agreement would help cut the time taken to get products into the EU market.",
      "The body said international sales of salmon from Scotland hit a record \u00a3844m in 2024, with France, where Scottish salmon is given the \"Label Rouge\" quality mark, the largest market at \u00a3462m.",
      "Mr Scott said the deal could open up new opportunities for Scottish producers in Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, where demand is rising despite tough competition from Norway and Chile.",
      "\"This breakthrough will ease the burden on our farmers, processors and the communities they support,\" he said.",
      "\"Scottish salmon is the UK's largest food export, with strong demand in the EU, the US and beyond.\"",
      "The deal also benefits shellfish producers after the EU banned British fishermen from selling live mussels, oysters, clams, cockles and scallops to its member states in 2021.",
      "Under those rules, fishermen were previously not allowed to transport the animals to the EU unless they had already been treated in purification plants.",
      "'Sold down the river'",
      "Mike Park, chief executive of the Scottish White Fish Association, described the deal as an \"utter betrayal\".",
      "He said it was the \"third time\" the fishing industry had been \"sold down the river,\" citing decisions by former prime minister Ted Heath, who took the UK into the EU in 1973, and Boris Johnson, who negotiated its exit in the aftermath of Brexit in 2020.",
      "Mr Park said: \"We understand the free flow of food products, the EU benefit from that and the UK benefit from it.",
      "\"But here we have a massive fleet coming into UK waters and the UK fishing industry gets nothing out of it.\"",
      "Scottish Conservative MP for Gordon and Buchan, Harriet Cross, described the deal as a \"surrender\" and \"one of the biggest acts of betrayal that our fishing industry has seen in Scotland.\"",
      "She said: \"Our fishermen have been used as a pawn by Keir Starmer, which will result in catastrophic consequences for our coastal communities.\"",
      "The UK government also announced a \u00a3360m fund to invest in coastal communities as part of the agreement.",
      "It said that would go towards new technology and equipment to modernise the fleet, training to upskill workforces and help to \"revitalise\" coastal communities.",
      "About 4,000 people are employed in Scotland's commercial sea fishing industry, according to a Scottish government report published in 2023.",
      "In 2022, it brought \u00a3335m into the Scottish economy, more than half of which came from Aberdeenshire, including the UK's largest fishing port at Peterhead.",
      "The fish farming and aquaculture industries account for about 2,200 jobs and brought in \u00a3337m to the Scottish economy in 2022.",
      "Keir Starmer has described this UK-EU deal as a \"win-win\" but that is not necessarily how it is viewed by every part of the Scottish fishing industry.",
      "The sharply contrasting reactions of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation - which has accused the UK government of \"capitulation\" - and Salmon Scotland, which has welcomed an agreement it believes will \"slash red tape\", underlines the fact that any deal involves trade-offs.",
      "The UK government is trying to offset the disappointment of some in the fishing industry with a \u00a3360m fund for coastal communities.",
      "There are aspects of closer cooperation between the UK and EU that the Scottish government is happy to welcome.",
      "However, there was never going to be a package that would satisfy SNP ministers, as they favour a return to the EU.",
      "They argue the best way for that to be achieved is through Scottish independence. But that debate has lost much of its previous energy.",
      "An earlier \"reset\" in relations between the UK and devolved governments has improved how they work together.",
      "But Scottish ministers argue that they should have been consulted on today's deal, despite foreign affairs being a matter reserved to Westminster.",

    "summary": "Lenders will have to carry out affordability checks and shoppers will have faster access to refunds under the plans.",
    "story": [
      "The government has announced new rules aiming to protect shoppers using buy now, pay later services, saying it wants to end the \"wild west\" of unregulated borrowing.",
      "Under the legislation, lenders will have to carry out affordability checks to stop people taking on too much debt and shoppers will have faster access to refunds.",
      "The use of buy now, pay later (BNPL) has surged recently, with 11 million people in the UK estimated to have used it in the last year, but there have been fears some are spending more than they can afford.",
      "Consumer groups welcomed the move and said many users did not realise they were taking on debt they might struggle to repay.",
      "Under BNPL, rather than paying the full amount of a purchase in one go, shoppers can spread payments into smaller amounts over a short period of time, usually only weeks or months.",
      "For some people this can be a convenient way of spreading the cost of shopping, but there are fears some consumers could be taking on too much debt.",
      "BNPL products are currently unregulated and Citizens Advice said the new measures were a \"crucial step\" towards better protection for shoppers.",
      "\"For too long, people have been exposed to unaffordable debt from a BNPL sector that has operated in a regulatory grey area,\" said Tom MacInnes, director of policy at Citizens Advice.",
      "\"For some, this has had dire consequences. Many people are struggling to repay credit they can't afford, falling behind on essential bills and often needing emergency support, like food bank vouchers.\"",
      "Measures to tighten oversight of the sector have been discussed for years, and the previous government unveiled plans in 2023.",
      "Under the new legislation, which is due to take effect next year, the government says BNPL firms will have to follow consistent standards so shoppers know what they are signing up to, whether they can afford the purchase and how to get help if needed.",
      "It says this means \"upfront\" checks on affordability, faster access to refunds, and the right to complain to the Financial Ombudsman.",
      "Emma Reynolds, economic secretary to the Treasury, said BNPL had \"transformed shopping for millions\", but had left consumers exposed and operated as a \"wild west\".",
      "\"These new rules will protect shoppers from debt traps and give the sector the certainty it needs to invest, grow, and create jobs,\" she added.",
      "Last week, a comprehensive survey by the UK financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), found the number using BNPL had \"risen significantly\", climbing by two million in the past three years.",
      "It said 40% of lone parents and 35% of women aged between 25 and 34 use BNPL  products.",
      "Lisa Webb, consumer law expert at the Which? consumer association, said its research indicated \"many users do not realise they are taking on debt or consider the prospect of missing payments\".",
      "A spokesman for Klarna, one of the biggest suppliers of BNPL services in the UK, said the company had supported regulation for the sector since 2020.",
      "\"It's good to see progress on regulation, and we look forward to working with the FCA on rules to protect consumers and encourage innovation,\" he said.",
      "Another major BNPL provider, Clearpay, said it would \"support the FCA to deliver fit-for-purpose regulation that ensures consumer protection, provides much-needed innovation in consumer credit, and supports the UK's thriving FinTech sector\".",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8jg80j771zo",
    "published": "Sun, 18 May 2025 23:24:06 GMT",
    "summary": "The previous government had said autonomous vehicles were \"set to be on the road\" by 2026.",
    "story": [
      "Uber has said it is \"ready to go\" now with driverless taxis in the UK - but the government has put back the date it expects to approve fully self-driving vehicles.",
      "The previous administration said fully autonomous cars were \"set to be on roads by 2026\", but the new government says it is now more likely to happen in the second half of 2027.",
      "While limited self-driving technology is already permitted on UK roads, a human driver must be at the wheel and responsible for the vehicle, even if automated technology is being used.",
      "With some companies trialling more advanced tech on British streets, I took an automated car ride across central London in a car using a system developed by UK AI firm Wayve.",
      "\"We're ready to launch robotaxis in the UK as soon as the regulatory environment is ready for us,\" said Andrew Macdonald, senior vice president of mobility at Uber, who joined me for the ride.",
      "The ride-hailing firm is working with 18 automated car tech companies including Wayve.",
      "It is one of several companies which already offers robotaxis in the US.",
      "They are also on the roads in China, the UAE and Singapore.",
      "But Mr Macdonald disagreed that the UK was behind the rest of the world, arguing that the US and China were ahead largely because that is where the majority of the tech had been developed.",
      "\"We are working quickly and will implement self-driving vehicle legislation in the second half of 2027\", the Department for Transport said in a statement.",
      "\"We are also exploring options for short-term trials and pilots to create the right conditions for a thriving self-driving sector,\" it added.",
      "'Hands-off' experience",
      "In the US, Mr Macdonald said robotaxis typically operate for 20 hours per day, seven days per week.",
      "Even though there is no driver to pay, Uber says the fare is currently the same as a ride with a human behind the wheel.",
      "The option to take one appears on the app if one is available, and customers can opt in or out.",
      "That's partly because, aside from the regulatory environment, another potential barrier to their uptake is the public's reticence about travelling in a self-driving vehicle.",
      "A poll by YouGov in 2024 suggested that 37% of Brits would feel \"very unsafe\" travelling in a car without a driver.",
      "But Mr Macdonald insisted new customers' initial nervousness was short-lived and the experience soon \"becomes the new normal\".",
      "That was certainly my experience during our ride.",
      "I was in a Ford Mach-e, fitted with Wayve's autonomous driving sensors and software.",
      "It uses a radar and seven cameras. In the boot there's is a computer which is running the AI-driven software that processes all that sensor data in real time and controls the car's responses.",
      "The automated tech handled every scenario without a hitch, including pedestrians in the road, parked cars, heavy traffic, temporary traffic lights and delivery bikes.",
      "George, our safety driver, did not touch the controls once and a big red button, which shuts off the automated system immediately, was not deployed.",
      "If anything the robo-ride was a far more patient city driver than I am \u2013 and has no voice, making it a lot less chatty.",
      "Whether autonomous vehicles are more or less safe than human-driven ones is still being investigated.",
      "But numerous studies suggest that automated vehicles are less accident-prone than human drivers, based on US data.",
      "But there have been a number of incidents involving robotaxis in the countries where they operate, ranging from road accidents to passengers being locked in.",
      "In January, a man in Arizona, in the US, documented how his robotaxi drove round in circles in an airport carpark, with him trapped in the vehicle, unable to stop the car or get help.",
      "General Motors paused its driverless taxi service Cruise in San Francisco in 2023 because of safety concerns.",
      "\"The reality is that one accident is too many,\" said Uber's Mr Macdonald.",
      "\"That said, with EV (electric vehicles), human drivers\u2026 we operate in the real world and stuff happens.\"",
      "In the UK there are also practical questions around insurance, ownership and liability when a self-driving vehicle is involved in an accident. Mr Macdonald said they were all still being worked out.",
      "Tom Leggett, vehicle technology manager at Thatcham Research - an independent car safety centre - said robotaxis would have to be \"safety-led\" in the UK.",
      "\"Secondly, they will have to make sure the data is available to those who need it \u2013 insurers and those investigating incidents when they occur.\"",
      "The government says self-driving vehicles have the potential \"to build an industry worth \u00a342bn and provide 38,000 jobs by 2035.\"",
      "But of course they are source of concern for people who earn a living driving.",
      "Andy Prendergast, GMB national secretary, said the \"significant social implications\" driverless cars and taxis could have - such as potential less work or unemployment - for workers and the public must be fully considered.",
      "Uber's Mr Macdonald meanwhile believes automated vehicles will transform the way many people travel in the near future.",
      "\"I've got young kids,\" he said.",
      "\"Do I think my daughters will necessarily get their drivers licences when they turn 16?\" [the legal age in his home country, Canada].",

    "summary": "The US-China trade \"reset\" could stall the manufacturing investment coming into India, say experts.",
    "story": [
      "Just as India showed flickers of progress toward its long-held dream of becoming the world's factory, Washington and Beijing announced a trade \"reset\" that could derail Delhi's ambitions to replace China as the global manufacturing hub.",
      "Last week, Trump's tariffs on China dropped overnight - from 145% to 30%, vs 27% for India - as the two sides thrashed out an agreement in Switzerland.",
      "As a result, there's a chance manufacturing investment that was moving from China to India could either \"stall\" or \"head back\", feels Ajay Srivastava of the Delhi-based think tank, Global Trade Research Institute (GTRI).",
      "\"India's low-cost assembly lines may survive, but value-added growth is in danger.\"",
      "The change in sentiment stands in sharp relief to the exuberance in Delhi last month when Apple indicated that it was shifting most of its production of iPhones headed to the US from China to India.",
      "That may well still happen, even though US President Donald Trump revealed that he had told Apple CEO Tim Cook not to build in India because it was \"one of the highest tariff nations in the world\".",
      "\"India is well positioned to be an alternative to China as a supplier of goods to the US in the immediate term,\" Shilan Shah, an economist with Capital Economics, wrote in an investor note before the deal was announced. He pointed out that 40% of India's exports to the US were \"similar to those exported by China\".",
      "There were early signs that Indian exporters were already stepping in to fill the gap left by Chinese producers. New export orders surged to a 14-year high, according to a recent survey of Indian manufacturers.",
      "Nomura, a Japanese broking house, also pointed to growing \"anecdotal evidence\" of India emerging as a winner from \"trade diversion and supply-chain shift in low and mid-tech manufacturing\" particularly in sectors like electronics, textiles and toys.",
      "Some analysts do believe that despite the so-called trade \"reset\" between Beijing and Washington, a larger strategic decoupling between China and the US will continue to benefit India in the long run.",
      "For one, there's greater willingness by Narendra Modi's government to open its doors to foreign companies after years of protectionist policies, which could provide tailwind.",
      "India and the US are also negotiating a trade deal that could put Asia's third-largest economy in a sweet spot to benefit from the so-called \"China exodus\" - as global firms shift operations to diversify supply chains.",
      "India has just signed a trade pact with the UK, sharply cutting duties in protected sectors like whiskey and automobiles. It offers a glimpse of the concessions Delhi might offer Trump in the ongoing India-US trade talks.",
      "But all of this optimism needs to be tempered for more reasons than one.",
      "Apart from the fact that China is now back in the running, companies are also \"not entirely writing off other Asian competitors, with countries like Vietnam still on their radars\", economists Sonal Verma and Aurodeep Nandi from Nomura said in a note earlier this month.",
      "\"Hence, for India to capitalise on this opportunity, it needs to complement any tariff arbitrage with serious ease-of-doing-business reforms.\"",
      "A tough business climate has long frustrated foreign investors and stalled India's manufacturing growth, with its share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) stuck at around 15% for two decades.",
      "The Modi government's efforts, such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, have delivered only limited success in boosting this figure.",
      "The government's think tank, Niti Aayog, has acknowledged India's \"limited success\" in attracting investment shifting from China. It noted that factors like cheaper labour, simpler tax laws, lower tariffs, and proactive Free Trade Agreements helped countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Malaysia expand exports - while India lagged behind.",
      "Another major concern, says Nomura, is India's ongoing reliance on China for raw materials and components used in electronics like iPhones, limiting Delhi's ability to fully capitalise on supply chain shifts.",
      "\"India's earnings from making iPhones will only rise if more of the phone is made locally,\" Mr Srivastava told the BBC.",
      "According to him, right now Apple earns over $450 per iPhone sold in the US while India keeps less than $25 - even though the full $1,000 is counted as an Indian export.",
      "\"Just assembling more iPhones in India won't help much unless Apple and its suppliers also start making components and doing high-value work here. Without that, India's share stays small, and the export numbers go up only on paper -possibly triggering more scrutiny from the US without real economic gain for India,\" Mr Srivastava said.",
      "The jobs created by such assembly lines aren't very high quality either, says GTRI.",
      "Quite unlike companies like Nokia which set up a factory in the southern city of Chennai in 2007 where suppliers moved in together, \"today's smartphone makers mostly import parts and push for lower tariffs instead of building supply chains in India\", explained Mr Srivastava. He noted that, in certain instances, the investment made could be lower than the subsidies received under India's PLI scheme.",
      "Finally there are concerns that Chinese exporters could try to use India to reroute products to the US.",
      "India doesn't seem averse to this idea despite the pitfalls. The country's top economic adviser said last year that the country should attract more Chinese businesses to set-up export oriented factories and boost its manufacturing industry \u2013 a tacit admission that its own industrial policy hadn't delivered.",
      "But experts caution, this could further curtail India's ability to build local know-how and grow its own industrial base.",
      "All of this shows that beyond the headline-grabbing announcements by the likes of Apple, India is still a long way from realising its factory ambitions.",
      "\"Slash production costs, fix logistics, and build regulatory certainty,\" Mr Srivastava urged policymakers in a social media post.",
      "\"Let's be clear. This US-China reset is damage control, not a long-term solution. India must play the long game, or risk getting side-lined.\"",

    "story": [
      "The UK's largest gas storage facility could be closed if the government does not help support a redevelopment of the site, the boss of the company which owns it has told the BBC.",
      "Centrica chief executive Chris O'Shea told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that its Rough storage facility would be \"shut down\" without government help over energy pricing.",
      "Centrica - which owns British Gas - says the site is set to lose \u00a3100m this year, and it wants to invest \u00a32bn in the facility so it can use it to store more gas, including hydrogen.",
      "The government said the future of Rough was a commercial decision for Centrica but it was open to discussing proposals.",
      "The Rough facility is off the coast of East Yorkshire, and accounts for about half of the capacity the UK has to store gas.",
      "It was closed in 2017, but then partly reopened in October 2022 following the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Earlier this month, Centrica said it was in \"constructive discussions\" with the government for a support mechanism that would allow investment in the Rough site to proceed.",
      "The company is seeking a \"cap and floor\" pricing mechanism. This means that if energy prices fall below a certain level its revenues will be topped up, but prices would be capped if they rise too high.",
      "\"What we're asking for is simply for the government to help create the conditions which will unlock \u00a32bn of investment,\" Mr O'Shea told the BBC.",
      "\"It will create thousands of jobs in the construction phase, and it will safeguard the jobs of very highly skilled colleagues that are offshore.\"",
      "Without this investment he said the site would be decommissioned \"and we'll lose this resilience\".",
      "He said the UK currently has 12 days of gas storage, of which Rough provides six.",
      "\"So if we don't have Rough anymore, then we go down to six days. Now, if we take Rough to full capacity, we will go up to about 25, or 30 days.\"",
      "A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said while the future of Rough was a commercial decision for Centrica, \"we remain open to discussing proposals on gas storage sites, as long as it provides value for money for taxpayers\".",
      "UK has enough gas, says network after storage warning",
      "If the UK has more renewable energy, why aren't bills coming down?",
      "Last week, Mr O'Shea said the way that the energy pricing mechanism worked meant that building of renewables would not \"materially\" reduce UK electricity prices from current levels.",
      "He told Laura Kuenssberg on a visit to the North Sea platform that decarbonisation was important and also a \"huge economic opportunity\".",
      "However he added that \"the price we see today for electricity is the same as the price that we're given to new renewable developments\".",
      "\"Therefore, that new renewable development will not bring down the price.\"",
      "He added that he thought the government's 2030 target for clean energy was \"very challenging, but I think it's right that the energy secretary has set a very stretching target\".",
      "\"It's not impossible, no, but it's not easy.\"",
      "The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \"As shown by the National Energy System Operator's independent report, our mission for clean power by 2030 is achievable and will deliver a more secure energy system, which could see a lower cost of electricity and lower bills.\"",
      "Pay row",
      "Last year, Mr O'Shea told the BBC that the \u00a34.5m pay he received the previous year was \"impossible to justify\".",
      "And earlier this month, nearly 40% of Centrica's shareholders voted against the company's latest pay plans.",
      "When asked about this by Laura Kuenssberg, Mr O'Shea said: \"I don't set my own pay.",
      "\"I think it's really difficult,\" he said. \"I am unbelievably fortunate. I have a job where the market rate is is more than ever thought I would have done.\""

    "summary": "BBC's Joe Tidy spoke directly to those who claim they are responsible for hacking M&amp;S and Co-op.",
    "story": [
      "Almost daily, my phone pings with messages from hackers of all stripes.",
      "The good, the bad, the not-so-sure.",
      "I've been reporting on cyber security for more than a decade, so I know that many of them like to talk about their hacks, findings and escapades.",
      "About 99% of these conversations stay firmly locked in my chat logs and don't lead to news stories. But a recent ping was impossible to ignore.",
      "\"Hey. This is Joe Tidy from the BBC reporting on this Co-op news, correct?\" the hackers messaged me on Telegram.",
      "\"We have some news for you,\" they teased.",
      "When I cautiously asked what this was, the people behind the Telegram account - which had no name or profile picture - gave me the inside track on what they claimed to have done to M&S and the Co-op, in cyber attacks that caused mass disruption.",
      "Through messages back-and-forth over the next five hours, it became clear to me that these apparent hackers were fluent English speakers and although they claimed to be messengers, it was obvious they were closely linked to - if not intimately involved in - the M&S and Co-op hacks.",
      "They shared evidence proving that they had stolen a huge amount of private customer and employee information.",
      "I checked out a sample of the data they had given me - and then securely deleted it.",
      "Messages that confirmed suspicions",
      "They were clearly frustrated that Co-op wasn't giving in to their ransom demands but wouldn't say how much money in Bitcoin they were demanding of the retailer in exchange for the promise that they wouldn't sell or give away the stolen data.",
      "After a conversation with the BBC's Editorial Policy team, we decided that it was in the public interest to report that they had provided us with evidence proving that they were responsible for the hack.",
      "I quickly contacted the press team at the Co-op for comment, and within minutes the firm, who had initially downplayed the hack, admitted to employees, customers and the stock market about the significant data breach.",
      "Much later, the hackers sent me a long angry and offensive letter about Co-op's response to their hack and subsequent extortion, which revealed that the retailer narrowly dodged a more severe hack by intervening in the chaotic minutes after its computer systems were infiltrated. The letter and conversation with the hackers confirmed what experts in the cyber security world had been saying since this wave of attacks on retailers began \u2013 the hackers were from a cyber crime service called DragonForce.",
      "Who are DragonForce, you might be asking? Based on our conversations with the hackers and wider knowledge, we have some clues.",
      "DragonForce offers cyber criminal affiliates various services on their darknet site in exchange for a 20% cut of any ransoms collected. Anyone can sign up and use their malicious software to scramble a victim's data or use their darknet website for their public extortion.",
      "This has become the norm in organised cyber crime; it's known as ransomware-as-a-service.",
      "The most infamous of recent times has been a service called LockBit, but this is all but defunct now partly because it was cracked by the police last year.",
      "Following the dismantling of such groups, a power vacuum has emerged. Cue a tussle for dominance in this underground world, leading to some rival groups innovating their offerings.",
      "Power struggle ensues",
      "DragonForce recently rebranded itself as a cartel offering even more options to hackers including 24/7 customer support, for example.",
      "The group had been advertising its wider offering since at least early 2024 and has been actively targeting organisations since 2023, according to cyber experts like Hannah Baumgaertner, Head of Research at Silobreaker, a cyber risk protection company.",
      "\"DragonForce's latest model includes features such as administration and client panels, encryption and ransomware negotiation tools, and more,\" Ms Baumgaertner said.",
      "As a stark illustration of the power-struggle, DragonForce's darknet website was recently hacked and defaced by a rival gang called RansomHub, before re-emerging about a week ago.",
      "\"Behind the scenes of the ransomware ecosystem there seems to be some jostling - that might be for prime 'leader' position or just to disrupt other groups in order to take more of the victim share,\" said Aiden Sinnott, senior threat researcher from the cyber security company Sophos.",
      "Who is pulling the strings?",
      "DragonForce's prolific modus operandi is to post about its victims, as it has done 168 times since December 2024 - a London accountancy firm, an Illinois steel maker, an Egyptian investment firm are all included. Yet so far, DragonForce has remained silent about the retail attacks.",
      "Normally radio silence about attacks indicates that a victim organisation has paid the hackers to keep quiet. As neither DragonForce, Co-op nor M&S have commented on this point, we don't know what might be happening behind the scenes.",
      "Establishing who the people are behind DragonForce is tricky, and it's not known where they are located. When I asked their Telegram account about this, I didn't get an answer. Although the hackers didn't tell me explicitly that they were behind the recent hacks on M&S and Harrods, they confirmed a report in Bloomberg that spelt it out.",
      "Of course, they are criminals and could be lying.",
      "Some researchers say DragonForce are based in Malaysia, while others say Russia, where many of these groups are thought to be located.  We do know that DragonForce has no specific targets or agenda other than making money.",
      "And if DragonForce is just the service for other criminals to use \u2013 who is pulling the strings and choosing to attack UK retailers?",
      "In the early stages of the M&S hack, unknown sources told cyber news site Bleeping Computer that evidence is pointing to a loose collective of cyber criminals known as Scattered Spider - but this has yet to be confirmed by the police.",
      "Scattered Spider is not really a group in the normal sense of the word. It's more of a community which organises across sites like Discord, Telegram and forums \u2013 hence the description \"scattered\" which was given to them by cyber security researchers at CrowdStrike.",
      "They are known to be English-speaking and probably in the UK and the US and young \u2013 in some cases teenagers. We know this from researchers and previous arrests. In November the US charged five men and boys in their twenties and teens for alleged Scattered Spider activity. One of them is 22-year-old Scottish man Tyler Buchanan, who has not made a plea, and the rest are US based.",
      "Crackdowns by police seem to have had little effect on the hackers' determination, though. On Thursday, Google's cyber security division issued warnings that it was starting to see Scattered Spider-like attacks on US retailers now too.",
      "As for the hackers I spoke to on Telegram, they declined to answer whether or not they were Scattered Spider. \"We won't answer that question\" is all they said.",
      "Perhaps in a nod to the immaturity and attention-seeking nature of the hackers, two of them said they wanted to be known as \"Raymond Reddington\" and \"Dembe Zuma\" after characters from US crime thriller The Blacklist which involves a wanted criminal helping police take down other criminals on a blacklist.",
      "In a message to me, they boasted: \"We're putting UK retailers on the Blacklist.\"",

    "story": [
      "The government is pushing for a deal that would allow UK passport holders to use EU airport e-gates, a minister has confirmed.",
      "Nick Thomas-Symonds, who said negotiations were in the \"very final hours\" ahead of a UK-EU summit in London, described stopping people being stuck in border queues as a \"very sensible objective\".",
      "Asked whether the UK would have to follow more EU rules in some areas as part of any deals, the European relations minister told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg \"it will mean taking a sovereign choice as to... the common standards we wish to align\".",
      "Conservative MP Alex Burghart claimed the government's proposed deal with the EU could mean the UK becoming a \"rule taker\".",
      "The UK and EU will hold their first bilateral summit since Brexit on Monday, described by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer as a \"really significant moment\".",
      "Sir Keir is expected to announce a deal when he meets European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa.",
      "Announcements around trade and security have been expected to include British access to a 150 billion euro (\u00a3125 billion) EU defence fund, in what could be a boost for UK defence companies.",
      "But reports suggest there could also be agreements on allowing British travellers to use e-gates at European airports, cutting red tape on food exports and imports, and setting up a youth mobility scheme with the EU.",
      "Thomas-Symonds, who is leading the negotiations, said he was driven by \"ruthless pragmatism\" and focused on jobs, lower household bills and stronger borders.",
      "The minister also said the government would assess whether to contribute money to EU projects on a case-by-case basis, saying it would \"consider each one on its merits\".",
      "Asked whether he was confident British travellers would be able to use EU e-gates at European airports, Thomas-Symonds said: \"I'm certainly pushing for people to be able to go through far more quickly.",
      "\"I think we can all agree that not being stuck in queues and having more time to spend, whether it's on holiday or work trips, having more time to do what you want ... would be a very sensible objective.\"",
      "The minister said he was confident about a deal on food, but added \"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed\".",
      "He added: \"We know we've had lorries waiting for 16 hours, fresh food in the back not able to be exported because frankly it's just going off, red tape, all the certifications that are required, we absolutely want to reduce that.\"",
      "Youth mobility scheme could be part of EU deal, PM signals",
      "Defence deals and palace invites: UK and EU haggle before first summit since Brexit",
      "'Our business needs Irish Sea border reset'",
      "Burghart told the programme his main concern was the government signing up to EU standards and becoming \"a rule taker - one of the things we specifically left behind when we left the EU\".",
      "He said the government had not ruled out \"dynamic alignment\", which would see the UK and EU maintain equivalent regulatory standards on food and trade, despite the UK not being \"in the room\" when future decisions are taken.",
      "He added: \"As the government hasn't ruled that out we have to assume it's very firmly on the table and is about to happen.",
      "\"And if it is about to happen, then that is a surrender of some of Britain's sovereignty and we won't stand for it\".",
      "On a deal around whether young people from the EU can come to live and work in the UK and vice versa, Thomas-Symonds insisted he was negotiating around \"a smart and controlled scheme\", adding \"nobody is remotely suggesting that's freedom of movement. That's a red line for us\".",
      "The minister did not respond directly to questioning on whether there would be a cap on numbers or time-limited visas, such as in existing schemes with Australia and Canada, but did stress \"that control element is hugely important\".",
      "He also denied there were plans to exempt student numbers from overall migration figures and added \"anything agreed - and I stress this is in sensitive final hours - will be consistent with reducing the level of net migration as we've promised\".",
      "Appearing on the same programme, Liberal Democrat MP Calum Miller said he was \"troubled by the sense the government isn't seizing this moment, in the context of a changed environment, to really go further\" on EU relations.",
      "The party's spokesperson for foreign affairs said \"setting ourselves on an ambitious path towards a customs union is the best way to give some certainty to British businesses\".",
      "Miller also claimed removing red tape between the UK and EU could be worth \u00a325bn, and a customs union could increase the revenue further.",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage claimed an EU deal that included a youth mobility scheme and extending fishing rights for the EU in British waters would mean that \"to a large extent, Starmer will be betraying Brexit\" and he would \"get rid of it\" if he was prime minister.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House, Farage said a youth mobility scheme would be \"free movement of people to the under 30s\" and \"we know that'll be a one-way street - way more people will come here than will go in the other direction\".",
      "Farage suggested a deal on defence would mean \"we're going to see by the looks of it British soldiers under an EU flag\" before adding \"EU cooperation absolutely, under an EU flag, no\".",

      "This will facilitate the export and import of meat and plant products between the EU and UK and help reduce post-Brexit trade complications between Northern Ireland and Britain.",
      "In exchange, the EU insists the UK must agree to following any new SPS rules introduced in the future and accept a role for the European Court of Justice in policing the agreement.",
      "Those conditions will likely be unpopular with ardent Brexit supporters.",
      "They might also put backs up in Washington and complicate the UK doing a wider future deal on agriculture with the US, as the UK would be tied to stringent EU standards.",

      "But it looks like it is losing the internal EU argument, with the Nordics, the Baltics, Poland, Italy and the Netherlands favouring more openness on defence contracts, and particularly with the EU's biggest economic power, Germany, championing the UK.",

      "Political leaders will seek to justify increases in defence spending by insisting to voters that it's for their personal security and in the interest of their national economy, with boosts in revenue for domestic defence industries.",
      "But achieving a pan-European industrial base - built to be efficient, avoid duplication, and to replace much of the US capacity relied on by the continent today - would mean some European countries winning more defence contracts than others.",
      "It would also mean some national businesses shutting down, in favour of better-suited ones elsewhere on the continent.",
      "That's a hard sell for political leaders facing their voters.",
      "As is another big trade-off: Big increases in defence spending will mean governments have less money to spend on public services.",

      "Within moments, a 13-year-old boy has been arrested and we're back outside in the morning light. The family screams on the front lawn as the camera returns to the boy, now a detainee in the dark interior of a police van.",
      "All this happens in three minutes. In one take. It is an early scene in Netflix's hit show Adolescence, which was watched by more than 120 million people worldwide in its first month.",
      "It wouldn't have been possible to film a sequence quite like this five years ago, the show's cinematographer Matthew Lewis claimed in a recent interview. Each of the four, roughly one hour-long episodes of Adolescence was shot entirely in one take, known as a \"oner\", with the camera frequently following characters through frantic scenes, or switching from handheld to vehicle-mounted filming.",
      "Lightweight, self-stabilising cameras that can adjust to dramatic changes in environmental lighting have sparked a small revolution in the film and TV industry.",
      "At the end of Adolescence's second episode, for instance, the camera moves from filming inside a car to crossing a road, to flying over nearby streets, and then to ground level again.",
      "You can just about detect the switch from drone to human operator \u2013 there's a minuscule wobble \u2013 but unless you're looking for them, these transitions are effectively seamless.",
      "It was made possible in part by a DJI Ronin 4D, a small, high-resolution camera that has multiple built-in sensors for detecting movement in relation to the floor and nearby objects.",
      "This allows internal mechanisms to compensate for that movement and achieve smooth, stable footage.",
      "The result is \"phenomenal\", says seasoned filmmaker and Boston University professor Tim Palmer.",
      "He initially doubted that episodes of Adolescence really were shot in a single take. \"As soon as I saw it I knew, no, that was absolutely done in one take.\"",
      "Camera technology has developed significantly lately, he adds.",
      "In 2014, Prof Palmer worked on a hospital drama called Critical, which required lengthy shots in busy hospital corridors. \"It was just little joystick video game controllers to make the camera pan and tilt, and that was just not precise enough,\" he recalls.",
      "Makers of such TV programmes have long tried to capture the energy of hospital environments. One episode of 1990s BBC series Cardiac Arrest opens in a hectic triaging unit. As far as I can tell, there is only one cut in the first 10 minutes \u2013 but the camera moves rather robotically back and forth. It is nowhere near as dynamic as Adolescence.",
      "Prof Palmer adds that gimbals, stabilising devices for cameras, have been around for years now, but methods of controlling them and pulling footage remotely have only recently become highly sophisticated.",
      "He also mentions how some of the latest cameras have built-in filters that can be controlled remotely, or stabilisation technology that can be activated or deactivated at the press of a button. \"That's a complete game-changer,\" he says.",
      "Long single takes are far from a new concept in cinema. There are examples dating back decades.",
      "Take the 2015 film Victoria, a hair-raising, two-hour and 20 minute feature film that its makers say was shot in a single take. Some have expressed scepticism about this in the past, but cinematographer Sturla Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen tells the BBC emphatically, \"There are no edits or cuts.\"",
      "While Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen had to rely on the technology of the time, he says that the slightly shaky images were intentional \u2013 the director wanted a film that reminded viewers of footage shot by news crews in warzones.",
      "\"It feels very much in the moment, but also like you never know what's going to happen,\" says Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen, \"You're taken on a journey.\"",
      "He used a Canon C300, a small motion picture camera well-suited to documentary filmmaking. Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen reduced the weight of the camera as much as possible by only adding essential accessories. He also practised the movements he planned to make during takes of the final film in order to achieve \"muscle memory\" of the process.",
      "\"When they suddenly start running I have to shift my grip on the camera from holding it on the side handle to the top handle \u2013 that way it shakes a little bit less,\" he explains.",
      "The Ronin 4D is DJI's \"first dedicated cinema camera\", says Brett Halladay, product education manager at the firm.",
      "He describes the extensive stabilisation technology and the fact that the device transmits footage wirelessly to on-set monitors. It automatically selects a frequency based on the best available signal.",
      "There are some limitations, though. The camera is not set up for vertical filming \u2013 increasingly in-demand with the rise of video-sharing smartphone apps such as TikTok.",
      "Mr Halladay points out that it is possible to shoot in landscape and crop to a portrait, or vertical, image, though that might not be the most \"ideal\" solution, he acknowledges.",
      "Other cameras are available. Canon, for instance, touts its line of lightweight Cinema EOS models.",
      "Barry Griffin, a manager at Canon, says these cameras are finding a market among filmmakers aiming to shoot with increased freedom, or who want to put cameras in tiny podcast studios and livestream high-quality shots of hosts and their guests.",
      "The rise of highly ergonomic cameras could have a big impact on the quality of film and TV, says Booker T Mattison, a screenwriter and director who teaches filmmaking at the University of Georgia. \"Point of view is often represented by the camera itself,\" he says. \"It absolutely, 100% allows you to tell better, more dynamic stories.\"",
      "There's a risk that obsessing over one-take TV shows could become a gimmick at the expense of good storytelling, says Carey Duffy, director of product experiences at Cooke Optics.",
      "Lightweight Cooke lenses were used by the makers of Adolescence. Mr Duffy explains that his firm designed these lenses to work with emerging, lightweight cameras and that this was possible in part because of the shorter distance between the back of the lens and the image sensor in those cameras, versus earlier devices.",
      "But fascination over \"oners\" won't be enough to retain audiences, says Prof Palmer: \"Personally, it's not going to make me want to watch something because it's shot it one take \u2013 I want to watch these things because they're good.\"",

      "With rainforests, waterfalls, volcanoes and hot springs, the Caribbean island of Dominica's dramatic landscape is a haven for adventure-seeking ecotourists.",
      "It attracted 83,966 visitors last year, a 13% rise from 2023, and led by new direct flights from the US, and the opening of more hotels.",
      "Nicknamed the \"Nature Island\", and now recovered from the extensive damage caused by 2017's Hurricane Maria, Dominica's government is set to harness its natural resources to generate clean electricity for its 66,000 residents and tourism sector.",
      "To end the country's long reliance on generators fuelled by imported diesel, a geothermal power station is being built in the south of the country. It will access the boiling hot water contained in natural underground reservoirs that are heated by the surrounding volcanic rock.",
      "The 10-megawatt plant, under construction near the village of Laudat in the lush Roseau Valley, is on track to become operational by the end of the year.",
      "Steam will be drawn up to the surface to drive turbines that will generate electricity. The used steam will then be cooled to the point where it becomes water again, and reinjected back underground for the process to restart.",
      "Dominica country profile",
      "\"We hope to totally eliminate the need for diesel generation for electricity in Dominica by 2030,\" Dominica's energy minister Dr Vince Henderson tells the BBC. The government also says that the geothermal plant will reduce electricity bills.",
      "And it is not just Dominica (not to be confused with the similarly named Dominican Republic), that is set to benefit. Long-term plans include exporting surplus electricity via undersea cables to neighbouring islands.",
      "Dr Henderson adds that he hopes the success of the geothermal plant will inspire other Caribbean nations to explore more renewable energy sources.",
      "Dominica's geothermal plant will be just the second in the Caribbean. Guadeloupe, an overseas department of France, has had a 15-megawatt station in operation for three decades.",
      "The Roseau Valley facility is being created through a public-private partnership between the Dominican government and US-Israeli renewable energy company Ormat Technologies.",
      "It is costing tens of millions of US dollars, partially funded by grants and investments from several governments, including the US, UK, Japan and New Zealand. Additional funding has come from various non-governmental organizations from around the world, and loans from the World Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB).",
      "The Dominican government has also ploughed significant resources into the project, which required high upfront costs and a complex exploration process including drilling deep underground to test temperatures.",
      "\"Finding the resource is the first challenge. Then you need someone like us to build the facility,\" says Ormat's chief executive Doron Blachar. \"Ormat is doing the entire project, from making the plant's elements, shipping them to Dominica, mainly from Israel, and then constructing the power plant.\"",
      "Ormat has been designing and building renewable energy systems for more than five decades, and owns and operates geothermal plants in various countries from the Americas to Africa.",
      "\"Geothermal is a great, zero-emission electricity that doesn't depend on wind or sun, and operates 24/7,\" Mr Blachar explains. \"It brings jobs to a country, both during construction and, more importantly, during the plant's operations, along with new technology and expertise.\"",
      "Yet despite geothermal's green credentials, Dominica's new plant has raised concerns among some local residents, including environmentalist Atherton Martin who fears for the effects on the ecologically valuable Roseau Valley.",
      "\"There is no other area like it in the Caribbean,\" he says, adding that the removal of vegetation during the exploration process \"decimated wildlife\" including endemic frogs.",
      "Other residents told the BBC of some controversy over the amount of money the project was costing. It has certainly been several years in the making with the Dominican government alone said to have invested around $15m (\u00a311.3m).",
      "Dr Henderson admits that the project is \"not easy\" for a country that \"faced a big challenge\" when it had to substantially repair its electricity network after 2017's Hurricane Maria. But he insists \"it will be worth it in the end\".",
      "Another common fear about geothermal plants is the potential for triggering earthquakes.",
      "Ormat says it has never had a such an incident in its many years of operations.",
      "Mr Blachar believes the Caribbean could become \"a hub\" for geothermal technology.",
      "Ormat acquired Guadeloupe's plant from the French government in 2017 and is currently expanding it to boost its capacity to 25 megawatts.",
      "With support from the CDB and driven by the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) Commission, work is also under way to explore and develop geothermal potential in fellow volcanic island nations Grenada, St Lucia, St Kitts and Nevis, and St Vincent and the Grenadines.",
      "Ormat will operate the Dominica plant for 20 years before handing it over to state electricity provider Domlec. Mr Blachar estimates it will employ around 30 local people when it comes on stream later this year.",
      "It should initially generate enough power to meet half of Dominica's peak electricity demand, says Fred John, managing director of the government-owned Dominica Geothermal Development Company, which is also involved in the scheme.",
      "Authorities are confident the plant will then soon support the entire country, and have enough spare electricity for some to be exported to neighbouring islands.",
      "Mr John says that the facility will \"serve as a test case for an attractive alternative\" to fossil fuels. \"The rest of the OECS will benefit from the lessons learned here \u2013 both what worked and what didn't,\" he adds.",
      "The OECS recently set a target to reach 30% renewable energy within 10 years, with some countries, including Dominica and St Kitts, aiming for 100% by then.",
      "OECS Director General Dr Didacus Jules describes Dominica's geothermal project as a \"bold and visionary step\".",
      "\"As a region heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels, the transition to green energy is not optional - it is existential,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"This development also breathes new life into the long-held vision of a regional energy grid - one that connects our islands through clean, reliable, and affordable energy.\""

      "The bill of a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by \u00a3129 a year, a drop of nearly 7%, analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted.",
      "The fall would mean a typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit would cost \u00a31,720, down from the current level of \u00a31,849.",
      "The price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, not the total bill - so if you use more, you pay more.",
      "The energy price cap covers around 22 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is set every three months by Ofgem.",
      "The cap changes every three months and the regulator illustrates the effect of this with the annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity.",
      "This typical household is assumed to use 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit.",
      "The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market.",
      "\"The fall in the price cap is a welcome development and will bring much-needed breathing space for households after a prolonged period of high energy costs,\" said Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight.",
      "He added that, while it was \"a step in the right direction\", prices were not falling enough for those households still struggling with cost of living, and bills \"remain well above the levels seen at the start of the decade\".",
      "\"As such, there remains a risk that energy will remain unaffordable for many,\" he said.",
      "Abigail Ward, policy manager at the Energy Saving Trust, which promotes energy efficiency, welcomed the forecast of cheaper bills.",
      "However she added that \"households will still be paying \u00a3100 more a year on their energy bills than last summer, proving that we're still feeling the impacts of fluctuating international wholesale energy markets\".",
      "\"This is why we urgently need to see policy action from the UK government to reduce energy bills by upgrading homes at scale.\"",
      "Andy Manning, head of energy policy at Citizens Advice, said the drop \"might ease the burden of high bills for some households\", but added that \"it'll be cold comfort for those pushed to the brink by the legacy of the energy crisis\".",
      "\"Energy use and bills typically go down during the summer months, but the government can't get complacent,\" he said, calling for more support for those struggling with energy bills.",
      "Citizen Advice research from February 2025 shows that 6.7 million people in Great Britain are living in a household in debt to their energy supplier, with over 8.3 million households finding it difficult to afford their energy bills.",

      "Last month, Cornwall Insight had predicted a larger fall in the cap - to \u00a31,683 - and it said the new forecast partly reflected higher wholesale energy prices.",
      "It predicted the energy price cap would fall again in October, followed by another drop in January 2026.",
      "However, it warned these forecasts could be affected by a number of factors, including changing weather patterns, US tariffs, and the continuing impact of the war in Ukraine."

    "summary": "An exclusive look inside the closely guarded factory the president wants to become a foundation stone for a US golden age.",
    "story": [
      "Among the cactuses in the desert of Arizona, just outside Phoenix, an extraordinary collection of buildings is emerging that will shape the future of the global economy and the world.",
      "The hum of further construction is creating not just a factory for the world's most advanced semiconductors. Eventually, it will mass produce the most advanced chips in the world. This work is being done in the US for the first time, with the Taiwanese company behind it pledging to spend billions more here in a move aimed at heading off the threat of tariffs on imported chips.",
      "It is, in my view, the most important factory in the world, and it's being built by a company you may not have heard of: TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. It makes 90% of the world's advanced semiconductors. Until now they were all made on the island of Taiwan, which is 100 miles east of the Chinese mainland. The Apple chip in your iPhone, the Nvidia chips powering your ChatGPT queries, the chips in your laptop or computer network, all are made by TSMC.",
      "Its Arizona facility \"Fab 21\" is closely guarded. Blank paper or personal devices are not allowed in case designs are leaked. It houses some of the most important intellectual property in the world, and the process to make these chips is one of the most complicated and intensive in global manufacturing.",
      "They're hugely protective of the secrets that lie within. Important customers, such as Apple and Nvidia, trust this company to safeguard their designs for future products.",
      "But after months of asking, TSMC let the BBC in to look at the partial transfer of what some argue is the most critical, expensive, complex and important manufacturing in the world.",
      "The poster child for Trump's policy",
      "President Trump certainly seems to think so. He often mentions the factory in passing. \"TSMC is the biggest there is,\" he has said. \"We gradually lost the chip business, and now it's almost exclusively in Taiwan. They stole it from us.\" This is one of the US president's regular refrains.",
      "TSMC's recent decision to expand its investments in the US by a further $100bn (\u00a375bn) is something Trump attributes to his threats of tariffs on Taiwan and on the global semiconductor business.",
      "The expansion of the Arizona facility, which was announced in March is, he believes, the poster child for his economic policies - in particular the encouragement of foreign companies to relocate factories to the US to avoid hefty tariffs.",
      "China is also watching developments carefully. Taiwan's chip-making prowess has been part of what its government has called its \"Silicon Shield\", against a much-feared invasion. While the original strategy was to make Taiwan indispensable in this area of critical technology, the pandemic supply chain difficulties changed the calculus because relying on a single country seemed like a greater risk.",
      "China claims the self-ruled Taiwan as its territory but Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland.",
      "So, many currents of the world economy, frontier technology and geopolitics flow through this one site and within it lies the essential contradiction of Trump's economic and diplomatic policy.",
      "He sees this plant as the exemplar of America First, and the preservation of economic and military superiority over China. Yet the manufacture of these modern miniaturised miracles at the frontier of physics and chemistry inherently relies on a combination of the very best technologies from around the world.",
      "The cleanest environment on Earth",
      "Greg Jackson, one of the facilities managers, takes me around in a golf buggy. The factories are almost a carbon copy of the TSMC spaces in Taiwan, where he trained. \"I would say these facilities are probably some of the most advanced and complicated in the world,\" he says.",
      "\"It's quite the dichotomy. You've got really, really small chips with really small structures, and it takes this massive facility with all the infrastructure to be able to make them... Just the sheer complexity, the amount of systems that it takes, is staggering.\"",
      "Inside the \"Gowning Building\", workers dress in protective clothing before crossing a bridge that is supposed to create the cleanest environment on Earth, in order to protect the production of these extraordinary microscopic transistors that create the microchips underpinning everything.",
      "Konstantinos Ninios, an engineer, shows me some of the very first productions from TSMC Arizona: a silicon wafer with what is known as \"4 nanometre chips\".",
      "\"This is the most advanced wafer in the US right now,\" he explains. \"[It] contains about 10 to 14 trillion transistors... The whole process is 3,000 to 4,000 steps.\"",
      "If you could somehow shrink your body to the same scale and get inside the wafer, he says that the many different layers would look like very tall streets and skyscrapers.",
      "Manufacturing manipulation of atoms",
      "TSMC was founded at the behest of the Taiwanese government in 1987, when chip executive Morris Chang was directed to start the business. The model was to become a dedicated foundry for microchips, manufacturing other companies' designs. It became wildly successful.",
      "Driving the advancement of the technology is the miniaturisation of the smallest feature on chips. Their size is measured these days in billionths of a metre or nanometres. This progress has enabled mobile phones to become smartphones, and is now setting the pace for the mass deployment of artificial intelligence.",
      "It requires incredible complexity and expense through the use of \"extreme ultraviolet (UV) light\". This is used to etch the intricate building blocks of our modern existence in a process called \"lithography\".",
      "Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy",
      "Trump's chips strategy: The US will struggle to take on Asia",
      "Gold is booming - but investors lured in by the hype could lose out, warn experts",
      "The world's dependence on TSMC is built on highly specialised bus-sized machines, which are in turn sourced almost entirely from a Dutch company called ASML, including in Arizona.",
      "These machines shoot UV light tens of thousands of times through drops of molten tin, which creates a plasma, and is then refracted through a series of specialised mirrors.",
      "The almost entirely automated process for each wafer of silicon is repeated thousands of times in layers over months, before the $1m LP-sized wafer of 4nm silicon chips is formed.",
      "\"Just imagine a particle or a dust particle falling into this,\" Mr Ninios says to me incredulously. \"The transistors are not going to work. So all of this is cleaner than hospital operating rooms.\"",
      "Caution in Taiwan",
      "Taiwan does not have special access to the raw materials - but it has the know-how to stay years ahead of other companies in the intricate process of producing these atomic building blocks of modern life.",
      "Some in the Taiwanese government are cautious about spreading the frontier of this technology off the island. Trump wasted little time in claiming the firm's decision to bring its highest level of technology to the US was due to his economic policies.",
      "He said this would not have happened without the stick of his planned tariffs on Taiwan and semiconductors. Those I speak to at TSMC are diplomatic about that claim.",
      "Much of this was already planned and subsidised under former US President Biden's Chips Act.",
      "On the walkway into the building are photographs showing Biden's visit in 2022, with the building site draped in the Stars and Stripes and a banner saying \"a future Made in America\".",
      "\"The semiconductor supply chain is global,\" says TSMC Arizona President Rose Castanares. \"There's really no single country at this moment that can do everything from chemicals to wafer manufacturing to packaging, and so it's very difficult to unwind that whole thing very quickly.\"",
      "'Non-Red' supply chains to counter China",
      "As for the semiconductor supply chain, tariffs will not help. The supply chain stretches all over the world. Whether it's the silicon wafers from Japan, the machines required from the Netherlands, or mirrors from Germany, all sorts of materials from all around the world are required. Now, they could face import charges.",
      "That said, TSMC's boss was quick off the mark in confirming the expansion of the US site at an event with Trump at the White House. In recent weeks, America's tech elite - from Apple's Tim Cook, to Nvidia's Jensen Huang - have been queueing up to tell the world that TSMC Arizona will now produce many of the chips in their US products.",
      "The global chip industry is very sensitive to the economic cycle, but its cutting-edge technology enjoys very healthy margins, that could cushion some of these planned tariffs.",
      "There are many geopolitical subtexts here. The factory sits at the heart of US strategy to gain technological, AI and economic supremacy over China.",
      "Both the Biden and Trump administrations have developed policies to try and limit Chinese access to the frontier semiconductor technology - from a ban on exports to China of ASML's machines, to new legislation to ban the use of Huawei AI chips in US software or technology anywhere in the world.",
      "Taiwan's President Lai this week urged democracies such as Japan and the US to develop \"non-Red\" supply chains to counter China.",
      "Not everyone is convinced that this strategy is working, however. Chinese technologists have been effective at working around the bans to develop competitive indigenous technology. And Bill Gates this week said that these policies \"have forced the Chinese in terms of chip manufacturing and everything to go full speed ahead\".",
      "Trump wants TSMC Arizona to become a foundation stone for his American golden age. But the company's story to date is perhaps the ultimate expression of the success of modern globalisation.",
      "So for now, it's a battle for global tech and economic supremacy, in which Taiwan's factory technology, some of which is now being moved to the Arizona desert, is the critical asset.",

      "Private school fees were 22.6% higher on average in January compared with a year ago, according to the body that represents most independent schools in the UK.",
      "The Independent Schools Council (ISC) says it expects a reduction in pupils applying to private school as a result of changes to VAT - but says it is too soon to know the full effects of the policy, which was introduced mid-year.",
      "The average termly fee for a day school in January was \u00a37,382, which includes 20% VAT, according to the ISC. In January last year the average was \u00a36,021.",
      "A Treasury spokesperson says the increase in fees are not only down to VAT and fees have been rising in private schools over the last 25 years.",
      "VAT on private school fees was introduced on 1 January across the UK.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the money raised would help \"provide the highest quality of support and teaching\" in the state sector.",
      "At the time, the government predicted fees would increase by about 10% as a result of the changes, saying some schools would be able to absorb part of the cost.",
      "The ISC said that many schools were able to reduce their fees, excluding VAT, in January to \"cushion the impact\" on parents.",
      "But the ISC chief executive Julie Robinson said the sector had been hit by a \"triple whammy\" of national insurance changes, an end to charitable business rates relief and \"the blow of 20% VAT on fees\".",
      "\"It seems clear to us that the government has underestimated the effect,\" she said.",
      "\"We know parents have already left the sector because of the threat of VAT coming in so we do expect the reality of this to lead to further decreases but the full effects will only become apparent over the next few years,\" Ms Robinson added.",

      "\"The government is trying to tax the more affluent areas of society in order to support the least affluent, but the wealthiest people have been affected the least.\"",
      "\"It's low to middle income families and those children on bursaries where the impact of VAT is being felt most,\" Mr Morton added.",
      "Given overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 in England by 2030, the government is confident that schools in the state sector will be able to accommodate any additional pupils moving from private schools.",
      "It estimates about 35,000 will move to the state sector in the long term and the impact will be \"very small\".",
      "Research by think tank the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) said it would be possible for the state sector to easily accommodate extra pupils as the number leaving is bigger than the total number of children attending private schools.",
      "The ISC said some of its members reported a 4.6% fall in Year 7 pupils in September 2024, but experts say the declining birth rate and cost of living could be having an impact.",

      "But the ISC and a number of families have taken the government to the High Court over claims the policy is discriminatory and breaches human rights laws.",
      "What is VAT and when was it added to private school fees?",
      "Value added tax (VAT) is one of the government's main sources of income. It is payable on top of the purchase price of many goods and services. The standard rate of VAT is 20%.",
      "Previously, private schools did not have to charge VAT on their fees because of an exemption for organisations providing education. That exemption was removed on 1 January.",
      "About half of England's private schools are charities, which means that they also received an 80% reduction on business rates (taxes on properties used for commercial purposes).",
      "The government removed that tax relief in April, but dropped earlier plans to scrap private schools' charitable status entirely.",
      "How will the government spend the extra VAT raised?",

      "The government estimates that the policy will raise an extra \u00a3460m in the 2024/25 financial year, rising to \u00a31.7bn by 2029/30.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"every single penny\" will go to state schools - including funding the recruitment of 6,500 new teachers in England.",
      "Schools have been struggling to attract and retain qualified teachers for many years, especially in subject areas like maths and science.",
      "The government also said there will be funding to address other issues in schools, such as crumbling buildings and delays in the system for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send).",
      "How much do private schools cost?",
      "Private schools - sometimes called independent schools - charge fees for most students.",
      "While some famous schools, like Eton and Harrow, charge about \u00a350,000 a year, the average is about \u00a315,000.",
      "There are about 2,500 private schools in the UK, educating about 7% of all pupils, including about 570,000 in England.",

      "In response to the ISC figures, a Treasury spokesperson said the increase was \"not only down to VAT\", and that private school fees had risen significantly in recent decades.",
      "According to the the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank, average fees rose by 55% (after inflation) between 2003 and 2023.",
      "However, the proportion of children being privately educated over the period did not fall.",
      "Will the VAT changes mean the number of private pupils will fall?",
      "When it announced the VAT increase, the government said it did not expect there to be a significant impact on the number of pupils attending private schools.",
      "According to a Treasury memo seen by the BBC, initial estimates suggested that 54,000 pupils would be displaced, with most moving to state schools within the first two years.",
      "However, the government now predicts that around 35,000 students will move to the state sector over a longer time period, and that class sizes will not increase.",
      "It points to research by the IFS which said that state system could \"easily accommodate extra pupils\" because overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 by 2030.",
      "That drop is larger than the total number of children currently attending private schools.",
      "However, pupil numbers are not falling by the same amount everywhere, so some individual state schools could face pressure on class sizes.",
      "The ISC says some of its members reported a 4.6% fall in the number of Year 7 pupils starting school in September 2024.",
      "It believes the government has underestimated the level of pupil displacement that will be caused.",
      "Why was the VAT policy challenged in court?",
      "The legal challenge was brought by the ISC, a smaller group of Christian faith schools, and parent-led group Education not Discrimination.",
      "They argue that the policy goes against the legal right to an education, and claim it is discriminatory because it affects families attending low-paying faith schools.",
      "The group also cites the effect on children with Send. Those who attend private school because their needs \"cannot be adequately met in the state sector\" but who do not have an EHCP have to pay VAT.",
      "The court was told that the government had considered introducing the policy in September 2025, rather than in January.",
      "But it rejected this idea because the main objective of the VAT change was to raise additional tax revenue to support the 94% of children who attend state schools, and any delay would have undermined that.",
      "Government lawyers argued that families who wished to opt out of \"the system of universally accessible, state-funded education\" were free to send their children to private school or to educate them at home.",
      "If the legal challenge is successful, the government could consider amending the policy, but would be under no obligation to do so."

      "Festivals at a south London park will still go ahead this summer despite last week's  successful High Court challenge against Lambeth Council.",
      "Brockwell Park in Lambeth hosts a series of events called Brockwell Live, attracting hundreds of thousands of people to six festivals, including Mighty Hoopla.",
      "Rebekah Shaman, a local resident a member of the Protect Brockwell Park group, brought legal action against the council over the use of parts of the park for the festivals, which this year are due to begin on 23 May.",
      "Ms Shaman's argument centred around planning laws prohibiting a change of use of parks for more than 28 days each year without additional planning consent.",
      "Presiding over the case, Mr Justice Mould found that parts of the park would be used for these events for as many as 37 days.",
      "The judge said his ruling was only about the lawfulness of the council's decision to grant permission for the additional days.",
      "'Carrying on regardless'",
      "A Lambeth Council spokesperson said on Monday that the parent company, Summer Events Ltd, had applied for a new certificate of lawfulness, for 24 days, following the High Court ruling.",
      "\"The council is urgently considering that application. That consideration does not stop the events proceeding,\" a statement read.",
      "Jen Hawkins, a campaigner from Protect Brockwell Park, said: \"We're taking legal advice as to next steps.",
      "\"It seems to us Brockwell Live are carrying on regardless, and Lambeth are allowing them to do that. This is exactly what Lambeth have been repeatedly criticised for, by us and others.",
      "\"This whole thing started because Lambeth refused to go through a planning process, do proper assessments and allow proper scrutiny, and instead issued legal certificates last minute to try to shut us out.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Brockwell Live said: \"Brockwell Live can confirm that all events in the series will go ahead as planned, including the Lambeth Country Show.",
      "\"Friday's High Court ruling dealt with a particular point of law and whether an administrative process had been carried out correctly.",
      "\"We wish to make it clear that no event will be cancelled as a result of the High Court's decision.\"",

      "For a while, it looked like Yuval Raphael's lead might be unassailable - but Austria's tally of 178 was the last to be announced, leaving the singer empty-handed.",

      "Frank Skinner has revealed he has married his girlfriend Cath Mason after 24 years together.",
      "The comedian and presenter shared the news on his podcast, Frank Off The Radio on an episode broadcast on Friday morning, alongside co-hosts Emily Dean and Pierre Novellie.",
      "\"You'll never guess what I did on Monday, I got married\", the 68-year-old said, adding: \"Don't be offended, we didn't invite anyone\".",
      "He confirmed that their only witness was their son Buzz, who was born in 2012, and that the marriage took place at Camden Town Hall.",
      "Skinner previously said during an interview with The Sun in 2024 that he had asked Mason to marry him four times, but she had always declined.",
      "\"Maybe it's some terrible personal reason that I don't know about,\" he said, \"that she doesn't actually like me as much as I think she does.",
      "\"Her parents got divorced, so she got a bit cynical about it and thinks if we get married it would be like a slight curse on the thing,\" he went on to add.",
      "Skinner, who met Mason when she was working for his management company, says their wedding was not a traditional one at her request.",
      "\"I don't want a load of guests, I'm not going in a church. I don't want a ring,\" he says she told him.",
      "He added: \"The thing that no one ever says about getting married is it's quite embarrassing. How can I put it? It's a bit basic getting married.\"",
      "Instead of a white dress, Skinner says \"she wore a flowery dress\" and they walked down the aisle to Lie Dream Of a Casino Soul by The Fall as the Manchester post-punk group \"meant so much to me and Cath when we were in our early days\".",
      "He says Mason also kept her own name and does not wear a ring now that they are married.",
      "Frank Skinner: \u2018I\u2019m all for a bit of moral menace\u2019",
      "When he was asked why they had decided now was the right time, he said: \"I don't know why. I just thought, \"Maybe I've got too much money, I'll give her half in about five years time!\" and denied that it was \"a tax thing\", adding \"I'm not planning on dying anytime soon\".",
      "Skinner, whose real name is Christopher Graham Collins, is probably best-known for writing the lyrics and singing on football song Three Lions, with David Baddiel and The Lightning Seeds, and for his TV and radio work.",
      "He hosted The Frank Skinner Show on Absolute Radio from 2009 to 2024, before moving the format over to the podcast.",
      "He also hosted The Frank Skinner show for 10 years on ITV from 1995 to 2005 and Room 101 on the BBC between 2012 and 2018."

      "The investigation comes after a lawsuit was filed last week by four anonymous housekeepers against the 85-year-old singer-songwriter, accusing him sexual battery, false imprisonment, negligence and gender violence.",
      "Mr Robinson has denied the allegations. His lawyer has said those behind the accusations are after the musician's money, and he welcomed the police investigation \"because exposure to the truth is a powerful thing\".",

      "He argued the police investigation was only opened because the plaintiffs filed a formal report with their allegations and said the claims were \"manufactured\" and designed to \"tarnish the good names\" of the musician and his wife, who is also named in the lawsuit and accused of contributing to a hostile work environment.",
      "The sheriff's department told the BBC in a statement that its Special Victims Bureau was \"actively investigating criminal allegations involving William Robinson AKA 'Smokey Robinson.' The investigation is in the early stages, and we have no further comment.\"",
      "The women filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court on 6 May under the pseudonyms Jane Doe 1, 2, 3 and 4.",
      "In the 27-page legal action, they allege several incidents that they say dated back to 2006, and accuse Mr Robinson of pressuring them into sex.",

      "For the third year in a row, the UK has crashed out at Eurovision, taking 19th place out of a possible 26.",
      "It feels particularly cruel this time because our contestants, Remember Monday, got a lot of things right with their song, What the Hell Just Happened.",
      "Most notably, they could sing \u2013 and I mean, really, really sing.",
      "Lauren, Holly and Charlotte hit every harmony in their song, What The Hell Just Happened, with pinpoint precision, drawing on a decade of West End experience that's seen them star in everything from Matilda to Phantom Of The Opera.",
      "After toe-curling performances from Olly Alexander in 2024 and Mae Muller in 2023, their vocals were as strong as a lion's roar. So strong, in fact, that they caught the attention of former Eurovision winner Conchita Wurst.",
      "\"Harmonising on the Eurovision stage has hardly worked out in the past, but they're spot on,\" Conchita enthused before the final.",
      "\"Their confidence is incredible. You immediately trust them, because when you feel the artist is nervous, you get nervous as a viewer. But they are just so light and so sharp.\"",
      "So what went wrong?",
      "The chief culprit, if I'm honest, was the song.",
      "A manic mish-mash of musical styles, it sped up in the verses, and slowed down for the choruses, with all the consistency of a jelly in a heatwave.",
      "That's not to say it's a bad piece of writing.",
      "Indeed, all of the UK's 88 points came from professional juries of songwriters, whose job it is to recognise compositional craft. Italy even gave us the top score of 12. Grazie mille!",
      "They'll have recognised all the clever British touches the band crammed in \u2013 Elton John-style piano crescendos, a Beatles-esque mellotron riff, and a vocal callback to George Michael's Freedom '90.",
      "The lyrics were witty, too. Reminiscent of Katy Perry's Last Friday Night (TGIF), or If I Were a Bell from Guys and Dolls, it was all about the drunken mistakes you make while trying to get over an ex.",
      "\"Broke a heel, lost my keys, scraped my knee / When I fell from the chandelier.\"",

      "But as seasoned Eurovision watcher Jonathan Vautrey noted, the song was simply too busy.",
      "\"It's hard to latch on to exactly what they're selling when you're too busy reeling from the constant whiplash of hearing an almost brand new song every 30 seconds,\" he wrote on the Wiwibloggs fansite last month..",

      "\"I would say that this is because these countries do share a music industry.\"",
      "The UK's music industry isn't particularly well integrated with Europe, tending to ride roughshod over its less influential neighbours.",
      "When it comes to friendly neighbours, our reputation took a hit after Brexit - although Luxembourg has always been a reliable source of votes, for reasons that aren't 100% clear.",

      "So where does that leave the UK going into next year?",
      "Well, we laid good foundations. Remember Monday didn't come with a copycat Eurodance hit, or an insipid ballad. The vocals were strong. The staging conveyed personality.",
      "Their energy was infectious and they made friends across Europe, becoming great ambassadors for the UK in the contest.",
      "Their 88 jury points almost doubled last year's score. We just have to find a way to get the public vote back on side.",
      "In other words, we shouldn't be too down on the band themselves, as Scott Mills and Graham Norton discussed on Radio 2 this weekend.",
      "\"I thought they were spectacular, so I don't really mind where they place, because it's not embarrassing,\" said Mills.",
      "\"I'm with you,\" Norton agreed. \"They're so likeable. Whatever happens, they walk away heads held high.\"",
      "Mills cautioned against the creeping allure of cynicism.",
      "\"There's a section of fans [who] will complain every year, whatever the UK does: 'Oh, the song's too generic, the vocals aren't great.'",
      "\"We could send Adele and they'd have something horrible to say.",
      "\"But the whole thing about Eurovision is that it's fun and it's joy through music\u2026 so please don't spoil it. Go and be miserable somewhere else.\"",
      "And that's exactly the attitude we need. The UK's never going to attract world-class talent if all we do is look down on the contest and approach it with a defeatist attitude.",

      "Starting out on Radio 5 Live \"was all part of the learning process\".",
      "\"I managed to stumble my way through it, and I learned from really good people alongside me who were incredibly helpful in the early days.\"",
      "Lineker built on that experience, writing all his own scripts and carving out a role for himself.",
      "Having watched ex-sports stars David Gower presenting the cricket and Sue Barker fronting the tennis, he questioned why it wasn't the same in football.",
      "\u201cI just thought, as a player who\u2019s played right at the top, if I could crack presenting it would give me a niche,\" he told BBC Radio 4 podcast Don't Tell Me the Score in 2019.",
      "\"It would give me an advantage over all the others.\"",
      "Meanwhile, his popularity as a footballer endured. In 1991, Arthur Smith and Chris England wrote a stage play called An Evening With Gary Lineker, about a couple trying to rekindle their marriage during the 1990 World Cup semi-final.",
      "Starring Caroline Quentin, Clive Owen, Paul Merton and Martin Clunes, it was filmed for TV in 1994 - with Lineker making a cameo appearance.",
      "He also began building his wider TV career, appearing as a team captain on BBC One's comedy panel show, They Think It's All Over, from 1995 to 2003.",
      "As a presenter, he got himself noticed when he stood in for Des Lynam on the Saturday afternoon sports show Grandstand, in 1997.",
      "By the mid-90s, Lineker was also appearing on Match of the Day as a pundit.",
      "This gave him a prime learning spot - right next to its experienced and slick host Lynam.",
      "\"Des was very helpful - I used to ask a lot of questions about the little things that he did, and picked up some of his nuances,\" the former footballer said.",
      "\"He told me to be brave occasionally with closing lines, and not to be afraid to try to be amusing.",
      "\"Again, the little pay-offs I sometimes make at the end of the show are something that came from him.\"",
      "By 1999, Lineker was hosting the show, and reaching audiences the BBC sometimes struggled to attract and retain.",
      "People would also tune in to see his chemistry with the show's pundits - including other former footballers such as Alan Shearer, Ian Wright, Micah Richards and Alan Hansen.",
      "Lineker's questions kept the analysis flowing, while he was always willing to share a joke and opinion of his own.",
      "He also memorably introduced the show in his pants in 2016, having pledged to \"do the first MOTD of next season in just my undies\" if his former club Leicester won the Premier League, which they did.",
      "Shearer and Wright couldn't keep straight faces.",
      "Their friendships often shone through. In June last year, Lineker and Shearer sent an emotional message of support to Hansen, after hearing the news that he was seriously ill in hospital.",
      "But despite his rapport with his colleagues, off-screen matters were not as straightforward.",
      "As one of the BBC's highest-paid presenters, regularly topping the list of the staff whose salaries are declared, he faced constant scrutiny.",
      "Lineker did not shy away from speaking out about his own views, particularly on social media, while simultaneously working for a broadcaster committed to impartiality.",
      "In March 2023, he posted on X about the government's asylum policy - resulting in the BBC briefly suspending him.",
      "Shearer, Wright and other BBC sport presenters refused to appear on air, in protest at his absence.",
      "Match of the Day was reduced to a 20-minute edition minus its host, pundits and commentary - and the story made headline news for several days, with politicians and media commentators all weighing in on the issue.",
      "Mr Davie subsequently apologised to licence fee payers for the disruption, calling it a \"difficult day\" for the corporation.",
      "Lineker was reinstated nine days later.",
      "The presenter later said the response to his tweet was \"silly - it shouldn't have been\".",
      "\"I love the BBC. I've been there for nearly 30 years but people make mistakes, they recognise that and they addressed it and in the end, thankfully, we're all back to work,\" he said.",
      "The incident prompted a review of BBC social media guidelines. Last September, new rules were published for BBC flagship presenters, saying they should be allowed to express views on issues and policies, but stop short of political campaigning.",
      "Lineker said the recommendations were \"all very sensible\".",
      "By February last year, he said he was using X less often, saying the platform had become \"increasingly toxic\" under its new owner, Elon Musk.",
      "In February 2025, Lineker made headlines when he was among 500 other high-profile figures who signed an open letter urging the BBC to reinstate a documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, to BBC iPlayer.",
      "The documentary was pulled from the streaming service in February after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.",
      "After concerns were raised, the BBC took down the film while it carried out further due diligence. The corporation has apologised and admitted \"serious flaws\" in the making of the film and the matter is still subject to an internal investigation.",
      "Last month, Lineker spoke to BBC presenter Amol Rajan, and was asked about the comments he posted on social media in March 2023.",
      "Lineker said he did not regret taking the position he did, but that he would not do it again because of the \"damage\" it did to the BBC.",
      "However it appears that the latest round of headlines about the sports presenter made his position untenable.",
      "Despite his BBC career being cut even shorter, Lineker has plenty of outside business interests, including the successful podcast production company he co-founded, called Goalhanger.",
      "It produces shows including The Rest Is History, The Rest Is Entertainment and The Rest Is Politics, which won the Champion prize at last year's Podcast Awards.",
      "At the recent Arias radio awards, Goalhanger was named audio brand of the year.",
      "The Rest is Football podcast, featuring Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards, is also on BBC Sounds.",
      "Lineker will be replaced on Match of the Day by Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan for the start of the 2025-26 season.",
      "He indicated to Rajan his next career move \"won't be more telly\", adding: \"I think I'll step back from that now\" and \"I think I'll probably focus more on the podcast world\".",

    "title": "Pop culture re-invented the Menendez brothers - now their fate may rest with one man",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79ed21xyyro",
    "published": "Sun, 18 May 2025 00:35:00 GMT",
    "summary": "The brothers' fate will now be in the hands of California's Parole Board and Governor Gavin Newsom.",
    "story": [
      "It was once unthinkable that Lyle and Erik Menendez, the men who murdered their wealthy parents by shooting them 16 times, would get the sympathy and forgiveness of the masses.",
      "Their claims of sexual abuse at the hands of their father were mocked by prosecutors and comedians alike, from late-night TV to jokes at the Academy Awards.",
      "But 35 years later - thanks in part to TikTok, Netflix and stars like Kim Kardashian - the Menendez brothers have a new generation of supporters - many who were not even born in 1989, the year the brothers ambushed their parents with shotguns in their Beverly Hills mansion.",
      "At the time of their trials, the brothers were portrayed as greedy, entitled monsters who went on a $700,000 (\u00a3526,0000) spending spree in the weeks after the murders. Now, with a growing understanding of trauma and sexual abuse, many are more sympathetic - and that might just give the brothers a chance at freedom.",
      "This week, a Los Angeles judge reduced the brothers' sentence to include the possibility of parole, which could be granted at a hearing next month.",
      "Their fate will then be in the hands of California's Parole Board and, ultimately, Governor Gavin Newsom, who will be weighing the shifting public opinion about the divisive case with his own political ambitions.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "In 1989, Erik and Lyle Menendez burst into their Beverly Hills living room, both toting loaded shotguns, and opened fire on their parents, who were watching television. The crime would go unsolved for months.",
      "They got tickets for the James Bond film License to Kill as an alibi and told law enforcement and members of the news media, who were covering the execution of the wealthy, high-powered couple in their mansion, that perhaps the mafia was to blame.",
      "Meanwhile, they bought a new Porsche, Jeep, Rolex watches and other luxury items with cash from their parents' estate.",
      "They weren't caught until police got word of their admissions to a psychologist.",
      "Even at the time, their crime was divisive - the first trial ended un a mistrial after the jury couldn't reach a verdict. After the second, they were sentenced to life without parole.",
      "During both trials, the brothers were characterised as bad boys and spoiled children who were motivated to kill their parents out of hatred and hopes to acquire their $14 million estate.",
      "Saturday Night Live and other late-night shows mocked the pair's defence in court \u2013 including tearful testimony about their alleged sexual abuse, which prosecutors dubbed the \"abuse excuse\" - and documentary titles from that decade included phrases like \"the bad sons\" and \"American sons, American murderers\".",
      "Appeal after appeal was denied but last year, everything seemed to change. New evidence about the alleged sexual abuse had surfaced and Netflix released a drama that captured the attention of a whole new generation. Soon, documentaries about the case included titles with words like \"misjudged\" and \"boys betrayed\".",
      "TikTokers discussed the case with their followers. Reality star Kim Kardashian, a criminal justice advocate who has helped free imprisoned people, penned an opinion piece publicly backing their bid for freedom.",
      "\"Back then, there were limited resources for victims of sexual abuse, particularly for boys,\" Kardashian wrote in the NBC piece.",
      "In the 1990s, society did not have the same understanding we do today of trauma, sexual abuse and harassment, Whitney Phillips, a University of Oregon professor who studies true crime, told the BBC. That gap in understanding was especially pronounced for boys who were abused, she added.",
      "But after the MeToo movement, there was more cultural space created for people to speak about these experiences, she said.",
      "\"Not only does it create a permission structure,\" Prof Phillips said of people feeling encouraged to speak out about harassment and abuse, \"in some ways it creates an incentive structure to feature stories about trauma\".",
      "Adding to that is the change in how the public views criminal justice, with more emphasis on rehabilitation and reducing prison populations instead of the tough-on-crime mentality that dominated Los Angeles at the end of the 20th Century.",
      "\"The lock people up forever attitude of the 1990s is fortunately long gone,\" said Robert Rand, a journalist who met and interviewed the brothers before they were arrested and uncovered new evidence in 2018 - a letter Erik had written as a teenager to a cousin about his father's sexual abuse.",
      "In a documentary Mr Rand produced about the killings, released in 2023, a former member of the boy band called Menudo alleged that the brothers' father, Jose Menendez - who was an executive at RCA Records - had raped him when he was 14 years old. The accusation further bolstered the brothers' claims of abuse.",
      "The new testimonies helped give new life to the brothers' claims, and provided a catalyst for what Prof Phillips called a \"hurricane\" of interest and support, from the Netflix drama to Kardashian's op-ed.",
      "\"The things that get really big online are things that have lots of sources of energy,\" she said.",
      "Even Lyle Menendez noted the sea change.",
      "\"The followers who are younger that are on that sort of TikTok social media generation, they really have tremendous hope,\" Lyle Menendez said at a court hearing.",
      "\"I'm not as hopeless as I was as a 21-year-old, that's for sure. Obviously, I feel more hope when society seems to be understanding these experiences and sex abuse better.\"",
      "Where do the Menendez brothers go from here?",
      "The fate of the brothers \u2013 regardless of what social media,  the courts or California's parole board recommends \u2013 ultimately rests with one man: Governor Newsom, who has the power to accept or reject any parole recommendation.",
      "And many believe that man is considering a run for president in 2028.",
      "Since the last election, Newsom has been undergoing a political transformation, shifting from crusading liberal pushing universal healthcare to a more moderate, pragmatic approach, most recently proposing freezing healthcare for undocumented immigrants.",
      "Weighing in on such a divisive case could be \"risky\", said Pennsylvania-based Republican political strategist Sam Chen.",
      "\"Can you imagine a reality TV show of the Menendez brothers while Newsom is trying to run for president? Talk about free campaign airtime,\" he said. \"That would be the worst thing for him.\"",
      "Although no one knows which way he is leaning, Newsom has mentioned the case several times on social media and on his podcast.",
      "\"The question for the board is a rather simple one,\" Newsom said in February on TikTok.  \"Do they pose a current, what we call 'unreasonable' risk to public safety.\"",
      "Mr Rand acknowledged the case is \"risky\" politically for Newsom.",
      "\"You can't get around the elephant in the room: They brutally murdered their parents,\" Rand told the BBC. \"But if you do believe that they were abused and that they suffered from a lifetime of abuse - and there actually is evidence that supports their story - it's a very different situation.\"",
      "The brothers have not committed violent crimes while in prison, a fact the judge in their resentencing hearing considered, although they did have infractions for using cell phones smuggled into prison.",
      "They've also led productive lives while incarcerated, with Erik founding a hospice programme to help elderly and disabled inmates while Lyle has been working on prison beautification.",
      "Remarkably, every single surviving member of their family \u2013 from cousins to aunts and uncles - want the Menendez brothers released, including the surviving siblings of Jose and Kitty Menendez.",
      "\"They chose to live their lives with clarity and a purpose of service,\" their cousin Anamaria Baralt said outside the court after they were resentenced.",
      "If the board recommends parole in June, the governor has 30 days to accept or reject the recommendation. If they are paroled, the brothers will be released likely within five months, according to the California Department of Corrections.",
      "The fact that Gov Newsom ordered the state parole board to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment before the brothers were even deemed eligible for parole has many thinking he's open to releasing them.",
      "\"He wants the political cover\" of the parole board and court recommendations, said Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor who has been following the brothers' legal saga but is not representing any of the participants.",
      "A year ago, Mr Rahmani never would have predicted the Menendez brothers could be released. Now he thinks they will be free within the next few months.",
      "But it wouldn't be unprecedented for Gov Newsom to reject a high-profile parole recommendation.",
      "Several times he blocked the release of a Manson Family member. And in 2022, Newsom blocked the release of Sirhan Sirhan, the man who assassinated Sen Robert F Kennedy.",
      "As far as the Menendez brothers go, Gov Newsom said on his podcast that he's mulling over the case and he's not planning to watch any of the documentaries or true crime dramas about the case.",
      "\"I'm obviously familiar with the Menendez brothers just through the news over the course of many decades, but not to the degree that many others are because of all of these documentaries and all of the attention they've received,\" he said. \"So that won't bias my independent and objective review of the facts.\"",

      "In a trial that is undoing the legacy of one of music's biggest moguls of the 2000s, the focus of the opening week of proceedings was not Sean \"Diddy\" Combs  himself - but his ex-girlfriend.",
      "R&B singer Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura took the witness stand for four days, describing in emotional details the years of beatings and drug-fuelled sex encounters with prostitutes that she alleges she endured at the hands of the rap superstar, who she dated for more than a decade.",
      "But while her story clearly left an impression on those in the courtroom, which one onlooker described as an \"aura of sadness\", it is just one piece in the puzzle that prosecutors must present to prove that Mr Combs was not just an abuser, but a mastermind of a criminal, sexual enterprise.",
      "On Tuesday, gasps erupted in a Manhattan overflow courtroom when prosecutors called Ms Ventura - their star witness - to the stand. All eyes were fixed on the eight-months pregnant singer, as she strolled past her ex-boyfriend, whom she had not seen in six years.",
      "Ms Ventura was there to testify in the federal sex trafficking, racketeering and prostitution case against Mr Combs, whom she accuses of abusing her and coercing her into unwanted sex acts - so-called \"freak-offs\" - during their 11-and-a-half year relationship.",

      "An aspiring musician falls in love with a 'larger-than-life' rapper",
      "On her first day on the stand, Ms Ventura began by taking prosecutors through the start of her tumultuous relationship with Mr Combs, whom she met when she was a 19-year-old aspiring musician. Mr Combs, 17 years her senior, signed her onto his record label.",
      "Their romantic relationship began soon after, when Ms Ventura fell in love with the \"larger-than-life\" musician and entrepreneur, she said. But it was not long before she noticed a \"different\" side to him, Ms Ventura testified, at times wiping the tears from her eyes.",
      "Mr Combs, she said, wanted to control every aspect of her life. He paid for her rent, her car, and her phone, sometimes taking the items away to \"punish\" her when he was upset, she said.",
      "Eventually, the relationship turned violent. She testified about the time when he attacked her because she was sleeping, slashing her eyebrow as he threw her onto the corner of her bed as her two friends tried to stop him. The court was shown a photo of the gash that Ms Ventura said Mr Combs hired a plastic surgeon to fix secretly. There was another time at a party where he kicked her head as she cowered behind a toilet in a bathroom stall, she said.",
      "While jurors remained concentrated on her testimony and the evidence, betraying little emotion, some in the courtroom wiped away tears or looked away from the graphic photos and videos - including the viral video of Mr Combs beating and dragging Ms Ventura in the hallway of the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles in 2016.",
      "Published by CNN last year, the video has been viewed by millions - including many of the jurors before they were seated in the trial - and Ms Ventura, who was forced to rewatch the incident of abuse several times this week.",
      "Freak-offs become 'a job'",
      "Ms Ventura testified that the hotel incident took place after she tried to leave a \"freak-off\", a sexual encounter in which the couple would hire male escorts to have sex with Ms Ventura while Mr Combs watched and recorded from the corner.",
      "Ms Ventura said the rapper introduced her to freak-offs around a year into their relationship, and at first, she did it to make him happy.",
      "But over time, the encounters humiliated her, she said. They would sometimes last as long as four days, and require Ms Ventura to take countless drugs to stay awake, she said. She endured injuries like painful urinary tract infections - and once even blacked out, waking up in the shower, she said.",
      "\"It made me feel worthless,\" she told the court. \"Freak-offs became a job where there was no space to do anything else but to recover and just try to feel normal again.\"",
      "The couple would go on to have \"hundreds\" of freak-offs, Ms Ventura estimated.",
      "After years of temporary break-ups - some fuelled by Mr Combs' affairs - Ms Ventura ended her relationship with Mr Combs for good in 2018, the same year she alleges the rapper raped her in her home as she cried.",
      "Ms Ventura went on to date and marry her personal trainer, Alex Fine, with whom she has two children, but the trauma of her relationship has stayed with her.",

The statute was created to take on mob bosses, but has since been used in other cases, including sex trafficking, such as the case against disgraced R&B singer R Kelly.",

      "Ms Ventura acknowledged writing the messages while adding that those were \"just words at that point\".",
      "Ms Estevao also kept bringing Ms Ventura back to the couple's moments of infidelity, like when Mr Combs would spend holidays with his family and former girlfriend Kim Porter, or when Ms Ventura began dating rapper Kid Cudi while she and Mr Combs were on a break.",
      "She repeatedly asked Ms Ventura about her drug use and how both she and Mr Combs struggled with opioid addiction at times.",
      "In these moments, the defence was trying to show jurors that it was a toxic, violent and complicated relationship - but not a case of racketeering or sex trafficking, former federal prosecutor Sarah Krissoff told the BBC.",

      "The games industry has also leaned into customisation in recent years, giving players the power to finely tweak different elements and aspects of difficulty - something that's been incorporated into The Dark Ages.",
      "\"In that regard I think it's going to be a great first-time experience for a lot of fans,\" says Hugo.",
      "But there's still the small matter of the cost of entry.",
      "The debate over prices has been a feature of gaming discourse for years.",

      "The issue has been thrown back into the spotlight thanks to worries over Donald Trump's tariff plans and price announcements from the three major console makers.",
      "That could make competitors such as Fortnite - which don't require new, specialised hardware to run - even more appealing for cash-strapped players.",
      "But Doom producer Marty argues that \"free\" games can end up costing players more in the long run, while there are \"no unknown expenses\" with a one-off purchase such as Doom.",
      "\"You're not going to be asked to pay anything else, two hours in,\" he says.",

    "story": [
      "Ozwald Boateng, celebrating four decades of making his indelible mark on the fashion industry, got his chance to stamp his style on the Met Gala in New York earlier this month.",
      "The esteemed British-Ghanaian designer for the first time dressed celebrities - including three of Africa's biggest musicians, Tems, Burna Boy and Arya Starr, as well as actors Ncuti Gatwa and Jaden Smith - at what is seen as his industry's biggest night of the year.",
      "The theme - Superfine: Tailoring Black Style - was \"completely in my wheelhouse\", he says, as it looked at the way that style formed black identities.",
      "Given that he already has a robust legacy in the design world, the 58-year-old saw the opportunity to find fresh adherents to the Boateng look.",
      "\"I think it's, in a way, communicating to a new audience,\" he tells the BBC a few days after the showcase.",
      "Throughout his 40 years in fashion, the designer has built a reputation for challenging the norms of men's tailoring. His eponymous brand sells form-fitting, stylish suits, often accented with bold colours and West African-inspired patterns.",
      "The son of Ghanaian immigrants, Boateng reimagined the country's iconic kente cloth to produce his signature \"tribal\" pattern.",
      "\"It's all about having a strong concept, having a thorough idea of what you want to achieve from the textiles,\" he says.",
      "The Met Gala perfectly matched his outlook. \"Being a theme about black culture and black cultural influence, I mean, how can you do that without Africa?\" he asks.",
      "Considering the link to Ghana, Boateng explains: \"When we were colonised by the Europeans or the Brits, we kept our traditional dress, but tailoring was a big part of how we dressed to look more... effectively more European.",
      "\"My father always wore tailored suits. You had to be smart at all times, that was something I was taught.\"",
      "As if producing outfits for 16 celebrities for fashion's premier event was not stressful enough, Boateng switched up Burna Boy's outfit less than 24 hours before the event.",
      "\"We did his fitting quite literally the night before the Met Gala,\" Boateng says, adding that everyone in the room got \"really excited\" when they saw the Grammy-award winning musician in the finished product.",
      "The look -  a red suit paired with a buttercup yellow shirt and eel-skin cape - was partly inspired by Burna Boy's Nigerian roots.",
      "The musician told Vogue: \"As a waterside pikin [Pidgin for \"child\"] from the Niger Delta, the eel and fish in general are the lifeblood of my people - they symbolise survival, spirit and the flow of tradition through generations.\"",
      "The Met Gala was \"not unusual\", Boateng says, explaining that Africa has been part of his \"message\" throughout his career.",
      "Back in 1995, Boateng was the first black designer to open a shop on Savile Row, a London street famed for fine tailoring.",
      "\"When I first started as a designer, Savile as a street was a dying street,\" Boateng recalls.",
      "\"The concept, it was dying. I effectively moved there in the early 90s and breathed new life into it.\"",
      "Boateng was dubbed the \"peacock of Savile Row\" - with his flamboyance, 6ft-something frame and modelesque facial features, he stood out among his neighbours.",
      "Colour and flair had long been part of Boateng's psyche. At five years old his favourite outfit was a purple, mohair suit made by his mother, who was a seamstress.",
      "Young Boateng commandeered his mother's sewing machine and although he initially chose to study computing at college, he switched to fashion after realising menswear was his future.",
      "As a teenager, Boateng was greatly inspired by tailoring titan Giorgio Armani - and decades later, Armani would praise the London designer for his \"elegance\" and \"cutting edge\" designs.",
      "Boateng opened his first studio in his early 20s, dressing the likes of Mick Jagger, Jimmy Page and Spike Lee.",
      "He then opened his Savile Row store - at the age of 28 he was the youngest to ever do so.",
      "The burgeoning designer captivated London's fashion scene initially, but in 1998 he went bankrupt when an economic downturn in east Asia scuppered a major order.",
      "Both his professional and personal life descended into disarray - in just 12 months an entire collection was stolen from his studio and his marriage broke down.",
      "But the peacock strutted his way back. Boateng gradually rebuilt his business and in 2002 moved into bigger premises on Savile Row.",
      "Since then, he has served as Givency's creative director for menswear, been awarded an OBE, designed staff uniforms for British Airways and branched out into womenswear.",
      "While racking up professional and charitable commitments, Boateng was raising two children.",
      "Now adults, Oscar and Emilia Boateng accompanied their father to the Met Gala, dressed in the suits that made their surname one of the most famous in contemporary British tailoring.",
      "They are not, however, keen to follow their father into fashion design.",
      "\"I'm trying to slowly but surely seduce them into the fashion business,\" Boateng jokes.",
      "\"It is ultimately their decision to decide what they want from their life. If they find something they're passionate about in a way I have, I am happy.\"",
      "And what is next for his own passion? Boateng might have a brain brimming with concepts, but he has a clear vision of where he wants his brand to go next.",
      "\"The future is expansion,\" he says, \"raising capital to really, really push the brand globally\".",
      "\"I think it's the moment in time - and it's the right moment.\"",

    "story": [
      "The line-up for UK's celebrity edition of The Traitors has finally been revealed - with enough star power to rival Graham Norton's chat show sofa.",
      "The 19-strong roundtable of stars joining Claudia Winkleman at Ardross Castle in Scotland boasts household names across sport and the arts.",
      "Among them are comedians Stephen Fry and Alan Carr, chat show host Jonathan Ross and Olympic diver Tom Daley - all vying to win the game of deception.",
      "Singers Paloma Faith, Cat Burns and Charlotte Church will also be there, alongside others including historian David Olusoga, broadcaster Clare Balding, actress Celia Imrie and Ted Lasso star Nick Mohammed.",
      "The third series of The Traitors, which aired in January, attracted more than 10 million viewers.",
      "The show's format is deceptively simple. A handful of contestants, known as traitors, pick off their castmates, the faithful, with nightly \"murders\" - while the faithful try to work out their identity. If any traitors remain at the end, they nab the cash prize (though this time the money goes to a charity of the winner's choosing).",
      "The celebrity season, which airs this autumn, will bring a unique mix of fame, ego and public image to the popular format. BBC News speaks to psychologists to uncover likely faithfuls, traitors and frontrunners.",
      "The comedians",
      "Alan Carr, Jonathan Ross, Stephen Fry, Joe Wilkinson and Lucy Beaumont",
      "Comedians are likely to be \"the obvious frontrunners to go the distance\", says Susie Masterson, a psychotherapist registered with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP).",
      "Humour can be a highly adapted defence mechanism, she says, which can make comedians more opaque than other contestants.",
      "Comics are also quick on their feet, used to presenting a persona and masking in public - this makes them well-equipped traitors, notes Masterson.",
      "\"I think Alan Carr could well be a frontrunner,\" she says. \"There is an affability about him, but he's also not afraid of stirring the pot. He's very authentic and has a big personality without necessarily dominating the space.\"",
      "But fame could disadvantage the high-profile names in the group, like Jonathan Ross. Status, explains consultant counselling psychologist Dr Ritika Suk Birah, can create a power imbalance.",
      "\"It can make others feel threatened or suspicious of their motives, even when there's no evidence,\" she says.",
      "This may be a particular challenge for those understood as both intelligent and articulate, like Stephen Fry.",
      "This perception can lead others to assume strategic manipulation, potentially forcing early elimination out of fear rather than logic, adds Dr Birah.",
      "Unfortunately, Masterson also believes Fry could fit into the category of contestants who \"struggle with criticism or scrutiny\".",
      "\"He might struggle with banishing people as well as any potential heat he might receive,\" she says.",
      "The singers",
      "Paloma Faith, Cat Burns and Charlotte Church",
      "Stage performers like Cat Burns are used to high-pressure situations, interacting with a variety of people in a live environment. \"This could help at the round table,\" says Masterson.",
      "She adds that Paloma Faith and Charlotte Church are both \"big personalities and have direct communication styles\". While this may make them good motivators, Masterson is unsure whether they can appear contained or measured enough to endure as traitors.",
      "The sports stars",
      "Tom Daley, Joe Marler and Clare Balding",
      "Sports people will likely make good faithfuls, says Masterson, as strong physical types tend to do better in most of the challenges and can also both lead and motivate the rest of the group. They are also usually goal-driven and able to handle pressure.",
      "\"They are quite different personalities in this group, and I'm interested to see how it might play out,\" says Masterson.",
      "\"Clare Balding is very practical and pragmatic, but we have also seen her emotional side on TV recently\".",
      "She feels Tom Daley, and to a lesser extent Balding, could well be \"golden retriever types\" - loyal and supportive - whereas rugby star Joe Marler may be less likely to want to talk things through.",
      "As for the in-built competitive edge, she says success depends on whether they can \"play as a team rather than against each other.\"",
      "The actors",
      "Nick Mohammad, Mark Bonnar, Tameka Empson, Ruth Codd, Celia Imrie",
      "Actors, like comics, may also face distrust depending on how much their castmates expect them to be naturally deceptive.",
      "However, among the group of actors, there is a good mix of ages, types of acting and levels of fame - from soap star Tameka Empson to established film names like Mark Bonnar and Celia Imrie. This could \"balance out this superficial disadvantage\" by muddying the threat level, says Masterson.",
      "She says cast members with lesser-known personalities, like Ruth Codd and Nick Mohammed, might be harder to read.",
      "The media personalities",
      "David Olusoga, Niko Omilana and Kate Garraway",
      "Presenters like Kate Garraway will be used to live interactions, giving them a potential advantage at the roundtable, notes Masterson.",
      "Historian David Olusoga, as a heavyweight intellect, will likely face the same preconception struggle as Fry, she says.",
      "Masterson also adds that quiet people can struggle to go the distance on the show, as they can either be perceived as threatening or unsupportive by the group.",
      "But the show's history has shown this isn't always the case. Last year's contestant Francesca was hardly visible in the first few episodes, even prompting memes about her supposed irrelevancy, before growing into the show and making it to the final.",
      "One dark horse is YouTube prankster Niko Omilana, says author Eloise Skinner, who holds a diploma in psychotherapy.",
      "His career in social media and online content might offer an edge in the game, as someone fluent in an online world that is hyper-aware of perception."

    "summary": "Senior figures in the UK TV industry are contemplating how best to secure its future",
    "story": [
      "Just before Christmas, in a private dining room in the upmarket Charlotte Street Hotel in the heart of London's Fitzrovia area, the BBC's director general gathered some of the UK's leading TV creatives and executives for lunch. As they ate, surrounded by kaleidoscopic-patterned wallpaper and giant artworks, they were also chewing over the future survival of their own industry.",
      "As solutions were thrown around to what many see as an acute funding crisis in the age of global streaming, one of the invitees suggested, in passing, that BBC Studios (the corporation's commercial content-producing arm) could merge with Channel 4 to create a bigger, more powerful force to compete with the likes of Disney Plus, Netflix and Amazon.",
      "As another diner knocked down the idea, I'm told that Tim Davie, the BBC's DG, asked why it was so ridiculous.",
      "I relate that not because it has come to fruition. It hasn't. Nor even to suggest that the Director General supports the idea.",
      "Instead the story illustrates the belief, among some within the broadcasting industry, that nothing should be off the table when it comes to contemplating how to ensure the survival of British-originated and British-focused TV as we know it.",
      "Many of the people I spoke to for this piece didn't want to be quoted. But Sir Peter Bazalgette, the former Chairman of ITV, told me that what he termed the current \"generous spread\" of British broadcasters (BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5) will need some consolidation or, at the very least, more cooperation in future.",
      "\"We're in danger of having no public service broadcasting within a decade, certainly within 20 years,\" he says. \"We don't have a strategy for their survival. It's that serious. The regulators need to start thinking about it.",
      "\"Mergers may well be part of the answer. There should be fewer companies in the future.\"",
      "Lord Vaizey, who was Culture Minister under David Cameron, put it baldly. \"ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 should merge.",
      "\"The UK only has room for two domestic broadcasters.\"",
      "Others, however, argue that distinctiveness is good for viewers. Channel 5 President Sarah Rose told me she \"couldn't disagree with Ed Vaizey more\" \u2013 calling it a \"Doomsday prophecy\".",
      "Channel 5 is profitable, she tells me; it invests in smaller production companies and offers plurality for British audiences. By having just one commercial channel, \"You're taking the funnel from three to one types of content for British audiences.\"",
      "Channel 4 also rejects the suggestion of any merger. Its outgoing CEO Alex Mahon argues that, \"The unique structure of competition between our publicly funded and commercially funded broadcasters\" is what makes UK public service TV \"so excellent\".",
      "And yet the days of turning on your TV and finding an electronic programme guide listing channels \u2013 with BBC1 and BBC2 at the top, then ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 \u2013 are disappearing. The proposed date for the dawn of a new era is 2035; the end of traditional terrestrial TV as we know it.",
      "When the increasingly expensive contracts to provide broadcast channels and digital terrestrial services like Freeview come to an end, the UK's broadcasters are likely to pivot to offering digital-only video on demand. (However this won't happen without a campaign to ensure older people are protected, as well as rural and low-income households who may not have high quality internet access.)",
      "But if the aerials are turned off in 2035, is this the moment TV as we know it changes forever? If it becomes a battle between online-only British streamers and their better-funded US rivals, can the Brits survive? And, crucially, what will audiences be watching?",
      "How TV could look by 2035",
      "Flash forward to switching on the television in 2035 and there will of course have been certain technological transformations \u2013 perhaps more immersive viewing experiences or some shows viewed through augmented reality glasses. What's highly likely, though, is that the communal big screen will still be a staple, (albeit probably voice-activated by then).",
      "It's a shift that has already begun with YouTube viewers changing their viewing habits and moving to the bigger screen. In 2024, for the first time, TV sets were the most-used device for watching content on the video sharing site at home, according to recent data from Barb Audiences. In all, 41% of YouTube viewing was done on TV sets, ahead of 31% on smartphones.",
      "With YouTube an apparently unstoppable force, in ten years' time it could well become the go-to viewing for the majority.",
      "\"We are likely to continue to see a shift in the share of viewing time and advertising revenue towards globally-scaled players and user-generated content platforms like YouTube and TikTok,\" all within the next five years, according to Kate Scott-Dawkins, Global President for Business Intelligence at media investment company Group M.",
      "There'll also likely be Netflix, Disney, Apple, Amazon. In other words, the global players, based in the US, many of which also have other revenue streams (whether parks, computer hardware or a vast shopping platform).",
      "Kate Scott-Dawkins tells me the UK broadcasters are facing what could be an \"existential\" battle against US-based media companies with \"wildly different business models\".",
      "The shift to streaming TV has, she says, \"enabled large globally-scaled players to get even bigger and pour money into content that they can put in front of worldwide audiences\".",
      "The \"big players with big pockets\" already pay for a bespoke button on certain remote controls, or their own content tile front and centre on the homepage on smart TVs.",
      "Ms Scott-Dawkins believes that in the future it will be \"a position of strength\" to own the operating systems themselves, as well as the media that people are watching on them. Examples include Apple showing its films and television series on Apple TVs and iPhones, or Amazon showing its own productions via its Fire devices, or Google through its own computers and phones.",
      "Questions of revenue",
      "Part of the problem is that the UK terrestrial channels can't compete financially with the streamers. Netflix, for example, is valued at $472bn (\u00a3356bn).",
      "The BBC has lost 30% of its income \u2013 or \u00a31bn a year \u2013 in real terms since 2010, as the licence fee has become worth less. ITV's share price hasn't yet recovered since the advertising downturn in 2022, despite its vast production arm, ITV Studios, boosting its earnings before tax to \u00a3299m.",
      "Meanwhile, Channel 4's recorded a deficit of \u00a352m for 2023. Alex Mahon told Parliament last month, \"We will pretty much break even in the year\".",
      "Some TV insiders think the solution will be one gateway or app for all public service content: one place to find all shows from BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and 5.",
      "Alex Mahon recently told a newspaper that there needs to be \"more collaboration\" between the UK broadcasters \u2013 a way of \"making sure we're not duplicating the same technology\".",
      "ITV has spent hundreds of millions to create ITVX, its streaming platform for the Netflix-age. Channel 4 took a pioneering approach to its own digital transformation, launching 4oD back in 2006; the first broadcaster in the world to offer television content on-demand.",
      "But while its current \u00a31bn a year revenue enables it to compete as a significant content creator, this may not be enough to sustain a modern distribution platform with all the associated investment costs into the long term, according to some insiders.",
      "Lord Hall, the former BBC Director General, is among those arguing that it's not sustainable for individual broadcasters to continue going it alone. \"The notion that everyone has their own portals when you are competing against the huge streamers is not going to survive into the future,\" he says.",
      "'One big streamer under iPlayer'?",
      "Could the solution be for BBC iPlayer, which has been built with public money, to become the portal for the other British public service media content, too? It would be a single place where viewers could find ITV's The Chase, Channel 4's The Great British Bake Off and Channel 5 News, alongside BBC's The Traitors. This was one idea suggested to me by multiple TV insiders. \"One big streamer under iPlayer\", as one TV executive described it to me, \"a modern public service streaming service\".",
      "Part of their argument is that it's the fastest growing streaming service in the UK \u2013 and the only existing platform of plausible scale to compete.",
      "With political support and the right deal, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 could potentially get behind sharing tech (after all, the streaming service Freely, which launched last year, already hosts their content with the BBC's and others).",
      "But the idea of branding this all under the BBC iPlayer is \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 not something that commercial broadcasters would likely entertain, according to conversations I've had.",
      "Lord Hall believes, \"It could be branded differently... It would be a very good step.\"",
      "He says: \"The public would have to get used to the fact that BBC material would be free of advertising, and other parts of the platform would have adverts.\"",
      "If the idea of a shared streaming service sounds familiar, that's because it was proposed years ago. Project Kangaroo was a plan by BBC Worldwide, ITV and Channel 4 for a UK video-on-demand joint venture. Think an early rival to Netflix.",
      "But the UK's Competition Commission blocked the project in 2009 because of concerns it could harm competition in the emerging VoD market.",
      "Other regulators across Europe have also blocked mergers: In France, the TFI and M6 channels were prevented from merging. Two of the largest TV and radio broadcasters in the Netherlands, which would have combined eight national TV channels and four national radio stations, were also stopped for competition reasons.",
      "Any form of merger between different public service broadcasters would be subject to the same scrutiny. It's perhaps why Sir Peter Bazalgette is calling on UK politicians and regulators to focus on creating a strategy \u2013 or risk the end of British TV as we know it.",
      "Should the audiences care?",
      "The BBC remains the most watched of the traditional broadcasters. Today, people in the UK spend more time watching traditional broadcasters than they do streaming services. Figures show 87% of people age four and above watch the traditional broadcasters each month and they spend an average of 137 minutes a day doing so. By comparison, 78% of people watch a streaming service and they spend only 40 minutes a day doing so.",
      "If this does shift and the pattern reverses, TV producers and executives may be worried. But does it really matter to audiences?",
      "Netflix is already making the types of shows that may have previously been made by the likes of the BBC (Adolescence, Toxic Town and Baby Reindeer are all very British stories made by the streamer). So what is the problem? (Aside from the obvious point that you need a subscription to watch Netflix.)",
      "Ms Rose argues that the picture is \"much more complex\". Creatives involved in those shows often cut their teeth in public service TV, she says \u2013 one of benefits of the traditional broadcasters is, she believes, that it is a pipeline of talent.",
      "Sir Peter Bazalgette argues that they're needed more than ever in our AI age to serve as \"a gold standard of trusted news for our democracy, amid the online Tower of Babel.\"",
      "He also argues for programmes that reflect \"our shared values and national conversation\". Would a US-based streamer have chosen to make Mr Bates v the Post Office (ITV), for example, or 'Wolf Hall' (BBC) or 'It's A Sin' (Channel 4) \u2013 stories that are uniquely British and reflect who we are?",
      "Backing producers to take risks is, says Lord Hall, \"exactly what the BBC should be doing \u2013 but of course [it] has been doing less because the licence fee has been consistently cut\".",
      "Start of the 'martini streaming age'",
      "Ultimately, the American streamers are here to stay; they're spending billions and their UK operations are often led by British executives who are supportive of Britain's public service broadcasting scene.",
      "I have also picked up a sense from those inside Netflix that the company is often used as a battering ram to persuade the government that the UK's traditional broadcasters need more protections.",
      "Some have also been critical of the BBC for, as they see it, wanting everything on its own terms: \"'We want you to give us your money for co-productions, but the BBC will make all the creative decisions',\" is how one insider put it to me, unfairly or not.",
      "In 2018, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos was invited to the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London. Invitees recall that he talked warmly about how influential the BBC's iPlayer had been to the success of Netflix, describing how impressed he had been by a piece of kit that had got British viewers used to getting their video on demand.",
      "With more than 17 million Brits now subscribed to Netflix, there is a certain irony to that.",
      "Today, as the BBC's Director General Tim Davie starts to position the BBC ahead of the renewal of the corporation's charter after 2027, the TV landscape is changing fast. And the challenges are clear.",
      "Lord Hall tells me: \"Our lives will be enriched by having not only what the streamers can offer, but also what the public service broadcasters can bring. It's unthinkable not to build on what the BBC and others can deliver\".",
      "Sir Peter Bazalgette predicts that, \"Small doesn't cut it,\" adding that, \"The winners will have to be big enough to [both] afford high end dramas for winning subscribers and maintain large back catalogues to keep subscribers happy.\"",
      "He says we now live in \"the 'martini' streaming age - any time, any place, anywhere\".",
      "The question is whether the leaders of the public service broadcasters can forge the right plan to safeguard their industry in that age.",
      "The real problem facing Britain's shrinking military",
      "Gold is booming - but investors lured in by the hype could lose out, warn experts",

      "At the time, Kelly was on a waiting list for traditional NHS talking therapy to discuss issues with anxiety, low self-esteem and a relationship breakdown.",
      "She says interacting with chatbots on character.ai got her through a really dark period, as they gave her coping strategies and were available for 24 hours a day.",

      "Visit bbc.co.uk/mentalwellbeing to find out more",
      "People around the world have shared their private thoughts and experiences with AI chatbots, even though they are widely acknowledged as inferior to seeking professional advice. Character.ai itself tells its users: \"This is an AI chatbot and not a real person. Treat everything it says as fiction. What is said should not be relied upon as fact or advice.\"",
      "But in extreme examples chatbots have been accused of giving harmful advice.",
      "Character.ai is currently the subject of legal action from a mother whose 14-year-old son took his own life after reportedly becoming obsessed with one of its AI characters. According to transcripts of their chats in court filings he discussed ending his life with the chatbot. In a final conversation he told the chatbot he was \"coming home\" - and it allegedly encouraged him to do so \"as soon as possible\".",
      "Character.ai has denied the suit's allegations.",
      "And in 2023, the National Eating Disorder Association replaced its live helpline with a chatbot, but later had to suspend it over claims the bot was recommending calorie restriction.",
      "In April 2024 alone, nearly 426,000 mental health referrals were made in England - a rise of 40% in five years. An estimated one million people are also waiting to access mental health services, and private therapy can be prohibitively expensive (costs vary greatly, but the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy reports on average people spend \u00a340 to \u00a350 an hour).",
      "At the same time, AI has revolutionised healthcare in many ways, including helping to screen, diagnose and triage patients. There is a huge spectrum of chatbots, and about 30 local NHS services now use one called Wysa.",
      "Experts express concerns about chatbots around potential biases and limitations, lack of safeguarding and the security of users' information. But some believe that if specialist human help is not easily available, chatbots can be a help. So with NHS mental health waitlists at record highs, are chatbots a possible solution?",
      "An 'inexperienced therapist'",
      "Character.ai and other bots such as Chat GPT are based on \"large language models\" of artificial intelligence. These are trained on vast amounts of data \u2013 whether that's websites, articles, books or blog posts - to predict the next word in a sequence. From here, they predict and generate human-like text and interactions.",
      "The way mental health chatbots are created varies, but they can be trained in practices such as cognitive behavioural therapy, which helps users to explore how to reframe their thoughts and actions. They can also adapt to the end user's preferences and feedback.",
      "Hamed Haddadi, professor of human-centred systems at Imperial College London, likens these chatbots to an \"inexperienced therapist\", and points out that humans with decades of experience will be able to engage and \"read\" their patient based on many things, while bots are forced to go on text alone.",
      "\"They [therapists] look at various other clues from your clothes and your behaviour and your actions and the way you look and your body language and all of that. And it's very difficult to embed these things in chatbots.\"",
      "Another potential problem, says Prof Haddadi, is that chatbots can be trained to keep you engaged, and to be supportive, \"so even if you say harmful content, it will probably cooperate with you\". This is sometimes referred to as a 'Yes Man' issue, in that they are often very agreeable.",
      "And as with other forms of AI, biases can be inherent in the model because they reflect the prejudices of the data they are trained on.",
      "Prof Haddadi points out counsellors and psychologists don't tend to keep transcripts from their patient interactions, so chatbots don't have many \"real-life\" sessions to train from. Therefore, he says they are not likely to have enough training data, and what they do access may have biases built into it which are highly situational.",
      "\"Based on where you get your training data from, your situation will completely change.",
      "\"Even in the restricted geographic area of London, a psychiatrist who is used to dealing with patients in Chelsea might really struggle to open a new office in Peckham dealing with those issues, because he or she just doesn't have enough training data with those users,\" he says.",
      "Philosopher Dr Paula Boddington, who has written a textbook on AI Ethics, agrees that in-built biases are a problem.",
      "\"A big issue would be any biases or underlying assumptions built into the therapy model.\"",
      "\"Biases include general models of what constitutes mental health and good functioning in daily life, such as independence, autonomy, relationships with others,\" she says.",
      "Lack of cultural context is another issue \u2013 Dr Boddington cites an example of how she was living in Australia when Princess Diana died, and people did not understand why she was upset.",
      "\"These kinds of things really make me wonder about the human connection that is so often needed in counselling,\" she says.",
      "\"Sometimes just being there with someone is all that is needed, but that is of course only achieved by someone who is also an embodied, living, breathing human being.\"",
      "Kelly ultimately started to find responses the chatbot gave unsatisfying.",
      "\"Sometimes you get a bit frustrated. If they don't know how to deal with something, they'll just sort of say the same sentence, and you realise there's not really anywhere to go with it.\" At times \"it was like hitting a brick wall\".",
      "\"It would be relationship things that I'd probably previously gone into, but I guess I hadn't used the right phrasing [\u2026] and it just didn't want to get in depth.\"",
      "A Character.AI spokesperson said \"for any Characters created by users with the words 'psychologist', 'therapist,' 'doctor,' or other similar terms in their names, we have language making it clear that users should not rely on these Characters for any type of professional advice\".",
      "'It was so empathetic'",
      "For some users chatbots have been invaluable when they have been at their lowest.",
      "Nicholas has autism, anxiety, OCD, and says he has always experienced depression. He found face-to-face support dried up once he reached adulthood: \"When you turn 18, it's as if support pretty much stops, so I haven't seen an actual human therapist in years.\"",
      "He tried to take his own life last autumn, and since then he says he has been on a NHS waitlist.",
      "\"My partner and I have been up to the doctor's surgery a few times, to try to get it [talking therapy] quicker. The GP has put in a referral [to see a human counsellor] but I haven't even had a letter off the mental health service where I live.\"",
      "While Nicholas is chasing in-person support, he has found using Wysa has some benefits.",
      "\"As someone with autism, I'm not particularly great with interaction in person. [I find] speaking to a computer is much better.\"",
      "The app allows patients to self-refer for mental health support, and offers tools and coping strategies such as a chat function, breathing exercises and guided meditation while they wait to be seen by a human therapist, and can also be used as a standalone self-help tool.",
      "Wysa stresses that its service is designed for people experiencing low mood, stress or anxiety rather than abuse and severe mental health conditions. It has in-built crisis and escalation pathways whereby users are signposted to helplines or can send for help directly if they show signs of self-harm or suicidal ideation.",
      "For people with suicidal thoughts, human counsellors on the free Samaritans helpline are available 24/7.",
      "Nicholas also experiences sleep deprivation, so finds it helpful if support is available at times when friends and family are asleep.",
      "\"There was one time in the night when I was feeling really down. I messaged the app and said 'I don't know if I want to be here anymore.' It came back saying 'Nick, you are valued. People love you'.",
      "\"It was so empathetic, it gave a response that you'd think was from a human that you've known for years [\u2026] And it did make me feel valued.\"",
      "His experiences chime with a recent study by Dartmouth College researchers looking at the impact of chatbots on people diagnosed with anxiety, depression or an eating disorder, versus a control group with the same conditions.",
      "After four weeks, bot users showed significant reductions in their symptoms \u2013 including a 51% reduction in depressive symptoms - and reported a level of trust and collaboration akin to a human therapist.",
      "Despite this, the study's senior author commented there is no replacement for in-person care.",
      "'A stop gap to these huge waiting lists'",
      "Aside from the debate around the value of their advice, there are also wider concerns about security and privacy, and whether the technology could be monetised.",
      "\"There's that little niggle of doubt that says, 'oh, what if someone takes the things that you're saying in therapy and then tries to blackmail you with them?',\" says Kelly.",
      "Psychologist Ian MacRae specialises in emerging technologies, and warns \"some people are placing a lot of trust in these [bots] without it being necessarily earned\".",
      "\"Personally, I would never put any of my personal information, especially health, psychological information, into one of these large language models that's just hoovering up an absolute tonne of data, and you're not entirely sure how it's being used, what you're consenting to.\"",
      "\"It's not to say in the future, there couldn't be tools like this that are private, well tested [\u2026] but I just don't think we're in the place yet where we have any of that evidence to show that a general purpose chatbot can be a good therapist,\" Mr MacRae says.",
      "Wysa's managing director, John Tench, says Wysa does not collect any personally identifiable information, and users are not required to register or share personal data to use Wysa.",
      "\"Conversation data may occasionally be reviewed in anonymised form to help improve the quality of Wysa's AI responses, but no information that could identify a user is collected or stored. In addition, Wysa has data processing agreements in place with external AI providers to ensure that no user conversations are used to train third-party large language models.\"",
      "Kelly feels chatbots cannot currently fully replace a human therapist. \"It's a wild roulette out there in AI world, you don't really know what you're getting.\"",
      "\"AI support can be a helpful first step, but it's not a substitute for professional care,\" agrees Mr Tench.",

      "Former US President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones.",
      "Biden received the news on Friday after he saw a doctor last week for urinary symptoms.",
      "Here's what you need to know about prostate cancer and its treatment options.",
      "What is prostate cancer?",
      "Prostate cancer affects tissue of the prostate gland, the part of the male reproductive system that helps make semen. It is located between the penis and the bladder.",
      "According to the NHS, it usually develops slowly, meaning some live for decades without symptoms or needing treatment.",
      "In Biden's case, the cancer is aggressive, and his family are said to be reviewing options for treatment.",
      "Biden was diagnosed following urinary symptoms, one of the most common signs of prostate cancer. That's because it is often detected only when the prostate is big enough to have impacted the urethra, the tube that connects the bladder to the penis.",

      "Joe Biden diagnosed with 'aggressive' prostate cancer",
      "Analysis: Another formidable challenge for Biden",
      "Those symptoms can include needing to urinate more frequently, as well as a slow or weak urinary stream.",
      "Screening for prostate cancer is part of routine presidential health inspections, according to Dr Jeffrey Kuhlman, former White House doctor under President Barack Obama.",
      "Prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in American men, according to the American Cancer Society, behind lung cancer.",
      "There will be more than 300,000 new cases in the US this year, according to projections by the American Cancer Society. About one in 8 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime.",
      "While it is \"not uncommon\" for men in their 80s to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, the grade and stage of Biden's cancer are \"more advanced than most men would encounter\" at diagnosis, Dr Ryan Cleary, urologist at MedStar Health, told the BBC.",
      "What is the Gleason score?",
      "The former president's prostate cancer is \"characterised by a Gleason score of 9\", his office said in the statement announcing his diagnosis.",
      "In the US, the Gleason score is a common way of grading the capacity for cells from the primary tumour to spread round the body - also known as metastatic cancer.",
      "Specifically, it refers to how abnormal the cancer cells look in a sample under a microscope. The scale runs from six to 10, with a higher number indicating a more aggressive cancer.",
      "The scale starts at six because it is calculated by combining the two most common patterns of cancer cells found in a patient. The lowest score assigned to cancerous cells is three. That's why the lowest Gleason score for a cancer diagnosis is six.",
      "A Gleason score of nine, such as Biden's, means it is a \"high-grade cancer\". Cancer cells with a score of nine look very abnormal and are likely to grow quickly.",
      "What are Biden's treatment options?",
      "Biden's cancer is aggressive in nature and has already spread to his bones.",
      "According to Dr Jamin Vinod Brahmbhatt, a urologist at Orlando Health Medical Group, this level of spread does limit the treatment options.",
      "While there are medical based treatments such as chemotherapy, steroids and hormone therapy available, none of them are \"curative\", he said.",
      "\"There are more medical options to stabilise the patient and control the cancer, but it never gets rid of the cancer completely.\"",
      "Biden's cancer is also said to be hormone sensitive, which means the cancer uses hormones to grow or develop.",

      "She suffers from panic attacks and her fear of driving means she is constantly cancelling plans.",
      "But, over the course of six sessions with psychotherapist Owen O'Kane, it becomes clear her problems are much deeper than just a fear of driving.",
      "Digging around in the mind",
      "Every week, one in six of the UK population experience mental health problems such as depression and anxiety and every year more than 1.2 million people seek help from the NHS talking therapies service, with many more paying for support privately.",
      "This form of therapy is most commonly used for anxiety and depression, but can also help with a range of other problems, including body image dysmorphia, obsessive compulsive disorder and post traumatic stress disorder. It does not work for everyone: research suggests one-third of people do not benefit.",
      "The BBC has followed 12 people, featured in the series Change Your Mind, Change Your Life, who each received six support sessions from therapists.",
      "The therapists have used a combination of different talking therapy approaches, including cognitive behavioural therapy which focuses on changing the way we think and behave, alongside other techniques to improve relationships and process trauma.",
      "What it reveals is striking: How understanding and learning to manage the mind has the power to transform lives.",
      "\"You're not stuck with the brain you've got,\" says Owen O'Kane, who has worked in the field for 25 years.",
      "He describes his job as like detective work: \"People come with what seems to be a reasonable story, but the interesting thing is that very often the story and emotions don't match. I guess what we are doing is digging around a little bit.\"",
      "'I completely hated myself'",
      "Over their sessions, Owen digs deeper into Nicole's anxiety. At one point she weeps. She admits in the past she has \"completely hated\" herself. She worries about what people think of her and is socially anxious: \"I don't feel good enough to be there. I might say something wrong. I need people to like me.\"",
      "Owen questions why she feels like this: \"As human beings we like the nice emotions. We like feeling happy, joy, being in love.\" but he says some people try to avoid or suppress emotions like fear, dread and sadness, and that can cause anxiety. Instead, he says it is healthier to accept them and accept them as safe.",
      "When people get to that point, he says, they start to feel empowered: \"They realise they're not going to be overwhelmed.\"",
      "Speaking outside the therapy room, Nicole says: \"I'm shocked. He got my number straight away. I would see vulnerability as a negative thing, but it's not.\"",
      "Asked to describe herself she uses words such as kind, thoughtful, determined and enthusiastic: \"I am not a bad person,\" she tells Owen.",
      "She says she has learned a lot: \"Most importantly I found I wasn't being kind to myself. That was really eye-opening.\"",
      "Owen says this is typical of many people he treats: \"When people get to these crossroads, when they wake up and realise what they are doing, that's a gold dust moment for me.\"",

      "\"It made me feel a lesser man.\"",
      "Now he fears under-performing at work and losing his job.",
      "Over the course of the sessions, Prof Peters explains the key is James's belief system.",
      "First, he gives some seemingly simple advice: \"Put your feet on the floor, stand up and walk,\" he says.",
      "Focusing on the basic task of moving, in James's case moving so he can get to work, enables someone caught up in catastrophic thinking to block out the negative thoughts that stop them doing something.",
      "In later sessions, James and Prof Peters explore what could be behind his problems. James tells Prof Peters about his childhood and how his father would criticise him to push him to improve.",
      "Prof Peters explains how James believes that to please you cannot make errors and then the devastating stroke he suffered at a young age has triggered an absolute desire for things to never go wrong again.",
      "He tells James he needs to make \"peace with himself\" by defining himself not by performance but by values and behaviours. He too asks James to describe himself and James replies he is hard-working, honest, engaging, friendly and as someone who would put others first.",

      "Julia suggests eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy, which uses movement to help people process and recover from distressing events.",
      "Julia asks Anjalee for her worst memory and she describes how her father tried to save her mother's life by performing chest compressions in their home until the paramedics arrived. Her mother was rushed out with Anjalee hoping she would return. She never did.",

      "Julia says this type of treatment is particularly effective when dealing with one single traumatic event. One memory, she says, can act as a block on everything.",

      "The legislation passed its first stage in the House of Commons last November \u2013 but since then the details have been pored over and dozens of amendments added by both sides.",
      "On Friday MPs debated further potential changes, which also included preventing medical staff from raising the option of assisted dying with a patient first.",
      "However, MPs ran out of time to vote on more changes, so further debate and voting will take place on 13 June.",
      "That would be followed by a vote on whether to pass the bill as a whole to its next stage or reject it, either on the same day or a future date.",
      "The government is neutral on the bill and MPs have been given a free vote, meaning they can decide based on their conscience rather than having to follow a party line.",
      "The original bill stated that no registered medical practitioner or other health professional would be under any obligation to participate in the process of assisted dying and they could not be discriminated by their employer if they did not wish to do so.",
      "Under a change proposed by Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, and approved by MPs, this has been expanded say no one would have to take part in the process, giving protections to any staff who might be involved.",

      "During an emotionally charged - and at times ill-tempered - debate, supporters of the bill argued it had been strengthened by earlier changes.",
      "Opening the proceedings, Leadbeater said many people had \"lost loved ones in deeply difficult and traumatic circumstances\".",
      "The MP for Spen Valley added: \"Put simply, if we do not vote to change the law, we are essentially saying that the status quo is acceptable.\"",
      "But opponents said the bill had been rushed through and needed stronger protections for people who could be vulnerable to coercion.",
      "Conservative MP Rebecca Paul argued there should be a focus on improving end-of-life care, rather than assisted dying.",
      "\"[The bill] will harm far more people than it will help,\" Paul said.",
      "\"And those people who will be harmed are among the most vulnerable in our communities and I'm not willing to accept this collateral damage.\"",

      "She said that while she appreciated there were concerns over coercion and how the proposed legislation could affect vulnerable or disabled people, the bill was \"full of safeguards\".",

      "Several MPs raised concerns people with anorexia could be considered terminally ill and eligible for assisted dying if they refuse to eat or drink.",
      "However, Leadbeater argued this risk was \"negligible\".",
      "\"Not only would someone with severe anorexia be highly unlikely to be assessed to have capacity to make a decision about assisted dying, the other tragic reality is that if a patient was so ill as a result of not eating and drinking for whatever reason, they would die before the process of assisted dying would be able to take place,\" she told MPs.",
      "A proposal from Labour MP Naz Shah would amend the bill so an individual would not meet the requirements for an assisted death \"solely as a result of voluntarily stopping eating or drinking\".",
      "Leadbeater indicated she would support this but suggested further changes may be needed to make the proposal workable.",
      "Leadbeater's Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill cleared its first parliamentary hurdle by 330 to 275 votes back in November.",
      "Since then, the bill has gone through six months of intense scrutiny by a parliamentary committee and several changes, including removing the need for a High Court judge to sign off each request for an assisted death. Instead, a panel of experts - including a legal professional, psychiatrist and social worker - would oversee the process.",
      "The issue has split Parliament, with strong opinions on both sides.",
      "Those opposed to assisted dying say the mood has altered among MPs, but so far only a handful have said they have changed their minds since November and it would take dozens to block the bill.",
      "Labour MP Jonathan Hinder is the latest to reveal he will no longer support the bill, saying his concerns have \"deepened\" as it has progressed.",
      "He gave the example of removing the role of a High Court judge as one reason he had changed his mind, adding that more work was needed to make the bill \"practicable and safe\".",

      "\"Rather than acknowledge they couldn't do it, because that would have indicated a mistake in their overall strategy, they remained silent.\"",

      "As Covid hit, a team of 300 volunteers started using the organisation's laboratory space and equipment to process Covid tests for dozens of hospitals, GP surgeries and care homes in the local area.",
      "It had the capacity to carry out 4,000 tests a day and to increase that to 10,000 with more funding, according to Prof Nurse.",
      "In March 2020, he wrote to the government offering to help with the national testing effort.",
      "Instead ministers decided to set up a network of giant privately-run Lighthouse laboratories.",
      "In his evidence, Prof Nurse accepted that the larger sites were needed, but said \"insufficient attention\" was paid to universities and other publicly-funded institutions, which could have quickly processed tests for healthcare workers, particularly in the early stages of the pandemic.",

      "The House of Lords has dealt a second defeat to the government over its Data (Use and Access) Bill.",
      "Peers had already backed an amendment calling for more copyright protections for the creative industries from artificial intelligence (AI) scrapers once.",
      "MPs rejected that amendment and sent the Bill back to the Lords, where Technology Minister Baroness Jones told peers it would lead to \"piecemeal\" legislation as it pre-empted consultation on AI and copyright.",
      "However, there was broad and vociferous support for Baroness Kidron, a film director and digital rights campaigner, who accused ministers of being swayed by the \"whisperings of Silicon Valley\" asking them to \"redefine theft\".",
      "The Lords rebellion follows condemnation from Sir Elton John, who called the government \"losers\" over the weekend and said ministers would be \"committing theft\" if they allowed AI firms to use artists' content without paying.",
      "He joins the ranks of high-profile musicians, including Paul McCartney, Annie Lennox, and Kate Bush, who are outraged by plans they say would make it easier for AI models to be trained on copyrighted material.",
      "Kidron's amendment would force AI companies to disclose what material they were using to develop their programmes, and demand they get permission from copyright holders before they use any of their work.",
      "Highlighting the power differential between the big tech giants in the US and creatives in the UK, Kidron branded the government's plans \"extraordinary\".",
      "\"There's no industrial sector in the UK that government policy requires to give its property or labour to another sector - which is in direct competition with it - on a compulsory basis, in the name of balance,\" she said.",
      "\"The government has got it wrong.",
      "\"They have been turned by the sweet whisperings of Silicon Valley who have stolen - and continue to steal every day we take no action - the UK's extraordinary, beautiful and valuable creative output.",
      "\"Silicon Valley has persuaded the government that it's easier for them to redefine theft than make them pay for what they have stolen.\"",
      "Defending her amendment, the crossbench peer said it was \"the minimum viable action from the government\" to signal that \"UK copyright law is indeed the law of the land\".",
      "Otherwise, Kidron said, the Bill was merely a \"political gesture\" ignoring \"widespread theft\" of UK copyright and \"starving\" the creative industry of \"the transparency they need to survive\".",
      "Sir Elton John angry at 'criminal' AI plans for artists",
      "Artists release silent album in protest against AI using their work",
      "She was backed by Labour's Lord Brennan, who said the government was trying to set up \"a double standard\" with AI companies, and abandoning its historical leadership over the importance of intellectual copyright.",
      "\"This country has shown leadership throughout history in relation to copyright and setting the highest standards in order to try and drag people up to our level rather than simply putting up the flag of surrender,\" he said.",
      "\"I fear there is a view that we have to allow AI companies to do anything they want because otherwise they'll just go and do it somewhere else.\"",
      "Lord Watson, former deputy leader of the Labour Party and clearly a fan of Sir Elton, reeled off a string of song lyrics urging ministers to heed \"the clarion cry of this country's creators\".",
      "A third Labour peer, Lord Knight, also called on his party colleagues to \"protect the livelihoods of artists from big tech\" and said he believed this could be done at the same time as \"taking advantage of the creative and economic opportunities of AI\".",
      "The strength of feeling around the urgency to protect artists was made clear by others, including crossbencher and composer Lord Berkeley, who labelled the current situation \"burglary\".",
      "\"The only way you will stop it is by acting now before the gate is trampled down by the horses,\" he said.",
      "\"If this door is left open we will destroy the future of our creative industries.\"",
      "Conservative Lord Dobbs agreed those who had \"slogged away, struggled and suffered\" for their art deserved the government's protection and Liberal Democrat Floella Benjamin said she saluted Kidron for her \"tenacity and dogged determination\" to ensure \"creativity will not be stolen\".",
      "Baroness Jones spoke again at the close of the debate to plead with peers not to overturn the will of MPs for a second time, insisting \"this isn't about Silicon Valley\", denying the government was being complacent, and pointing out that \"no other territory has cracked this either\".",
      "\"We all want to see a way forward that protects our creative industries while supporting everyone in the UK to develop and benefit from AI,\" she said.",
      "\"Kidron's amendment will not provide certainty of anything except for certainty of more uncertainty, of continuous regulations stacked one upon another in a pile of instruments...",
      "\"Jumping the gun on one issue will hamstring us in reaching the best outcome on all the others and especially because this is a global issue and we cannot ringfence the UK away from the rest of the world.\"",
      "However, Kidron said her amendment \"does not challenge the primacy of the Commons\" and pushed ahead.",
      "The result was a decisive defeat for the Government, with 287 votes in favour of Kidron's amendment and 118 against - a majority of 169 - and the Bill will now be sent back to the Commons.",

      "This is undeniably a significant deal. In a funny way, though, for Sir Keir Starmer to succeed he needs it to seem as insignificant and uncontroversial as possible.",
      "For many in politics, wading through the details of this agreement will be an act of nostalgia \u2013 or perhaps deeply triggering.",
      "Dynamic alignment. Sanitary and phytosanitary checks. Fishing quotas. Jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.",
      "These are concepts, institutions and trade-offs which came to dominate British politics for much of the past decade. And with good reason: as the UK navigated its divorce with the EU, these technical questions became deeply political as they shaped the post-Brexit relationship.",

      "In the press conference with EU chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa, the prime minister talked about moving on from the \"stale old debates\" of the Brexit years.",
      "It's worth remembering too that the 2016 referendum was not the only political mandate delivered on this issue, and that Labour's general election manifesto last year promised an \"improvement\" to the Brexit deal.",
      "The view at the top of government is that there is no public clamour to reopen the biggest questions of Brexit \u2013 membership of the single market and customs union \u2013 but that making the relationship smoother within those parameters is mere pragmatic common sense.",
      "Of course pragmatism lies in the eyes of the beholder. The Conservatives have lambasted the deal as \"surrender\", attacking both the 12-year extension to existing fishing quotas and the commitment for the UK to follow EU rules on agriculture.",
      "Reform UK, in many ways the successor to the Brexit Party and UKIP, are unsurprisingly making a similar argument.",
      "On the other side of the equation, the Liberal Democrats welcomed \"some positive first steps\" but urged the prime minister to \"be more ambitious\".",
      "Their position is that the UK should rejoin the EU's customs union - an agreement between member states not to charge tariffs on each other's goods.",
      "What will prove revealing over the coming days, weeks, and months is not just those opposition parties' positions but how much they campaign on them.",
      "If opposition to today's deal becomes a significant part of these parties' platforms, it will tell us that they believe there is in fact plenty of controversy yet in the decades-long debate over the UK's relationship with the EU.",
      "If that's right, then today's main significance may prove to have been thrusting questions about Brexit right back to the centre of political life.",
      "But if Sir Keir is right that the bulk of the public simply wants as little friction with the EU as possible, then he could prove to be our first truly post-Brexit prime minister.",

      "How much will the UK pay?",
      "The deal makes several references to a \"financial contribution\" from the UK to access certain benefits, notably an agreement to reduce checks on food exports to the EU.",
      "The prime minister's official spokesman said these were \"administrative costs\".",
      "He insisted they would not be \"big\" but refused to put a figure on how much the UK would pay.",
      "In other areas, terms are still being negotiated so the cost to the UK isn't known yet.",
      "For example, the two sides are working towards the UK rejoining the Erasmus+ exchange programme, which allows students to study or do work placements abroad.",

      "The government has said any such deal would be \"capped and time-limited\" but it has not specified how many visas could be issued annually and how long they would be valid for.",
      "These details will be the subject of future negotiations.",
      "The UK already has similar schemes with 11 countries including Australia, New Zealand and Japan, with people able to stay for up to three years depending on which country they are from.",
      "Last year, just over 24,000 youth mobility visas were issued by the UK.",
      "When can British travellers use e-gates?",

      "Some airports already allow British passport-holders to use e-gates - but for those that don't the only alternative is often a lengthy queue.",

      "The long-awaited digital border checks system is due to replace passport stamping for travellers from outside the EU in October.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said UK holidaymakers will want to get away \"without delay\" this summer and he wants them to be able to use e-gates \"as soon as possible\".",
      "But it is up to individual EU countries to decide whether British passport holders can use e-gates at their airports.",
      "So whether this will be possible in more countries by the summer holidays is unclear.",
      "Will it be easier for British bands to tour Europe?",
      "Since Brexit, British musicians have faced extra costs and red tape when touring Europe - and stars have long called for action to tackle this.",
      "Labour's general election manifesto last year pledged to \"help our touring artists\" as part of negotiations with the EU.",
      "But the deal agreed on Monday only recognises the \"value\" of touring artists and promises to continue efforts \"to support travel and cultural exchange\".",

      "Tom Kiehl, chief executive of UK Music, which represents the industry, welcomed this as \"an important first step\" but said the sector was seeking \"more concrete commitments\".",
      "Will UK qualifications be recognised in the EU?",
      "Another promise in Labour's manifesto was to \"secure a mutual recognition agreement for professional qualifications to help open up markets for UK service exporters\".",
      "This would mean professionals - such as doctors, lawyers, accountants and architects - who qualified in one country could practice in another with minimal extra bureaucracy.",
      "EU citizens already have the right to do this across the bloc.",
      "Such an agreement would make it easier for British companies to move staff between the UK and EU and undertake short-term work in Europe.",
      "However, there may be less incentive for the EU to reach a deal on this, given that the current situation makes it harder for UK firms to compete for business in Europe.",
      "Monday's deal only promises to set up \"dedicated dialogues\" on the recognition of professional qualifications.",

      "BBC Verify has gone through the deal, picking out the potential winners and losers.",
      "Food",
      "Winner: UK food exporters to the EU who could see fewer checks",
      "Loser: People who don't want the UK to follow EU rules, as there are strings attached",
      "Since Brexit, UK goods travelling to the EU \u2013 including food products \u2013 have faced new checks and extra paperwork.",
      "Some items, such as UK exports of raw burgers and sausages, have been banned from entering the EU because they do not meet its strict import rules.",
      "UK food exports to the EU have fallen \u2013 with volumes in 2024 down 34% compared with 2019 \u2013 and the industry blames this partly on the added red tape.",
      "Now, both sides have agreed to work on a joint food safety agreement that could remove many of the current barriers.",
      "If signed and fully implemented, it would reduce paperwork, ease checks, and could even lift bans on products like raw meats.",
      "Food and drink exports to the EU in 2023 were worth \u00a314bn, accounting for 57% of all the sector's overseas sales.",
      "But the deal comes with conditions. The UK will need to follow future EU food standards \u2013 a system known as \"dynamic alignment\" \u2013 and accept that the European Court of Justice will have the final say in any disputes in this area.",
      "The UK will be also required to make a financial contribution. However is it currently unknown how much the payment would be and when it would be required.",
      "Fishing",
      "Winner: The EU - fishing vessels get 12 more years of access to UK waters",
      "Loser: UK fishermen who wanted annual negotiations on fishing access",
      "Although fishing accounts for a very small part of the UK economy - just 0.04% of GDP in 2024 - it is politically sensitive.",
      "The \"reset\" document notes \"political agreements leading to full reciprocal access to waters to fish until 30 June 2038\" - a 12-year extension to the current deal negotiated by Boris Johnson's Conservative government - and much longer than expected.",
      "Under the existing agreement (due to expire in 2026), EU vessels get access to UK waters to fish - in return for transferring 25% of their fishing quota - the amount they are allowed to catch - to UK fleets.",
      "The new UK-EU deal at a glance",
      "UK-EU deal moves us on from Brexit rows, Starmer says",
      "Why youth mobility and fishing are key issues ahead of UK/EU summit",
      "Some UK fishing groups have criticised the existing deal and do not want to see it extended.",
      "Elspeth Macdonald, who represents 450 fishing boats as chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation says: \"This deal is a horror show for Scottish fishermen, far worse than Boris Johnson's botched Brexit agreement.\"",
      "She says the long-term deal takes away the industry's bargaining power in future talks and would prefer annual negotiations with the EU.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says there will be \"no increase in the amount that the EU vessels can catch in British waters\" and says it will now be easier for UK fishermen to export their products.",
      "In 2023, the UK exported \u00a31.2bn of fish to the EU, around 70% of all fish exports.",
      "Tavish Scott from Salmon Scotland, which represents salmon farming in Scotland, says the agreement to reduce checks would \"speed up the delivery of our premium salmon to market\".",
      "Youth mobility",
      "Winner: Young people in the UK and EU who should - if this is confirmed - be able to work and study more freely between the two",
      "Loser: Those who oppose an increase in net migration to the UK will point out that any mobility scheme could affect immigration figures, although this effect may be temporary",
      "The details here are still to be confirmed, but the winners would be those young people from both the UK and EU who would be able to work and study more easily across Europe and Great Britain. Other youth mobility schemes have focused on people aged 18 to 30.",
      "However, the impact of what is being called a \"youth experience scheme\" could be uneven.",
      "Before Brexit more young people from the EU came to the UK than went the other way.",
      "And, remember, Sir Keir has pledged to \"significantly\" reduce immigration levels in the coming years. So there's a  big question mark on what impact a UK-EU scheme could have on UK immigration levels.",
      "Madeleine Sumption from Oxford University's Migration Observatory told BBC Verify that a scheme would likely increase net migration in the short term, as new participants arrive.",
      "However, she adds that if everyone left the UK when their visa expired, the long-term impact on migration levels would be minimal.",
      "\"If the UK is worried about the impact, it could phase in the scheme, where it gradually increases the quota. So as people leave, the quota could be raised rather than a big bang all come at once,\" she said.",
      "eGates",
      "Winner: British tourists may be able to use eGates at EU airports but we do not know which ones and from when",
      "Loser: Those expecting to escape long queues this summer",
      "As part of the agreement, UK nationals will be able to use eGates at EU airports, rather than having their passport manually checked by a border officer.",
      "The government claims: \"British holidaymakers will be able to use more eGates in Europe, ending the dreaded queues at border control.\"",
      "However the text of the EU-UK agreement is less clear, only referring to the \"potential use of eGates where appropriate\".",
      "It is unlikely any change will be implemented by the summer, travel organisation Abta told BBC Verify.",
      "Abta believes the deal clarifies that the EU countries can offer eGates to UK nationals once a new Entry/Exit System (EES) comes into effect in October.",
      "EES is an automated IT system for registering all non-EU travellers for a short stay, each time they cross the EU's external borders.",
      "Whether UK passengers will avoid a border guard altogether will depend on the technology at each border crossing, Abta says.",
      "Defence",
      "Winner: UK defence firms may get contracts from new EU rearmament fund",
      "Loser: EU defence firms which hoped to get more of these revenues",
      "The EU has established a Security Action for Europe fund (SAFE) with \u20ac150bn (\u00a3126bn) of loans, backed by the EU budget, to enable its member states to rearm.",
      "This was going to be spent on EU-based defence firms. The fund also allows for the involvement of a number of non-EU countries and could now be opened up to UK defence companies too. This would potentially allow EU firms to use the fund to buy kit from the UK.",
      "The UK has a large defence manufacturing industry relative to many EU states and this sector directly employs about164,00 people in the UK.",
      "Between 2020 and 2024, the UK was estimated by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute to have accounted for around 3.6% of total global annual arms exports, making the UK the seventh largest national exporter.",

    "story": [
      "There was much fanfare  - and then lunch on the Thames - to mark the \"reset\" of the relationship between the UK and the EU with claims of a \"huge\" potential boost to growth.",
      "The deal does represent a  significant breakthrough in deepening ties in the UK's most important trading relationship and paves the way for more gains while still allowing scope for pursuing other trade deals.",
      "But ultimately what has been agreed so far only dismantles a fraction of the trade barriers erected post-Brexit.",
      "Those producing and selling foodstuffs between Britain and the EU, in particular, are celebrating a reduction in red tape and checks.",
      "The agreement on plant and animal health, or sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPS), goes further than envisaged a few months ago. By agreeing to follow EU rules, the government has faced accusations of selling out on sovereignty. But it will smooth the path for over 1,500 products crossing borders.",
      "The new UK-EU deal at a glance",
      "Brexitcast: The EU-UK Deal (and our Rachel Reeves interview)",
      "For more than four years, those selling agricultural products from Britain to the EU have had to comply with extra certification and checks, intended to prevent the spread of disease and ensure food safety.",
      "Amid frequent complaints of forms stretching to dozens of pages and fish and other perishables rotting in transit, the Food & Drink Federation claims that exports of such items to the EU have dropped by a third since 2019.",
      "Small companies were particularly likely to conclude it wasn't worth the effort; the variety of products being exported was reduced as costs increased. Formalities on items coming into the UK, too, have been ramped up, albeit more gradually.",
      "By doing away with some of the paperwork and inspections, the government claims this agreement - and the one centred on energy - will be worth \u00a38.9bn to the UK by 2040.",
      "Those predictions are always uncertain but that's roughly equivalent to 0.3% of GDP - helpful but not quite the \"huge\" boost to growth it claims. And that would recoup only a small  fraction of the 4% of GDP the government's own independent forecasters reckon has been foregone as a result of  Brexit.",
      "What about prices?",
      "Some studies suggest that greater red tape has contributed to higher prices for foodstuffs imported from the EU in recent years.",
      "And while retailers are among those welcoming this deal, it's not guaranteed that any savings in costs will be passed on, although the deal could limit the degree of future increases in the price of - that depends on suppliers passing on savings.",
      "The key concession made by the UK was an extension to the agreement on fisheries by 12 years. That sector represents just 0.04% of GDP, but clearly this will be a big disappointment to some fishing communities, concerned by an encroachment of rights. However, exports of fish to the EU have fallen by 29% over the course of just a few  years - the SPS agreement is likely to help reverse that loss.",
      "What's been agreed in detail so far may not provide the \"huge\" boost to growth the government wants, but there is more that should be ahead.",
      "The youth mobility scheme could deliver significant gains, depending on the details that are hammered out, as could the mutual recognition of professional qualifications.",
      "But even those are unlikely to repair even the majority of the damage to growth some economists reckon Brexit has caused.",
      "The independent Office for Budget Responsibility, the official forecasters, had reckoned that as a result of Brexit GDP will be the equivalent of 4% lower than it could have been. That's the equivalent of costing the economy \u00a3100bn per year.",
      "Fully compensating for that, analysts reckon, would involve the UK rejoining the single market and customs union and allowing freedom of movement - all of which the government reiterated today are \"red lines\" it's not prepared to cross.",
      "But there is still a very significant triumph the government can claim. In a short period of time, it has tied up trade agreements with India and the US - and struck this improved deal with the EU.",
      "The latter, in particular, may have been given added impetus by President Trump's trade hostility.",
      "Knowing it perhaps could rely less on that traditional ally across the Atlantic may not have driven the EU and UK into each others arms, but it likely added a new focus on working to break down barriers previously thought insurmountable.",
      "Moreover, the UK has achieved something many commentators thought not possible in the early years of Brexit, securing a deal (albeit limited) with the US without lowering food standards and so managing to align with EU rules.",
      "This deal may not be a huge growth gamechanger. But it paves the way for reaching more common ground with the EU while allowing the UK to strengthen ties with the US on services, in particular financial services, and technology - areas of growing importance for British firms doing business with America.",
      "And that strategic focus on building on our economic strength is not to be sniffed at, particularly at a time of geopolitical uncertainty"

      "Some sections of Scotland's fishing industry have accused Sir Keir Starmer's government of \"capitulating\" to the EU over a deal on access to UK waters.",
      "Labour ministers have agreed a 12-year deal which extends existing access for EU boats in exchange for reduced checks and restrictions on food exports.",
      "The agreement was described as \"disastrous\" by the Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) while Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes said it was a \"great betrayal of our fishing fleet\".",
      "But fish farming body Salmon Scotland welcomed the deal as a \"slashing of red tape\" which will allow Scottish products and people easier access to the EU.",
      "The prime minister officially announced the deal as part of the first UK-EU summit, describing it as a \"win-win\".",
      "He said it would \"tear down\" barriers to trade and end the \"needlessly difficult\" process of selling Scottish products in Europe.",
      "Starmer added the fishing agreement would protect UK access with no increase in EU vessels, while other measures meant shellfish could now be sold again in Europe.",
      "\"This agreement isn't about revisiting the stale old debates of the past,\" he said.",
      "\"It's time now for Britain to look forwards and outwards as a proud, sovereign nation on the world stage - to get the best deal for the people of Scotland and Britain. \"",
      "The new sanitary and phytosanitary agreement (SPS) would also benefit other agricultural exporters while holidaymakers will be able to use eGates at some airports to cut down on passport queue wait times, Starmer added.",
      "Forbes welcomed closer co-operation which \"unpicks a small part of the damage that  Brexit continues to inflict\".",
      "But she criticised the lack of consultation with the Scottish government over the fishing deal.",
      "\"Given the importance of fishing to Scotland it is also astonishing that the Scottish government was giving no warning of this great betrayal of our fishing fleet,\" she said.",
      "The previous post-Brexit deal saw the UK regain 25% of fishing rights from the EU, but it also gave European boats continuous access to UK waters.",
      "It was due to expire at the end of June 2026 but the new agreement will see that extended until the summer of 2038.",
      "The deal does not include any change to current access to fish for coastal communities. There is no reduction in the British quota or increase in the quota the EU is allowed to catch.",
      "But SFF chief executive Elspeth Macdonald said she was worried the agreement would end any \"leverage\" the UK has in future negotiations.",
      "She told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"This is not a roll over, it's a total capitulation to the EU and a disastrous outcome for the Scottish fishing fleet.",
      "\"The EU have clearly reneged on a deal that they signed up to in 2020 and have said that they require to have another multi-year deal.",
      "\"But in doing so the UK loses all its negotiating capital and all its leverage, so the EU continues to take a far bigger share of the resources in our waters than they are entitled to.",
      "\"We've always been in this position where fishing seems to be the expendable price for something else that the UK wants.\"",
      "Cutting 'red tape'",
      "While the deal has been criticised, it has also been welcomed in other parts of Scotland's fishing and food production industries.",
      "Tavish Scott, chief executive of Salmon Scotland, said the new agreement would help cut the time taken to get products into the EU market.",
      "The body said international sales of salmon from Scotland hit a record \u00a3844m in 2024, with France, where Scottish salmon is given the \"Label Rouge\" quality mark, the largest market at \u00a3462m.",
      "Mr Scott said the deal could open up new opportunities for Scottish producers in Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, where demand is rising despite tough competition from Norway and Chile.",
      "\"This breakthrough will ease the burden on our farmers, processors and the communities they support,\" he said.",
      "\"Scottish salmon is the UK's largest food export, with strong demand in the EU, the US and beyond.\"",
      "The deal also benefits shellfish producers after the EU banned British fishermen from selling live mussels, oysters, clams, cockles and scallops to its member states in 2021.",
      "Under those rules, fishermen were previously not allowed to transport the animals to the EU unless they had already been treated in purification plants.",
      "'Sold down the river'",
      "Mike Park, chief executive of the Scottish White Fish Association, described the deal as an \"utter betrayal\".",
      "He said it was the \"third time\" the fishing industry had been \"sold down the river,\" citing decisions by former prime minister Ted Heath, who took the UK into the EU in 1973, and Boris Johnson, who negotiated its exit in the aftermath of Brexit in 2020.",
      "Mr Park said: \"We understand the free flow of food products, the EU benefit from that and the UK benefit from it.",
      "\"But here we have a massive fleet coming into UK waters and the UK fishing industry gets nothing out of it.\"",
      "Scottish Conservative MP for Gordon and Buchan, Harriet Cross, described the deal as a \"surrender\" and \"one of the biggest acts of betrayal that our fishing industry has seen in Scotland.\"",
      "She said: \"Our fishermen have been used as a pawn by Keir Starmer, which will result in catastrophic consequences for our coastal communities.\"",
      "The UK government also announced a \u00a3360m fund to invest in coastal communities as part of the agreement.",
      "It said that would go towards new technology and equipment to modernise the fleet, training to upskill workforces and help to \"revitalise\" coastal communities.",
      "About 4,000 people are employed in Scotland's commercial sea fishing industry, according to a Scottish government report published in 2023.",
      "In 2022, it brought \u00a3335m into the Scottish economy, more than half of which came from Aberdeenshire, including the UK's largest fishing port at Peterhead.",
      "The fish farming and aquaculture industries account for about 2,200 jobs and brought in \u00a3337m to the Scottish economy in 2022.",
      "Keir Starmer has described this UK-EU deal as a \"win-win\" but that is not necessarily how it is viewed by every part of the Scottish fishing industry.",
      "The sharply contrasting reactions of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation - which has accused the UK government of \"capitulation\" - and Salmon Scotland, which has welcomed an agreement it believes will \"slash red tape\", underlines the fact that any deal involves trade-offs.",
      "The UK government is trying to offset the disappointment of some in the fishing industry with a \u00a3360m fund for coastal communities.",
      "There are aspects of closer cooperation between the UK and EU that the Scottish government is happy to welcome.",
      "However, there was never going to be a package that would satisfy SNP ministers, as they favour a return to the EU.",
      "They argue the best way for that to be achieved is through Scottish independence. But that debate has lost much of its previous energy.",
      "An earlier \"reset\" in relations between the UK and devolved governments has improved how they work together.",
      "But Scottish ministers argue that they should have been consulted on today's deal, despite foreign affairs being a matter reserved to Westminster.",

      "Hackers had scrambled Redcar and Cleveland Council's IT systems and would soon demand payment to restore it.",

      "But he conceded that the UK government may have to change approach if SNP popularity and support for another vote grows.",

      "While he doesn't think Scottish independence is currently on the agenda, he is warning supporters of the union not to \"assume any degree of complacency.\"",
      "Gove described the UK as a \"living thing\" and added that politicians had to continually demonstrate that the union was working.",
      "The former minister said that he didn't think a second referendum was \"necessary at the moment\", but added that if there was \"an overwhelming desire on the part of the Scottish people for one then we'd have to review the decision.\"",
      "When pressed on what would trigger such a change in policy, Gove said that was for the Westminster government to decide.",

      "He denied that this was anti-democratic and insisted that Scotland had \"more important\" issues to deal with.",

      "\"If, for the sake of argument, the SNP make all of those decisions in government in a way that gives people confidence in them then we might be in a different position [on a second referendum]\", he said.",
      "Michael Gove and SNP leader John Swinney do not have much in common politically, but they seem to be delivering a relatively similar message on this topic.",
      "Last week, the first minister talked about securing \"demonstrable support\" for independence.",
      "Swinney compared this to the 1997 referendum for a Scottish parliament, which was backed by around 74% of Scots.",

      "But the first minister also told BBC Scotland News that it was \"completely unacceptable\" for the independence movement \"to be thwarted by a Westminster government that just folds its arms and says 'no'.\"",

      "Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the term 'woman' related to biological sex under the Equality Act.",

      "Prof Phinnimore said: \"If that trend is to be reversed, a closer UK-EU relationship needs to deliver on reducing obstacles to the GB-NI movement of goods.\"",

      "How could an agri-food deal change things?",
      "Agri-food deals from the EU fall into two broad categories: New Zealand-style or Swiss-style.",
      "The EU's deal with New Zealand means that each party recognises that the other has high food standards and so the frequency of checks on products and paperwork is reduced.",
      "However, New Zealand still sets its own standards and a proportion of goods are still checked as they enter the EU.",
      "By contrast there are no regulatory border controls for trade in agri-food products between Switzerland and the EU.",
      "But the Swiss only have this deal because they agreed to follow EU rules almost to the letter, without much say in setting those rules.",
      "Switzerland is obliged to modify its laws in response to changes in EU legislation, what is known as dynamic alignment, and accept oversight from the European Court of Justice.",
      "A Swiss-style deal would mean controls on GB food products entering NI could be effectively ended.",
      "The EU has previously said this deal would be on offer to the UK but the government had retained an ambivalent stance on whether it would accept this.",
      "However in recent weeks ministers have been careful not to rule it out.",
      "Such a deal will face opposition from Brexit supporters who say it would involve surrendering powers which were returned to the UK after it left the EU.",

      "The Irish Sea is really two borders.",
      "One deals with products' standards - making sure goods can be legally sold. The other deals with customs - making sure the correct tariffs have been paid.",
      "An agri-food deal would go a long way to removing the standards border but it would leave the customs border untouched.",

    "summary": "The summit between the UK and EU on 19 May will be the first since Brexit - the very idea of it has polarised opinions",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Damian read this article",
      "On a warm morning earlier this month, a group of Metropolitan Police diplomatic protection officers sat in an anteroom off the ornate entrance hall in London's Lancaster House, sipping tea and nibbling chocolate biscuits, while upstairs a core group of European politicians discussed the future of European cooperation.",
      "It was an apt setting: everywhere you look in Lancaster House, there is evidence of the long, entangled histories of the UK and Europe. The double sweep of its grand staircase deliberately echoes the Palace of Versailles. Queen Victoria sat in these rooms listening to Frederic Chopin play the piano in 1848. Tony Blair hosted Russian President Putin here for an energy summit in 2003.",
      "The important issues on the agenda at the Lancaster House meeting, which was hosted by the Foreign Secretary David Lammy, included the latest developments in the war in Ukraine, Europe's response to ensure the continent's security, and \u2013 for the first time since Brexit \u2013 a summit between the UK and the European Union, which will take place on 19 May.",
      "The British government believes it's a significant moment.",
      "Before Brexit, British prime ministers would travel to Brussels four times a year or more for summits with the heads of the EU's institutions and its 27 member states. The haggling would go on late into the night. After Brexit those large summits stopped.",
      "Now, the Labour government, elected last year on a manifesto that promised \"an improved and ambitious relationship with our European partners\", envisages new and regular interactions with the EU. Monday's marks the first.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer will host the most senior EU leaders to launch a new \"partnership\".",
      "Pedro Serrano, the EU ambassador to London, has described it as the \"culmination of enhanced contacts at the highest levels since the July 2024 [UK] elections\". But what will it amount to?",
      "Is what's coming a \"surrender summit\" as the Conservatives warn; \"the great British sellout\" undoing bits of Brexit that Reform UK fear; or \"a huge opportunity\" the UK may be about to squander, as Liberal Democrats say? Or could it be an example of how, in Sir Keir Starmer's words, \"serious pragmatism defeats performative politics\" by delivering practical things that will improve people's lives?",
      "Questions around a security pact",
      "In those long, drama-filled nights of 2020, when the then-prime minister Boris Johnson was negotiating Brexit, the possibility of a Security and Defence Partnership was discussed. But the UK's main priority was diverging from Brussels. So nothing was agreed \u2013 a notable omission, some think.",
      "Now a new UK-EU security pact has been worked on for months, the plan is for it to be the centrepiece of what's agreed.",
      "Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, who is overseeing negotiations, was at the early talks at Lancaster House. \"Our relationship has had some difficulties,\" she told me, but \"considering what is going on in the world [\u2026] we need to move forward with this partnership.\"",
      "Yet some think the UK should not seize this outstretched hand.",
      "\"The cornerstone of our defence is Nato,\" Alex Burghart, a Conservative frontbencher, told the Commons this week. \"We know of no reason why Nato is insufficient.\"",
      "Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice has his own view. \"There's no value at all,\" he argues. \"We do not want to be constrained by a bungling top-down bureaucratic military structure. Our defence is guaranteed by Nato.\"",
      "The government fires back on that point, arguing that a partnership will in no way undermine Nato; rather it will complement it, they say, because it will stretch to areas beyond defence, like the security of our economies, infrastructure, energy supplies, even migration and transnational crime.",
      "Some industry experts also believe that a security pact could boost the UK economy. Kevin Craven, chief executive of ADS Group, a UK trade association that represents aerospace, defence and security firms, is among them.",
      "Take, for example, the SAFE (Security Action For Europe) programme that is being set up by the EU, aiming to provide up to \u20ac150bn (\u00a3126bn) in loans for new projects. If the UK strikes a security partnership with the EU, then British weapons manufacturers could potentially access some of that cash.",
      "\"There is a huge amount of interest from European partners,\" says Mr Craven. \"One of the challenges for defence companies in the last couple of years, since the advent of Ukraine, is being able to scale up their own capacity to meet demand.\" He estimates the UK could boost the EU's defence output by a fifth.",
      "The Liberal Democrat's Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Calum Miller, similarly believes that a security pact is a huge opportunity for the British defence industry - but, he adds, \"as importantly, it's a new strategic opportunity for the UK to be part of that ongoing conversation about how we arm as a continent\".",
      "Others point out that the UK has already been working with the EU on defence ever since Russia's invasion of Ukraine \u2013 at Nato, and most recently via the so-called Coalition of the Willing.",
      "So, in practice, does it make huge amounts of difference to the UK's place in Europe?",
      "No, argues Jill Rutter, a former senior civil servant who is now a senior fellow at the UK in a Changing Europe think tank. \"Because relations [on defence] have already been improving quite a long way.\"",
      "Some of those working on the partnership, however, argue that it will set in train new ways for the UK to engage and cooperate with its neighbours.",
      "Delays at the border",
      "More contentious is the UK's desire to sign what's called a 'veterinary' deal to remove some border checks on food and drink. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister leading these negotiations, told the Commons this week that the objective to lower food and drink costs is in the manifesto, so there is a mandate for it.",
      "Inside the food industry, calls for reform have been growing. Julianne Ponan, whose firm Creative Nature makes vegan snack bars, exports to 18 countries but only a small proportion goes to the EU. She says this is because of the paperwork and inspections since Brexit.",
      "One of her employees had to carry samples in her luggage on a passenger flight to Spain for a meeting to make sure the food wasn't held up at the border, she says.",
      "\"I think this will open up huge opportunities for businesses like mine.\"",
      "It would also make a big difference for Northern Ireland. After Brexit, special arrangements were put in place to keep the land border it shares with the Republic of Ireland free of new impediments. But at the same time, new paperwork and inspections were put in place on food, drink, animals and plants being transported from mainland Britain across the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland. They're bitterly opposed by Unionist politicians and complicate life for many businesses.",
      "But a veterinary deal may carry political danger. It would require the UK to align some of its rules on food and drink with EU ones, and move in-step with Brussels over time. And those rules are subject to oversight by EU courts.",
      "\"I call it the surrender summit,\" says Andrew Griffith, the Conservative Shadow Business and Trade Secretary. Under this deal the UK would lose \"our freedom to set our own rules\", he adds.",
      "The Conservatives say they \"fought long and hard\" to \"take back control of our laws, our borders, our money\" \u2013 and that this should not now be reversed.",
      "Step change or 'sell out'?",
      "Reform UK has not held back in its language: \"We think prepare for the Great British sell out. That's the bottom line, and it will be dressed up as a reset,\" Richard Tice says.",
      "\"Why would you want to reset and get closer to a patently failing economic model? The EU is struggling even more than we are. We should be diverging as fast as we can away from that.\"",
      "But Labour's Thomas-Symonds dismisses these views as a \"rehash of the arguments of the past\".",
      "On the other end of the spectrum is the accusation that Sir Keir is far too cautious. Calum Miller of the Liberal Democrats says he knows of businesses \"gnashing their teeth in frustration that they just can't exploit opportunities to work with and trade with Europe\".",
      "His party wants the UK to explore a Customs Union with the EU. It would make moving goods easier, but mean we couldn't sign our own trade deals.",
      "David Henig, a former senior trade negotiator, has been talking to both sides \"hoping to help, to sort of navigate them in\".",
      "\"The summit is a step forward, not a step change,\" he says, \"A slight deepening of the trade ties, rather than something dramatically new.\"",
      "A deal on food and drink checks would deliver very little, he believes, because food and drink is such a limited part of trade. \"If you were, for example, aligning UK and EU rules on industrial products, you'd get a much bigger economic impact\".",
      "Jill Rutter thinks that a veterinary deal would not prove \"economically earth shattering\" \u2013 but if it goes well, she argues that it could provide \"early proof of concept\" for further UK-EU cooperation.",
      "'Tough it out' on fishing?",
      "After Brexit, many British fishermen were disappointed when Boris Johnson's government agreed to let EU boats continue much as before, taking significant catches from UK waters. Those arrangements expire next year. The EU wants them extended.",
      "David Davis who, as Brexit minister, led some of the original negotiations for the UK, told me fishing was \"totemic\" for Brussels. London conceded too easily, he thinks.",
      "\"Europeans got what they wanted first, and then we had a haggle from a weak position.\"",
      "So he adds, \"If I was giving advice to the government, I would say, tough it out\" and use fishing as a lever to seek concessions.",
      "But, as the UK found before, Brussels has cards to play. Much of the fish caught by British fishermen is sold to buyers on the Continent and the UK needs access to that market.",
      "Some EU coastal states, like France and Denmark, are prepared to drive a hard bargain, demanding that London concedes on fishing rights in return for things it wants. Early on, even signing the Security Partnership was being linked to agreement on a fishing deal. The haggling will be tough.",
      "Immigration and youth mobility",
      "And finally, there's an idea that has prompted much interest in recent months: a youth mobility deal, through which under-30s from the UK and EU could live and work in each other's countries.",
      "For a long time the government said there were \"no plans\" for such a deal \u2013 but earlier this month they changed course, with Labour's Thomas-Symonds saying that \"A smart, controlled youth mobility scheme would of course have benefits for our young people\".",
      "It's likely that would mean very limited numbers allowed to enter the UK, and only with a visa, for a limited time.",
      "Under those conditions, ministers hope it would not inflate net migration numbers. It's far from what the EU would like.",
      "The UK already has similar schemes with 13 countries, including Australia, New Zealand and Japan.",
      "\"When we are comfortable having those relationships, why are we so averse to having it with our nearest neighbours?\" Calum Miller asks, \"It just doesn't really make sense\".",
      "Paula Surridge, a professor of political sociology at Bristol University, argues that public views on immigration are more nuanced than many people think. \"Voters care most about what they perceive as illegal migration \u2013 small boat crossings and so on,\" she says, \"People coming here to study or to work, particularly young people, are not a particular cause for concern\" for most.",
      "\"There will definitely be a group of voters that are upset [about potential deals], but they were never going to vote Labour.\"",
      "Of those who backed Labour in 2024, she adds, about three quarters previously voted Remain in the Brexit referendum. The political risk to the government of signing pacts with the EU is \"smaller than it appears\", she adds.",
      "Conservative pollster Lord Hayward is more cautious \u2013 and is concerned that a deal may pose a \"bear trap\" for the government if it's seen as providing free movement to young Europeans. \"It will provide serious difficulties for them to come to an agreement on something which could easily be portrayed as EU membership 2.0.\"",
      "'Making Brexit work'",
      "Even before Sir Keir's upcoming summit on Monday, his opponents are raising that spectre.",
      "\"All of his muscle memory has been to get closer to the European political union,\" says Mr Griffith. \"I am worried about our prime minister, with that baggage, with those preconceived ideas, [\u2026] trying to negotiate a better deal with the EU.\"",
      "Richard Tice says his party could simply undo any deals with the EU. \"If I'm right about our fears, and we win the next general election, we will just reverse the lot. The whole lot.\"",
      "But Mr Thomas-Symonds is of the view that Monday will show the government is \"not returning to the Customs Union, Single Market, or Freedom of Movement\", all red lines it has pledged not to cross.",
      "Instead it will be about \"making Brexit work in the interests of the British people\".",
      "Labour to unveil big immigration plans next week - but will they win back votes?",
      "The real problem facing Britain's shrinking military",
      "Sir John Curtice: The map that shows Reform's triumph was much more than a protest vote",
      "Back at Lancaster House, the politicians have moved on, heading to more meetings in Albania and Turkey to grapple with the issues facing the continent. But in a quiet hallway in the house is a painting from the 1850s of the Duke of Wellington inspecting troops in London's Hyde Park.",
      "In it, he sits on a black stallion, raising his white-feathered hat to salute the cavalry - a tribute to the prime minister and military hero who defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo.",
      "The upcoming summit won't be as momentous an event in the UK's complicated history with Europe. But a modern British leader about to plunge into the fray of European politics might pause for thought here \u2013 perhaps, for just a moment.",

      "How are the inheritance tax rules changing?",

      "Downing Street insisted its own deal with Albania was \"never planned as part of the discussions.\"",
      "In short, though, they had failed to ensure the most eye-catching idea they were talking about matched the pictures, the backdrop, the stage they were on.",
      "Cue the Conservatives, whose own record on small boat crossings was poor, but who can point to that specific success with Albania, seizing on Sir Keir's awkward juxtaposition and branding it an \"embarrassment\".",

      "Sir Keir Starmer is being urged to scrap a law forcing people who live in mobile homes to hand over 10% of the profits when they sell up to the site owner.",
      "The charge has been labelled  \"legal theft of equity\" by campaigner Sonia McColl, one of an estimated 200,000 park homes residents across England.",

      "Sonia, who has earned an OBE for her campaigning work, has been fighting  for a change to the law for more than a decade and complained politicians \"keep kicking it into the long grass\" but she was hopeful the new cohort of MPs would \"make a tremendous difference\".",
      "Asked why the issue was so important to her, she said: \"Often people need to move into care homes and the loss of 10% of their equity curtails the amount they can afford and that falls back on the local council.",

      "\"Why should the park site owner benefit from work and investment in kitchens and bathrooms in park homes?\" he asked.",
      "\"They already get pitch funds and annual rent, so taking 10% when homes are sold is fundamentally unfair because the park owner doesn't do anything to have this stake in other people's property.\"",

      "UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch and her Senedd leader Darren Millar have declined to rule out deals with Plaid Cymru and Reform after next year's election in Wales.",
      "On current projections, it is likely politicians of different parties will need to work together to form the next Welsh government, with a majority difficult to obtain.",
      "On the first day of his party's Welsh conference in Llangollen, Senedd Tory leader Darren Millar has said his party was willing to work with \"anybody\" to get Labour out of power.",
      "Kemi Badenoch, who has ruled out working Reform at a UK level, admitted it was a \"reality\" that post-election talks may need to happen but said the conversation was a \"distraction\".",
      "The Conservatives have been polling in fourth place behind Labour, Reform UK and Plaid Cymru ahead of the election in Wales next May and lost all their Welsh MPs at the last general election.",
      "Millar described his party, which has 16 seats in the Welsh Parliament, as a \"government in waiting\" while Badenoch called on members to \"fight back\" against Plaid Cymru and Reform.",

      "Asked to clarify if that was his answer to working with Reform, he repeated the point: \"I will work with anybody to get rid of this dreadful Welsh Labour government. I'll say no more than that.\"",
      "Pushed on what his position was on working with Plaid Cymru, he made the same comment.",
      "'We're not here to talk about deals'",
      "In an interview with BBC Wales, Badenoch was asked if she wanted to fight Plaid Cymru and Reform or do a deal with them.",
      "She said: \"We're not here to talk about deals, we're here to talk about what we are going to do to fix Wales.",
      "\"Whenever politicians start talking about who they are going to do deals with or how they are going to get back into government, you can see they are not really thinking about what is going to deliver for the people of this country.",
      "\"And that's why Darren and I are 100% focused on Conservatives winning as many seats as possible.\"",
      "Asked again about deals with Reform or Plaid, Badenoch admitted it was a \"reality\" that conversations might take place \"but right now, that's not where we are\".",
      "She added: \"I'm very clear I'm not having this conversation because its a distraction.\"",
      "Nigel Farage has said that Reform UK would be willing to work with any other party to form a government in Wales.",
      "In her speech to conference, Badenoch said Plaid Cymru and Reform were playing the \"politics of identity\".",
      "She said Labour had \"always been able to blame someone else\" in Wales and that Plaid Cymru and Reform were \"benefiting\" now Labour was in power in Westminster.",
      "\"It's the politics of identity they are playing and we need to fight back. Reform is not the answer, Labour is not the answer.",
      "\"All these other parties are a flavour of the same thing. They tell people what they think they want to hear because they're trying to help themselves.\"",
      "Badenoch said last year's election result was \"devastating\" and the local elections in England showed the party was \"not yet out of the woods\".",
      "She said Wales was \"where our fightback begins\".",
      "In her speech she said it was \"good to be back in Wales\" before saying it had been \"fantastic meeting so many people\" including \"MSPs\".",
      "Wales does not have any MSPs \u2013 politicians from Cardiff Bay are called Members of the Senedd (MSs).",
      "She later told BBC Wales it was a \"slip of the tongue\".",
      "Earlier, Millar told the conference that last year's general election defeat was \"very bruising\" and it was \"clear that we have got a lot of work to do  to rebuild trust\".",
      "He said his party was \"the only credible alternative to this clapped out, lacklustre Labour government that has run this country into the ground, has run out of ideas and has run out of steam\".",
      "He said \"a bad opinion poll\" did not discourage him, but \"motivates me. It makes me work harder\".",
      "He said the Tories were \"pro-freedom, pro-choice, pro-personal responsibility\".",
      "On Friday morning the party launched a number of policies including a promise to bring down waits for NHS treatment to no more than a year, and reinstating home economics to schools.",
      "Millar told Radio Wales Breakfast that the policies showed the Tories were \"a government in waiting\".",
      "The conference follows a row among party grassroots members, who say Tories who dislike devolution are effectively barred from being candidates for the next Senedd election.",
      "Analysis",
      "By Gareth Lewis, BBC Wales political editor",
      "Kemi Badenoch did not want to talk about post election deals, but did not rule them out either.",
      "Both she and Darren Millar appear to accept that with the polls looking ominous, this is the party's best hope of being involved in government in Cardiff Bay.",
      "But while Millar was talking of the potential for deals as soon as he took over last December, Badenoch's reticence suggests she is aware of the wider ramifications.",
      "She has already ruled out a pact with Reform at Westminster level \u2013 they potentially represent an existential threat to the Tories, and a deal with Plaid Cymru might be a tough sell to members of the Conservative and Unionist Party.",
      "Her choice of language is interesting too: Senedd politicians have accepted deals as a fact of political life for the past quarter of a century.",
      "For a Westminster politician they are seen as a \"stitch-up\"."

      "Inside a laboratory nestled above the mist of the forests of South Dakota, scientists are searching for the answer to one of science's biggest questions: why does our Universe exist?",
      "They are in a race for the answer with a separate team of Japanese scientists \u2013 who are several years ahead.",
      "The current theory of how the Universe came into being can't explain the existence of the planets, stars and galaxies we see around us. Both teams are building detectors that study a sub-atomic particle called a neutrino in the hope of finding answers.",
      "The US-led international collaboration is hoping the answer lies deep underground, in the aptly named Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune).",
      "The scientists will travel 1,500 metres below the surface into three vast underground caverns. Such is the scale that construction crews and their bulldozers seem like  small plastic toys by comparison.",
      "The science director of this facility, Dr Jaret Heise describes the giant caves as \"cathedrals to science\".",
      "Dr Heise has been involved the construction of these caverns at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (Surf) for nearly ten years. They seal Dune off from the noise and radiation from the world above. Now, Dune is now ready for the next stage.",
      "\"We are poised to build the detector that will change our understanding of the Universe with instruments that will be deployed by a collaboration of more than 1,400 scientists from 35 countries who are eager to answer the question of why we exist,\" he says.",
      "When the Universe was created two kinds of particles were created: matter \u2013 from which stars, planets and everything around us are made \u2013 and, in equal amounts, antimatter, matter's exact opposite.",
      "Theoretically the two should have cancelled each other out, leaving nothing but a big burst of energy. And yet, here we \u2013 as matter \u2013 are.",
      "Scientists believe that the answer to understanding why matter won \u2013\u00a0and we exist \u2013 lies in studying a particle called the neutrino and its antimatter opposite, the anti-neutrino.",
      "They will be firing beams of both kinds of particles from deep underground in Illinois to the detectors at South Dakota, 800 miles away.",
      "This is because as they travel, neutrinos and anti-neutrinos change ever so slightly.",
      "The scientists want to find out whether those changes are different for the neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. If they are, it could lead them to the answer of why matter and anti-matter don't cancel each other out.",
      "Dune is an international collaboration, involving 1,400 scientists from thirty countries. Among them is Dr Kate Shaw from Sussex University, who told me that the discoveries in store will be \"transformative\" to our understanding of the Universe and humanity's view of itself.",
      "\"It is really exciting that we are here now with the technology, with the engineering, with the computer software skills to really be able to attack these big questions,\" she said.",
      "Half a world away, Japanese scientists are using shining golden globes to search for the same answers. Gleaming in all its splendour it is like a temple to science, mirroring the cathedral in South Dakota 6,000 miles (9,650 km) away. The scientists are building Hyper-K - which will be a bigger and better version of their existing neutrino detector, Super-K.",
      "The Japanese-led team will be ready to turn on their neutrino beam in less than three years, several years earlier than the American project. Just like Dune, Hyper-K is an international collaboration. Dr Mark Scott of Imperial College, London believes his team is in pole position to make one of the biggest ever discoveries about the origin of the Universe.",
      "\"We switch on earlier and we have a larger detector, so we should have more sensitivity sooner than Dune,\" he says.",
      "Having both experiments running together means that scientists will learn more than they would with just one, but, he says, \"I would like to get there first!\"",
      "But Dr Linda Cremonesi, of Queen Mary University of London, who works for the Dune project, says that getting there first may not give the Japanese-led team the full picture of what is really going on.",
      "\"There is an element of a race, but Hyper K does not have yet all of the ingredients that they need to understand if neutrinos and anti-neutrinos behave differently.\"",
      "The race may be on, but the first results are only expected in a few years' time. The question of just what happened at the beginning of time to bring us into existence remains a mystery \u2013 for now.",

      "\"Then here, we have all of these long, skinny bones. These are all ribs. And this is a neat one - it's part of a toe bone. This one here, we have no idea what it is - it's a great example of a Pipestone Creek mystery.\"",
      "BBC News has come to Pipestone Creek to witness the sheer scale of this prehistoric graveyard and see how researchers are piecing together the clues.",
      "Thousands of fossils have been collected from the site, and are constantly generating new discoveries.",
      "The bones all belong to a dinosaur called Pachyrhinosaurus. The species, and Prof Bamforth's excavation, feature in a new landmark BBC series - Walking With Dinosaurs - which uses visual effects and science to bring this prehistoric world to life.",
      "These animals, which lived during the Late Cretaceous period, were a relative of the Triceratops. Measuring about five metres long and weighing two tonnes, the four-legged beasts had large heads, adorned with a distinctive bony frill and three horns. Their defining feature was a big bump on the nose called a boss.",
      "The dig season has just started and lasts each year until autumn. The fossils in the small patch of ground that the team are working on are incredibly tightly packed; Prof Bamforth estimates there are up to 300 bones in every square metre.",
      "So far, her team has excavated an area the size of a tennis court, but the bed of bones extends for a kilometre into the hillside.",
      "\"It's jaw dropping in terms of its density,\" she tells us.",
      "\"It is, we believe, one of the largest bone beds in North America.",
      "\"More than half of the known dinosaur species in the world are described from a single specimen. We have thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus here.\"",
      "Palaeontologists believe the dinosaurs were migrating together in a colossal herd for hundreds of miles from the south - where they had spent the winter - to the north for the summer.",
      "The area, which had a much warmer climate than it does today, would have been covered in rich vegetation, providing abundant food for this enormous group of plant-eating animals.",
      "\"It is a single community of a single species of animal from a snapshot in time, and it's a huge sample size. That almost never happens in the fossil record,\" says Prof Bamforth.",
      "Bigger beasts offering clues",
      "And this patch of north-western Alberta wasn't just home to Pachyrhinosaurus. Even bigger dinosaurs roamed this land, and studying them is essential to try and understand this ancient ecosystem.",
      "Two hours drive away, we reach the Deadfall Hills. Getting there involves a hike through dense forest, wading - or doggy-paddling in the case of Aster - across a fast-running river, and clambering over slippery rocks.",
      "No digging is required here; super-sized bones lie next to the shoreline, washed out from the rock and cleaned by the flowing water, just waiting to be picked up.",
      "A huge vertebra is quickly spotted, as are bits of ribs and teeth scattered across the mud.",
      "Palaeontologist Jackson Sweder is particularly interested in what looks like a chunk of dinosaur skull. \"Most of what we find here is a duck-billed dinosaur called Edmontosaurus. If this is a skull bone, this is a dinosaur that's large - probably 30ft (10m) long,\" he says.",
      "The Edmontosaurus, another herbivore, roamed the forests like the Pachyrhinosaurus - and is helping palaeontologists build up a picture of this ancient land.",
      "Sweder is the collection manager at the Philip J Currie Dinosaur Museum in nearby Grande Prairie, where the bones from both of these giants are taken to be cleaned up and analysed. He is currently working on a huge Pachyrhinosaurus skull that's about 1.5m long and has been nicknamed \"Big Sam\".",
      "He points to where the three horns should be at the top of the frill, but the one in the middle is missing. \"All\u00a0the skulls that are decently complete have a spike in that spot,\" he says. \"But\u00a0its nice little unicorn spike doesn't seem to be there.\"",
      "Throughout years working at the extraordinary site, the museum team has collected 8,000 dinosaur bones, and the surfaces of the lab are covered in fossils; there are bones from Pachyrhinosaurus of every size, from young to old.",
      "Having material from so many animals allows researchers to learn about dinosaur biology, answering questions about how the species grows and the make-up of the community. They can also look at individual variations, to see how one Pachyrhinosaurus could stand out from the herd \u2013 as may be the case with Big Sam and his missing spike.",
      "A sudden devastating event",
      "All of this detailed research, in the museum and at the two sites, is helping the team to answer the vital question: how did so many animals in Pipestone Creek die at the same time?",
      "\"We believe that this was a herd on a seasonal migration that got tangled up in some catastrophic event that effectively wiped out, if not the entire herd, then a good proportion of it,\" Prof Bamforth says.",
      "All the evidence suggests that this catastrophic event was a flash flood - perhaps a storm over the mountains that sent an unstoppable torrent of water towards the herd, ripping trees from their roots and shifting boulders.",
      "Prof Bamforth says the Pachyrhinosaurus wouldn't have stood a chance. \"These animals are not able to move very fast because of their sheer numbers, and they're very top heavy - and really not very good at swimming at all.\"",
      "Rocks found at the site show the swirls of sediment from the fast-flowing water churning everything up. It's as if the destruction is frozen in time as a wave in the stone.",
      "But this nightmare day for the dinosaurs is now a dream for palaeontologists.",
      "\"We know, every time we come here, it's 100% guaranteed we'll find bones. And every year we discover something new about the species,\" says Prof Bamforth.",
      "\"That's why we keep coming back, because we're still finding new things.\"",
      "As the team packs up their tools ready to return another day, they know there's a lot of work ahead. They've only just scratched the surface of what's here - and there are many more prehistoric secrets just waiting to be revealed.",

    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 15:01:51 GMT",
    "summary": "Researchers in Japan and US have unlocked the 60-year mystery of what gives cats their orange colour.",
    "story": [
      "Garfield, Puss in Boots,  Aristocats' Toulouse \u2013 cultural icons maybe, ginger most certainly.",
      "And now scientists across two continents have uncovered the DNA mystery that has given our furry friends, particularly males, their notable colour.",
      "They discovered that ginger cats are missing a section of their genetic code, which means the cells responsible for their skin, eye and fur tone produce lighter colours.",
      "The breakthrough has brought delight to the scientists but also the thousands of cat lovers that originally crowdfunded the research.",
      "The scientists hope solving the puzzle could also help shed light on whether orange coloured cats are at increased risk of certain health conditions.",
      "It has been known for decades that it is genetics that gives orange tabby cats their distinctive colouring, but exactly where in the genetic code has evaded scientists till now.",
      "Two teams of scientists at Kyushu University in Japan and Stanford University in the US have now revealed the mystery in simultaneous papers published on Thursday.",
      "What the teams found was that in the cells responsible for giving a cat its skin, hair follicles and eyes their colour - melanocytes - one gene, ARHGAP36, was much more active.",
      "Genes are made up of pieces of DNA which give instructions to a cat's cells, like other living creatures, on how to function.",
      "By comparing the DNA from dozens of cats with and without orange fur they found that those with ginger colouring had a section of DNA code missing within this ARHGAP36 gene.",
      "Without this DNA the activity of the ARHGAP36 is not suppressed i.e. it is more active. The scientists believe that the gene instructs those melanocytes to produce lighter pigment.",
      "Ginger cats mostly male",
      "For decades scientists have observed that cats with completely ginger colouring are far more likely to be male. This tallies with the fact that the gene is carried on the X chromosome.",
      "Chromosomes are larger sections of DNA, and male cats like other mammals have an X and a Y chromosome, which carry different number of genes.",
      "As it is a gene only on the X chromosome, in this case controlling the pigment production, then one missing piece of DNA is enough to turn a cat fully ginger.",
      "In comparison female cats have two X chromosomes so the DNA needs to be missing in both chromosomes to increase lighter pigment production to the same extent - it means a mixed colouring is more likely.",
      "\"These ginger and black patches form because, early in development, one X chromosome in each cell is randomly switched off,\" explains Prof Hiroyuki Sasaki, geneticist at Kyushu University.",
      "\"As cells divide, this creates areas with different active coat colour genes, resulting in distinct patches.\"",
      "Although couched in science, the study originally started off as a passion project for Professor Sasaki.",
      "He had retired from his university post, but as a cat lover said he wanted to continue working to uncover the orange cat gene in the hope it could \"contribute to the overcoming of cat diseases\".",
      "He and his team raised 10.6m yen (\u00a355,109) via crowdfunding for the research from thousands of fellow cat lovers across Japan and the world.",
      "One contributor wrote: \"We are siblings in the first and third grades of elementary school. We donated with our pocket money. Use it for research on calico cats.\"",
      "The ARHGAP36 gene is also active in many other areas of the body including the brain and hormonal glands, and is considered important for development.",
      "The researchers think it is possible that the DNA mutation in the gene could cause other changes in these parts of the body linked to health conditions or temperament.",
      "The ARHGAP36 gene is found in humans and has been linked to skin cancer and hair loss.",
      "\"Many cat owners swear by the idea that different coat colours and patterns are linked with different personalities,\" said Prof Sasaki.",
      "\"There's no scientific evidence for this yet, but it's an intriguing idea and one I'd love to explore further.\"",

    "story": [
      "Many of the UK's rivers have hit exceptionally low levels and that could worsen in the next three months, according to the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), raising questions over supplies to households, farmers and businesses.",
      "The warning comes after the driest spring in England since 1961, with northern regions experiencing the driest start to the year in nearly a century.",
      "Almost all of the UK is expected to have below normal or low river levels in May, apart from the south-west of England and southern Wales.",
      "The Environment Agency has said that the UK is at medium risk of drought and warned households of the risk of water restrictions.",
      "The next 2-3 weeks will be \"crucial\" in determining whether the country goes into drought, says Mark Owen, head of fisheries for the Angling Trust and a member of the National Drought Group.",
      "That is the committee, led by the government, that declares if and when a drought is officially under way.",
      "The country is not now in drought, but the impacts of the exceptionally dry weather are already being felt.",
      "Some farmers are being forced to water their crops instead of relying on rainfall, which is something that normally happens later in the year.",
      "\"We are having a drought now from an agricultural point of view,\" arable farmer Nick Deane told BBC News from his farm in Norfolk.",
      "He had to start irrigating his fields in March.",
      "\"We have to ration our water and decide which areas we are going to put that water on in order to keep the crops growing,\" he said.",
      "He warned that an extremely long drought would mean farmers struggle to produce food and more produce would need to be imported.",
      "The dry and sunny weather this year has led to a larger area of the UK burned by wildfires this year compared with any other entire year.",
      "The last drought was in June-August 2022, which was the joint hottest summer (with 2018) and fifth driest since the 1890s.",
      "Five companies introduced hosepipe bans, affecting 19 million people, and waterways had restricted navigation.",
      "That drought was preceded by six months of very dry weather.",
      "However, the wet summer in 2024 and moderately-wet winter means water supplies are in a better place now and water companies have larger reserves to rely on.",
      "But dry weather earlier in the year has risks. It does \"potentially pose a greater risk to water resources later on in the year, particularly if the dry weather continues,\" says Stephen Turner, hydrologist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.",
      "Last week, Richard Thompson, chair of the National Drought Group, warned that water companies may need to bring in water restrictions to protect supplies if the dry weather continues.",
      "At the moment the key questions are when will it next rain and when it does, how much will there be.",
      "There are some signs that some rain is on the horizon, with unsettled weather from the west at the end of next week.",
      "Drinking water comes from different places depending on the geography and geology of regions.",
      "Roughly speaking, the south of England takes a long time to get into drought but a long time to leave. That's because a lot of rainfall is stored in rocks underground and takes a long time to reach rivers and water supplies.",
      "By contrast, the north of England quickly enters drought and quickly gets out because reservoirs are more heavily used for water supplies.",
      "Water Companies introduce hosepipe bans when water supplies reach a certain low in their areas.",
      "If drought conditions become severe, the government can restrict irrigation of farms, reduce boats' movement on waterways, and limit water available to non-essential businesses like car washes.",
      "In an extreme scenario, it could ration the amount of water available to homes and businesses but that has not happened since 1976.",
      "Water industry bosses and the National Farmers' Union (NFU) are calling on the government to do more to ensure the driest parts of the UK have secure water supplies in the face of any future drought.",
      "Water UK, which represents the water industry, is calling for a new national water grid of pipes, canals and reservoirs to be set up in England to move water from the wettest regions to where it is most needed.",
      "And farmers say they need more government funding and less planning red tape to build their own reservoirs to supply their farms.",
      "Mr Deane came together with five other farmers, including fruit growers, to build their own reservoir. It took four years and cost more than \u00a31m.",
      "It has proved vital, they say, with 15% of the stored water already used this year in the dry conditions.",
      "But the group said obtaining planning permission was costly and difficult.",
      "A government spokesman said it was working with the agricultural sector to improve its water supply resilience and establish more groups of farmers who could work together to develop their own reservoirs.",
      "He added: \"Over \u00a3104bn of private sector investment has been secured to fund essential infrastructure, including nine new reservoirs, to help secure our future water supply for farmers.\"",
      "Are the dry conditions linked to climate change?",
      "The prolonged dry weather is linked to what are called \"blocking highs\" when a high pressure weather system becomes stuck.",
      "Scientists do not know if this blocked pattern is linked to climate change.",
      "Global warming is expected to cause more extreme weather events globally.",
      "Studies about our future climate suggest more and longer periods of dry weather as well as periods of less rainfall in the UK. Winters are likely to be wetter and warmer.",

      "It takes about 45 minutes to get all her gear on before a helmet is carefully lowered over her head.",
      "The British astronaut is about to undergo her toughest challenge yet \u2013 assessing whether she is ready for a spacewalk. The test will take place in one of the largest pools in the world: Nasa's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.",
      "The pool \u2013 which is 12m deep (40ft) \u2013 contains a life-sized replica of the International Space Station (ISS), and a \"spacewalk\" here is as close as it gets to mimicking weightlessness on Earth.",
      "\"It's a big day,\" Rosemary says before the dive, which is going to last more than six hours. \"It's very physically intense \u2013 and it's very psychologically intense.\"",
      "But Rosemary doesn't seem too fazed. She smiles and waves as the platform she's standing on is slowly lowered into the water.",
      "Being an astronaut was Dr Rosemary Coogan's dream from a young age, she says. But it was a dream that seemed out of reach.",
      "\"At the careers day at school, you don't tend to meet astronauts,\" Rosemary says. \"You don't get to meet people who've done it, you don't really get to hear their stories.\"",
      "So she decided to study the stars instead, opting for a career in astrophysics. But when the European Space Agency (ESA) announced it was looking for new recruits to go to space, Rosemary applied and was chosen from more than 22,000 people.",
      "ESA aims to get Rosemary to the International Space Station (ISS) by 2030. She'll be following in the footsteps of Britons Helen Sharman, who visited the Soviet's Mir Space Station in 1991, and Tim Peake who launched to the ISS in 2015.",
      "Rosemary has spent the last six months training at the Johnson Space Center. As well as exploring the outside of the submerged ISS, she can head inside the orbiting lab in another life-sized mock-up located in a huge hangar.",
      "She takes us on a tour of the lab's interconnected modules. It feels very cramped, especially considering astronauts usually spend many months on board. But Rosemary reminds us about the spectacular views.",
      "\"It is an isolated environment, but I think this helps to give that kind of connection to being outside \u2013 to alleviate that sense of claustrophobia.\"",
      "Rosemary's training here covers every aspect of going to space - including learning how to use the onboard toilet.",
      "\"The lower part is where you put your solid waste,\" she says, pointing to a loo in a small cubicle that looks like something you might find at a very old campsite. \"And this funnel here is actually attached to an air suction system, and that is where you put your liquid waste.\"",
      "Female astronauts have the option of suppressing their periods using drugs, Rosemary says, but can also opt not to.",
      "\"There's essentially a filter that you put on top of the cone in which you urinate and it's to stop any particles, any blood, from going into the urine system.\"",
      "Urine needs to be kept separate because it's purified and treated to be re-used as drinking water, she explains.",
      "Back in the pool, divers are constantly adjusting Rosemary's buoyancy in the water to make the experience as close as possible to microgravity.",
      "She moves around painstakingly, making sure she's always attached to the submerged structure using two hooks.",
      "Every hand-hold is carefully chosen along the bars on the outside of each module. They're in exactly the same positions as the ones on the real thing, vital muscle memory if she gets to carry out a spacewalk 200 miles (322km) above the Earth.",
      "It's slow and difficult work, requiring plenty of upper body strength and physical effort in the hot, bulky spacesuit.",
      "\"You do a lot of mental preparation \u2013 you really think through every single movement,\" Rosemary explains. \"You have to be really efficient with your energy. You don't want to do something and realise it wasn't quite right and have to do it again.\"",
      "Rosemary is working alongside another astronaut to complete a list of space station repairs and maintenance for the test. Her every move is monitored by a team in a control room overlooking the pool. They're in constant communication with her as she works through her tasks.",
      "Former space station commander Aki Hoshide, from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, is on hand for advice. He has completed four spacewalks and says it's a steep learning curve for new astronauts.",
      "\"When we first start out, there's so much information thrown at you, so many skills that you have to learn and show and demonstrate,\" he says. \"It is baby steps, but they are moving forward \u2013 and I can see their excitement every time they come here and jump in the pool.\"",
      "Rosemary takes us to see a Saturn V \u2013 the rocket that took the Apollo astronauts to the Moon in 1969. More than 50 years on, Nasa is planning an imminent return to the lunar surface with its Artemis programme. European astronauts will join later missions. With an expected 35-year space career ahead, Rosemary may one day get the chance to become the first Briton to walk on the Moon.",
      "\"It's incredibly exciting that we, as humanity, are going back to the Moon, and of course, any way that I could be a part of that, I would be absolutely delighted. I think it's absolutely thrilling,\" she says.",
      "After six gruelling hours underwater, Rosemary is nearing the end of her spacewalk test \u2013 but then she's thrown a curve ball.",
      "In the control room, we hear her call out for a comms check with her astronaut partner who's working on another part of the space station. But she's met with silence.",
      "On a video screen, we can see he's motionless. Rosemary doesn't know it, but he's been asked to pretend to lose consciousness. Rosemary's job is to reach him, check his condition \u2013 and tow him back to the airlock.",
      "After so long under water, we can see how exhausted she is \u2013 but working slowly and steadily, she gets him safely to the airlock.",
      "\"Rosemary has the endurance of a champion. She crushed it today,\" says Jenna Hanson, one of Nasa's spacewalk instructors who's been assessing Rosemary. \"We're really happy with where she's at \u2013 she's doing awesome.\"",

      "Centrica - which owns British Gas - says the site is set to lose \u00a3100m this year, and it wants to invest \u00a32bn in the facility so it can use it to store more gas, including hydrogen.",
      "The government said the future of Rough was a commercial decision for Centrica but it was open to discussing proposals.",
      "The Rough facility is off the coast of East Yorkshire, and accounts for about half of the capacity the UK has to store gas.",

      "Earlier this month, Centrica said it was in \"constructive discussions\" with the government for a support mechanism that would allow investment in the Rough site to proceed.",
      "The company is seeking a \"cap and floor\" pricing mechanism. This means that if energy prices fall below a certain level its revenues will be topped up, but prices would be capped if they rise too high.",
      "\"What we're asking for is simply for the government to help create the conditions which will unlock \u00a32bn of investment,\" Mr O'Shea told the BBC.",

    "story": [
      "Many of the UK's rivers have hit exceptionally low levels and that could worsen in the next three months, according to the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), raising questions over supplies to households, farmers and businesses.",
      "The warning comes after the driest spring in England since 1961, with northern regions experiencing the driest start to the year in nearly a century.",
      "Almost all of the UK is expected to have below normal or low river levels in May, apart from the south-west of England and southern Wales.",
      "The Environment Agency has said that the UK is at medium risk of drought and warned households of the risk of water restrictions.",
      "The next 2-3 weeks will be \"crucial\" in determining whether the country goes into drought, says Mark Owen, head of fisheries for the Angling Trust and a member of the National Drought Group.",
      "That is the committee, led by the government, that declares if and when a drought is officially under way.",
      "The country is not now in drought, but the impacts of the exceptionally dry weather are already being felt.",
      "Some farmers are being forced to water their crops instead of relying on rainfall, which is something that normally happens later in the year.",
      "\"We are having a drought now from an agricultural point of view,\" arable farmer Nick Deane told BBC News from his farm in Norfolk.",
      "He had to start irrigating his fields in March.",
      "\"We have to ration our water and decide which areas we are going to put that water on in order to keep the crops growing,\" he said.",
      "He warned that an extremely long drought would mean farmers struggle to produce food and more produce would need to be imported.",
      "The dry and sunny weather this year has led to a larger area of the UK burned by wildfires this year compared with any other entire year.",
      "The last drought was in June-August 2022, which was the joint hottest summer (with 2018) and fifth driest since the 1890s.",
      "Five companies introduced hosepipe bans, affecting 19 million people, and waterways had restricted navigation.",
      "That drought was preceded by six months of very dry weather.",
      "However, the wet summer in 2024 and moderately-wet winter means water supplies are in a better place now and water companies have larger reserves to rely on.",
      "But dry weather earlier in the year has risks. It does \"potentially pose a greater risk to water resources later on in the year, particularly if the dry weather continues,\" says Stephen Turner, hydrologist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.",
      "Last week, Richard Thompson, chair of the National Drought Group, warned that water companies may need to bring in water restrictions to protect supplies if the dry weather continues.",
      "At the moment the key questions are when will it next rain and when it does, how much will there be.",
      "There are some signs that some rain is on the horizon, with unsettled weather from the west at the end of next week.",
      "Drinking water comes from different places depending on the geography and geology of regions.",
      "Roughly speaking, the south of England takes a long time to get into drought but a long time to leave. That's because a lot of rainfall is stored in rocks underground and takes a long time to reach rivers and water supplies.",
      "By contrast, the north of England quickly enters drought and quickly gets out because reservoirs are more heavily used for water supplies.",
      "Water Companies introduce hosepipe bans when water supplies reach a certain low in their areas.",
      "If drought conditions become severe, the government can restrict irrigation of farms, reduce boats' movement on waterways, and limit water available to non-essential businesses like car washes.",
      "In an extreme scenario, it could ration the amount of water available to homes and businesses but that has not happened since 1976.",
      "Water industry bosses and the National Farmers' Union (NFU) are calling on the government to do more to ensure the driest parts of the UK have secure water supplies in the face of any future drought.",
      "Water UK, which represents the water industry, is calling for a new national water grid of pipes, canals and reservoirs to be set up in England to move water from the wettest regions to where it is most needed.",
      "And farmers say they need more government funding and less planning red tape to build their own reservoirs to supply their farms.",
      "Mr Deane came together with five other farmers, including fruit growers, to build their own reservoir. It took four years and cost more than \u00a31m.",
      "It has proved vital, they say, with 15% of the stored water already used this year in the dry conditions.",
      "But the group said obtaining planning permission was costly and difficult.",
      "A government spokesman said it was working with the agricultural sector to improve its water supply resilience and establish more groups of farmers who could work together to develop their own reservoirs.",
      "He added: \"Over \u00a3104bn of private sector investment has been secured to fund essential infrastructure, including nine new reservoirs, to help secure our future water supply for farmers.\"",
      "Are the dry conditions linked to climate change?",
      "The prolonged dry weather is linked to what are called \"blocking highs\" when a high pressure weather system becomes stuck.",
      "Scientists do not know if this blocked pattern is linked to climate change.",
      "Global warming is expected to cause more extreme weather events globally.",
      "Studies about our future climate suggest more and longer periods of dry weather as well as periods of less rainfall in the UK. Winters are likely to be wetter and warmer.",

      "Government ministers should have been better at planning ahead and making sure other green jobs were available locally, the experts said.",
      "The independent Climate Change Committee (CCC) has set out its latest advice on how Wales reaches net zero - with a push for more electric vehicles, heat pumps and tree planting.",

      "Climate change in Wales in charts",
      "More than 2,000 jobs were lost at Tata's Port Talbot steelworks following the closure of its blast furnaces in 2024.",
      "The move brought an end to traditional steelmaking at the site, as the company grappled with losses of over \u00a31m a day.",
      "It was given a \u00a3500m grant by the UK government and is now investing \u00a31.25bn to build a new electric arc furnace by 2027.",
      "This will recycle scrap metal into new steel products, but requires far fewer workers on site.",
      "The changes will have a dramatic impact on direct emissions of planet-warming gases from Wales.",
      "The blast furnaces were constantly fed with coal, and their closure will have more than halved Wales' industrial emissions since 2022, according to the CCC.",
      "But environmentalists have warned the situation at Port Talbot could damage public support for climate action if it is seen to mean job losses and the demise of heavy industry.",
      "In its report, the CCC said there were \"important lessons to learn\", and that governments in both Westminster and Cardiff Bay should have been better prepared.",
      "\"The challenges facing the UK steel sector have been clear for many years and, given the significance of this site to the local economy, a more proactive and decisive transition plan should have been developed,\" they argued.",
      "The UK government should have taken steps to make industrial electricity prices more competitive, and convened \"early and collaborative\" negotiations between plant owners, workers and the community, the report said.",
      "The Welsh government could have ensured \"the right training and re-skilling programmes were in place well before closure\", it added, and developed a local industrial strategy to support alternative employment in areas like heating services and floating offshore wind.",
      "The committee said Port Talbot's experience should now be used \"to guide future efforts to decarbonise other strategically and locally-significant emissions-intensive industries,\" citing Pembroke's oil refineries as an example.",

      "How can Wales reach net zero?",
      "Like the UK, Wales has set a legally binding net zero target, which means that by 2050 it should no longer be adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.",
      "The CCC provides independent advice on how much can be emitted over five-year periods, known as \"carbon budgets\", and how each UK nation might achieve this.",
      "Each carbon budget is a stepping stone to net zero, with the latest advice covering the period between 2031-35.",
      "The report recommends a 73% reduction in average annual emissions over this period compared to how much Wales pumped into the atmosphere in 1990.",
      "Emissions have decreased by 37% so far and the country met its first carbon budget between 2016-2020 mainly through changes to electricity generation - such as the closure of the last remaining coal-fired power station at Aberthaw in Vale of Glamorgan.",
      "Future cuts will rely more on all of us making choices about how we live.",
      "The CCC has made 16 \"priority\" recommendations for immediate action.",
      "These include supporting people to better insulate their homes and install low-carbon heating systems, drive electric vehicles or opt for public transport.",
      "By 2033 - in just eight years' time - a third of cars and vans on Welsh roads should be electric, the committee said, and nearly a quarter of existing homes need a heat pump or similar technology.",
      "'Fewer sheep and cattle'",
      "The committee also said the Welsh government will need to support farmers and rural communities to \"diversify their income\" away from livestock farming and towards woodland creation and peatland restoration.",
      "In 2022, agriculture was the third-highest emitting sector in Wales, accounting for 16% of Wales' emissions.",
      "Cattle and sheep numbers should fall by 19% by 2033 due to changes in agricultural policy but also a shift in diets with less meat and dairy consumed UK-wide, the report has predicted.",
      "The proportion of woodland cover across Wales will rise from 15% to 17% in 2033 and 26% by 2050, according to the committee's projections.",

    "story": [
      "Rosemary Coogan is surrounded by a team of people pushing, pulling, squishing and squeezing her into a spacesuit.",
      "It takes about 45 minutes to get all her gear on before a helmet is carefully lowered over her head.",
      "The British astronaut is about to undergo her toughest challenge yet \u2013 assessing whether she is ready for a spacewalk. The test will take place in one of the largest pools in the world: Nasa's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.",
      "The pool \u2013 which is 12m deep (40ft) \u2013 contains a life-sized replica of the International Space Station (ISS), and a \"spacewalk\" here is as close as it gets to mimicking weightlessness on Earth.",
      "\"It's a big day,\" Rosemary says before the dive, which is going to last more than six hours. \"It's very physically intense \u2013 and it's very psychologically intense.\"",
      "But Rosemary doesn't seem too fazed. She smiles and waves as the platform she's standing on is slowly lowered into the water.",
      "Being an astronaut was Dr Rosemary Coogan's dream from a young age, she says. But it was a dream that seemed out of reach.",
      "\"At the careers day at school, you don't tend to meet astronauts,\" Rosemary says. \"You don't get to meet people who've done it, you don't really get to hear their stories.\"",
      "So she decided to study the stars instead, opting for a career in astrophysics. But when the European Space Agency (ESA) announced it was looking for new recruits to go to space, Rosemary applied and was chosen from more than 22,000 people.",
      "ESA aims to get Rosemary to the International Space Station (ISS) by 2030. She'll be following in the footsteps of Britons Helen Sharman, who visited the Soviet's Mir Space Station in 1991, and Tim Peake who launched to the ISS in 2015.",
      "Rosemary has spent the last six months training at the Johnson Space Center. As well as exploring the outside of the submerged ISS, she can head inside the orbiting lab in another life-sized mock-up located in a huge hangar.",
      "She takes us on a tour of the lab's interconnected modules. It feels very cramped, especially considering astronauts usually spend many months on board. But Rosemary reminds us about the spectacular views.",
      "\"It is an isolated environment, but I think this helps to give that kind of connection to being outside \u2013 to alleviate that sense of claustrophobia.\"",
      "Rosemary's training here covers every aspect of going to space - including learning how to use the onboard toilet.",
      "\"The lower part is where you put your solid waste,\" she says, pointing to a loo in a small cubicle that looks like something you might find at a very old campsite. \"And this funnel here is actually attached to an air suction system, and that is where you put your liquid waste.\"",
      "Female astronauts have the option of suppressing their periods using drugs, Rosemary says, but can also opt not to.",
      "\"There's essentially a filter that you put on top of the cone in which you urinate and it's to stop any particles, any blood, from going into the urine system.\"",
      "Urine needs to be kept separate because it's purified and treated to be re-used as drinking water, she explains.",
      "Back in the pool, divers are constantly adjusting Rosemary's buoyancy in the water to make the experience as close as possible to microgravity.",
      "She moves around painstakingly, making sure she's always attached to the submerged structure using two hooks.",
      "Every hand-hold is carefully chosen along the bars on the outside of each module. They're in exactly the same positions as the ones on the real thing, vital muscle memory if she gets to carry out a spacewalk 200 miles (322km) above the Earth.",
      "It's slow and difficult work, requiring plenty of upper body strength and physical effort in the hot, bulky spacesuit.",
      "\"You do a lot of mental preparation \u2013 you really think through every single movement,\" Rosemary explains. \"You have to be really efficient with your energy. You don't want to do something and realise it wasn't quite right and have to do it again.\"",
      "Rosemary is working alongside another astronaut to complete a list of space station repairs and maintenance for the test. Her every move is monitored by a team in a control room overlooking the pool. They're in constant communication with her as she works through her tasks.",
      "Former space station commander Aki Hoshide, from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, is on hand for advice. He has completed four spacewalks and says it's a steep learning curve for new astronauts.",
      "\"When we first start out, there's so much information thrown at you, so many skills that you have to learn and show and demonstrate,\" he says. \"It is baby steps, but they are moving forward \u2013 and I can see their excitement every time they come here and jump in the pool.\"",
      "Rosemary takes us to see a Saturn V \u2013 the rocket that took the Apollo astronauts to the Moon in 1969. More than 50 years on, Nasa is planning an imminent return to the lunar surface with its Artemis programme. European astronauts will join later missions. With an expected 35-year space career ahead, Rosemary may one day get the chance to become the first Briton to walk on the Moon.",
      "\"It's incredibly exciting that we, as humanity, are going back to the Moon, and of course, any way that I could be a part of that, I would be absolutely delighted. I think it's absolutely thrilling,\" she says.",
      "After six gruelling hours underwater, Rosemary is nearing the end of her spacewalk test \u2013 but then she's thrown a curve ball.",
      "In the control room, we hear her call out for a comms check with her astronaut partner who's working on another part of the space station. But she's met with silence.",
      "On a video screen, we can see he's motionless. Rosemary doesn't know it, but he's been asked to pretend to lose consciousness. Rosemary's job is to reach him, check his condition \u2013 and tow him back to the airlock.",
      "After so long under water, we can see how exhausted she is \u2013 but working slowly and steadily, she gets him safely to the airlock.",
      "\"Rosemary has the endurance of a champion. She crushed it today,\" says Jenna Hanson, one of Nasa's spacewalk instructors who's been assessing Rosemary. \"We're really happy with where she's at \u2013 she's doing awesome.\"",
      "The spacewalk is finally over. Rosemary's platform is hoisted out of the pool and the support team help her out of her suit. As her helmet is removed, we can see she's clearly very tired, but still smiling.",
      "\"It was a challenging one, it really was, and a challenging rescue,\" she tells us, \"But yeah, it was a really enjoyable day.\"",
      "Rosemary's hard work is bringing her ever closer to her dream of getting to space.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" Rosemary says, \"If I could do that for the real space station - where you can look out and see the stars and see the Earth at the same time - that would just be the cherry on top.\"",

Character.ai itself tells its users: \"This is an AI chatbot and not a real person. Treat everything it says as fiction. What is said should not be relied upon as fact or advice.\"",
      "But in extreme examples chatbots have been accused of giving harmful advice.",
      "Character.ai is currently the subject of legal action from a mother whose 14-year-old son took his own life after reportedly becoming obsessed with one of its AI characters. According to transcripts of their chats in court filings he discussed ending his life with the chatbot. In a final conversation he told the chatbot he was \"coming home\" - and it allegedly encouraged him to do so \"as soon as possible\".",
      "Character.ai has denied the suit's allegations.",
      "And in 2023, the National Eating Disorder Association replaced its live helpline with a chatbot, but later had to suspend it over claims the bot was recommending calorie restriction.",
      "In April 2024 alone, nearly 426,000 mental health referrals were made in England - a rise of 40% in five years. An estimated one million people are also waiting to access mental health services, and private therapy can be prohibitively expensive (costs vary greatly, but the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy reports on average people spend \u00a340 to \u00a350 an hour).",
      "At the same time, AI has revolutionised healthcare in many ways, including helping to screen, diagnose and triage patients. There is a huge spectrum of chatbots, and about 30 local NHS services now use one called Wysa.",
      "Experts express concerns about chatbots around potential biases and limitations, lack of safeguarding and the security of users' information. But some believe that if specialist human help is not easily available, chatbots can be a help. So with NHS mental health waitlists at record highs, are chatbots a possible solution?",
      "An 'inexperienced therapist'",
      "Character.ai and other bots such as Chat GPT are based on \"large language models\" of artificial intelligence. These are trained on vast amounts of data \u2013 whether that's websites, articles, books or blog posts - to predict the next word in a sequence. From here, they predict and generate human-like text and interactions.",
      "The way mental health chatbots are created varies, but they can be trained in practices such as cognitive behavioural therapy, which helps users to explore how to reframe their thoughts and actions. They can also adapt to the end user's preferences and feedback.",
      "Hamed Haddadi, professor of human-centred systems at Imperial College London, likens these chatbots to an \"inexperienced therapist\", and points out that humans with decades of experience will be able to engage and \"read\" their patient based on many things, while bots are forced to go on text alone.",
      "\"They [therapists] look at various other clues from your clothes and your behaviour and your actions and the way you look and your body language and all of that. And it's very difficult to embed these things in chatbots.\"",
      "Another potential problem, says Prof Haddadi, is that chatbots can be trained to keep you engaged, and to be supportive, \"so even if you say harmful content, it will probably cooperate with you\". This is sometimes referred to as a 'Yes Man' issue, in that they are often very agreeable.",
      "And as with other forms of AI, biases can be inherent in the model because they reflect the prejudices of the data they are trained on.",
      "Prof Haddadi points out counsellors and psychologists don't tend to keep transcripts from their patient interactions, so chatbots don't have many \"real-life\" sessions to train from. Therefore, he says they are not likely to have enough training data, and what they do access may have biases built into it which are highly situational.",
      "\"Based on where you get your training data from, your situation will completely change.",
      "\"Even in the restricted geographic area of London, a psychiatrist who is used to dealing with patients in Chelsea might really struggle to open a new office in Peckham dealing with those issues, because he or she just doesn't have enough training data with those users,\" he says.",

      "He tried to take his own life last autumn, and since then he says he has been on a NHS waitlist.",
      "\"My partner and I have been up to the doctor's surgery a few times, to try to get it [talking therapy] quicker. The GP has put in a referral [to see a human counsellor] but I haven't even had a letter off the mental health service where I live.\"",

      "\"As someone with autism, I'm not particularly great with interaction in person. [I find] speaking to a computer is much better.\"",
      "The app allows patients to self-refer for mental health support, and offers tools and coping strategies such as a chat function, breathing exercises and guided meditation while they wait to be seen by a human therapist, and can also be used as a standalone self-help tool.",
      "Wysa stresses that its service is designed for people experiencing low mood, stress or anxiety rather than abuse and severe mental health conditions. It has in-built crisis and escalation pathways whereby users are signposted to helplines or can send for help directly if they show signs of self-harm or suicidal ideation.",

    "story": [
      "Uber has said it is \"ready to go\" now with driverless taxis in the UK - but the government has put back the date it expects to approve fully self-driving vehicles.",
      "The previous administration said fully autonomous cars were \"set to be on roads by 2026\", but the new government says it is now more likely to happen in the second half of 2027.",
      "While limited self-driving technology is already permitted on UK roads, a human driver must be at the wheel and responsible for the vehicle, even if automated technology is being used.",
      "With some companies trialling more advanced tech on British streets, I took an automated car ride across central London in a car using a system developed by UK AI firm Wayve.",
      "\"We're ready to launch robotaxis in the UK as soon as the regulatory environment is ready for us,\" said Andrew Macdonald, senior vice president of mobility at Uber, who joined me for the ride.",
      "The ride-hailing firm is working with 18 automated car tech companies including Wayve.",
      "It is one of several companies which already offers robotaxis in the US.",
      "They are also on the roads in China, the UAE and Singapore.",
      "But Mr Macdonald disagreed that the UK was behind the rest of the world, arguing that the US and China were ahead largely because that is where the majority of the tech had been developed.",
      "\"We are working quickly and will implement self-driving vehicle legislation in the second half of 2027\", the Department for Transport said in a statement.",
      "\"We are also exploring options for short-term trials and pilots to create the right conditions for a thriving self-driving sector,\" it added.",
      "'Hands-off' experience",
      "In the US, Mr Macdonald said robotaxis typically operate for 20 hours per day, seven days per week.",
      "Even though there is no driver to pay, Uber says the fare is currently the same as a ride with a human behind the wheel.",
      "The option to take one appears on the app if one is available, and customers can opt in or out.",
      "That's partly because, aside from the regulatory environment, another potential barrier to their uptake is the public's reticence about travelling in a self-driving vehicle.",
      "A poll by YouGov in 2024 suggested that 37% of Brits would feel \"very unsafe\" travelling in a car without a driver.",
      "But Mr Macdonald insisted new customers' initial nervousness was short-lived and the experience soon \"becomes the new normal\".",
      "That was certainly my experience during our ride.",
      "I was in a Ford Mach-e, fitted with Wayve's autonomous driving sensors and software.",
      "It uses a radar and seven cameras. In the boot there's is a computer which is running the AI-driven software that processes all that sensor data in real time and controls the car's responses.",
      "The automated tech handled every scenario without a hitch, including pedestrians in the road, parked cars, heavy traffic, temporary traffic lights and delivery bikes.",
      "George, our safety driver, did not touch the controls once and a big red button, which shuts off the automated system immediately, was not deployed.",
      "If anything the robo-ride was a far more patient city driver than I am \u2013 and has no voice, making it a lot less chatty.",
      "Whether autonomous vehicles are more or less safe than human-driven ones is still being investigated.",
      "But numerous studies suggest that automated vehicles are less accident-prone than human drivers, based on US data.",
      "But there have been a number of incidents involving robotaxis in the countries where they operate, ranging from road accidents to passengers being locked in.",
      "In January, a man in Arizona, in the US, documented how his robotaxi drove round in circles in an airport carpark, with him trapped in the vehicle, unable to stop the car or get help.",
      "General Motors paused its driverless taxi service Cruise in San Francisco in 2023 because of safety concerns.",
      "\"The reality is that one accident is too many,\" said Uber's Mr Macdonald.",
      "\"That said, with EV (electric vehicles), human drivers\u2026 we operate in the real world and stuff happens.\"",
      "In the UK there are also practical questions around insurance, ownership and liability when a self-driving vehicle is involved in an accident. Mr Macdonald said they were all still being worked out.",
      "Tom Leggett, vehicle technology manager at Thatcham Research - an independent car safety centre - said robotaxis would have to be \"safety-led\" in the UK.",
      "\"Secondly, they will have to make sure the data is available to those who need it \u2013 insurers and those investigating incidents when they occur.\"",
      "The government says self-driving vehicles have the potential \"to build an industry worth \u00a342bn and provide 38,000 jobs by 2035.\"",
      "But of course they are source of concern for people who earn a living driving.",
      "Andy Prendergast, GMB national secretary, said the \"significant social implications\" driverless cars and taxis could have - such as potential less work or unemployment - for workers and the public must be fully considered.",
      "Uber's Mr Macdonald meanwhile believes automated vehicles will transform the way many people travel in the near future.",

    "story": [
      "Among the cactuses in the desert of Arizona, just outside Phoenix, an extraordinary collection of buildings is emerging that will shape the future of the global economy and the world.",
      "The hum of further construction is creating not just a factory for the world's most advanced semiconductors. Eventually, it will mass produce the most advanced chips in the world. This work is being done in the US for the first time, with the Taiwanese company behind it pledging to spend billions more here in a move aimed at heading off the threat of tariffs on imported chips.",
      "It is, in my view, the most important factory in the world, and it's being built by a company you may not have heard of: TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. It makes 90% of the world's advanced semiconductors. Until now they were all made on the island of Taiwan, which is 100 miles east of the Chinese mainland. The Apple chip in your iPhone, the Nvidia chips powering your ChatGPT queries, the chips in your laptop or computer network, all are made by TSMC.",
      "Its Arizona facility \"Fab 21\" is closely guarded. Blank paper or personal devices are not allowed in case designs are leaked. It houses some of the most important intellectual property in the world, and the process to make these chips is one of the most complicated and intensive in global manufacturing.",
      "They're hugely protective of the secrets that lie within. Important customers, such as Apple and Nvidia, trust this company to safeguard their designs for future products.",
      "But after months of asking, TSMC let the BBC in to look at the partial transfer of what some argue is the most critical, expensive, complex and important manufacturing in the world.",
      "The poster child for Trump's policy",
      "President Trump certainly seems to think so. He often mentions the factory in passing. \"TSMC is the biggest there is,\" he has said. \"We gradually lost the chip business, and now it's almost exclusively in Taiwan. They stole it from us.\" This is one of the US president's regular refrains.",
      "TSMC's recent decision to expand its investments in the US by a further $100bn (\u00a375bn) is something Trump attributes to his threats of tariffs on Taiwan and on the global semiconductor business.",
      "The expansion of the Arizona facility, which was announced in March is, he believes, the poster child for his economic policies - in particular the encouragement of foreign companies to relocate factories to the US to avoid hefty tariffs.",
      "China is also watching developments carefully. Taiwan's chip-making prowess has been part of what its government has called its \"Silicon Shield\", against a much-feared invasion. While the original strategy was to make Taiwan indispensable in this area of critical technology, the pandemic supply chain difficulties changed the calculus because relying on a single country seemed like a greater risk.",
      "China claims the self-ruled Taiwan as its territory but Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland.",
      "So, many currents of the world economy, frontier technology and geopolitics flow through this one site and within it lies the essential contradiction of Trump's economic and diplomatic policy.",
      "He sees this plant as the exemplar of America First, and the preservation of economic and military superiority over China. Yet the manufacture of these modern miniaturised miracles at the frontier of physics and chemistry inherently relies on a combination of the very best technologies from around the world.",
      "The cleanest environment on Earth",
      "Greg Jackson, one of the facilities managers, takes me around in a golf buggy. The factories are almost a carbon copy of the TSMC spaces in Taiwan, where he trained. \"I would say these facilities are probably some of the most advanced and complicated in the world,\" he says.",
      "\"It's quite the dichotomy. You've got really, really small chips with really small structures, and it takes this massive facility with all the infrastructure to be able to make them... Just the sheer complexity, the amount of systems that it takes, is staggering.\"",
      "Inside the \"Gowning Building\", workers dress in protective clothing before crossing a bridge that is supposed to create the cleanest environment on Earth, in order to protect the production of these extraordinary microscopic transistors that create the microchips underpinning everything.",
      "Konstantinos Ninios, an engineer, shows me some of the very first productions from TSMC Arizona: a silicon wafer with what is known as \"4 nanometre chips\".",
      "\"This is the most advanced wafer in the US right now,\" he explains. \"[It] contains about 10 to 14 trillion transistors... The whole process is 3,000 to 4,000 steps.\"",
      "If you could somehow shrink your body to the same scale and get inside the wafer, he says that the many different layers would look like very tall streets and skyscrapers.",
      "Manufacturing manipulation of atoms",
      "TSMC was founded at the behest of the Taiwanese government in 1987, when chip executive Morris Chang was directed to start the business. The model was to become a dedicated foundry for microchips, manufacturing other companies' designs. It became wildly successful.",
      "Driving the advancement of the technology is the miniaturisation of the smallest feature on chips. Their size is measured these days in billionths of a metre or nanometres. This progress has enabled mobile phones to become smartphones, and is now setting the pace for the mass deployment of artificial intelligence.",
      "It requires incredible complexity and expense through the use of \"extreme ultraviolet (UV) light\". This is used to etch the intricate building blocks of our modern existence in a process called \"lithography\".",
      "Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy",

      "Gold is booming - but investors lured in by the hype could lose out, warn experts",
      "The world's dependence on TSMC is built on highly specialised bus-sized machines, which are in turn sourced almost entirely from a Dutch company called ASML, including in Arizona.",
      "These machines shoot UV light tens of thousands of times through drops of molten tin, which creates a plasma, and is then refracted through a series of specialised mirrors.",
      "The almost entirely automated process for each wafer of silicon is repeated thousands of times in layers over months, before the $1m LP-sized wafer of 4nm silicon chips is formed.",
      "\"Just imagine a particle or a dust particle falling into this,\" Mr Ninios says to me incredulously. \"The transistors are not going to work. So all of this is cleaner than hospital operating rooms.\"",
      "Caution in Taiwan",
      "Taiwan does not have special access to the raw materials - but it has the know-how to stay years ahead of other companies in the intricate process of producing these atomic building blocks of modern life.",
      "Some in the Taiwanese government are cautious about spreading the frontier of this technology off the island. Trump wasted little time in claiming the firm's decision to bring its highest level of technology to the US was due to his economic policies.",
      "He said this would not have happened without the stick of his planned tariffs on Taiwan and semiconductors. Those I speak to at TSMC are diplomatic about that claim.",
      "Much of this was already planned and subsidised under former US President Biden's Chips Act.",
      "On the walkway into the building are photographs showing Biden's visit in 2022, with the building site draped in the Stars and Stripes and a banner saying \"a future Made in America\".",
      "\"The semiconductor supply chain is global,\" says TSMC Arizona President Rose Castanares. \"There's really no single country at this moment that can do everything from chemicals to wafer manufacturing to packaging, and so it's very difficult to unwind that whole thing very quickly.\"",
      "'Non-Red' supply chains to counter China",
      "As for the semiconductor supply chain, tariffs will not help. The supply chain stretches all over the world. Whether it's the silicon wafers from Japan, the machines required from the Netherlands, or mirrors from Germany, all sorts of materials from all around the world are required. Now, they could face import charges.",
      "That said, TSMC's boss was quick off the mark in confirming the expansion of the US site at an event with Trump at the White House. In recent weeks, America's tech elite - from Apple's Tim Cook, to Nvidia's Jensen Huang - have been queueing up to tell the world that TSMC Arizona will now produce many of the chips in their US products.",
      "The global chip industry is very sensitive to the economic cycle, but its cutting-edge technology enjoys very healthy margins, that could cushion some of these planned tariffs.",
      "There are many geopolitical subtexts here. The factory sits at the heart of US strategy to gain technological, AI and economic supremacy over China.",
      "Both the Biden and Trump administrations have developed policies to try and limit Chinese access to the frontier semiconductor technology - from a ban on exports to China of ASML's machines, to new legislation to ban the use of Huawei AI chips in US software or technology anywhere in the world.",
      "Taiwan's President Lai this week urged democracies such as Japan and the US to develop \"non-Red\" supply chains to counter China.",
      "Not everyone is convinced that this strategy is working, however. Chinese technologists have been effective at working around the bans to develop competitive indigenous technology. And Bill Gates this week said that these policies \"have forced the Chinese in terms of chip manufacturing and everything to go full speed ahead\".",
      "Trump wants TSMC Arizona to become a foundation stone for his American golden age. But the company's story to date is perhaps the ultimate expression of the success of modern globalisation.",
      "So for now, it's a battle for global tech and economic supremacy, in which Taiwan's factory technology, some of which is now being moved to the Arizona desert, is the critical asset.",

      "The BBC has been investigating how the attack on Redcar and Cleveland unfolded, what it took to get things back to normal and the impact on local people.",
      "In the days before Saturday 8 February 2020, an email with a seemingly innocuous attachment arrived in a council inbox. Hidden inside was a piece of malicious software that would lie dormant in the council's network until it was activated remotely.",
      "Within a few hours of that activation it had spread throughout the computer system, locking staff out and scrambling files.",
      "By 11:00 GMT on Saturday, local residents began to notice the council website was offline.",
      "\"There wasn't a lot we could do,\" Mrs Lanigan said about efforts to stop the virus.",
      "\"You had to be practical, so it was actually getting more phones in there so that people could ring us.\"",
      "News was spreading, but Mrs Lanigan, who lost her position in the 2023 local elections, claims she received pressure from council officials and central government not to speak out.",
      "The council declined to be interviewed about the attack but said there had been no pressure or instruction not to speak publicly, either at the time or since.",
      "What Mrs Lanigan did not say in 2020, but admits now, was the council was dealing with a crisis.",
      "\"It was devastating,\" she said. \"Devastating for us, for the staff, for the public and for everybody else.\"",
      "They had lost the ability to share information with police and the NHS, while social services and elderly care services were knocked out, she said.",

      "\"When we saw how much damage had been caused we realised it would probably take weeks, maybe years to do,\" said IT worker Ben Saunders.",
      "At the same time, experts at the NCSC - part of GCHQ - were considering the council's plea for help.",
      "Mr Martin, who was the NCSC's chief executive at the time, said it was \"unusually serious\".",
      "\"If a council are telling you they are worried about their ability to run services for vulnerable children, you take that very seriously.\"",
      "It was feared social workers, tasked with keeping young people safe, would struggle to do their jobs without access to the online records they relied on to help inform difficult decisions.",
      "In what Mr Martin called an \"unusual\" step, NCSC officers were deployed to Redcar.",
      "On Tuesday 11 February \u2013 the second working day after the attack - hackers made their ransom demand.",
      "The exact figure has never been made public, but Mr Martin said that, based on similar attacks, it was likely to have been in the \"low single figure millions of US dollars\".",
      "The current government is considering a ban on the public sector paying ransoms to hackers but, while it is the guidance, there was no formal ban in place in 2020.",
      "Regardless, Mrs Lanigan was in no mind to cough up. \"I'm a Yorkshire woman and the thing being about that is there was no way I was paying any ransom to anybody.\"",
      "The following day, Wednesday 12 February, the government held a Cobra meeting, designed to co-ordinate the response to major emergencies.",
      "\"That's when you realised just how serious it was,\" the former council leader said. \"It wasn't just some hacker sat in a bedroom having a play with computers.\"",
      "While the system was being rebuilt, the council turned the clocks back and returned to using paper and pen. Many functions ground to a halt or were dramatically slowed down.",
      "Redcar husband and wife Paul and Clare were \"very reliant on the council\" at the time.",
      "Clare needed support from care workers and specialist equipment to help with a debilitating condition called functional neurological disorder.",
      "\"You'd be waiting on the phone for hours,\" Paul said. \"When people were coming it was handwritten notes, so the systems weren't getting updated. It was a real nightmare.\"",
      "The couple waited many months before they got the support they needed. In the meantime, Paul had quit his job to care for his wife.",
      "All the while staff continued to work on getting the council back online and within a few weeks a temporary system for social services had been restored.",
      "By May 2020 the council said it was still only back to 90%, with the system taking 10 months to be fully restored.",
      "\"Some of it was able to be recovered; a lot of it was needed to be built from scratch,\" said Mr Saunders. \"It was a very meticulous, very long process.\"",
      "Yet it took several years before evidence emerged suggesting who was behind the cyber-attack.",
      "In February 2022, one of the world's most prolific ransomware gangs, the Russia-based Conti Group, fell apart.",
      "After Russia invaded its neighbour, pro-Ukrainian hackers leaked the group's private messages and data, revealing details of some of the most dangerous cyber-criminals.",
      "A year later, in February 2023, a group of Russian hackers were sanctioned by UK and US government over a string of attacks on businesses, schools and councils, including Redcar and Cleveland.",
      "Earlier that year, Mrs Lanigan gave evidence in Parliament about the attack. She said the response had cost \u00a311.3m and they had received \u00a33.68m compensation from the government.",
      "As the authority was not insured for the attack, the difference had to be taken from its limited reserves.",
      "A council spokesman said that while it had general insurance cover, it still did not have a specific policy which covered a cyber-attack.",
      "They said a recent inspection by external auditors found that at the time the council had had proper arrangements and controls in place to reduce the likelihood of a cyber-security breach.",
      "But it is far from the only council to face such an attack. According to the Information Commissioner's Office, there were 202 ransomware attacks on local authorities in 2024.",
      "The government said it was \"taking action to protect local councils by providing funding to increase their cyber defences\".",
      "But Mr Martin fears the attack on the council, and other public services, could have \"shown hostile nation states how to disrupt our society\".",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly34p1jwvgo",
    "published": "Sun, 18 May 2025 23:39:17 GMT",
    "summary": "The US-China trade \"reset\" could stall the manufacturing investment coming into India, say experts.",
    "story": [
      "Just as India showed flickers of progress toward its long-held dream of becoming the world's factory, Washington and Beijing announced a trade \"reset\" that could derail Delhi's ambitions to replace China as the global manufacturing hub.",
      "Last week, Trump's tariffs on China dropped overnight - from 145% to 30%, vs 27% for India - as the two sides thrashed out an agreement in Switzerland.",
      "As a result, there's a chance manufacturing investment that was moving from China to India could either \"stall\" or \"head back\", feels Ajay Srivastava of the Delhi-based think tank, Global Trade Research Institute (GTRI).",
      "\"India's low-cost assembly lines may survive, but value-added growth is in danger.\"",
      "The change in sentiment stands in sharp relief to the exuberance in Delhi last month when Apple indicated that it was shifting most of its production of iPhones headed to the US from China to India.",
      "That may well still happen, even though US President Donald Trump revealed that he had told Apple CEO Tim Cook not to build in India because it was \"one of the highest tariff nations in the world\".",
      "\"India is well positioned to be an alternative to China as a supplier of goods to the US in the immediate term,\" Shilan Shah, an economist with Capital Economics, wrote in an investor note before the deal was announced. He pointed out that 40% of India's exports to the US were \"similar to those exported by China\".",
      "There were early signs that Indian exporters were already stepping in to fill the gap left by Chinese producers. New export orders surged to a 14-year high, according to a recent survey of Indian manufacturers.",
      "Nomura, a Japanese broking house, also pointed to growing \"anecdotal evidence\" of India emerging as a winner from \"trade diversion and supply-chain shift in low and mid-tech manufacturing\" particularly in sectors like electronics, textiles and toys.",
      "Some analysts do believe that despite the so-called trade \"reset\" between Beijing and Washington, a larger strategic decoupling between China and the US will continue to benefit India in the long run.",
      "For one, there's greater willingness by Narendra Modi's government to open its doors to foreign companies after years of protectionist policies, which could provide tailwind.",
      "India and the US are also negotiating a trade deal that could put Asia's third-largest economy in a sweet spot to benefit from the so-called \"China exodus\" - as global firms shift operations to diversify supply chains.",
      "India has just signed a trade pact with the UK, sharply cutting duties in protected sectors like whiskey and automobiles. It offers a glimpse of the concessions Delhi might offer Trump in the ongoing India-US trade talks.",
      "But all of this optimism needs to be tempered for more reasons than one.",
      "Apart from the fact that China is now back in the running, companies are also \"not entirely writing off other Asian competitors, with countries like Vietnam still on their radars\", economists Sonal Verma and Aurodeep Nandi from Nomura said in a note earlier this month.",
      "\"Hence, for India to capitalise on this opportunity, it needs to complement any tariff arbitrage with serious ease-of-doing-business reforms.\"",
      "A tough business climate has long frustrated foreign investors and stalled India's manufacturing growth, with its share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) stuck at around 15% for two decades.",
      "The Modi government's efforts, such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, have delivered only limited success in boosting this figure.",
      "The government's think tank, Niti Aayog, has acknowledged India's \"limited success\" in attracting investment shifting from China. It noted that factors like cheaper labour, simpler tax laws, lower tariffs, and proactive Free Trade Agreements helped countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Malaysia expand exports - while India lagged behind.",
      "Another major concern, says Nomura, is India's ongoing reliance on China for raw materials and components used in electronics like iPhones, limiting Delhi's ability to fully capitalise on supply chain shifts.",
      "\"India's earnings from making iPhones will only rise if more of the phone is made locally,\" Mr Srivastava told the BBC.",
      "According to him, right now Apple earns over $450 per iPhone sold in the US while India keeps less than $25 - even though the full $1,000 is counted as an Indian export.",
      "\"Just assembling more iPhones in India won't help much unless Apple and its suppliers also start making components and doing high-value work here. Without that, India's share stays small, and the export numbers go up only on paper -possibly triggering more scrutiny from the US without real economic gain for India,\" Mr Srivastava said.",
      "The jobs created by such assembly lines aren't very high quality either, says GTRI.",
      "Quite unlike companies like Nokia which set up a factory in the southern city of Chennai in 2007 where suppliers moved in together, \"today's smartphone makers mostly import parts and push for lower tariffs instead of building supply chains in India\", explained Mr Srivastava. He noted that, in certain instances, the investment made could be lower than the subsidies received under India's PLI scheme.",
      "Finally there are concerns that Chinese exporters could try to use India to reroute products to the US.",
      "India doesn't seem averse to this idea despite the pitfalls. The country's top economic adviser said last year that the country should attract more Chinese businesses to set-up export oriented factories and boost its manufacturing industry \u2013 a tacit admission that its own industrial policy hadn't delivered.",
      "But experts caution, this could further curtail India's ability to build local know-how and grow its own industrial base.",
      "All of this shows that beyond the headline-grabbing announcements by the likes of Apple, India is still a long way from realising its factory ambitions.",
      "\"Slash production costs, fix logistics, and build regulatory certainty,\" Mr Srivastava urged policymakers in a social media post.",
      "\"Let's be clear. This US-China reset is damage control, not a long-term solution. India must play the long game, or risk getting side-lined.\"",

      "Almost daily, my phone pings with messages from hackers of all stripes.",
      "The good, the bad, the not-so-sure.",
      "I've been reporting on cyber security for more than a decade, so I know that many of them like to talk about their hacks, findings and escapades.",
      "About 99% of these conversations stay firmly locked in my chat logs and don't lead to news stories. But a recent ping was impossible to ignore.",
      "\"Hey. This is Joe Tidy from the BBC reporting on this Co-op news, correct?\" the hackers messaged me on Telegram.",
      "\"We have some news for you,\" they teased.",
      "When I cautiously asked what this was, the people behind the Telegram account - which had no name or profile picture - gave me the inside track on what they claimed to have done to M&S and the Co-op, in cyber attacks that caused mass disruption.",
      "Through messages back-and-forth over the next five hours, it became clear to me that these apparent hackers were fluent English speakers and although they claimed to be messengers, it was obvious they were closely linked to - if not intimately involved in - the M&S and Co-op hacks.",
      "They shared evidence proving that they had stolen a huge amount of private customer and employee information.",
      "I checked out a sample of the data they had given me - and then securely deleted it.",
      "Messages that confirmed suspicions",
      "They were clearly frustrated that Co-op wasn't giving in to their ransom demands but wouldn't say how much money in Bitcoin they were demanding of the retailer in exchange for the promise that they wouldn't sell or give away the stolen data.",
      "After a conversation with the BBC's Editorial Policy team, we decided that it was in the public interest to report that they had provided us with evidence proving that they were responsible for the hack.",
      "I quickly contacted the press team at the Co-op for comment, and within minutes the firm, who had initially downplayed the hack, admitted to employees, customers and the stock market about the significant data breach.",
      "Much later, the hackers sent me a long angry and offensive letter about Co-op's response to their hack and subsequent extortion, which revealed that the retailer narrowly dodged a more severe hack by intervening in the chaotic minutes after its computer systems were infiltrated. The letter and conversation with the hackers confirmed what experts in the cyber security world had been saying since this wave of attacks on retailers began \u2013 the hackers were from a cyber crime service called DragonForce.",
      "Who are DragonForce, you might be asking? Based on our conversations with the hackers and wider knowledge, we have some clues.",
      "DragonForce offers cyber criminal affiliates various services on their darknet site in exchange for a 20% cut of any ransoms collected. Anyone can sign up and use their malicious software to scramble a victim's data or use their darknet website for their public extortion.",
      "This has become the norm in organised cyber crime; it's known as ransomware-as-a-service.",
      "The most infamous of recent times has been a service called LockBit, but this is all but defunct now partly because it was cracked by the police last year.",
      "Following the dismantling of such groups, a power vacuum has emerged. Cue a tussle for dominance in this underground world, leading to some rival groups innovating their offerings.",
      "Power struggle ensues",
      "DragonForce recently rebranded itself as a cartel offering even more options to hackers including 24/7 customer support, for example.",
      "The group had been advertising its wider offering since at least early 2024 and has been actively targeting organisations since 2023, according to cyber experts like Hannah Baumgaertner, Head of Research at Silobreaker, a cyber risk protection company.",
      "\"DragonForce's latest model includes features such as administration and client panels, encryption and ransomware negotiation tools, and more,\" Ms Baumgaertner said.",
      "As a stark illustration of the power-struggle, DragonForce's darknet website was recently hacked and defaced by a rival gang called RansomHub, before re-emerging about a week ago.",
      "\"Behind the scenes of the ransomware ecosystem there seems to be some jostling - that might be for prime 'leader' position or just to disrupt other groups in order to take more of the victim share,\" said Aiden Sinnott, senior threat researcher from the cyber security company Sophos.",
      "Who is pulling the strings?",
      "DragonForce's prolific modus operandi is to post about its victims, as it has done 168 times since December 2024 - a London accountancy firm, an Illinois steel maker, an Egyptian investment firm are all included. Yet so far, DragonForce has remained silent about the retail attacks.",
      "Normally radio silence about attacks indicates that a victim organisation has paid the hackers to keep quiet. As neither DragonForce, Co-op nor M&S have commented on this point, we don't know what might be happening behind the scenes.",
      "Establishing who the people are behind DragonForce is tricky, and it's not known where they are located. When I asked their Telegram account about this, I didn't get an answer. Although the hackers didn't tell me explicitly that they were behind the recent hacks on M&S and Harrods, they confirmed a report in Bloomberg that spelt it out.",
      "Of course, they are criminals and could be lying.",
      "Some researchers say DragonForce are based in Malaysia, while others say Russia, where many of these groups are thought to be located.  We do know that DragonForce has no specific targets or agenda other than making money.",
      "And if DragonForce is just the service for other criminals to use \u2013 who is pulling the strings and choosing to attack UK retailers?",
      "In the early stages of the M&S hack, unknown sources told cyber news site Bleeping Computer that evidence is pointing to a loose collective of cyber criminals known as Scattered Spider - but this has yet to be confirmed by the police.",
      "Scattered Spider is not really a group in the normal sense of the word. It's more of a community which organises across sites like Discord, Telegram and forums \u2013 hence the description \"scattered\" which was given to them by cyber security researchers at CrowdStrike.",
      "They are known to be English-speaking and probably in the UK and the US and young \u2013 in some cases teenagers. We know this from researchers and previous arrests. In November the US charged five men and boys in their twenties and teens for alleged Scattered Spider activity. One of them is 22-year-old Scottish man Tyler Buchanan, who has not made a plea, and the rest are US based.",
      "Crackdowns by police seem to have had little effect on the hackers' determination, though. On Thursday, Google's cyber security division issued warnings that it was starting to see Scattered Spider-like attacks on US retailers now too.",
      "As for the hackers I spoke to on Telegram, they declined to answer whether or not they were Scattered Spider. \"We won't answer that question\" is all they said.",
      "Perhaps in a nod to the immaturity and attention-seeking nature of the hackers, two of them said they wanted to be known as \"Raymond Reddington\" and \"Dembe Zuma\" after characters from US crime thriller The Blacklist which involves a wanted criminal helping police take down other criminals on a blacklist.",
      "In a message to me, they boasted: \"We're putting UK retailers on the Blacklist.\"",

      "For outdoor workers, even a 20-minute break from the heat and humidity, such as in well-designed cooling stations, can make a difference.",
      "But beyond this, active cooling will become increasingly critical as temperatures continue to rise due to climate change.",
      "Morgan Stanley is predicting that the annual growth rate of the cooling market, already worth $235bn (\u00a3180bn) a year, could more than double by 2030.",
      "Yet existing cooling devices have serious drawbacks. One issue the refrigerant - the fluid that transitions back and forth from liquid to gas, in a process that transfers heat.",
      "It's common for them to leak from standard systems, harming both efficiency and potentially health.",
      "The refrigerants typically used in cooling today are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), a group of synthetic gases with high global warming potential. HFCs are much more potent than carbon dioxide.",
      "So one option is to replace the refrigerants with more climate-friendly versions. But the candidates with the lower global warming potential, also have problems.",

      "RMI has identified between 10 and 20 start-ups working on early versions of solid-state cooling devices.",
      "One of those startups is the German company Magnotherm, which uses magnets. Certain materials change temperature when exposed to magnetic fields.",
      "\"With our technology, it's inherently safe because it's not toxic, it's a metal, and we operate at very low pressures,\" according to Timur Sirman, the CEO and cofounder of Magnotherm.",

      "The permanent magnets are the most expensive part of the technology, Mr Sirman reports. \"But it never breaks, so we can always reuse this quite cost-intensive component.\"",
      "The company is seeking out alternative sources of magnetic fields, as well as optimising materials, as they aim to dramatically increase the cooling capacity of their devices.",
      "Mr Sirman believes that if you account for the efficiency and health issues of refrigerants, like leakages, Magnotherm products can compete on price. \"We are not targeting customers who are only looking at initial cost.\"",
      "He acknowledges that for now the company's beverage coolers are quite pricey. Their customers tend to be early adopters of new technologies.",
      "Another technology under development is thermoelectric cooling.",
      "This involves moving heat between two sides of a device. With the application of electrical energy, heat is transferred in the direction of the current.",
      "A notable thermoelectric start-up is Phononic, which is based in the US and has an additional manufacturing facility in Thailand.",
      "Millions of Phononic cooling devices are now in use, including in data centres, supermarkets and other buildings.",
      "Their cooling devices are built in a similar way to computer chips, using semiconducting materials to transfer the heat.",
      "\"Our chips are really thin, really small, but they get really cold. They consume a small amount of electricity in generating that coldness, but they pack one hell of a punch,\" says Tony Atti, the CEO of Phononic.",
      "He says that, to work at their best, traditional fridges need to be run all the time.",
      "But  thermoelectric devices can be easily switched on off. This helps to reduce the costs, energy use and space requirements.",
      "\"We like to present the coolness on demand where you need it,\" says Mr Atti.",
      "Another advantage is that thermoelectric cooling can operate silently. \"That's because there's zero moving parts,\" Ms Rasmussen explains. \"The heat is occurring because of the reaction in the material level.\"",
      "In contrast, standard vapour compression systems contain pumps, condensers and expanders for refrigerant, which all generate much of the noise.",
      "A different type of solid-state cooling is elastocaloric cooling. This achieves temperature changes through mechanical stress to elastocaloric materials, which can cool down or heat up with the application of stress.",
      "Researchers in four European countries are collaborating on SMACool, an elastocaloric air conditioner that uses metal tubes made from specific metallic alloys.",
      "At the moment, elastocaloric prototypes have much lower cooling capacity than commercial air conditioning. And the maximum possible efficiency of SMACool is still lower than that of conventional air conditioning, although the aim is to beat the energy efficiency of A/C.",
      "However, progress is continuing. A team led by Hong Kong researchers recently created an A/C alternative that achieved a cooling power of 1,284W\u2014the first time an elastocaloric device surpassed the 1,000W mark. One innovation was using graphene nanofluid rather than distilled water to transfer the heat.",
      "Overall, Ms Rasmussen says, solid-state devices are generally not yet as powerful as conventional vapour-compression air conditioning. But she expects performance improvements over time.",
      "She also expects improvements in affordability. So far solid-state cooling has mainly been deployed in wealthy countries.",
      "A key question, Ms Rasmussen says, is \"Can these technologies scale up to where they could be affordable for those who need it the most and where the greatest demand for cooling is coming from?\"",

    "summary": "Whole TV shows shot in one long take are made possible by new lightweight cameras.",
    "story": [
      "Three strong knocks from the police battering ram and the front door bursts open. There's a lot of shouting.",
      "We follow heavily-armed officers as they stream into the house, a woman drops to the floor as the camera turns left, and we head up a small, dimly lit staircase, passing a man with his back against the wall, hands raised, yelling to no avail.",
      "Within moments, a 13-year-old boy has been arrested and we're back outside in the morning light. The family screams on the front lawn as the camera returns to the boy, now a detainee in the dark interior of a police van.",
      "All this happens in three minutes. In one take. It is an early scene in Netflix's hit show Adolescence, which was watched by more than 120 million people worldwide in its first month.",
      "It wouldn't have been possible to film a sequence quite like this five years ago, the show's cinematographer Matthew Lewis claimed in a recent interview. Each of the four, roughly one hour-long episodes of Adolescence was shot entirely in one take, known as a \"oner\", with the camera frequently following characters through frantic scenes, or switching from handheld to vehicle-mounted filming.",
      "Lightweight, self-stabilising cameras that can adjust to dramatic changes in environmental lighting have sparked a small revolution in the film and TV industry.",
      "At the end of Adolescence's second episode, for instance, the camera moves from filming inside a car to crossing a road, to flying over nearby streets, and then to ground level again.",
      "You can just about detect the switch from drone to human operator \u2013 there's a minuscule wobble \u2013 but unless you're looking for them, these transitions are effectively seamless.",
      "It was made possible in part by a DJI Ronin 4D, a small, high-resolution camera that has multiple built-in sensors for detecting movement in relation to the floor and nearby objects.",
      "This allows internal mechanisms to compensate for that movement and achieve smooth, stable footage.",
      "The result is \"phenomenal\", says seasoned filmmaker and Boston University professor Tim Palmer.",
      "He initially doubted that episodes of Adolescence really were shot in a single take. \"As soon as I saw it I knew, no, that was absolutely done in one take.\"",
      "Camera technology has developed significantly lately, he adds.",
      "In 2014, Prof Palmer worked on a hospital drama called Critical, which required lengthy shots in busy hospital corridors. \"It was just little joystick video game controllers to make the camera pan and tilt, and that was just not precise enough,\" he recalls.",
      "Makers of such TV programmes have long tried to capture the energy of hospital environments. One episode of 1990s BBC series Cardiac Arrest opens in a hectic triaging unit. As far as I can tell, there is only one cut in the first 10 minutes \u2013 but the camera moves rather robotically back and forth. It is nowhere near as dynamic as Adolescence.",
      "Prof Palmer adds that gimbals, stabilising devices for cameras, have been around for years now, but methods of controlling them and pulling footage remotely have only recently become highly sophisticated.",
      "He also mentions how some of the latest cameras have built-in filters that can be controlled remotely, or stabilisation technology that can be activated or deactivated at the press of a button. \"That's a complete game-changer,\" he says.",
      "Long single takes are far from a new concept in cinema. There are examples dating back decades.",
      "Take the 2015 film Victoria, a hair-raising, two-hour and 20 minute feature film that its makers say was shot in a single take. Some have expressed scepticism about this in the past, but cinematographer Sturla Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen tells the BBC emphatically, \"There are no edits or cuts.\"",
      "While Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen had to rely on the technology of the time, he says that the slightly shaky images were intentional \u2013 the director wanted a film that reminded viewers of footage shot by news crews in warzones.",
      "\"It feels very much in the moment, but also like you never know what's going to happen,\" says Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen, \"You're taken on a journey.\"",
      "He used a Canon C300, a small motion picture camera well-suited to documentary filmmaking. Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen reduced the weight of the camera as much as possible by only adding essential accessories. He also practised the movements he planned to make during takes of the final film in order to achieve \"muscle memory\" of the process.",
      "\"When they suddenly start running I have to shift my grip on the camera from holding it on the side handle to the top handle \u2013 that way it shakes a little bit less,\" he explains.",
      "The Ronin 4D is DJI's \"first dedicated cinema camera\", says Brett Halladay, product education manager at the firm.",
      "He describes the extensive stabilisation technology and the fact that the device transmits footage wirelessly to on-set monitors. It automatically selects a frequency based on the best available signal.",
      "There are some limitations, though. The camera is not set up for vertical filming \u2013 increasingly in-demand with the rise of video-sharing smartphone apps such as TikTok.",
      "Mr Halladay points out that it is possible to shoot in landscape and crop to a portrait, or vertical, image, though that might not be the most \"ideal\" solution, he acknowledges.",
      "Other cameras are available. Canon, for instance, touts its line of lightweight Cinema EOS models.",
      "Barry Griffin, a manager at Canon, says these cameras are finding a market among filmmakers aiming to shoot with increased freedom, or who want to put cameras in tiny podcast studios and livestream high-quality shots of hosts and their guests.",
      "The rise of highly ergonomic cameras could have a big impact on the quality of film and TV, says Booker T Mattison, a screenwriter and director who teaches filmmaking at the University of Georgia. \"Point of view is often represented by the camera itself,\" he says. \"It absolutely, 100% allows you to tell better, more dynamic stories.\"",
      "There's a risk that obsessing over one-take TV shows could become a gimmick at the expense of good storytelling, says Carey Duffy, director of product experiences at Cooke Optics.",
      "Lightweight Cooke lenses were used by the makers of Adolescence. Mr Duffy explains that his firm designed these lenses to work with emerging, lightweight cameras and that this was possible in part because of the shorter distance between the back of the lens and the image sensor in those cameras, versus earlier devices.",
      "But fascination over \"oners\" won't be enough to retain audiences, says Prof Palmer: \"Personally, it's not going to make me want to watch something because it's shot it one take \u2013 I want to watch these things because they're good.\"",

      "He also denied that the US was stepping back from its negotiating role.",
      "In recent weeks, Trump has repeatedly warned that the US would step away from negotiations as he became increasingly frustrated at the lack of developments from both Moscow and Kyiv in the way of peace.",
      "When asked on what he believes on Russia, he said he thinks Putin has had enough of the war and wants it to end.",
      "Meanwhile, Putin - who described the call with Trump, which he took from a music school on a visit to the city of Sochi, as \"frank, informative and constructive\" - also spoke of the potential for a ceasefire.",
      "\"We have agreed with the US president that Russia will offer and is ready to work with Ukraine on a memorandum on a possible future peace agreement,\" he said.",
      "This, he added would define \"a number of positions\" including \"principles of the settlement and a timeline for concluding a possible peace agreement...including a possible ceasefire for a certain period of time, should relevant agreements be reached\".",
      "Yury Ushakov, an aide to the Russian president, said a ceasefire timeframe was not \"discussed... although Trump, of course, emphasises his interest in reaching one or another agreement as soon as possible\".",
      "Zelensky held a second call with Trump after the US president spoke to Putin, which also included President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, and the leaders of  France, Italy, Germany and Finland.",

      "But for Romania things looked very different this morning.",
      "A vote for change",
      "Nicusor Dan has been mayor of Bucharest since 2020 but until now he was little known beyond the capital. That's why his election is widely seen as an act of protest against the old political guard who have governed Romania for over three decades.",
      "But it was also the least extreme option for change.",
      "Dan's opponent in the second-round vote was George Simion, a hard-right nationalist and Eurosceptic who regularly dishes out public insults.",
      "He's also banned from two neighbouring countries because he claims part of Ukraine and all of Moldova belong to Romania.",
      "Simion won the first round with 41% of the vote but Dan caught up in the second, and then took over.",
      "\"This time, fear managed to defeat fury,\" is how political analyst Radu Magdin explains the shift, and points to a significant increase in turnout.",

      "\"I would say there were many people who did not really appreciate that.\"",
      "Defiance of Russia",

      "At the election street celebrations last night, as well as yelling the new president's name and cheering, people chanted their defiance: \"Russia, don't forget! Romania is not yours!\"",
      "They were referring to evidence Russia interfered in their election back in November to boost the chances of far-right conspiracy theorist, Calin Georgescu.",
      "When he came from nowhere to win the first round, the vote was annulled.",
      "This weekend was a re-run, with Georgescu banned and Simion in his place. The two were often seen side-by-side, even on voting day.",
      "But Georgescu's open sympathy for Russia \u2013 he once told me he admired Vladimir Putin \u2013 was a turn-off for many voters.",
      "European choice",

      "His voters liked what he stood for, including a future firmly within Europe.",

    "story": [
      "Hidden beneath the slopes of a lush forest in Alberta, Canada, is a mass grave on a monumental scale.",
      "Thousands of dinosaurs were buried here, killed in an instant on a day of utter devastation.",
      "Now, a group of palaeontologists have come to Pipestone Creek - appropriately nicknamed the \"River of Death\" - to help solve a 72-million-year-old enigma: how did they die?",
      "Trying to work out exactly what happened here starts with the hefty strike of a sledgehammer.",
      "Brute force is needed to crack open the thick layer of rock that covers what Professor Emily Bamforth, who's leading the dig, describes as \"palaeo gold\".",
      "As her team begins the more delicate job of removing the layers of dirt and dust, a jumble of fossilised bones slowly begins to emerge.",
      "\"That big blob of bone right there is, we think, part of a hip,\" Prof Bamforth says, watched on by her dog Aster - whose job today is to bark if she spots any nearby bears.",
      "\"Then here, we have all of these long, skinny bones. These are all ribs. And this is a neat one - it's part of a toe bone. This one here, we have no idea what it is - it's a great example of a Pipestone Creek mystery.\"",
      "BBC News has come to Pipestone Creek to witness the sheer scale of this prehistoric graveyard and see how researchers are piecing together the clues.",
      "Thousands of fossils have been collected from the site, and are constantly generating new discoveries.",
      "The bones all belong to a dinosaur called Pachyrhinosaurus. The species, and Prof Bamforth's excavation, feature in a new landmark BBC series - Walking With Dinosaurs - which uses visual effects and science to bring this prehistoric world to life.",
      "These animals, which lived during the Late Cretaceous period, were a relative of the Triceratops. Measuring about five metres long and weighing two tonnes, the four-legged beasts had large heads, adorned with a distinctive bony frill and three horns. Their defining feature was a big bump on the nose called a boss.",
      "The dig season has just started and lasts each year until autumn. The fossils in the small patch of ground that the team are working on are incredibly tightly packed; Prof Bamforth estimates there are up to 300 bones in every square metre.",
      "So far, her team has excavated an area the size of a tennis court, but the bed of bones extends for a kilometre into the hillside.",
      "\"It's jaw dropping in terms of its density,\" she tells us.",
      "\"It is, we believe, one of the largest bone beds in North America.",
      "\"More than half of the known dinosaur species in the world are described from a single specimen. We have thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus here.\"",
      "Palaeontologists believe the dinosaurs were migrating together in a colossal herd for hundreds of miles from the south - where they had spent the winter - to the north for the summer.",
      "The area, which had a much warmer climate than it does today, would have been covered in rich vegetation, providing abundant food for this enormous group of plant-eating animals.",
      "\"It is a single community of a single species of animal from a snapshot in time, and it's a huge sample size. That almost never happens in the fossil record,\" says Prof Bamforth.",
      "Bigger beasts offering clues",
      "And this patch of north-western Alberta wasn't just home to Pachyrhinosaurus. Even bigger dinosaurs roamed this land, and studying them is essential to try and understand this ancient ecosystem.",
      "Two hours drive away, we reach the Deadfall Hills. Getting there involves a hike through dense forest, wading - or doggy-paddling in the case of Aster - across a fast-running river, and clambering over slippery rocks.",
      "No digging is required here; super-sized bones lie next to the shoreline, washed out from the rock and cleaned by the flowing water, just waiting to be picked up.",
      "A huge vertebra is quickly spotted, as are bits of ribs and teeth scattered across the mud.",
      "Palaeontologist Jackson Sweder is particularly interested in what looks like a chunk of dinosaur skull. \"Most of what we find here is a duck-billed dinosaur called Edmontosaurus. If this is a skull bone, this is a dinosaur that's large - probably 30ft (10m) long,\" he says.",
      "The Edmontosaurus, another herbivore, roamed the forests like the Pachyrhinosaurus - and is helping palaeontologists build up a picture of this ancient land.",
      "Sweder is the collection manager at the Philip J Currie Dinosaur Museum in nearby Grande Prairie, where the bones from both of these giants are taken to be cleaned up and analysed. He is currently working on a huge Pachyrhinosaurus skull that's about 1.5m long and has been nicknamed \"Big Sam\".",
      "He points to where the three horns should be at the top of the frill, but the one in the middle is missing. \"All\u00a0the skulls that are decently complete have a spike in that spot,\" he says. \"But\u00a0its nice little unicorn spike doesn't seem to be there.\"",
      "Throughout years working at the extraordinary site, the museum team has collected 8,000 dinosaur bones, and the surfaces of the lab are covered in fossils; there are bones from Pachyrhinosaurus of every size, from young to old.",
      "Having material from so many animals allows researchers to learn about dinosaur biology, answering questions about how the species grows and the make-up of the community. They can also look at individual variations, to see how one Pachyrhinosaurus could stand out from the herd \u2013 as may be the case with Big Sam and his missing spike.",
      "A sudden devastating event",
      "All of this detailed research, in the museum and at the two sites, is helping the team to answer the vital question: how did so many animals in Pipestone Creek die at the same time?",
      "\"We believe that this was a herd on a seasonal migration that got tangled up in some catastrophic event that effectively wiped out, if not the entire herd, then a good proportion of it,\" Prof Bamforth says.",
      "All the evidence suggests that this catastrophic event was a flash flood - perhaps a storm over the mountains that sent an unstoppable torrent of water towards the herd, ripping trees from their roots and shifting boulders.",
      "Prof Bamforth says the Pachyrhinosaurus wouldn't have stood a chance. \"These animals are not able to move very fast because of their sheer numbers, and they're very top heavy - and really not very good at swimming at all.\"",
      "Rocks found at the site show the swirls of sediment from the fast-flowing water churning everything up. It's as if the destruction is frozen in time as a wave in the stone.",
      "But this nightmare day for the dinosaurs is now a dream for palaeontologists.",
      "\"We know, every time we come here, it's 100% guaranteed we'll find bones. And every year we discover something new about the species,\" says Prof Bamforth.",
      "\"That's why we keep coming back, because we're still finding new things.\"",
      "As the team packs up their tools ready to return another day, they know there's a lot of work ahead. They've only just scratched the surface of what's here - and there are many more prehistoric secrets just waiting to be revealed.",

      "Mining researcher and activist Makhotla Sefuli backs this up.",
      "He says criminal gangs specifically target children to work in illegal mines across South Africa.",
      "Many of them are abducted from neighbouring countries and trafficked. They are enticed by baseless promises of finding them employment in the formal mining industry.",
      "\"Their passports are confiscated when they get to South Africa\u2026 It is common knowledge that these young boys are being abused,\" Mr Sefuli says.",
      "The BBC has spoken to miners who worked in at least two other illegal mines who told us they saw children being abused in the shafts where they were working.",
      "Tshepo, not his real name, says he saw older men forcing young boys to have sex with them underground.",
      "\"In some instances, they did it for the money. Some are recruited solely for that purpose, because of the financial incentives that will come with the practice of maybe trading sex underground.\"",

      "They launched an operation called Vala Umgodi, or seal the hole, in December 2023, promising to take a tough stance on the gangs.",
      "As part of the operation, the police limited the amount of food and water that went down the Stilfontein mine to, as one minister put it, \"smoke out\" the illegal miners. Officials said the men were refusing to come out for fear of being arrested.",
      "Soon footage began to emerge from within the mine showing dozens of emaciated men begging to be rescued, as well as rows of body bags. Eventually a court ordered the authorities to save the men.",
      "Among those brought up were many who said they were underage, but as a number of them were migrants without documents confirming how old they were, the authorities carried out medical tests to get an estimate.",

      "\"Children don't understand when you say: 'I'll pay you 20 rands ($1; \u00a30.80) per day.' The adults sometimes refuse to work, but children find themselves with no choice. So it's easier to use a child to do the work. It's easier to take a child who's kind of voiceless and to bring them down there.\"",
      "Beyond being exploited financially, she says there are gangs that recruit children specifically for sex.",

I hadn't slept or eaten or had water for 48 hours and then I was forced to sign a big stack of documents,\" said Radalj of his introduction to imprisonment in China, which began with his arrest on 2 January, 2020.",
      "The former Beijing resident claims he was wrongfully convicted after a fight with shopkeepers at an electronics market, following a dispute over the agreed price to fix a mobile phone screen.",
      "He claims he ended up signing a false confession to robbery, after being told it would be pointless to try to defend his innocence in a system with an almost 100% criminal conviction rate and in the hope that this would reduce the time of his incarceration.",
      "Court documents indicate that this worked at least to some extent, earning him a four-year sentence.",
      "Once in prison, he said he first had to spend many months in a separate detention centre where he was subjected to a more brutal \"transition phase\".",
      "During this time prisoners must follow extremely harsh rules in what he described as horrific conditions.",
      "\"We were banned from showering or cleaning ourselves, sometimes for months at a time. Even the toilet could be used only at specific allotted times, and they were filthy - waste from the toilets above would constantly drip down on to us.\"",
      "Eventually he was admitted to the \"normal\" prison where inmates had to bunk together in crowded cells and where the lights were never turned off.",
      "You also ate in the same room, he said.",
      "According to Radalj, African and Pakistani prisoners made up the largest groups in the facility, but there were also men being held from Afghanistan, Britain, the US, Latin America, North Korea and Taiwan. Most of them had been convicted for acting as drug mules.",
      "The 'good behaviour' points system",
      "Radalj said that prisoners were regularly subjected to forms of what he described as psychological torture.",
      "One of these was the \"good behaviour points system\" which was a way \u2013 at least in theory \u2013 to reduce your sentence.",
      "Prisoners could obtain a maximum of 100 good behaviour points per month for doing things like studying Communist Party literature, working in the prison factory or snitching on other prisoners. Once 4,200 points were accumulated, they could in theory be used to reduce prison time.",
      "If you do the maths, that would mean a prisoner would have to get maximum points every single month for three-and-half years before this could start to work.",
      "Radalj said that in reality it was used as a means of psychological torture and manipulation.",
      "He claims the guards would deliberately wait till an inmate had almost reached this goal and then penalise them on any one of a huge list of possible infractions which would cancel out points at the crucial time.",
      "These infractions included - but were not limited to - hoarding or sharing food with other prisoners, walking \"incorrectly\" in the hallway by straying from a line painted on the ground, hanging socks on a bed incorrectly, or even standing too close to the window.",
      "Other prisoners who spoke about the points system to the BBC described it as a mind game designed to crush spirits.",
      "Former British prisoner Peter Humphrey, who spent two years in detention in Shanghai, said his facility had a similar points calculation and reduction system which was manipulated to control prisoners and block sentence reductions.",
      "\"There were cameras everywhere, even three to a cell,\" he said. \"If you crossed a line marked on the ground and were caught by a guard or on camera, you would be punished. The same if you didn't make your bed properly to military standard or didn't place your toothbrush in the right place in the cell.",
      "\"There was also group pressure on prisoners with entire cell groups punished if one prisoner did any of these things.\"",
      "One ex-inmate told the BBC that in his five years in prison, he never once saw the points actually used to mitigate a sentence.",
      "Radalj said that there were a number of prisoners - including himself - who didn't bother with the points system.",
      "So authorities resorted to other means of applying psychological pressure.",
      "These included cutting time off monthly family phone calls or the reduction of other perceived benefits.",
      "Food As Control",
      "But the most common daily punishment involved the reduction of food.",
      "The BBC has been told by numerous former inmates that the meals at Beijing's No 2 prison were mostly made up of cabbage in dirty water which sometimes also had bits of carrot and, if they were lucky, small slivers of meat.",
      "They were also given mantou - a plain northern Chinese bread. Most of the prisoners were malnourished, Radalj added.",
      "Another prisoner described how inmates ate a lot of mantou, as they were always hungry. He said that their diets were so low in nutrition \u2013 and they could only exercise outside for half an hour each week \u2013 that they developed flimsy upper bodies but retained bloated looking stomachs from consuming so much of the mantou.",
      "Prisoners were given the opportunity to supplement their diet by buying meagre extra rations, if money from relatives had been put into what were called their \"accounts\": essentially a prison record of funds delivered to purchase provisions like soap or toothpaste.",
      "They could also use this to purchase items like instant noodles or soy milk powder. But even this \"privilege\" could be taken away.",
      "Radalj said he was blocked from making any extra purchases for 14 months because he refused to work in the prison factory, where inmates were expected to assemble basic goods for companies or compile propaganda leaflets for the ruling Communist Party.",
      "To make things worse, they were made to work on a \"farm\", where they did manage to grow a lot of vegetables, but were never allowed to eat them.",
      "Radalj said the farm was displayed to a visiting justice minister as an example of how impressive prison life was.",
      "But, he said, it was all for show.",
      "\"We would be growing tomatoes, potatoes, cabbages and okra and then \u2013 at the end of the season \u2013 they would push it all into a big hole and bury it,\" he added.",
      "\"And if you were caught with a chilli or a cucumber in general population you would go straight to solitary confinement for eight months.\"",
      "Another prisoner said they would occasionally suddenly receive protein, like a chicken leg, to make their diet look better when officials visited the prison.",
      "Humphrey said there were similar food restrictions in his Shanghai prison, adding that this led to power struggles among the inmates: \"The kitchen was run by prison labour. Those who worked there stole the best stuff and it could then be distributed.\"",
      "Radalj described a battle between African and Taiwanese groups in Beijing's Prison No 2 over this issue.",
      "The Nigerian inmates were working in the kitchen and \"were getting small benefits, like a bag of apples once a month or some yogurt or a couple of bananas\", he said.",
      "Then the Mandarin-speaking Taiwanese inmates were able to convince the guards to let them take over, giving them control of precious extra food items.",
      "This led to a large brawl, and Radalj said he was caught in the middle of it. He was sent to solitary confinement for 194 days after hitting another prisoner.",
      "Inside solitary, he finally had the lights turned off only to realise he'd be with very little light nearly all of the time, giving him the opposite sensory problem.",
      "His small food ration was also cut in half. There were no reading materials and there was nobody to talk to while he was held in a bare room of 1.2 by 1.8 metres (4ft by 6ft) for half a year.",
      "\"You start to go crazy, whether you like it or not, and that's what solitary is designed to do\u2026 So you've got to decide very quickly whether your room is really, really small, or really, really big.",
      "\"After four months, you just start talking to yourself all the time. The guards would come by and ask 'Hey, are you okay?'. And you're like, 'why?'. They replied, 'because you're laughing'.\"",
      "Then, Radalj said, he would respond, in his own mind: \"It's none of your business.\"",
      "'I've had 100 operations and will never stop' - inside China's cosmetic surgery boom",
      "Aboard the 'silver trains', China's retirees do their bit to offset Trump's tariffs",
      "The small-town mayor accused of trafficking and spying for China",
      "Another feature of Chinese prison life, according to Radalji, was the fake \"propaganda\" moments officials would stage for Chinese media or visiting officials to paint a rosy picture of conditions there.",
      "He said, at one point, a \"computer suite\" was set up. \"They got everyone together and told us that we'd get our own email address and that we would be able to send emails. They then filmed three Nigerian guys using these computers.\"",
      "The three prisoners apparently looked confused because the computers were not actually connected to the internet - but the guards had told them to just \"pretend\".",
      "\"Everything was filmed to present a fake image of prisoners with access to computers,\" Radalj said.",
      "But, he claims, soon after the photo opportunity, the computers were wrapped up in plastic and never touched again.",
      "The memoirs",
      "Throughout much of the ordeal, Radalj had been secretly keeping a journal by peeling open Covid masks and writing tiny sentences inside, with the help of some North Korean prisoners, who have also since been released.",
      "\"I would be writing, and the Koreans would say: 'No smaller\u2026 smaller!'.\"",
      "Radalj said many of the prisoners had no way of letting their families know they were in jail.",
      "Some had not made phone calls to their relatives because no money had been placed in their accounts for phone calls. For others, their embassies had not registered family telephone numbers for the prison phone system. Only calls to officially approved numbers worked.",
      "So, after word got round that the Australian was planning to try to smuggle his notes out, they passed on details to connect with their families.",
      "\"I had 60 or 70 people hoping I could contact their loved ones after I got out to tell them what was happening.\"",
      "He wrapped the pieces of Covid mask as tight as he could with sticky tape hoarded from the factory and tried to swallow the egg-sized bundle without the guards seeing.",
      "But he couldn't keep it down.",
      "The guards saw what was happening on camera and started asking, \"Why are you vomiting? Why do you keep gagging? What's wrong?\"",
      "So, he gave up and hid the bundle instead.",
      "When he was about to leave on 5 October 2024, he was given his old clothes which had been ripped five years earlier in the struggle over his initial arrest.",
      "There was a tear in the lining of his jacket and he quickly dropped the notes inside before a guard could see him.",
      "Radalj said he thinks someone told the prison officers of his plan because they searched his room and questioned him before he left.",
      "\"Did you forget something?\" the guards asked.",
      "\"They trashed all my belongings. I was thinking they're gonna take me back to solitary confinement. There will be new charges.\"",
      "But the guard holding his clothes never knew the secret journal had been slipped inside.",
      "\"They were like, 'Get out of here!'. And it wasn't until I was on the plane, and we had already left, and the seat belt sign was switched off, that I reached into my jacket to check.\"",
      "The notes were still there.",
      "Life After Prison",
      "Just before he had boarded the plane in Beijing a policeman who had escorted him to the gate had used Radalj's boarding pass to buy duty free cigarettes for his mates.",
      "\"He said don't come back to China. You're banned for 10 years. And I said 'yeah cool. Don't smoke. It's bad for your health'\".",
      "The officer laughed.",
      "He arrived back in Australia and hugged his father at Perth airport. The tears were flowing.",
      "Then he got married to his long-time girlfriend and now they spend their days making candles and other products.",
      "Radalj says he is still angry about his experience and has a long way to go to recover properly.",
      "But he is making his way through the contact list of his former inmate friends \u2013 \"I have spent the best part of six months contacting their families, lobbying their embassies so they might try to do a better job of helping them during their incarceration.\"",
      "Some of them, he said, haven't spoken to people back home for nearly a decade. And helping them has also helped with the transition back to his old life.",
      "\"With freedom comes a great sense of gratitude,\" Radalj says. \"You have a deeper appreciation for the very simplest things in life. But I also have a great sense of responsibility to the people I left behind in prison.\""

    "published": "Sun, 18 May 2025 00:08:56 GMT",
    "summary": "The BBC visits families in Kashmir devastated by the deadliest clashes in years, and speaks to military insiders.",
    "story": [
      "Sixteen-year-old Nimra stood outside, rooted to the spot, as the Indian missiles that had woken her a moment ago rained down on the mosque a few metres from her house in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. She watched one tear the minaret off the top of the building. But she failed to realise she, too, had been struck - in the chest.",
      "When the family reached the relative safety of her aunt's house nearby, someone turned on a phone torch. \"My aunt gasped. There was blood on my frock. It was pink and white but now soaked in red. I hadn't seen it before.\" Again they ran. \"I was running but my hand was pressed on my chest the whole time. I didn't want to take it off. I thought if I let go, everything inside me would come out.\" A piece of shrapnel was lodged near her heart, she later discovered.",
      "A few hours later, in Poonch, Indian-administered Kashmir, a different family was dodging shelling which Pakistan had launched in response to India's missile strikes.",
      "\"When the firing began, everyone ran for their lives - children clinging to their parents in fear,\" said MN Sudhan, 72. \"Some families managed to leave for Jammu in their vehicles. We also decided to escape. But barely 10 minutes into our journey, a shell landed near our vehicle. The shrapnel tore through the car. My grandson died on the spot.\"",
      "\"Our future was shattered at that [very] moment,\" Mr Sudhan said of 13-year-old Vihaan's death. \"Now we're left with nothing but grief. I have witnessed two wars between India and Pakistan, but never in my life have I seen shelling as intense as this.\"",
      "Nimra and Vihaan were among many of the villagers caught up in the deadliest attacks for several years in a decades-long conflict between two of the world's nuclear powers - India and Pakistan. Both sides administer the Himalayan region in part but claim it in full. Both governments deny targeting civilians, but BBC journalists in the region have spoken to families caught up in the violence.",
      "The strike that injured Nimra was part of India's armed response after a militant attack killed 26 people - mostly Indian tourists - last month at a beauty spot in India-administered Kashmir. Police there claimed militants included at least two Pakistan nationals. Pakistan has asked India for evidence of this, and has called for an independent inquiry into who was behind the attack.",
      "What followed was four days of tit-for-tat shelling and drone attacks, intensifying each day and culminating in missile strikes on military bases, which threatened to tip over into full-blown conflict. Then, suddenly, a ceasefire brokered by the US and other international players on 10 May brought the two nuclear powers back from the brink.",
      "Families on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border in Kashmir - told us they had had loved ones killed and property destroyed. At least 16 people are reported to have been killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling. We also heard from Indian and Pakistani government insiders about the mood in their respective administrations as the conflict escalated.",
      "In Delhi's corridors of power, the atmosphere was initially jubilant, an Indian government source told the BBC. Its missile attacks on targets in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and in Pakistan itself - including the Bilal Mosque in Muzaff arabad, which India claims is a militant camp, though Pakistan denies this - were deemed a success.",
      "\"The strikes\u2026 were not limited to Pakistani-administered Kashmir or along the Line of Control,\" an Indian government source told the BBC. \"We went deep - even into the Pakistani side of Punjab, which has always been Pakistan's red line.\"",
      "But the Pakistani military had been prepared, a source from the Pakistan Air Force told the BBC. Days earlier, the Pakistani government said it was expecting an attack.",
      "\"We knew something was coming, and we were absolutely ready,\" one officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said Indian fighter jets approached Pakistani territory and the air force was under instructions to shoot down any that crossed into its airspace or dropped a payload.",
      "Pakistan claims to have shot down five Indian jets that night, something India has remained silent on.",
      "\"We were well prepared, and honestly, we were also lucky,\" the source said - his account repeated by two other sources.",
      "But Mr Sudhan, Vihaan's grandfather, said there had been no warning to stay indoors or evacuate. \"Why didn't they inform us? We, the people, are caught in the middle.\"",
      "It is likely that no evacuation orders had been issued because the Indian government needed to keep the military strikes confidential, though the local administration had, following the April militant attack, directed locals to clean out community bunkers as a precautionary measure.",
      "A day after the initial missile strikes, Thursday, both sides launched drone attacks, though they each accused the other of making the first move.",
      "India began to evacuate thousands of villagers along the Indian side of the LoC. Just after 21:00 that evening, the Khan family in India-administered Kashmir decided they must flee their home in Uri, 270km (168 miles) to the north of Poonch. Most of their neighbours had already left.",
      "But after travelling for just 10 minutes, their vehicle was struck by shrapnel from a shell, fatally injuring 47-year-old Nargis. Her sister-in-law Hafeeza was seriously injured. They headed to the nearest hospital, only to find the gates locked.",
      "\"I somehow climbed the hospital wall and called out for help, telling them we had injured people with us. Only then did the staff come out and open the gate. As soon as they did, I collapsed. The doctors were terrified by the ongoing shelling and had closed everything out of fear,\" Hafeeza said.",
      "Hafeeza's sister-in-law Nargis is survived by six children. The youngest daughter Sanam, 20, said the first hospital they went to was not equipped to help, and as they headed to another, her mother died of her injuries.",
      "\"A piece of shrapnel had torn through her face. My clothes were soaked in her blood\u2026 We kept talking to her, urging her to stay with us. But she passed away on the way.\"",
      "Since a ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan in 2021 there had been relative peace in the region, locals told the BBC. For the first time in years, they had been able to live normal lives, they said, and now this sense of security was destroyed.",
      "Sanam, who lost her mother, said: \"I appeal to both governments - if you're heading into war, at least secure your civilians. Prepare... Those who sit in comfort and demand war - they should be sent to the borders. Let them witness what it really means. Let them lose someone before their eyes.\"",
      "Sajjad Shafi, the representative for Uri in the regional government, said he had acted as promptly as possible.",
      "\"The moment I got the news that India has attacked, I got in touch with people and started moving them out.\"",
      "After two days of attacks and counter attacks, the Indian government source said there was now a \"clear sense in\u2026 power corridors that things were escalating but we were ready.",
      "\"We were ready because India had spent the last 10 years acquiring and building strategic military assets - missiles, warheads and defence systems.\"",
      "On the international stage, there had been consternation that the tensions would not be de-escalated by the US, despite its diplomatic overtures during India and Pakistan's previous Kashmir clashes.",
      "US Vice President JD Vance said a potential war would be \"none of our business\".",
      "This statement came as no surprise, the Indian government source told the BBC. At that stage, \"it was clear the US didn't want to get involved\".",
      "By the following day, Friday, shelling had become more intense.",
      "Muhammed Shafi was at home with his wife in Shahkot village in the Neelum Valley, Pakistan-administered Kashmir, on the LoC.",
      "The 30-year-old was standing in the doorway, just a few steps away from where his son was playing; his wife standing in their courtyard.",
      "\"I remember looking up and seeing a mortar shell coming from a distance. In the blink of an eye, it struck her. She didn't even have time to scream. One second she was there, and the next, she was gone. Her face... her head... there was nothing left. Just a cloud of smoke and dust. My ears went numb. Everything went silent. I didn't even realise I was screaming.",
      "\"That night, her body lay there, right in our home. The entire village was hiding in bunkers. The shelling continued all night, and I stayed beside her, weeping. I held her hand for as long as I could.\"",
      "One of those in a bunker was his niece, 18-year-old Umaima. She and her family were holed up in the shelter for four days, on and off, in brutal conditions.",
      "\"There were six or seven of us packed into it,\" she said. \"The other bunker was already full. There's no place to lie down in there - some people stood, others sat. There was no drinking water, no food,\" with people shouting, crying and reciting prayers in the pitch black.",
      "Also in a bunker, in the Leepa Valley, Pakistan-Administered Kashmir - one of the most militarised and vulnerable valleys in the region - was Shams Ur Rehman and family. It is Shams's own bunker, but that night he shared it with 36 other people, he said.",
      "Leepa is surrounded on three sides by the LoC and Indian-administered territory, so Shams was used to living with cross-border tensions. But he was not prepared for the complete destruction of his house.",
      "He left the bunker at three in the morning to survey the scene.",
      "\"Everything was gone. Wooden beams and debris from the house were scattered everywhere. The blast was so powerful, the shockwave pushed in the main wall. The metal sheets on the roof were shredded. The entire structure shifted - by at least two inches.",
      "\"A house is a person's life's work. You're always trying to improve it - but in the end, it's all gone in seconds.\"",
      "Four hours later, back in the Neelum Valley, Umaima and her family also emerged on Saturday 10 May to a transformed landscape.",
      "\"We came out of the bunker at seven in the morning. That's when we saw - nothing was left.\"",
      "As Umaima surveyed the ruins of her village, India and Pakistan's forces that day were trading ever more destructive blows - firing missiles at each other's military installations, which both sides accused the other of instigating.",
      "India had targeted three Pakistani air bases, including one in Rawalpindi - the garrison city that houses the Pakistan Army's General Headquarters.",
      "\"This was a red line crossed,\" said one Pakistani officer. \"The prime minister gave the go-ahead to the army chief. We already had a plan, and our forces were desperately ready to execute it\u2026 For anyone in uniform, it was one of those unforgettable days.\"",
      "Pakistan hit back at Indian military installations. On the diplomatic front, this was seen as a moment to highlight the issue of Kashmir on the international stage, an official in the Pakistan foreign office told the BBC.",
      "\"It was non-stop. Endless meetings, coordination, and back-to-back calls to and from other countries for both foreign minister and then the prime minister. We welcomed mediation offers from the US, the Saudis, the Iranians, or anyone who could help de-escalate.\"",
      "On the Indian side, the Pahalgam attack on 22 April had already prompted External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to speak to at least 17 world leaders or diplomats, including UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. In most of these conversations, he has tweeted, the emphasis had been on the \"cross-border terrorist attack\" and focused on building a case to hold the perpetrators accountable for the attack.",
      "Then, on Saturday afternoon local time, in the aftermath of the latest missile exchanges, came a diplomatic breakthrough out of nowhere. US President Donald Trump took to social media to reveal that a ceasefire had been agreed.",
      "\"After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE.",
      "\"Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,\" he wrote on social media platform Truth Social.",
      "India has since downplayed Washington's role in the ceasefire and it has rejected that trade was used as a lever to achieve this.",
      "Behind the scenes, US mediators, diplomatic backchannels and regional players, including the US, the UK and Saudi Arabia, had proved critical in negotiating the climbdown, experts say.",
      "\"We hit Pakistani strategic bases deep inside their territory and that must have worried the US,\" the Indian government source believes.",
      "In Pahalgam, the site of the militant gun attack that sparked the crisis, the search is still on for the perpetrators.",
      "Vinay Narwal, a 26-year-old Indian Navy officer, was on his honeymoon in Pahalgam when he was killed. He had got married just a week before the attack.",
      "A photo of Vinay's wife Himanshi, sitting near her husband's body following the attack, has been widely shared on social media.",
      "His grandfather Hawa Singh Narwal wants \"exemplary punishment\" for the killers.",
      "\"This terrorism should end. Today, I lost my grandson. Tomorrow, someone else will lose their loved one,\" he said.",
      "A witness to the attack's aftermath, Rayees Ahmad Bhat, who used to lead pony treks to the beauty spot where the shootings took place, said his industry was now in ruins.",
      "\"The attackers may have killed tourists that day, but we - the people of Pahalgam - are dying every day since. They've stained the name of this peaceful town\u2026 Pahalgam is terrorised, and its people broken.\"",
      "The attack was a huge shock for a government which had begun to actively promote tourism in stunningly picturesque Kashmir, famed for its lush valleys, lakes and snow-capped mountains.",
      "The source in the Indian administration said this might have lulled Delhi into a false sense of security.",
      "\"Perhaps we got carried away by the response to tourism in Kashmir. We thought we were over a hump but we were not.\"",

      "The Canadian actor reprises his role as CIA director Eugene Kittridge in \"Mission: Impossible \u2014 The Final Reckoning,\" a character he calls morally ambiguous by design.",
      "\"If you were in their shoes, you'd kind of go, 'Yeah, exactly. Well, actually, you know what? He's got a point,'\" Czerny said. \"I don't like him because he reminds me of parts of me that I don't particularly like. But maybe he's got a point.\"",
      "Czerny first portrayed Kittridge as the former head of the Impossible Mission Force in the original 1996 film, often serving as an antagonist to Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt. After a 25-year absence from the franchise, he returned for the last two installments.",

      "\"You read it, you imagine what this person has gone through, you dig into everything that you have that might relate to something that they've done in their life,\" Czerny explained about his preparation process. \"You put all the other stuff away, and somebody calls action and you get the hell out of the way and see what happens.\"",

      "Hayley Atwell says working in 40 degrees below zero temperatures in the Arctic was just part of the job for\u00a0\"Mission: Impossible \u2014 The Final Reckoning,\" but nothing prepared her for the moment a polar bear wandered onto the set.",
      "\"We were so far north that the Northern Lights were below us,\" Atwell said.",
      "The set being interrupted by the presence of a polar bear remains one of her strongest memories from five years working on the franchise.",
      "The British actress, who plays Grace in the latest installment hitting theaters Friday, underwent extensive training to work with sled dogs on the frozen sea. The extreme conditions were real, no green screen effects.",
      "\"We had to train to know what it was like, how to survive, how to work out there,\" she said.",
      "Atwell's character represents a departure from typical action film roles for women. Rather than serving as a romantic interest, Grace develops what Atwell calls a \"nuanced intimacy\" with Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt.",
      "\"The woman is not just the object of desire or not led with a romantic agenda,\" Atwell said, \"There's intellectual stimulation between them, common cause that brings them together, something that feels sibling-like, maternal.\"",
      "Working alongside Cruise for five years has given Atwell insight into the actor's off-camera persona. The two have become close, he even took her grandmother on a helicopter ride at sunset on Christmas Eve.",
      "\"For a man who is an aerobatic pilot, seeing him be so gentle and kind and patient with her and explaining how everything worked, that to me was like just a mark of a really decent guy,\" she said.",
      "To prepare for her role as a thief, Atwell practiced sleight-of-hand techniques, even successfully stealing items from Cruise during filming, including salt and pepper shakers, a watch, a necklace and gym socks.",
      "\"I've never been a thief before. So I needed to practice,\" she said.",
      "Atwell describes \"The Final Reckoning\" as \"the culmination of all the movies that's gone before\" that \"ties up plot points and characters that people have been watching for the last 30 years.\" The film received a five-minute standing ovation at its debut in France.",
      "Despite the film's title suggesting the end, Atwell remained coy about whether this truly ends the franchise.",

    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering trial continues Monday in New York City. His ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura\u00a0wrapped up her testimony Friday after four days on the stand.",
      "The hip-hop mogul is accused of running a criminal enterprise since at least 2004 that manipulated women into participating in commercial sex acts with him, and sometimes male sex workers, during what prosecutors described as drug-fueled parties called \"freak offs.\"",
      "Combs has been jailed at the Metropolitan Detention Center Brooklyn since his arrest last September. He\u00a0faces five counts from four different women, including Ventura.",
      "So far, jurors heard from a former security manager at the Los Angeles hotel where Combs was seen on a now infamous video attacking Ventura in 2016, along with a man who says he was hired to have sex with Ventura while Combs watched, and Ventura herself.",
      "On Friday, they also heard from a special agent who photographed the hotel where Combs was arrested last year, and from Danity Kane singer Dawn Richard, who testified about seeing Combs assault Ventura.",
      "Here's what to know about the charges and key names in the case.",
      "Who is Cassie Ventura? Hotel video a key piece of evidence",
      "Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, rose to fame with the single \"Me & U\" on her self-titled debut album. The song landed the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart in 2006.",
      "In her testimony, she said she signed with Bad Boy Records when she was 19, and Combs first kissed her on her 21st birthday. She and Combs dated off-and-on for more than 10 years, from about 2007 to 2018.",
      "She said she recorded hundreds of songs as part of a 10-album deal, but most were never released. She testified Combs became controlling and violent, and the \"freak offs\" became her job.",
      "Ventura spoke about years of alleged psychological and physical abuse. She also said Wednesday that he raped her after they had broken up in 2018.",
      "\"This week has been extremely challenging, but also remarkably empowering and healing for me,\" Ventura said in a statement after her testimony. \"I hope that my testimony has given strength and a voice to other survivors, and can help others who have suffered to speak up and also heal from abuse and fear.\"",
      "The security video of Combs attacking Ventura in the hallway of the InterContinental hotel is a key piece of evidence in his trial. The video,\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0by CNN last year, shows Combs throw her onto the floor before kicking and dragging her.",
      "Prosecutors allege the hotel assault happened during a \"freak off,\" but Combs' lawyers, who\u00a0sought to have the video excluded from trial, argue it was a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship.\"",
      "Ventura filed a federal lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of rape and physical abuse. The suit also said Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the footage.",
      "\"After years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships,\" Ventura said in a statement to CBS News at the time. \"With the expiration of New York's Adult Survivors Act fast approaching, it became clear that this was an opportunity to speak up about the trauma I have experienced and that I will be recovering from for the rest of my life.\"",
      "Combs later apologized for the behavior seen on the video, but denied the allegations in the lawsuit. In a social media post that has since been removed, he said he was \"f---ed up\" and \"hit rock bottom.\"",
      "\"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,\" he said. \"I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry. But I'm committed to be a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.\"",
      "One day after the suit was filed, a settlement was announced. While the details were not disclosed, Ventura said in a statement, \"I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control.\"",
      "Combs' defense attorneys said in their opening statements that he and Ventura hadn't seen each other since his ex, Kim Porter's, funeral in 2018.",
      "Ventura is now married and pregnant with her third child. Her husband, trainer Alex Fine, and her brother were both seen in court for support.",
      "\"Over the past five days, the world has gotten to witness the strength and bravery of my wife freeing herself of her past,\" Fine said in a statement, going on to say, \"I did not 'save Cassie' as some have said. To say that is an insult to the years of painful work my wife has done to save herself. Cassie saved Cassie.\"",
      "Who are Diddy's other accusers?",
      "Since 2023, dozens of women and men have filed lawsuits against Combs alleging sexual and physical abuse.",
      "Many of the accusers said they were drugged and then abused while incapacitated, and some claimed other celebrities were present or participated in the abuse.",
      "However, the majority of those allegations are not part of the criminal case. Prosecutors have chosen to focus on allegations where there is physical evidence or witness corroboration.",
      "The other three women involved in the trial have not been publicly named and they are expected to testify using pseudonyms. The indictment refers to them as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Jurors are expected to hear from one woman who the defense says had a three-year relationship with Combs that also turned jealous and violent, as well as former employees and an assistant.",
      "Combs has denied all of the allegations through his lawyers, who described the women as \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "Other high-profile names in the Sean Combs case",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they were familiar with a list of some 190 celebrities, including Michael B. Jordan, Kanye West and Mike Myers, though it wasn't clear how those people are related to the trial, if at all. Ventura testified about dating Jordan, as well as Kid Cudi.",
      "The judge overseeing the case is U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian, a Columbia Law School graduate and former clerk for the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. President Joe Biden appointed Subramanian as a federal judge in 2022.",
      "The prosecution team is made up of eight assistant U.S. attorneys, seven of them women. They include Maurene Ryan Comey, daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. She was one of the prosecutors in the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of conspiring Jeffrey Epstein to recruit and sexually abuse teenage girls.",
      "Combs' defense team is led by New York lawyer Marc Agnifilo, who along with his wife Karen Friedman Agnifilo is also defending\u00a0Luigi Mangione\u00a0in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Also on the seven-person defense team is Atlanta attorney Brian Steel, who represented Young Thug in a trial that lasted nearly two years before the rapper pleaded guilty to gang, drug and gun charges.",
      "Can you watch the Diddy trial live?",
      "Per federal court rules, photos and videos from inside court are not allowed. Courtroom sketches, however, are permitted.",

    "story": [
      "At the\u00a0sex trafficking trial of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, his ex-girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie Ventura, testified for multiple days. Her testimony was completed on Friday.",
      "Ventura is a critical witness in the prosecution's case against Combs, who has been accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and exploiting women for decades until his\u00a0arrest\u00a0on multiple charges last September. Combs has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The music mogul could receive a lifetime prison sentence if convicted on all of them.",
      "Here are some key takeaways from Ventrua's testimony.",
      "Violence occurred \"frequently\"",
      "In her initial statements before the court, Ventura, now pregnant with her third child and married to personal trainer Alex Fine, recalled her and Combs' early interactions and how she started to see a different side of him over time. She said she met Combs when she was a newly signed singer at 19, and their burgeoning friendship became romantic two years later.",
      "She also described his alleged violence throughout their 10-year on-off relationship, recounting instances where he knocked her over, kicked and dragged her, and stomped on her head, causing black eyes and bruises on her body. When asked, Ventura said the abuse she endured happened \"frequently.\"",
      "Combs is seen attacking Ventura in video footage CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0last year, which shows him throwing her to the floor, kicking and dragging her in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel.",
      "\"Control was everything\"",
      "Ventura characterized Combs as physically and psychologically abusive throughout the first hours of her testimony.",
      "\"Control was everything \u2014 from the way that I looked, to what I was working on that day, who I was speaking to,\" she said. \"Control was an all-around thing to a certain point.\"",
      "Combs allegedly introduced Ventura to \"freak offs,\" drug-fueled events where he is accused of forcing women to perform sex acts with hired sex workers, which were a focus of the indictment outlining his alleged crimes.",
      "Ventura said Combs broached the idea of sexual encounters involving voyeurism during the first year of their relationship, and he would hire an escort or dancer with whom he would watch her engage while he directed them. The singer testified she felt confused and nervous, \"but I also loved him very much and wanted to make him happy.\"",
      "She testified she worried about making Combs angry because of how much control he had over her life and career, and the possibility that he could blackmail her by releasing images of the \"freak offs.\" Prosecutors alleged in court documents that Combs often recorded these performances with or without participants' consent.",
      "A shift in the relationship",
      "Ventura recalled Combs looking out for her when she first met him. They fell in love, she said, while spending time together in the studio or traveling elsewhere.",
      "\"I think I was just enamored by him. We were just having a good time. It was really fun at this point,\" she told the court. But as her appearance, transportation, rent and overall lifestyle came under Combs' control, Ventura said her music career \u2014 and record deal \u2014 eventually took a backseat to the alleged \"freak offs,\" which left her feeling humiliated.",
      "She testified that despite recording hundreds of songs and nine albums while she was with Combs, the work was never released because \"freak offs\" became her job. They took up too much time and energy to leave room for other pursuits, Ventura said, adding that she would stay up for several days at a time to party, drink and have sex with strangers.",
      "The \"freak offs\" could last from 36 to 72 hours at a time, she said, with the longest continuing for four days. She recalled them happening almost weekly for years.",
      "Ventura felt \"disgusted\" and \"humiliated\" by \"freak offs\"",
      "Ventura began to cry during her testimony when asked whether she wanted to participate in every \"freak off.\" She said she didn't and that she felt \"disgusted\" and \"humiliated\" by them, but she also didn't want to disappoint Combs.",
      "Ventura told the court Combs dismissed her when she expressed how she felt about them, calling her predictable for not wanting to engage.",
      "Testifying at length about the \"freak offs,\" Ventura said Combs provided ecstasy and cocaine, which she took to stay awake during the incidents.",
      "2016 hotel incident",
      "Ventura recalled the 2016 hotel altercation seen on video footage. After being shown a clip from the incident during the second day of her testimony, she recounted that Combs was yelling and threw something at her during the attack.",
      "She said she told Combs via text message she had a black eye from the incident and reminded him of a premiere she was supposed to attend.",
      "\"You are sick for thinking it's OK to do what you've done,\" she wrote in a text to Combs. \"Please stay far away from me.\"",
      "Ventura told the court she wore sunglasses to cover her eyes and used makeup to hide bruises on other parts of her body when she attended the premiere.",
      "Prosecutors showed several photos of Ventura at the premiere event and after party, where the injuries could be seen.",
      "Drug use",
      "Combs allegedly provided stimulant drugs, like cocaine, to keep participants awake for the length of his \"freak offs,\" Ventura said. She also testified about a time when she requested ketamine, an anesthetic that has been used recreationally for its hallucinogenic and dissociative effects.",
      "Prosecutors allege Combs' \"freak offs\" involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and accuse him of using substances in part to exercise control over the people he targeted.",
      "She said Combs didn't like the drug and argued a successful \"freak off\" can be remembered, but explained ketamine was her preference because it allowed her to be less present in the moment.",
      "Rape allegation",
      "Ventura told the jury that Combs raped her in her living room in 2018. They were not together at the time and Ventura was seeing the man who is now her husband, she testified. Ventura said she remembered crying and saying no, but Combs did not stop. After, he got up and left, Ventura testified.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape in a lawsuit she filed in 2023. The lawsuit was settled the day after she filed it. Combs denied the allegation.",
      "Text messages",
      "During cross-examination Thursday and Friday, the defense asked Ventura about numerous text messages she and Combs exchanged over the course of their relationship.",
      "They included affectionate messages where Ventura told Combs she loved him and saw a future with him, potentially one that involved starting a family.",
      "Other messages related to the alleged \"freak offs,\" including one exchange allegedly coordinating one of them.",
      "\"You told him you wanted to do freak offs?\" they asked Ventura at one point, to which she replied, \"No, there's a lot more to that.\"",
      "During redirect on Friday, Ventura told prosecutors there were times Combs was kind and loving, but they didn't last.",

      "Bruce Springsteen gave his latest stinging criticism of President Trump and his administration, calling them \"treasonous\" and \"incompetent\" to kick off the first show of his British tour this week. The president responded in a Truth Social post that included criticism of the rocker's skin and telling him to \"keep his mouth shut\" until returning to the U.S.",
      "Springsteen, a long and prominent supporter of Democratic presidential candidates, made his remarks at a concert in Manchester, England, on Wednesday during the first of his \"Land of Hope and Dreams\" tour.",
      "\"The mighty E Street Band is here tonight to call upon the righteous power of art, of music, of rock 'n' roll in dangerous times,\" he said. \"In my home, the America I love, the America I've written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.\"",
      "The 75-year-old rocker, who later shared a transcript and video of his remarks on his website and YouTube channel, asked supporters of democracy to \"raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring!\"",
      "Throughout the concert, Springsteen accused Mr. Trump and his administration of authoritarianism, rolling back civil rights, blocking free speech and \"taking sadistic pleasure in the pain that they inflict on loyal American workers.\"",
      "\"They're rolling back historic civil rights legislation that led to a more just and plural society,\" Springsteen said. \"They're abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those struggling for their freedom.\"",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump responded on his social media platform, saying that the rocker is \"just a pushy, obnoxious JERK, who fervently supported Crooked Joe Biden, a mentally incompetent FOOL, and our WORST EVER President, who came close to destroying our Country.\"",
      "He added: \"Springsteen is 'dumb as a rock,' and couldn't see what was going on, or could he (which is even worse!)? This dried out 'prune' of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that's just 'standard fare.' Then we'll all see how it goes for him!\"",
      "This is not the first time Springsteen has aimed at Mr. Trump and his policies.",
      "When he endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election, Springsteen called Mr. Trump \"the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime.\"",
      "\"Perhaps not since the Civil War has this great country felt as politically, spiritually and emotionally divided as it does than at this moment. It doesn't have to be this way,\" the rock star said in\u00a0a short video\u00a0shared on social media.",

      "Singer Chris Brown was arrested Thursday in England for allegedly hitting someone with a bottle in a London nightclub in 2023.",
      "The Metropolitan Police did not name Brown but said it took a 36-year-old into custody at a Manchester hotel on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. Under British law, police cannot name suspects before charges are filed.",
      "The Sun, which first reported the story, said producer Abe Diaw told them Sunday that he was hospitalized after Brown beat him in an unprovoked attack at the Tape nightclub in the swanky Mayfair neighborhood in London in February 2023. Diaw told the Sun that Brown allegedly hit him over the head with a bottle before punching and kicking him as he lay on the floor.",
      "The tabloid said it became aware Brown was in the U.K. on Wednesday and called police to find out if he was under arrest. The newspaper said Met officers then traveled to Manchester and made the arrest.",
      "Brown's representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "Diaw said Brown, who was on a U.K. tour at the time, cracked him on the head with a bottle and punched and kicked him on the floor. The producer has filed a 12 million pound ($16 million) lawsuit against the singer.",
      "Brown, often called by his nickname Breezy, burst onto the music scene as a teen in 2005 and has become a major hitmaker over the years with notable songs such as \"Run It,\" \"Kiss Kiss\" and \"Without You.\" He won his first Grammy for best R&B album in 2011 for \"F.A.M.E.\" then earned his second gold trophy in the same category for \"11:11 (Deluxe)\" earlier this year.",
      "Brown has a history of legal issues dating back to his felony conviction in the 2009 assault of his then-girlfriend Rihanna. He pleaded guilty to felony assault at the time. In 2014, Brown pleaded guilty to hitting a man outside a Washington, D.C., hotel. In 2024, Brown, along with his paid entourage, allegedly beat several men who attended his concert in Texas.",
      "Earlier this year, Brown sued Warner Bros. Discovery for defamation over labeling the singer as an abuser in the 2024 documentary \"Chris Brown: A History of Violence.\"",

      "News of the Neurological Disorders and Stroke scientists losing their jobs was previously reported by The Transmitter.",
      "The laid-off scientists include Richard Youle. Youle, who has served at the NIH since 1978, carries the title of distinguished investigator, a designation reserved for the agency's most preeminent researchers. He was the winner\u00a0of the $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences in 2021 for his research into Parkinson's disease.",

      "Weeks have passed since those assurances were made to the scientists. Multiple sources said the scientists have yet to receive any letters revoking their \"reduction in force\" or \"RIF\" notices, or an explanation for why moves to reverse their layoffs never occurred.",
      "That is unlike similar layoffs that were revoked weeks ago at the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by the department, which officials completed in the days ahead of Kennedy's testimony to Capitol Hill.",
      "When asked about the employment status of NIH and NIOSH scientists who received reduction in forces notices, a spokesperson for the department pointed back to Kennedy's remarks at the Senate hearing about the layoffs.",
      "Kennedy's claim that no working scientists were fired has drawn disdain in recent days from other laid-off scientists at multiple health agencies beyond the NIH.",
      "For example, while some of the laid-off employees at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health were restored ahead of Kennedy's hearing, researchers in the agency's Health Effects Laboratory Division remain off the job. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also lost many scientists in its National Center for Environmental Health, which had been responsible for an array of work ranging from lead poisonings to illness outbreaks on cruise ships.

      "\"Physically, I feel better than I did 2-3 years ago,\" he said.",
      "Deming credits the treatment he received during a first-of-its-kind clinical study he participated in at the University of California, San Francisco: Psilocybin therapy for people with Parkinson's Disease.",
      "\"This is very clich\u00e9, but it truly gave me my life back,\" he said.",
      "Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in 'magic mushrooms.' When administered in controlled, clinical research settings, it has shown promise in treating depression and anxiety, both of which are mood symptoms associated with Parkinson's that are linked to a faster physical decline.",
      "\"The neurodegeneration that is happening isn't just impacting motor circuitry \u2013 it's impacting a lot of brain circuitry. That creates this huge burden of symptoms that we often overlook and don't talk about enough, maybe,\" said Dr. Ellen Bradley, of UCSF. \"We were really surprised by how well this trial went.\"",

      "12 patients participated in this first-round study, which involved a first and second course of Psilocybin treatment.",
      "\"We had folks do a lower dose of Psilocybin \u2013 a 10 mg dose initially \u2013 and monitored them for a couple of weeks to see how that went,\" Bradley said. \"If it did go well, if we didn't have safety concerns, then they were eligible for the full therapeutic dose of 25 mg.\"",
      "All 12 patients were able to complete both courses of treatment without reporting any serious side effects, according to Bradley.",
      "\"We want to find out not just does Psilocybin therapy work, but if it does, how does it work? That mechanistic piece is so important,\" she said. \"Can it change the brain's ability to adapt to its environment and to rewire itself?\"",
      "While there were no serious adverse effects reported, every patient didn't have the same life-changing experience as Deming says he experienced. Though many did report their motor and cognitive functions improved afterwards, per Bradley.",
      "\"We don't have a reason to believe that this is a treatment that is going to be a good fit for every patient. That is never really our expectation in medicine. But our goal is to figure out when is it the right treatment and how much for which patient,\" Bradley said.",
      "Bradley says her team is scaling up their work and are in the process of recruiting for a larger study, due to the success with the initial research.",
      "\"That was really exciting just to see that promising safety profile in this initial pilot. That kind of gives us a green light to go forward with more in-depth research,\" she said. \"We really desperately need new treatments for Parkinson's.

    "summary": "President Trump is now seeking to implement the idea through an executive order.",
    "story": [
      "Senate Democrats and the Biden administration dropped plans to set drug price caps based on the amount paid in other high-income countries, during talks years ago to push through the law that empowered Medicare to negotiate down the cost of prescription medications.",
      "A version of the idea was revived by President Trump in the executive order signed Monday, which called on the Department of Health and Human Services next month to draw up regulations to impose price restrictions tied to lower amounts paid in other developed nations, if drugmakers did not voluntarily reduce what they were charging in the U.S.",
      "\"Democrats could have done this a long time ago. They have fought like hell, for the drug companies. And they knew they were doing the wrong thing,\" Mr. Trump told reporters, speaking at a White House event to announce the move.",
      "For Democrats on Capitol Hill, this kind of approach to price controls has roots in a bill their own party successfully passed under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2019.",
      "As part of giving Medicare the ability to negotiate the price of costly drugs it covered, the bill passed by House Democrats wanted the maximum price to be tied to an average based on prices paid in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom.",
      "\"We were hoping to get Trump. Trump said, 'I want to negotiate.' But then Republicans in Congress got to him,\" said Wendell Primus, who served for nearly two decades as Pelosi's top aide on health policy.",
      "The bill did not make it through the Senate at the time, which was controlled by Mr. Trump's party. After Democrats flipped control of the Senate, the idea ran into headwinds years later, as Biden aides and lawmakers tried to incorporate the measure into the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Multiple Democrats involved in the talks on Capitol Hill at the time blamed a series of meetings in early 2021 with the staff from the Senate Finance Committee and party leadership for scuttling the idea.",
      "Staff on the committee said that they were worried that moderate Democrats like then-Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona would not support the bill if it included the measure, Primus said. Menendez and Sinema are no longer in the Senate.",
      "\"Members did not want to have something referencing foreign countries. They wanted it to make a function of the manufacturer's price here, what drug companies were offering to commercial insurers,\" Primus said.",
      "One former Biden White House aide involved in the talks said that there were several senators who understood that drug prices were too high, but they worried those price caps could undercut innovation from drugmakers in the U.S.",
      "Instead, the deal struck by lawmakers and White House aides to pass the law in 2022 ultimately turned to a different formula: capping them using calculations based on the price previously paid by Medicare and a fixed discount off the list price in the private U.S. market.",
      "\"President Biden and Democrats in Congress cared about getting something done, and so there was a compromise on the table that wasn't perfect, but it was going to make a huge amount of difference. And so that's the law they ultimately enacted,\" said Christen Linke-Young, deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under Mr. Biden.",
      "Medicare has gone on to implement the law, resulting in talks that are continuing under the current Trump administration to lower the maximum price that the federal insurance program will pay for a growing list of costly drugs.",
      "\"It's a good thing for prescription drug costs in this country to be lower, we need to continue to work on that. And one of the ways to do that is actually put a proposal before Congress and get it enacted, so it has the force of law,\" said Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under Mr. Biden.",
      "Meanwhile, as the White House was working with their allies in Congress to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration moved to formally scrap a bid by Mr. Trump to impose caps tied to lower prices in other high-income countries using executive power during his first term.",
      "Called the \"most favored nation\" model, Trump officials had directed Medicare to only reimburse hospitals and clinics for some costly drugs based on the lowest price paid for in other high-income countries.",
      "CMS under Mr. Biden ultimately rescinded that move in 2022, after a legal fight that had blocked the proposal on the grounds that the Trump administration had unlawfully shortcutted the normal rulemaking steps to finalize the policy.",
      "\"The proposal was always pretty transparently illegal. The statute says that Medicare has to pay for prescription drugs in one particular way, and the Trump administration proposal was that we are going to ignore the statute and pay for drugs in an entirely different way. If the statute allowed that, a president before Donald Trump would have done it,\" Linke-Young said.",
      "A White House official under Mr. Trump disagreed with the accusation that their initial proposal was unlawful, arguing that the initial authority they used for the \"demonstration\" model in Medicare used powers that were broadly written by Democrats.",
      "While they are not planning to go down the exact same path, the official said, saying that they \"learned certain things from that first demonstration,\" the Trump administration believes they \"absolutely have that authority in our pocket.\"",
      "\"We are confident that we have authorities within our government programs to do this. And any dispute from the Biden administration is an intentional misinterpretation of the statute for political reasons, because they are the ones that walked away,\" the White House official said.",
      "Trump administration officials have painted their second run at the \"most favored nation\" idea as even broader in scope than their first term, which had been limited to only some costly drugs administered by healthcare providers through Medicare Part B.",
      "The White House official said Wednesday that they \"firmly believe\" they have the ability to pursue wider actions to push drugmakers to lower their prices within Medicare. They cited other authorities in the law being considered like section 402, which affords HHS powers to \"develop and engage in experiments\" which could affect payment rates in Medicaid as well.",
      "Asked this week on Fox Business Network whether the president's promise of steep drug price cuts would also extend to Medicare Part D, which covers the broad swath of prescriptions filled at drug store pharmacies, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said \"they absolutely will.\"",
      "\"They'll apply to Medicare, and they'll apply in the private market as well,\" Kennedy said.",

      "The reinstatements mean that some NIOSH programs might soon be able to resume, after they were previously hobbled by the layoffs.",
      "For example, the agency's National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory had been forced to suspend new approvals of equipment like new N95 respirators and protective gear for firefighters after the initial round of cuts on April 1. Investigations of workplace health risks through NIOSH's Health Hazard Evaluation program were also upended by the layoffs, but staff working in those probes have now been reinstated.",

      "In NIOSH's Spokane and Pittsburgh Mining Research Division, laid-off scientists and engineers were called back to work, but only for a few more weeks to wind down their laboratories and research before their layoff notices take effect. Those NIOSH employees have not received letters formally rescinding their layoffs, unlike some of their colleagues.",
      "Part of their work includes overseeing miner safety programs like the personal dust monitors, or PDM, required by the Department of Labor for coal miners. NIOSH is responsible for testing PDM's accuracy. The monitors are needed to reduce the risk of black lung disease.",

    "story": [
      "There were 30,000 fewer U.S. drug overdose deaths in 2024 than the year before \u2014 the largest one-year decline ever recorded. An estimated 80,000 people died from overdoses last year, according to provisional Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data released Wednesday. That's down 27% from 110,000 in 2023.",
      "Still, annual overdose deaths are higher than they were before the COVID-19 pandemic. In a statement, the CDC noted that overdoses are still the leading cause of death for people 18-44 years old, \"underscoring the need for ongoing efforts to maintain this progress.\"",
      "Some experts worry the recent decline could be slowed or stopped by reductions in federal funding and the public health workforce, or a shift away from the strategies that seem to be working.",
      "\"Now is not the time to take the foot off the gas pedal,\" said Dr. Daniel Ciccarone, a drug policy expert at the University of California, San Francisco.",
      "The CDC has been collecting comparable data for 45 years. The previous largest one-year drop was 4% in 2018, according to the agency's National Center for Health Statistics.",
      "All but two states saw declines last year \u2014 with some of the biggest in Ohio, West Virginia and other states that have been hard-hit in the nation's decades-long overdose epidemic. Experts say more research needs to be done to understand what drove the reduction, but they mention several possible factors. Among the most cited:",

      "The number of at-risk Americans is shrinking, after waves of deaths in older adults and a shift in teens and younger adults away from the drugs that cause most deaths.",
      "The provisional numbers are estimates of everyone who died of overdoses in the U.S., including noncitizens. That data is still being processed, and the final numbers can sometimes differ a bit. But it's clear that there was a huge drop last year.",
      "A CDC report late last year showed that overdose deaths in the U.S. fell 17% between July 2023 and July 2024 \u2014 credited in part to wider naloxone access. Naloxone, also sold under the brand name Narcan,  was made\u00a0available for over-the-counter purchase\u00a0in 2023 and is\u00a0standard for first responders\u00a0to carry. It's even popped up\u00a0in some classrooms.",
      "The Trump administration has proposed cutting a $56 million grant that teaches first responders how to use the lifesaving overdose reversal drug naloxone, which experts have previously said could reverse progress the U.S. has made in lowering opioid overdose deaths.",
      "The grant money can be used by state and local organizations for training people on how to use naloxone, as well as administering and distributing the medication. The grant is administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.",
      "Experts note that there have been past moments when U.S. overdose deaths seemed to have plateaued or even started to go down, only to rise again. That happened in 2018.",
      "But there are reasons to be optimistic.",
      "Drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacy chains and other businesses have settled lawsuits with state and local governments over the painkillers that were a main driver of overdose deaths in the past. The deals over the last decade or so have promised about $50 billion over time, with most of it required to be used to fight addiction.",
      "Another settlement that would be among the largest, with members of the Sackler family who own OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma agreeing to pay up to $7 billion, could be approved this year.",
      "The money, along with federal taxpayer funding, is going to a variety of programs, including supportive housing and harm reduction efforts, such as providing materials to test drugs for fentanyl, the biggest driver of overdoses now.",
      "But what each state will do with that money is currently at issue. \"States can either say, 'We won, we can walk away'\" in the wake of the declines or they can use the lawsuit money on naloxone and other efforts, said Regina LaBelle, a former acting director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. She now heads an addiction and public policy program at Georgetown University.",
      "President Donald Trump's administration views opioids as largely a law enforcement issue and as a reason to step up border security. That worries many public health leaders and advocates.",
      "\"We believe that taking a public health approach that seeks to support \u2014 not punish \u2014 people who use drugs is crucial to ending the overdose crisis,\" said Dr. Tamara Olt, an Illinois woman whose 16-year-old son died of a heroin overdose in 2012. She is now executive director of Broken No Moore, an advocacy organization focused on substance use disorder.",
      "Olt attributes recent declines to the growing availability of naloxone, work to make treatment available, and wider awareness of the problem.",

      "Despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts last year, mortgage rates have remained near their 25-year peak because they tend to track the 10-year Treasury bond, which is sensitive to economic conditions. With Moody's downgrade on Friday, the markets slipped in early trading and the yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped above 5%, the highest since late 2023.",

      "The U.S. credit rating was downgraded by Moody's Ratings on Friday, highlighting investor concerns about the government's growing debt.",
      "The downgrade from the top rating of Aaa to Aa1 \"reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,\" the credit rating firm said in a statement on Friday.",
      "\"Successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,\" Moody's added.",
      "Moody's also highlighted the environment of heightened policy uncertainty driven by Mr. Trump's evolving trade priorities.",
      "Moody's is the last of the three major credit rating agencies to downgrade U.S. government debt. In August 2011, Standard and Poor's downgraded the U.S. from AAA to AA+, and in August 2023\u00a0Fitch Ratings cut the credit rating a notch from AAA to AA+.",
      "Moody's said it expects federal deficits to grow from 6.4% of GDP in 2024 to 9% of GDP by 2035, driven by \"increased interest payments on debt, rising entitlement spending and relatively low revenue generation.''",
      "\"Even Obama economists warned the Biden administration and congressional Democrats against recklessly wasting trillions on COVID 'stimulus' bills \u2013 spending that piled on our national debt, fueled runaway inflation, and forced the Fed to raise interest rates for everyday Americans,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement Friday to CBS News in response to the downgrade. \"The Trump administration and Republicans are focused on fixing Biden's mess by slashing the waste, fraud, and abuse in government and passing The One, Big, Beautiful Bill to get our house back in order. If Moody's had any credibility, they would not have stayed silent as the fiscal disaster of the past four years unfolded.\"",
      "The credit downgrade came as the House Budget Committee on Friday rejected\u00a0President Trump's domestic policy bill, which would extend tax cuts from his first term.",
      "If the 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act is extended, it would add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit (excluding interest payments) over the next decade, Moody's said Friday.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans plan to move ahead with a vote this week on the legislation containing President Trump's second term agenda, which includes spending on tax cuts, as well as border security and defense priorities. Fractures in the GOP conference appeared to persist, despite the legislation's movement out of committee, throwing its passage into question. President Trump is expected to make a personal visit to House Republicans Tuesday to urge them to back the bill, a source familiar with the planning confirmed.",
      "\"There's a lot more work to do,\" House Speaker Mike Johson told reporters late Sunday. \"But I'm looking forward to very thoughtful discussions, very productive discussions, over the next few days \u2014 and I'm absolutely convinced we're going to get this in final form and pass it.\"",
      "After the final three committees advanced their portions of the massive legislative package last week, a handful of conservative hardliners on the House Budget Committee blocked the package from moving forward Friday. The setback prompted work through the weekend to negotiate with the holdouts, who ultimately allowed the legislation to advance late Sunday.",
      "House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington called it a \"critical step,\" while acknowledging that deliberations are continuing, with disagreements remaining on a cap on the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, and on when Medicaid work requirements would take effect. But Arrington said the vote to advance the legislation Sunday \"is a sign that people are confident that these things will be resolved.\"",
      "Reps. Chip Roy of Texas and Ralph Norman of South Carolina, two of the conservative holdouts, celebrated a change they said would be made to remove delays from the Medicaid work requirements, since conservatives opposed the original plan, which would have delayed until 2029 work requirements for childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities. But Roy noted in a post on social media that \"the bill does not yet meet the moment,\" pointing to remaining sticking points on cutting clean energy subsidies implemented under the Biden administration and cuts to the federal share of payments for Medicaid.",
      "Johnson suggested that he and the conservatives had agreed to \"minor modifications\" over the weekend. The speaker is walking a tightrope between the hardliners demanding more cuts and moderates who are reluctant to slash Medicaid, while a number of Republicans who represent blue states have also threatened to withhold their votes unless their demands are met on SALT, among other divisions.",
      "On Monday, Johnson told reporters that there have been \"lots of discussions\" with the various members of different GOP caucuses, adding that nothing has been \"ultimately and finally decided\" as Republican leaders look to build consensus around the ideas.",
      "\"I told all the members on a conference call this morning that this is a consensus-building operation, it's been a bottom-up process,\" Johnson said. \"And we're almost there.\"",
      "The legislation is set to go before the House Rules Committee on Wednesday at 1 a.m., where any changes to the legislation would be made. But Roy and Norman also sit on the Rules Committee and could raise a final hurdle there ahead of the full House vote. Should the package advance out of the Rules Committee, it would tee up a vote on the package on Thursday, before lawmakers are set to leave town for the Memorial Day recess.",
      "As Republican leadership irons out the remaining issues, President Trump is expected to continue to pressure Republicans to get the bill passed this week, as he did on Friday on social media. And on Tuesday morning.",
      "Meanwhile, the legislation is expected to face some resistance in the Senate, where a number of Republicans have warned that should the House pass the bill, the upper chamber will try to make changes.",
      "Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, told reporters late last week that the House bill \"would not pass in the Senate, and I think there's plenty of us that would vote against it.\" And Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters that \"we've assumed all along that the Senate would have its input on this.\"",
      "Johnson said on Fox News Sunday that \"the package that we send over there will be one that was very carefully negotiated and delicately balanced, and we hope that they don't make many modifications to it because that will ensure its passage quickly.\"",
      "Beyond the self-imposed deadlines, the inclusion of a debt limit increase in the package has added urgency to getting the legislation to the president's desk. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged Congress earlier this month to address the debt limit by mid July, warning that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August without action. And top administration and congressional leaders have circled July 4 as the deadline to get the package to the president desk.",
      "\"We've got to get this done and get it to the president's desk by that big celebration on Independence Day,\" Johnson said. \"I'm convinced that we can.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Republican-backed tax and spending bill that's now moving forward in the House is getting a reality check from Wall Street. That's because the proposed tax breaks are projected to far outstrip any savings in the bill, potentially leading to mounting U.S. debt and a worsening fiscal outlook, according to economists and policy experts.",
      "If the bill moves forward without significant changes, the U.S. would likely find its debt levels spiraling higher in order to finance the tax cuts, according to several analyses. Over the next decade, the GOP bill could cost the U.S. $3.8 trillion, according to a report\u00a0earlier this month by the Joint Committee on Taxation that examined the impact of the the tax measures versus spending cuts.",
      "Those risks are rattling Wall Street. Moody's Ratings on Friday\u00a0downgraded the nation's debt, citing the potential for the new bill to add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit, which excludes interest payments, over the next decade.",
      "The bill also faces detractors within the Republican party, with the House Freedom Caucus saying in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0on Sunday that the bill \"fails to actually honor our promise to significantly correct the spending trajectory of the federal government and lead our nation towards a balanced budget.\"",
      "The concern, according to both Wall Street economists and policy experts, is that adding billions in debt to the U.S. ledger could eventually squeeze federal spending because the nation would likely face higher interest payments. That, in turn, could make it more difficult to fund programs like Social Security, which is already facing a financial drawdown as baby boomers hit retirement age, or to invest in initiatives like infrastructure that can spur economic growth.",
      "\"It's time for policymakers to hit pause, go back to the drawing board and put forward a plan that actually takes steps toward putting our nation on a sustainable fiscal trajectory,\" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a public policy think tank, in an email.",
      "She added, \"Our federal interest payments are skyrocketing, already surpassing what we spend annually on defense or Medicare.\"",
      "The Trump administration said it disagreed both with the Moody's analysis and forecasts that the legislation could widen the nation's deficit, which is the gap between federal spending and revenue.",
      "\"This bill does not add to the deficit,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Monday in a press conference. \"In fact, according to the Council of Economic Advisers, there's $1.6 trillion worth of savings in this bill \u2014 that's the largest saving for any legislation that has ever passed Capitol Hill in our nation's history.\"",
      "Savings versus spending",
      "At the heart of the proposed GOP bill is President Trump's vow to renew his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which introduced lower tax brackets for many Americans. Because those provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025, about 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026 without an extension of the law,\u00a0according\u00a0to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "The Council of Economic Advisers, a White House agency that advises the president on economic issues,\u00a0said\u00a0in a May study that the new bill would \"avert a $4 trillion tax hike\" by extending the TCJA's provisions.",
      "Renewing the law's cuts alone would cost $2.2 trillion over the next decade, estimates Joint Committee on Taxation, which assesses the impact of policy for Congress. The GOP bill also includes other new tax breaks that would add to the bill's long-term costs, the group's analysis found.",
      "For instance, the bill's proposal to provide taxpayers with a more generous standard deduction would result in $1.3 trillion in lost revenue over the next decade, the Joint Committee found. Eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, as well as giving a bigger deduction to senior citizens, would cost an additional $234 billion over the same period, its analysis finds.",
      "The bill does include spending cuts, but they aren't large enough to offset the tax breaks, several recent analyses conclude. The nonpartisan Bipartisan Policy Center\u00a0estimatedin a May 14 analysis that the tax cuts would cost $7.7 trillion over the next decade, while the spending cuts would offset $3.9 trillion over the same period. The result is a gap of $3.8 trillion, it said.",
      "That's the arithmetic that prompted Moody's to cut its rating on U.S. debt, from its top rating of Aaa to Aa1. In its assessment, the credit rating agency noted that the U.S. deficit has spiraled higher as previous administrations and Congress have \"failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend.\"",
      "\"Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat,\" Moody's said on Friday when it became the third major rating agency to cut the nation's credit rating. \"In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher.\"",
      "It added, \"The U.S.' fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to its own past and compared to other highly rated sovereigns.\"",
      "The Trump administration says that the proposed tax bill will spur economic growth by lowering taxes on consumers and businesses. In an interview on Monday with Fox Business, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said the economy is \"going to continue to take off once those policies are actually in place, once we actually have the tax cuts passed.\"",
      "Who wins and loses",
      "The GOP tax bill remains in flux and is likely to change as it winds through the House.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged there are still details to \"iron out\" as conservative Republicans seek to quickly enact work requirements for able-bodied participants in Medicaid. Those rules would take effect in 2029 under the bill passed last week by the Ways and Means Committee. Some House Republicans also want to more quickly end tax breaks for green energy projects being used nationwide.",
      "If the bill passes the House this week, it would then move to the Senate, where Republicans are also eyeing changes.",
      "Democrats have decried the cuts Republicans are proposing to Medicaid and food stamps to offset the costs of the tax breaks, pointing out that the reductions in social safety net programs comes as many wealthy taxpayers would get a big tax break.",
      "\"This spending bill is terrible, and I think the American people know that,\" Rep. Jim Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina, told CNN's \"State of the Union\u2033 on Sunday. \"There is nothing wrong with us bringing the government in balance. But there is a problem when that balance comes on the back of working men and women. And that's what is happening here.\"",
      "The lowest-income Americans would end up paying more under the proposed GOP bill, according to a May 19\u00a0analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania group that studies the fiscal impact of public policies. Even including savings from tax cuts, the bottom 20%, who earn up to $17,000 per year, would take a $1,035 hit in 2026 after the reductions in Medicaid and other programs are factored in.",
      "\"[H]ouseholds most affected by the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP \u2014 those in the bottom income quintile \u2014 experience the largest losses under this bill, averaging $28,000 in lifetime value for the working-age population,\" the Penn Wharton Budget model calculated. \"In contrast, working-age households in the top income quintile generally benefit from lower taxes, gaining an average of $30,000.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 19 May 2025 15:57:13 -0400",
    "summary": "Extreme weather linked to climate change will likely lead to more Americans losing their homes as foreclosure rates rise, researchers predict.",
    "story": [
      "Extreme weather linked to climate change could spell financial ruin for many American homeowners and lead to billions in losses for lenders, a new study finds.",
      "First Street, a research firm that studies the impact of climate change, projects in an analysis\u00a0released Monday that foreclosures across the U.S. caused by flooding, wind and other weather-related incidents could soar 380% over the next 10 years. By 2035, climate-driven events could account for up to 30% of all foreclosures by 2035, up from roughly 7% this year.",
      "Low- to moderate-income households are particularly vulnerable to the effect of severe weather on their homes, First Street noted. Much of Americans' wealth is tied up in the value of their properties.",
      "A cascade of foreclosures, driven by the mounting costs of repairs and rising insurance premiums stemming from extreme weather, \u00a0wouldn't only hurt homeowners. First Street estimates lenders will lose $1.2 billion a year in 2025 \u2014 and up to $5.4 billion in 10 years \u2014 as they are forced to absorb the cost of mortgage defaults.",
      "Such losses represent the \"hidden risks\" of climate change that lenders often fail to account for in their underwriting practices, Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications at First Street, told CBS MoneyWatch. Lenders consider factors including a borrower's income, debt and credit score in issuing mortgages, but not the potential impact of extreme weather on a property or how it could raise premiums.",
      "First Street also looked at how indirect factors, like rising insurance premiums, are already shaping foreclosure trends. For every 1% increase in insurance costs, the firm projects a roughly 1% increase in the foreclosure rate nationwide.",
      "The findings comes as insurers are jacking up the cost of homeowners policies and in some cases exiting markets around the U.S. altogether, leading to spottier coverage in disaster-prone areas like California. That could leave more individual homeowners on the hook for damage from extreme weather.",
      "First Street said integrating climate risk into loan assessments could help lenders \u2013 and homeowners \u2013 be better prepared for weather-related disasters. But it could also tighten lending conditions, Porter said, putting potential homebuyers at a disadvantage.",
      "\"It's going to increase the price of homes. It's going to increase interest rates,\" he said.",
      "Where climate foreclosures could rise",
      "According to First Street, the communities around the U.S. at greatest risk for climate-related foreclosures in the years to come are densely populated areas with high property values and large numbers of underinsured homeowners. That includes coastal areas vulnerable to storm surge and hurricane winds.",
      "For example, Florida's Duval County in the northeastern corner of the state, home to the city of Jacksonville, could see up to $60 million in credit losses resulting from 900 foreclosures in a \"severe weather\" year, according to CBS MoneyWatch's analysis of First Street's data\u00a0 Florida is home to 8 of the top 10 counties with the highest projected credit losses due to extreme weather, the data shows.",
      "Louisiana, California and swaths of the northeast are also projected to see high climate-related mortgage losses this year. But the impact won't just be felt in coastal areas: First Street also expects extreme rainfall and riverine flooding to drive up foreclosures in inland states.",
      "\"We do expect foreclosures to rise in those areas because the predominant driver is a lack of insurance,\" Porter said.",
      "According to First Street, flooding events in particular is likely to drive up foreclosure rates, as gaps in insurance coverage put more people at risk of defaulting on their mortgages.",
      "Unlike homeowners insurance, flood insurance is only required for people who have federally-backed mortgages in FEMA's Special Flood Hazard Areas. As of August 2023, that amounted to roughly 3.1 million policies, according to National Flood Insurance Program data. But far more people could be at risk.",
      "FEMA's 100-year flood zone maps include just under 8 million properties. But First Street estimates that nearly 18 million homes are at risk of flooding. That's because while the agency takes flooding from major river channels and coastal storm surge into account for its maps, it does not consider extreme precipitation, Porter said.",
      "\"We already know that about half the people with significant flood risk aren't mapped into [FEMA's] Special Flood Hazard Area,\" he said. \"So it leads to a state where we have a lot of underinsurance across the country, in particular from flooding.\"",
      "Meanwhile, whether or not you live in an official FEMA flood zone can make a difference when it comes to the likelihood of foreclosure, First Street found. That's because people outside flood zones often lack insurance.",
      "\"If you don't protect yourselves, then when the event does occur it's completely on you. You end up having to pay out of pocket and you may go into foreclosure,\" Porter said.",
      "In an analysis of 29 historical flood events from 2002-2019, First Street found that damaged properties outside of those FEMA-designated zones experienced foreclosure increases at an average of 52% higher than properties inside the zones.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment on if and how it plans to update its flood maps. According to one estimate by the Association of State Floodplain Managers, it could take up to $11.8 billion to complete updated flood mapping in the U.S.",

      "The ministry said that many of the 65,935\u00a0Airbnb listings it had ordered to be withdrawn did not include their license number or specify whether the owner was an individual or a company. Others listed numbers that didn't match what authorities had, it said.",
      "Spain is grappling with a housing affordability crisis that has spurred government action against short-term rental companies. In recent months, tens of thousands of Spaniards have taken to the streets protesting rising housing and rental costs, which many say have been driven up by holiday rentals on platforms like Airbnb that have proliferated in cities like Madrid and Barcelona and many other popular tourist destinations.",

      "About 321,000 homes in Spain had holiday rental licenses as of November last year, which was 15% more than in 2020, Reuters reported, citing official data. Many others operate without having official licenses.",
      "Airbnb said that it would appeal the decision. Through a spokesperson, the company said it did not think the ministry was authorized to rule on short-term rentals \u2014 and that it had utilized \"an indiscriminate methodology\" to include Airbnb rentals that do not need a license to operate.",
      "Last year, Barcelona announced a plan to close down all of the 10,000 apartments licensed in the city as short-term rentals by 2028 to safeguard the housing supply for full-time residents.",
      "The ministry said it had notified Airbnb of the noncompliant listings months ago, but that the company had appealed the move in court.",
      "Spain's government said Madrid's high court had backed the order sent to Airbnb. Bustinduy said it involved the immediate removal of 5,800 rental listings from the site. Two subsequent orders would be issued until the nearly 66,000 removals are reached, he said.",
      "Spain's government said the first round of affected properties were located across the country, including in the capital, Madrid, as well as in the regions of Andalusia and Catalonia, whose capital is Barcelona.",

    "summary": "About half of states have broadened Medicaid, the state-federal low-income health care program, to pay for social services such as housing and nutritional support.",
    "story": [
      "During his first administration, President Trump's top health officials gave North Carolina permission to use Medicaid money for social services not traditionally covered by health insurance. It was a first-in-the-nation experiment to funnel health care money into housing, nutrition, and other social services.",
      "Some poor and disabled Medicaid patients became eligible for benefits, including security deposits and first month's rent for housing, rides to medical appointments, wheelchair ramps, and even prescriptions for fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "Such experimental initiatives to improve the health of vulnerable Americans while saving taxpayers on costly medical procedures and expensive emergency room care are booming nationally. Without homes or healthy food, people risk getting sicker, becoming homeless, and experiencing even more trouble controlling chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.",
      "Former President Joe Biden encouraged states to go big on new benefits, and the availability of social services exploded in states red and blue. Since North Carolina's launch, at least 24 other states have followed by expanding social service benefits covered by Medicaid, the health care program for low-income and disabled Americans \u2014 a national shift that's turning a system focused on sick care into one that prioritizes prevention. And though Mr. Trump was pivotal to the expansion, he's now reversing course regardless of whether evidence shows it works.",
      "In Mr. Trump's second term, his administration is throwing participating states from California to Arkansas into disarray, arguing that social services should not be paid for by government health insurance. Officials at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which grants states permission to experiment, have rescinded its previous broad directive, arguing that the Biden administration went too far.",
      "\"This administration believes that the health-related social needs guidance distracted the Medicaid program from its core mission: providing excellent health outcomes for vulnerable Americans,\" CMS spokesperson Catherine Howden said in a statement.",
      "\"This decision prevents the draining of resources from Medicaid for potentially duplicative services that are already provided by other well-established federal programs, including those that have historically focused on food insecurity and affordable housing,\" Howden added, referring to food stamps and low-income housing vouchers provided through other government agencies.",
      "Mr. Trump, however, has also proposed axing funding for low-income housing and food programs administered by agencies including the departments of Housing and Urban Development and Agriculture \u2014 on top of Republican proposals for broader Medicaid cuts.",
      "The pullback has led to chaos and confusion in states that have expanded their Medicaid programs, with both liberal and conservative leaders worried that the shift will upend multibillion-dollar investments already underway. Social problems such as homelessness and food insecurity can cause \u2014 or worsen \u2014 physical and behavioral health conditions, leading to sky-high health care spending. Medical care delivered in hospitals and clinics, for instance, accounts for only roughly 15% of a person's overall health, while a staggering 85% is influenced by social factors such as access to healthy food and shelter for sleep, said Anthony Iton, a policy expert on social determinants of health.",
      "Health care experts warn the disinvestment will come at a price.",
      "\"It will just lead to more death, more suffering, and higher health care costs,\" said Margot Kushel, a primary care doctor in San Francisco and a leading researcher on homelessness and health care.",
      "The Trump administration announced in a March 4 memo that it was rescinding Biden-era guidance dramatically expanding experimental benefits known as health-related social needs. Federal waivers are required for states to use Medicaid funds for most nontraditional social services outside of hospitals and clinics.",
      "Last month, the administration told states that these services, which can also include high-speed internet and storage units, should not be part of Medicaid.",
      "Future waiver requests allowing Medicaid to provide social services \u2014 a liberal philosophy \u2014 will be considered on a \"case-by-case basis,\" the administration said. Rather, it has signaled a conservative shift toward requiring most Medicaid beneficiaries to prove that they're working or trying to find jobs, which puts an estimated 36 million Americans at risk of losing their health coverage.",
      "\"What they're arguing is Medicaid has been expanded far beyond basic health care and it needs to be cut back to provide only basic coverage to those most desperately in need,\" said Mark Peterson, a health policy expert at UCLA. \"They're making the case, which is not widely shared by specialists in the health care field, that it's not the job of taxpayers and Medicaid to pay for all this stuff outside the traditional heath care system.\"",
      "Although states have not received formal guidance to end their social experiments, Peterson and other health policy researchers expect the administration not to renew waivers, which typically run in five-year intervals. Worse, legal experts say programs underway could be halted early.",
      "Evidence supporting social investments by Medicaid is still nascent. An expansion in Massachusetts that provided food benefits reduced ER visits and hospitalizations, for instance. But often, it's a mixed bag.",
      "California is going the biggest, investing $12 billion over five years to provide a slew of new services, from intensive case management to help people with severe behavioral health conditions to housing and food assistance through a pair of federal waivers. The most popular benefits provided by health insurers are those that help homeless people on Medicaid by placing them in apartments or securing beds in recovery homes, covering up to $5,000 for security deposits, and preventing eviction.",
      "Since the CalAIM program launched in 2022, it has served only a small fraction of the state's nearly 15 million Medicaid beneficiaries, with roughly 577,000 referrals for benefits. Yet it has improved and even saved the lives of some of those lucky enough to get help, including Eric Jones, a 65-year-old Los Angeles resident.",
      "\"When I got diabetes, I didn't know what to do and I had a hard time getting to my medical appointments,\" said Jones, who lost his housing this year when his mom died but received services through his Medi-Cal insurer, L.A. Care. \"My case manager got me rides to my appointments and also helped me get into an apartment.\"",
      "California is considering making some of its social services permanent after the CalAIM waivers expire at the end of 2026. Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration is adding more housing services, including up to six months of free rent under a third waiver approved by the Biden administration. Medi-Cal officials contended early evidence shows CalAIM has led to better care coordination and fewer hospital and ER visits.",
      "\"We are fully committed,\" said Susan Philip, a deputy director for the state Department of Health Care Services, which administers the program. \"We have invested so much.\"",
      "Health insurers, which deliver Medicaid coverage and receive greater funding to cover these additional benefits, say they're worried the Trump administration will end or curtail the programs. \"If we do things the same old way, we're just going to generate the same old results \u2014 people getting sicker and health care costs continuing to rise,\" said Charles Bacchi, president and CEO of the California Association of Health Plans, which represents insurers.",
      "Industry leaders say the expansion is already changing lives.",
      "\"We believe wholeheartedly that housing is health, food is health, so seeing these programs disappear would be devastating,\" said Kelly Bruno-Nelson, executive director of Medi-Cal for CalOptima Health, a health insurance provider in Orange County.",
      "Oregon is also providing low-income Medicaid patients with a range of new services, including home-delivered healthy meals and rental payment assistance. Residents can even qualify for air conditioners, heaters, air filters, power generators, and mini fridges. State Medicaid officials say they remain committed to providing the benefits but worry about federal cuts.",
      "\"Climate change and housing instability are huge indicators of poor health,\" said Josh Balloch, vice president of health policy and communications at AllCare Health, a Medicaid insurer in Oregon. \"We hope to prove to the federal government that this is a good return on their investment.\"",
      "But even as the Trump administration curtails waivers, it is retaining discretion to provide social services in Medicaid, just on a smaller scale. Supporters say it's fair to scrutinize where to draw the line on taxpayer spending, arguing that there isn't always a direct health connection.",
      "\"We're seeing these things increase, with the free rent, and we're seeing some states pay for free internet, paying for furniture,\" said Kody Kinsley, who previously served as North Carolina's top health official. \"We know there's evidence for food and housing, but with all of these new benefits, we need to look closely at the evidence and the linkage to what actually drives health.\"",
      "Current North Carolina officials say they're confident the new social services Medicaid provides in their state have resulted in better health and lower overall spending on expensive and acute care. Medicaid recipients there can even use the program to buy farm-fresh produce.",
      "While it's too soon to know whether these experiments have been effective elsewhere in the United States, early evidence in North Carolina shows promise: The state had saved $1,020 per participant a year into its experiment \u2014 operating in mostly rural counties \u2014 by reducing ER trips and hospitalizations.",
      "State health officials also touted the economic benefits of driving business to family farms, home improvement contractors, and community-based organizations providing housing and social services.",
      "\"I welcome the challenge of demonstrating the effectiveness of our programs. It's making for healthier people and healthier budgets,\" said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina's Medicaid program. \"Family farms that were on the verge of collapse after Hurricane Helene are now benefiting from a steady income while they also serve their community.\"",

      "The shoe revolutionized the sneaker industry, but it almost didn't happen.",
      "Michael Jordan's game-changing sneaker",
      "Howard White, a Nike veteran and founding father of the Jordan Brand now serving as its senior vice president, was in the room in 1984 with untested NBA rookie Michael Jordan to meet with Nike at its headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon. Jordan was practically dragged into the meeting by his parents, Deloris and James Jordan.",

But this was so unique in terms of just doing it, I mean, just having the guts to make something like this happen,\" White explained to \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" while wearing Christian Dior Jordans, which retail up to $17,000 dollars.",
      "The offer: $2.5 million for Jordan to wear their shoes. That was triple what anyone else in the league was making at the time.",
      "Jordan ended up taking the deal \u2013 and the rest is sneaker history. He went on to lead the Chicago Bulls to six championships, while sporting his shoe brand.",
      "Nike hoped the Air Jordan would net them $3 million over four years. Instead, they sold $126 million in year one.",
      "Much of that success is thanks to Jordan's ability to seemingly defy gravity with his \"hang time,\" soaring across the paint for legendary dunks.

      "The Jordan Brand, a standalone division within Nike, generates some $7 billion for Nike annually. They've released a new design every year for the past four decades. Next up: the top secret \"Jordan 40.\"",

      "\"Sneakers are wearable art.

      "President Trump ripped into Walmart, saying on social media Saturday that the retail giant should \"eat the tariffs\" instead of blaming the duties on imported goods imposed by his administration for its increased prices.",
      "Walmart on Thursday warned that everything from bananas to children's car seats could increase in price despite the softer tariffs on China.",
      "\"We can control what we can control,\" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on the company's first quarter earnings call Thursday. \"Even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices,\" he added.",
      "The price hikes are expected to go into effect later this month.",
      "As Mr. Trump has jacked up import taxes, he has tried to assure a skeptical public that foreign producers would pay for those taxes and that retailers and automakers would absorb the additional expenses.",
      "In a Truth Social post on Saturday, the president lashed out at Walmart \u2013 which employs some 1.6 million people in the United States \u2013 and said the company should sacrifice its profits for the sake of his economic agenda. Mr. Trump says his economic plan will eventually lead to more domestic jobs in manufacturing.",
      "\"Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain,\" Trump posted. \"Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected. Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, \"EAT THE TARIFFS,\" and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I'll be watching, and so will your customers!!!\"",
      "A spokesperson for Walmart told CBS News on Saturday that it has always worked to keep prices as low as possible and \"we won't stop.\"",
      "\"We'll keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can given the reality of small retail margins,\" the spokesperson said.",

    "published": "Fri, 16 May 2025 18:37:44 -0400",
    "summary": "The greatest benefits would go to high-income households, while low-income families would see a much more modest boost, analyses show.",
    "story": [
      "The White House on Friday touted a Republican-backed tax bill as delivering \"PERMANENT tax cuts and bigger paychecks.\" Yet experts say the legislation would disproportionately benefit the highest income earners, while offering far more modest gains to Americans lower down the ladder.",
      "If the bill is passed, households with more than $1 million in annual income would see their after-tax earnings rise by 4.3%, according to a new analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a public policy think tank. The lowest-earning 20% of Americans would receive the smallest boost \u2014 their after-tax incomes would rise 0.6%, or an average of $90 annually, CBPP found.",
      "Other analyses have reached similar conclusions. The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution,\u00a0forecasts\u00a0that the bottom 20% of Americans would see a 0.6% increase in after-tax income under the House tax bill, compared with a 3.7% increase for the top 20%.",
      "The fate of the GOP tax bill is unclear after five Republican members of the House Budget Committee on Friday voted against advancing the measure, dubbed the \"one big, beautiful, bill,\" saying the legislation does not do enough to slash federal spending.",
      "Such projections don't include the impact of cuts to federal programs such as Medicaid and food stamps, which support many low- and middle-income households. Under the GOP bill, those services could face steep cuts, potentially bumping millions off Medicaid by adding work requirements and cutting federal funding provided to states to support the health care program.",
      "Those cuts could leave many low-income households worse off even after accounting for lower taxes, according to another analysis released Friday from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania research group that analyzes the fiscal impact of public policies.",
      "The bottom 20% of households, who earn up to about $17,000 annually, would see their after-tax incomes drop by $1,035 in 2026, including a reduction in government benefits, the nonpartisan group found. The top 0.1%, who earn at least $4.3 million per year, would get an annual after-tax boost of about $389,000, Penn Wharton said.",
      "The White House took issue with the CBPP and Penn Wharton analyses.",
      "\"Once again, the experts are wrong, just as they were about the impact of Trump's tariffs, which have yielded trillions in investments, record job growth, and no inflation,\" said White House spokesman Harrison Fields in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These experts should be embarrassed to share their 'expertise,' considering the egg still on their faces. MAGAnomics transcends conventional wisdom, and the President's One, Big, Beautiful Bill will continue to prove the haters wrong.\"",
      "The White House pointed to an analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation that estimated the average tax bill would decline 11.1% in 2027 under the GOP legislation. The nonpartisan panel, which assess the impact of legislation for Congress, found that the biggest tax decrease would go to people earning $15,000 to $30,000, with a decline of 21.1%, while those earning more than $1 million would decline 8.6%",
      "Tariff impact",
      "Because low-income households spend a bigger share of their income on basics like food and clothing than wealthier Americans, they are likely to take a bigger financial hit from tariffs, experts including the nonpartisan\u00a0Yale Budget Lab have said. That could effectively wipe out the benefits from the tax cuts, according to some analysts.",
      "If inflation rises as a result of higher tariffs and tax cuts, the bottom 20% of U.S. households would lose $100 per year, largely due to paying higher costs for consumer goods that are imported from other countries, the CBPP found. Because tariffs are taxes on imports paid by U.S. businesses, they typically pass on the cost of such duties to consumers by raising prices.",
      "\"If we add just the effects of the tariffs the Trump Administration has put in place, the plan would still boost the rich while leaving the lowest-income people worse off because their tax cuts are so small,\" Brendan Duke, senior director for federal fiscal policy at the CBPP, said in a post.",
      "Counting the impact of tariffs, the top 1% of households would still see their after-tax incomes increase by 3%, or almost $45,000, the think tank estimated. That analysis doesn't include the impact of cuts to services like Medicaid or food stamps.",
      "On Thursday, Walmart said it plans to hike prices this month to offset the cost of new tariffs introduced by the Trump administration.",
      "Extending the 2017 tax cuts",
      "As well as calling for deeper cuts in federal spending, the Republican lawmakers blocking the tax bill also want to move up\u00a0work requirements\u00a0for some Medicaid recipients, which under the current bill wouldn't kick in until 2029.",
      "Other Republicans want a bigger deduction cap on state and local taxes, known as SALT, that can be applied on people's\u00a0federal tax returns. The bill increases the cap on the deduction from $10,000 to $30,000.",
      "But the bill's basic outline for cutting taxes isn't a focus of debate among Republicans, who are seeking to extend Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The bill would also add a host of other cuts, such as eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, while also providing a more generous standard deduction.",

The average number of hours worked also fell by 2.7 hours per week.",
      "\"There are simply not enough employees to manually switch out price labels on shelves because some stores have tens of thousands of price tags hanging at any one time,\" Kravitz wrote in the report.",

      "Ahn was held in his prison cell in China for about 40 days leading up to his execution and he kept himself busy writing an autobiography and making hundreds of calligraphy pieces, including one requested by his own prison guard.",
      "\"The court and prison officials, saying they wanted to keep my calligraphy as a memento, brought me hundreds of sheets of silk and paper and asked me to create for them,\" Ahn wrote in his autobiography. \"I ended up spending several hours each day doing calligraphy, even though I wasn't particularly skilled in it.\"",
      "Even though Ahn had assassinated their top official Ito, the Japanese who took his calligraphy preserved them with care, and some of their descendants have donated them to the South Korean government, which subsequently designated them as national treasures.",
      "Now, more of the calligraphies are surfacing in the private art market, with the latest being auctioned last month in Seoul for 940 million won ($674,098) \u2014 more than three times its opening bid.",
      "The piece, which says \"green bamboo\" \u2014 a traditional symbol of integrity \u2014 had been owned by a Japanese individual who did not wish to be identified, and they had done an impeccable job preserving it, said Kim Jun-seon, art valuation specialist at Seoul Auction.",

      "Moves to honor Ahn by Seoul and Beijing have previously strained ties with Tokyo, even briefly sparking a diplomatic row in 2013.",
      "In 2014, Japan criticized a memorial built in China to commemorate Ahn, BBC News reported. A Japanese government spokesman branded him a terrorist after the Chinese-Korean memorial hall opened in China's Harbin city, where Ito was shot.",
      "The fact that his Japanese captors preserved his calligraphy \"reflects the cultural and political contradictions of early 20th century East Asia,\" said Eugene Y. Park, a history professor at University of Nevada, Reno.",
      "At his trial, Ahn identified himself as a soldier for Korea, defined his assassination of Ito as a military operation, and envisioned a united East Asia \u2014 comprising Korea, China and Japan \u2014 somewhat akin to today's European Union.",
      "\"Some Japanese may have seen him as a misguided but principled idealist,\" Park told AFP.",
      "His calligraphy, which focused on values such as peace and ethics, \"resonated culturally, even if he opposed them politically,\" he said.",
      "\"At a time when Japan's own imperial identity was unsettled, preserving his works revealed deeper tensions between respect for moral courage and the pursuit of colonial domination.\"",
      "In 2023, the Global Sae-A Group, a South Korean conglomerate, purchased one of Ahn's calligraphies for a record-breaking 1.95 billion won (nearly $1.4 million).",

    "story": [
      "The House Republican bill to enact President Trump's domestic policy agenda contains a provision that has prompted opposition from the Mexican government \u2014 a tax on cash payments sent by non-U.S. citizens to family members in their home countries.",
      "The payments, known as remittances, would be subject to a 5% excise tax that would encompass more than 40 million people, including green card holders and nonimmigrant visa holders, such as people on H-1B, H-2A and H-2B visas. U.S. citizens would be exempt.",
      "In a May 13 letter to the leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee, Esteban Moctezuma Barrag\u00e1n, Mexico's ambassador to the U.S., urged Chairman Jason Smith and Ranking Member Richard Neal to reconsider the proposal.",
      "\"We respectfully urge you to reconsider this section of the legislative proposal, and we remain available to continue dialogue on the matter,\" wrote Barrag\u00e1n and Robert Velasco Alvarez, Mexico's chief officer for North America.",
      "Spokespeople for both Smith and Neal did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In April, President Trump hinted at a crackdown on remittances, announcing in a Truth Social Post\u00a0that the administration was \"finalizing a presidential memorandum to shut down remittances sent by illegal aliens outside of the United States.\" But details on the presidential proposal were unclear.",
      "The remittance tax provisions in the bill have become an international flashpoint. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has also criticized the plan and urged Republican lawmakers to reconsider it.",
      "At a press briefing this week, Sheinbaum warned that the proposal \"would damage the economy of both nations and is also contrary to the spirit of economic freedom that the U.S. government claims to defend.\"",
      "\"Remittances are the fruit of the efforts of those who, through their honest work, strengthen not only the Mexican economy but also the United States', which is why we consider this measure to be arbitrary and unjust,\" she said.",
      "An estimate by the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies, which is cited in the letter, found that Mexican migrant workers sent on average 16.7% of their labor income as remittances.",
      "\"In other words, more than 80% of the income generated by this community remains in the U.S. economy,\" the letter says.",
      "The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates, however, that the proposal would generate a little more than $1 billion in tax revenue in fiscal year 2026, and rise to about $3 billion by 2034.",
      "In the letter to lawmakers, Barrag\u00e1n said the proposal would amount to double taxation, \"since migrants already pay taxes in the country where they work.\"",
      "\"Imposing a tax on these transfers would disproportionately affect those with the least, without accounting for their ability to pay,\" he added and also warned of other unintended consequences.",
      "\"Many migrants might seek informal or unregulated means to do so, complicating oversight and control of these financial flows. This would not only reduce the expected revenue but also increase risks related to financial security, tax evasion and money laundering,\" he wrote.",
      "Barrag\u00e1n has been meeting with lawmakers in recent days and discussing the matter with them. On Tuesday, he hosted a dinner for members of Congress, including Texas Rep. Tony Gonzalez, whose district spans the length of much of the state's border with Mexico and is home to many migrant workers. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast and Florida Rep Maria Elvira Salazar attended the dinner.",
      "Salazar said, when asked about the proposal, she was still assessing the legislation and who exactly it will affect, noting that banks already charge fees for such transactions.",
      "\"I just want what's fair, what's just and what's Christian,\" she said.",
      "Separately, Barragan met with Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick and also discussed the remittance measure.",
      "Representatives for the electronic payment transfer industry also expressed concern that this proposal would harm vulnerable communities.",
      "\"Such a measure would harm the most financially vulnerable consumers, undermine small businesses, disrupt critical financial regulations, and weaken law enforcement's ability to combat illicit activity,\" the Electronic Transactions Association wrote to Smith and Neal.",

    "published": "Fri, 16 May 2025 13:17:34 -0400",
    "summary": "High temperatures and rising electricity costs could boost home energy bills by 6% this summer, a new report says.",
    "story": [
      "High temperatures projected across the U.S. summer could take a toll on Americans' budgets by driving up the price of keeping homes cool.",
      "Home electricity bills are expected to rise to an average of $784 for the summer period, up more than 6% from $737 in 2024 and marking a 12-year record, according a new analysis from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA).",
      "The growing expense comes on the heels of a cold winter that drove up heating costs for many Americans, and as consumers continue to grapple with higher prices on everyday goods. Consumers are also increasingly expressing concerns about how tariffs\u00a0could affect their day-to-day costs, Gallup polling has found.",
      "\"We found that it's going to be another expensive summer for air conditioning because temperatures will stay high, and electricity prices have been rising faster than inflation,\" energy economist Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The anticipated spike in residential electricity costs from June through September is due to the combination of rising cost of electricity, which is outpacing inflation, with higher temperatures, NEADA said. Those trends mean that households are not only expected to pay higher prices for electricity, but will likely consume more of it than they did last summer because of the need for more cooling.",
      "\"It's not just temperatures that are going up, but the cost of cooling is going up,\" Wolfe said. \"And when electricity prices go up, they tend to stay high. So even if temperatures moderate, your bill might go up because of the cost of electricity.\"",
      "Unpaid bills",
      "Energy costs eat up a larger share of low-income families' budgets compared to higher-earners. Low-income households spend roughly 8.6% of their incomes on energy costs, compared to 3% for those that are higher up the income ladder, according to NEADA.",
      "Worryingly, the lowest earners could struggle to afford to keep their homes cool, Wolfe noted. The most recent Census Household Pulse Survey found that 37% of low- and moderate-income households could not afford their energy bills for at least one month between April 2023 and April 2024.",
      "If those households find themselves in a financial crunch this summer, they may opt to turn off their air conditioning, which could pose serious health risks, noted Wolfe.",
      "\"Last winter was cold, so they're just getting over paying their heating bills, and are now facing higher summer cooling costs,\" Wolfe explained. \"And while people understand that if you don't use heat in the winter, your pipes will freeze, that won't happen in the summer.\"",
      "Reluctance to turn on one's air conditioning can have adverse health effects like heat stroke. \"While this won't do damage to your building, it will do damage to you,\" Wolfe said.",
      "Extreme heat and health",
      "Public assistance programs haven't kept pace with the evolving climate, according to Wolfe. \"We're having heat waves that are lasting longer, and the systems in place to protect families have not kept up,\" he said.",
      "This summer's cooling cost forecast should be taken as a sign that state and federal assistance programs require modernization, according to Wolfe. Only 26 states offer summer cooling assistance to help Americans pay their bills. Thirty-three states have no protections in place to prevent utilities company from shutting off customers' access to electricity when they're behind on payments.",
      "Extreme heat is the leading weather-related killer in the United States, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Wolfe says that taking steps to modernize your home can actually help households save money. For example, adding insulation to your house can help control energy bills.",

      "Oliver Allen, senior U.S. economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that the U. of Michigan's initial survey likely failed to capture any improvement in sentiment from the U.S. and China agreeing to ease tariffs earlier this week.",
      "\"[W]e increasingly suspect that the consumer surveys, and the Michigan survey in particular, are painting an unduly negative picture of the consumer outlook at present,\" Allen said in a report. \"Headline retail sales eked out a further small gain in April, following a 1.7% jump in March, despite the recent plunge in confidence. Moreover, most near-real indicators of consumers' discretionary spending on services are holding up well.\"",

    "summary": "The bottom 60% of U.S. households don't make enough money to afford a \"minimal quality of life,\" according to a new analysis.",
    "story": [
      "The gap between what Americans earn and how much they need to bring in to achieve a basic standard of living is growing, according to a new report.",
      "The analysis, from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP), looks beyond whether people can afford daily necessities like food and shelter to consider whether they have the means to pay for things like the technology tools necessary for their jobs, higher education, and health and child care.",
      "LISEP tracks costs associated with what the research firm calls a \"basket of American dream essentials.\" The group says its Minimal Quality of Life index provides a truer picture of how Americans are faring than standard economic data, such as the nation's gross domestic product and jobless rate. The index captures the annual change in the typical costs facing low- and moderate-income households who are looking to maintain a basic quality of life.",
      "\"We analyze these components not just in terms of financial figures but as crucial elements that shape a family's capability to achieve a desirable standard of living,\" the group explains in a paper describing its approach.",
      "The findings? For the bottom 60% of U.S. households, a \"minimal quality of life\" is out of reach, according to the group, a research organization focused on improving lower earners' economic well-being.",
      "\"The middle class has been declining \u2014 we just haven't recognized it fully,\" LISEP Chairman Gene Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's really dangerous because it's the kind of thing that leads to social unrest, and it's not fair. The American dream is not that it's given to you \u2014 it's that if you work hard, you have a chance to get ahead and achieve the things in life that you want to achieve. It's not living in a tent, not having to steal.\"",
      "The Ludwig Institute also says that the nation's official\u00a0unemployment rate of 4.2%\u00a0greatly understates the level of economic distress around the U.S. Factoring in workers who are stuck in poverty-wage jobs and people who are unable to find full-time employment, the U.S. jobless rate now tops 24%, according to LISEP, which defines these groups as \"functionally unemployed.\"",
      "Peering beneath the surface",
      "By those standards, the lowest-earning Americans around the U.S. are falling well short of what they need to maintain a decent standard of living, according to LISEP. These households, which in 2023 earned an average of $38,000 per year, would need to make $67,000 to afford the items the group tracks as part of its index, which also includes the cost of professional clothing and basic leisure activities.",
      "\"Traditional headline economic indicators like GDP and unemployment tell us the economy is thriving, but they don't reflect the lived reality of most Americans,\" Ludwig said in a statement. \"Americans are working harder than ever, fueling our economic growth, but the benefits of that hard work are not being distributed in a way that supports upward mobility for too many middle- and low-income Americans.\"",
      "From 2001 to 2023, the cost of affording what amounts to a basic level of economic security doubled, according to LISEP's analysis. Housing and health care costs surged, while the amount of savings required to attend an in-state, public university soared 122%.",
      "Meanwhile, median earnings for the bottom 60% of income earners fell 4% over that span when adjusting for the cost of goods tracked by the group's index, according to LISEP. Income growth for these households has also lagged, rising 0.37% per year during the same period \u2014 less than half as much as for the top 40% of earners, the group found.",
      "The gap between how much low-income families earn and how much they need to afford a minimum cost of living is expected to keep widening, Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Unfortunately, it is growing because the items that go into the basket of goods and services that make the minimal quality of life are inflating at a higher rate than wages are inflating,\" he said.",

      "\"We expect the U.S.'s effective tariff rate to increase by about 13 [percentage points] this year to its highest level since the 1930s,\" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a May 14 research note. \"While the ultimate level and composition of tariffs remains uncertain, they will probably remain elevated for the foreseeable future.\"",
      "Retailers warn of price hikes",
      "Walmart on Thursday warned that it will start raising prices later this month due to the impact of U.S. tariffs. While Mr. Trump on Monday announced he would ease tariffs on Chinese imports for 90 days \u2014 taking the rate down from 145% to about 30% \u2014 it represents an increased business expense for American companies.",
      "\"We can control what we can control,\" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on the company's first-quarter earnings call yesterday. \"Even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices,\" he added.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he's rolling out the tariffs for a variety of reasons, including to spur domestic and foreign businesses to shift their manufacturing plants to the U.S. and revive American manufacturing jobs. On Friday, Mr. Trump touted announcements from some companies that have said they plan to invest in the U.S.",
      "\"[W]e're probably in the $12 to $13 trillion range of investments,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think we're heading toward the $12 to $13 trillion between projects already announced, mostly announced, but some are going to be announced very shortly and literally, very shortly.\"",
      "Still, many trade experts\u00a0are skeptical\u00a0that the threat of higher tariffs and political pressure from the White House are enough to spark a major revival in U.S. manufacturing. Businesses typically decide to build new factories based on a number of other factors beyond tariffs, including labor, energy and transportation costs, tax rates, and the regulatory environment.",

      "Charter Communications has agreed to merge with Cox Communications in a $34.5 billion deal that will combine two of the top three cable companies in the U.S.",
      "Cox is the third-largest cable television company in the country, with more than 6.5 million digital cable, internet, telephone, and home security customers. It has a strong foothold in states spanning from California to Virginia. Charter Communications, known more widely as Spectrum, has more than 32 million customers in 41 states.",
      "The cable industry has been under assault for years from streaming services like Disney, Netflix, Amazon and HBO Max, as well as internet plans offered by mobile phone companies. Comcast, which is of nearly equal size to Charter, spun off many of its cable television networks in November as as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms.",
      "So-called \"cord cutting\" has cost the industry millions of customers and left them searching for ways to successfully compete.",
      "Charter said Friday that it will acquire Cox Communications' commercial fiber and managed IT and cloud businesses. Cox Enterprises will contribute Cox Communications' residential cable business to Charter Holdings, an existing subsidiary partnership of Charter.",
      "Cox Enterprises will own about 23% of the combined company's outstanding shares.",
      "The transaction, which needs approval from Charter shareholders as well as regulators, includes $12.6 billion in debt.",
      "The proposed deal is one of the largest in over a year. Mars' announced a $30 billion deal with Kellanova last summer and Exxon Mobil's approximately $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural happened in late 2023.",
      "The combined company will change its name to Cox Communications within a year after closing. It will keep Charter's headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut, and have a significant presence on Cox's Atlanta, Georgia campus following the closing.",
      "After the deal is complete, Charter CEO Chris Winfrey will become president and CEO of the combined company. Cox CEO and Chairman Alex Taylor will serve as chairman.",
      "Cox will be able to keep two directors on the 13-member board. Advance/Newhouse, which is part of Charter, will retain its two board members.",
      "The transaction is expected to close at the same time as Charter's merger with Liberty Broadband, which was approved by Charter and Liberty Broadband stockholders in February.",
      "Shares of Charter rose more than 4% before the market open. Cox is a private company.",

    "story": [
      "David's Bridal, the 75-year-old company serving budget-conscious brides and wedding parties, is courting the \"affordable luxury\" market.",
      "The go-to store for brides on a budget has launched a higher-end, bricks-and-mortar chain called Diamonds & Pearls that offers dresses ranging from $700 to more than $5,000. David's expansion into the luxury segment comes two years after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April 2023, citing inflation and pressures.",
      "The first Diamonds & Pearls store opened Thursday in Delray Beach, Florida. David's operates 193 stores across the U.S., selling gowns that range in cost from $500 to $3,000.",
      "While the company has long held a grip on the value-end of the bridal market, it was missing the luxury piece and wanted to serve customers looking for premium offerings, David's CEO Kelly Cook told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"We found that 90% of all brides were in David's funnel, but we didn't have products to serve the couture bride, or the budget bride. We only had products to serve the middle,\" Cook said. \"Affordable luxury is the fastest-growing segment we have.\"",
      "Cook explained that brides are under pressure as tariffs weigh on the cost of weddings, which stands at $37,500 on average, she said. An\u00a0estimate from Fidelity pegs the average cost of a wedding in 2024 at $33,000.",
      "David's solved the budget consumer's end of the equation first. In March, it began selling wedding dresses for as little as $99, under the DB Studio label. And in December 2024, David's partnered with delivery service DoorDash to let customers order dresses on the app and have them delivered in minutes \u2014 along with dessert.",
      "Roughly 17% of David's brides are shopping for dresses for weddings that are within three weeks, \"So we have to serve the last-minute brides,\" Cook said.",
      "Now, it's moving up the luxury scale, offering made-to-order dresses, including gowns from designers like Marchesa and Viola Chan, and serving champagne to brides-to-be at its Diamonds & Pearls store. The company has plans to open at least one more Diamonds & Pearls store this year, Cook said.",
      "Cook's ultimate goal for the company is to serve every type of consumer \u2014 including grooms \u2014 along every step of the wedding planning process. That includes launching its own AI-powered wedding planning tools, video content and more.",
      "The company is now in a growth spurt, undeterred by President Trump's evolving tariff program\u00a0that is dissuading some companies from investing in growth. Mr. Trump had imposed tariffs of as high as 145% on Chinese imports, which now stand at 30% for a period of 90 days.",
      "Although it previously produced 67% of its own line of dresses in China, David's plans to move all of its production out of China by the end of June, according to Cook, adding that its factories in Myanmar, India and Vietnam will pick up the slack.",
      "Despite the range in prices, DB Studio, dresses on DoorDash and Diamonds & Pearls all share a common denominator, which is \"absolute quality,\" according to Cook.",

      "Starbucks'\u00a0new dress code for baristas has sparked a strike at 75 U.S. stores, with more than 1,000 workers protesting the new policy, a union representing the coffee giant's workers said Wednesday.",
      "The new dress code, which went into effect on Monday, requires employees at company-operated and licensed stores in the U.S. and Canada to wear a solid black shirt and khaki, black or blue denim bottoms under their green apron.",
      "Under the previous dress code, baristas could wear a broader range of dark colors and patterned shirts. Starbucks said the new rules would make its green aprons stand out and create a sense of familiarity for customers as it tries to establish a warmer, more welcoming feeling in its stores.",
      "The new dress code comes as the company works on its\u00a0\"Back to Starbucks\"\u00a0mission, aimed at revitalizing its cafes and boosting sales. CEO Brian Niccol, who was brought on from Chipotle to lead the coffee chain\u00a0last year, has said \"there's a shared sense that we have drifted from our core.\"",
      "But Starbucks Workers United, the union that represents workers at 570 of Starbucks' 10,000 company-owned U.S. stores, said the dress code should be subject to collective bargaining.",
      "\"Starbucks has lost its way. Instead of listening to baristas who make the Starbucks experience what it is, they are focused on all the wrong things, like implementing a restrictive new dress code,\" said Paige Summers, a Starbucks shift supervisor from Hanover, Maryland. \"Customers don't care what color our clothes are when they're waiting 30 minutes for a latte.\"",
      "Most stores remain open",
      "Summers and others also criticized the company for selling styles of Starbucks-branded clothing that employees no longer are allowed to wear to work on an internal website. Starbucks said it would give two free black T-shirts to each employee when it announced the new dress code.",
      "Starbucks said Wednesday that the strike was having a limited impact on its 10,000 company-operated U.S. stores.",
      "\"[B]y their own measure, less than 1% of stores have participated in their attempts to cause disruption,\" a Starbucks spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "The company added that more than 99% of its stores are open and serving customers. In some cases the strikes closed stores for less than an hour, the company noted.",
      "\"It would be more productive if the union would put the same effort into coming back to the table to finalize a reasonable contract,\" Starbucks added.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has been unionizing U.S. stores since 2021. Starbucks and the union have yet to reach a contract agreement, despite agreeing to return to the bargaining table in February 2024.",
      "The union said this week that it filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board alleging Starbucks' failure to bargain over the new dress code.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it will let the Trump administration end the Temporary Protected Status program protecting roughly 350,000 Venezuelan migrants from the threat of deportation while legal proceedings over the move continue.",
      "The high court granted the administration's request to lift for now a lower court's injunction that blocked Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's revocation of the Temporary Protected Status program, or TPS, for Venezuelans. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said she would deny the administration's bid for emergency relief.",
      "Noem terminated the designation \u2014 which had been extended by the Biden administration \u2014 in February, a move that would have cleared the way for Venezuelans to lose their government-issued work permits and deportations protections on April 7. But a federal judge in California blocked the action in late March and said her decision to terminate the TPS program for the Venezuelan migrants appeared to be \"predicated on negative stereotypes\" and may have been motivated by unconstitutional animus.",
      "A federal appeals court declined to provide emergency relief to the Trump administration and pause the district court's order, leading the Trump administration to seek the Supreme Court's intervention.",
      "\"So long as the order is in effect, the secretary must permit hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan nationals to remain in the country, notwithstanding her reasoned determination that doing so is 'contrary to the national interest,'\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the administration's emergency appeal with the high court.",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, DHS's assistant secretary for public affairs, called the high court's ruling a \"win for the American people and the safety of our communities.\"",
      "Congress in 1990 created the program that allows the federal government to provide temporary immigration protections for migrants from countries experiencing wars, natural disasters or other \"extraordinary and temporary\" conditions that make it dangerous to send deportees there. The program allows beneficiaries to apply for renewable work permits and deportation deferrals.",
      "During the Biden administration, then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas designated Venezuela for the Temporary Protected Status program, citing \"extraordinary and temporary\" conditions that prevented Venezuelans in the U.S. from returning to their home country. Mayorkas extended the designation, set to last 18 months, in October 2023.",
      "In addition to designating Venezuela for TPS, the Biden administration also created or expanded programs for Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti and Ukraine. The Venezuelan program is the largest and covers roughly 600,000 people through two separate designations, though only the designation from 2023 is at issue in the case before the Supreme Court.",
      "After Mr. Trump took office for his second term, Noem vacated the extension for more than 350,000 Venezuelans, finding that it was \"contrary to the national interest\" to continue the program. The termination was set to take effect April 7. The Trump administration is also revoking TPS protections for tens of thousands of Haitians, with that move set to take effect in August.",
      "TPS beneficiaries and the National TPS Alliance filed a lawsuit in February challenging Noem's decision to end the protections for Venezuelans, and U.S. District Judge Edward Chen ruled in their favor, stopping Noem's termination determination from taking effect nationwide.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, Sauer said the district court's order \"wrested control of the nation's immigration policy away from the Executive Branch and imposed the court's own perception.\"",
      "\"The district court's decision undermines the Executive Branch's inherent powers as to immigration and foreign affairs,\" he wrote, calling the lower court's injunction \"ill-considered.\"",
      "But in response to the request, lawyers for TPS beneficiaries told the Supreme Court in a filing that lifting the district court's injunction would harm the nearly 350,000 people who would immediately lose their right to live and work in the U.S.",
      "\"Staying the district court's order would cause far more harm than it would stop,\" they wrote. \"It would radically shift the status quo, stripping plaintiffs of their legal status and requiring them to return to a country the State Department still deems too dangerous even to visit.\"",
      "They said that the TPS statute does not grant the Homeland Security secretary authority to vacate or rescind an extension, and Noem's terminations of TPS extensions for Venezuela and Haiti were the first and second times that a secretary has set an extension aside in the statute's history.",
      "The request for emergency relief from the Trump administration is one of more than a dozen involving Mr. Trump's second-term agenda that has landed before the Supreme Court, and one of several involving his immigration plans.",

      "Mahdawi said he has \"conflicting feelings\" about his time at Columbia, citing the war in Gaza and the continued detention of fellow Columbia activist Mahmoud Khalil. He was also critical of Columbia's handling of his case, saying the school \"let me down\" by not offering him more protection. CBS News has reached out to Columbia for comment.",

      "What to know about Mohsen Mahdawi's case",
      "Mahdawi was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in Vermont in mid-April after arriving for what he was told was a citizenship interview. A day beforehand, he told CBS News he feared the appointment was a \"honey trap.\" He remained in immigration custody for just over two weeks, until U.S. District Judge Geoffrey Crawford ordered his release earlier this month.",
      "Despite his release, Mahdawi's case remains active as a judge reviews the issue.",
      "The Trump administration is seeking to deport Mahdawi under a law that allows the government to revoke visas if the secretary of state believes somebody's presence in the U.S. poses \"serious adverse foreign policy consequences.\" Mahdawi argues his detention violated the First Amendment by punishing him for protesting.",
      "The administration has also accused Mahdawi of \"threatening rhetoric and intimidation of pro-Israeli bystanders,\" which he has denied, telling CBS News last month, \"antisemitism has no place in our movement.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News a week after his release, Mahdawi called the government's argument for detaining him \"laughable\": \"A person who has been vocally advocating for justice and peace is undermining U.S. policy?\" he said.",
      "Mahdawi is one of several students to face detention after their involvement in pro-Palestinian activism, with the government often citing the \"foreign policy consequences\" law.",
      "Another Columbia University student, Mahmoud Khalil, still remains in custody in Louisiana after he was detained on March 8, as the Trump administration pushes for his deportation and he sues for his release. And Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk was released earlier this month at the orders of a federal judge, over a month after her detention \u2014 which her lawyers say was prompted by nothing more than an op-ed that she co-wrote in the campus newspaper.",
      "Shortly after the commencement, Mahdawi spoke at a vigil for other students who have faced immigration scrutiny, including Khalil and Rajani Srinivasan, yet another Columbia student who self-deported to Canada after her visa was revoked.",

      "But, speaking to reporters on Monday, Mr. Trump raised questions about how long his predecessor had cancer. \"I'm surprised that it wasn't you know, the public wasn't notified a long time ago,\" he said. \"Because to get to stage 9, it's a long time. I just had my physical ... I think that test is standard to pretty much anybody getting a physical.\" Biden is 82 years old, and regular testing over the age of 75 is somewhat controversial because of a belief that screening could do more harm than good, and prostate cancers are often slow-growing at that point, CBS News medical contributor Dr. Celine Gounder says.",
      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris said she and her husband, Doug Emhoff, were saddened to hear about Biden's diagnosis.",
      "\"We are keeping him, Dr. Biden, and their entire family in our hearts and prayers during this time,\" she wrote in a social media post. \"Joe is a fighter \u2014 and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership. We are hopeful for a full and speedy recovery.\"",

      "Vance also said a conversation needs to be had over whether Biden was \"capable of doing the job\" when he was in office, although there has been no indication Biden had symptoms while president.",
      "\"You can separate the desire for him to have the right health outcome with the recognition that whether it was doctors or whether there were staffers around the former president, I don't think he was able to do a good job for the American people,\" Vance said. \"And that's not politics. That's not because I disagreed with him on policy. That's because I don't think that he was in good enough health. In some ways I blame him less than I blame the people around him.\"",
      "Former President Barack Obama, for whom Biden served as vice president, said Sunday, \"Michelle and I are thinking of the entire Biden family.

Over his decades of public service, Joe comforted so many of us in tough times and contributed so much to fighting cancer. Now we need to support and encourage him. Joe Biden has always been a fighter, and I know that won't change as he confronts this disease head-on. Joe's faith and family have brought him through tough challenges before and will again. Our prayers are with him and his family as he begins treatment.\"",

    "summary": "House Republicans plan to vote this week on legislation containing President Trump's second term agenda, including border and tax cut provisions.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans plan to move ahead with a vote this week on the legislation containing President Trump's second term agenda, which includes spending on tax cuts, as well as border security and defense priorities. Fractures in the GOP conference appeared to persist, despite the legislation's movement out of committee, throwing its passage into question. President Trump is expected to make a personal visit to House Republicans Tuesday to urge them to back the bill, a source familiar with the planning confirmed.",
      "\"There's a lot more work to do,\" House Speaker Mike Johson told reporters late Sunday. \"But I'm looking forward to very thoughtful discussions, very productive discussions, over the next few days \u2014 and I'm absolutely convinced we're going to get this in final form and pass it.\"",
      "After the final three committees advanced their portions of the massive legislative package last week, a handful of conservative hardliners on the House Budget Committee blocked the package from moving forward Friday. The setback prompted work through the weekend to negotiate with the holdouts, who ultimately allowed the legislation to advance late Sunday.",
      "House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington called it a \"critical step,\" while acknowledging that deliberations are continuing, with disagreements remaining on a cap on the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, and on when Medicaid work requirements would take effect. But Arrington said the vote to advance the legislation Sunday \"is a sign that people are confident that these things will be resolved.\"",
      "Reps. Chip Roy of Texas and Ralph Norman of South Carolina, two of the conservative holdouts, celebrated a change they said would be made to remove delays from the Medicaid work requirements, since conservatives opposed the original plan, which would have delayed until 2029 work requirements for childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities. But Roy noted in a post on social media that \"the bill does not yet meet the moment,\" pointing to remaining sticking points on cutting clean energy subsidies implemented under the Biden administration and cuts to the federal share of payments for Medicaid.",
      "Johnson suggested that he and the conservatives had agreed to \"minor modifications\" over the weekend. The speaker is walking a tightrope between the hardliners demanding more cuts and moderates who are reluctant to slash Medicaid, while a number of Republicans who represent blue states have also threatened to withhold their votes unless their demands are met on SALT, among other divisions.",
      "On Monday, Johnson told reporters that there have been \"lots of discussions\" with the various members of different GOP caucuses, adding that nothing has been \"ultimately and finally decided\" as Republican leaders look to build consensus around the ideas.",
      "\"I told all the members on a conference call this morning that this is a consensus-building operation, it's been a bottom-up process,\" Johnson said. \"And we're almost there.\"",
      "The legislation is set to go before the House Rules Committee on Wednesday at 1 a.m., where any changes to the legislation would be made. But Roy and Norman also sit on the Rules Committee and could raise a final hurdle there ahead of the full House vote. Should the package advance out of the Rules Committee, it would tee up a vote on the package on Thursday, before lawmakers are set to leave town for the Memorial Day recess.",
      "As Republican leadership irons out the remaining issues, President Trump is expected to continue to pressure Republicans to get the bill passed this week, as he did on Friday on social media. And on Tuesday morning.",
      "Meanwhile, the legislation is expected to face some resistance in the Senate, where a number of Republicans have warned that should the House pass the bill, the upper chamber will try to make changes.",
      "Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, told reporters late last week that the House bill \"would not pass in the Senate, and I think there's plenty of us that would vote against it.\" And Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters that \"we've assumed all along that the Senate would have its input on this.\"",
      "Johnson said on Fox News Sunday that \"the package that we send over there will be one that was very carefully negotiated and delicately balanced, and we hope that they don't make many modifications to it because that will ensure its passage quickly.\"",
      "Beyond the self-imposed deadlines, the inclusion of a debt limit increase in the package has added urgency to getting the legislation to the president's desk. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged Congress earlier this month to address the debt limit by mid July, warning that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August without action. And top administration and congressional leaders have circled July 4 as the deadline to get the package to the president desk.",
      "\"We've got to get this done and get it to the president's desk by that big celebration on Independence Day,\" Johnson said. \"I'm convinced that we can.\"",

    "summary": "The Senate is trying again to take a key procedural vote Monday evening on a first-of-its-kind crypto regulation bill after Democrats tanked it earlier this month.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate is expected to take a key procedural vote Monday evening on a crypto regulation bill after Democratic opposition tanked an initial attempt to advance the measure earlier this month amid concern over ties between the digital asset industry and the Trump family.",
      "The first-of-its-kind legislation, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins \u2014 a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. After the measure advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee with bipartisan support in March, Senate GOP leadership first brought the measure to the floor earlier this month. But the measure had lost Democratic support in the intervening weeks amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune said the upper chamber would try again to advance the legislation on Monday, while criticizing Democrats for blocking the measure from moving forward earlier this month, saying \"this bill reflects the bipartisan consensus on this issue, and it's had an open and bipartisan process since the very beginning.\"",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, argued that Senate Democrats \"inexplicably chose to block this legislation\" earlier this month, while adding that \"I'm hoping that the second time will be the charm.\"",
      "Since the failed vote earlier this month, negotiators returned to the table. And ahead of the procedural vote Monday, the measure saw backing from at least one Democrat as Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia advocated for the measure, calling it a \"meaningful step forward,\" though he added that it's \"not perfect.\"",
      "\"The stablecoin market has reached nearly $250 billion and the U.S. can't afford to keep standing on the sidelines,\" Warner said in a statement. \"We need clear rules of the road to protect consumers, defend national security, and support responsible innovation.\"",
      "Still, Warner pointed to concerns he said are shared among many senators about the Trump family's \"use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,\" after it was announced earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial.",
      "Warner said senators \"have a duty to shine a light on these abuses,\" but he argued \"we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has been among the leading voices advocating for adding anti-corruption reforms to the legislation. Warren has outlined a handful of issues with the bill, saying that it puts consumers at risk and enables corruption. In a speech Monday on the Senate floor, Warren said her concerns have not been addressed and urged her colleagues to vote against the updated version.",
      "\"While a strong stablecoin bill is the best possible outcome, this weak bill is worse than no bill at all,\" Warren said. \"A bill that meaningfully strengthens oversight of the stablecoin market is worth enacting. A bill that turbocharges the stablecoin market, while facilitating the president's corruption and undermining national security, financial stability, and consumer protection is worse than no bill at all.\"",
      "Whether the measure can advance in the upper chamber this time around remains to be seen. The measure fell short of the 60 votes necessary to move forward earlier this month, with all Senate Democrats and two Republicans \u2014 Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri \u2014 opposing. Paul has reservations about overregulation, while Hawley voted against the bill in part because it doesn't prohibit big tech companies from creating their own stablecoins.",
      "Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who sponsored the legislation, defended the measure on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Monday. He outlined that a lack of regulatory framework, which the bill would provide, makes for uncertainty \u2014 and results in innovative technology moving offshore. The Tennessee Republicans urged that \"this will fix it,\" while arguing that the bill has strong bipartisan support.",
      "\"We have broad policy agreement, Democrats and Republicans,\" Hagerty said. \"The question is can we get past the partisan politics and allow us to actually have a victory.\"",

    "summary": "Republican tax bill could cost $3.8 trillion over 10 years as its tax cuts surpass spending reductions, according to one analysis.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican-backed tax and spending bill that's now moving forward in the House is getting a reality check from Wall Street. That's because the proposed tax breaks are projected to far outstrip any savings in the bill, potentially leading to mounting U.S. debt and a worsening fiscal outlook, according to economists and policy experts.",
      "If the bill moves forward without significant changes, the U.S. would likely find its debt levels spiraling higher in order to finance the tax cuts, according to several analyses. Over the next decade, the GOP bill could cost the U.S. $3.8 trillion, according to a report\u00a0earlier this month by the Joint Committee on Taxation that examined the impact of the the tax measures versus spending cuts.",
      "Those risks are rattling Wall Street. Moody's Ratings on Friday\u00a0downgraded the nation's debt, citing the potential for the new bill to add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit, which excludes interest payments, over the next decade.",
      "The bill also faces detractors within the Republican party, with the House Freedom Caucus saying in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0on Sunday that the bill \"fails to actually honor our promise to significantly correct the spending trajectory of the federal government and lead our nation towards a balanced budget.\"",
      "The concern, according to both Wall Street economists and policy experts, is that adding billions in debt to the U.S. ledger could eventually squeeze federal spending because the nation would likely face higher interest payments. That, in turn, could make it more difficult to fund programs like Social Security, which is already facing a financial drawdown as baby boomers hit retirement age, or to invest in initiatives like infrastructure that can spur economic growth.",
      "\"It's time for policymakers to hit pause, go back to the drawing board and put forward a plan that actually takes steps toward putting our nation on a sustainable fiscal trajectory,\" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a public policy think tank, in an email.",
      "She added, \"Our federal interest payments are skyrocketing, already surpassing what we spend annually on defense or Medicare.\"",
      "The Trump administration said it disagreed both with the Moody's analysis and forecasts that the legislation could widen the nation's deficit, which is the gap between federal spending and revenue.",
      "\"This bill does not add to the deficit,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Monday in a press conference. \"In fact, according to the Council of Economic Advisers, there's $1.6 trillion worth of savings in this bill \u2014 that's the largest saving for any legislation that has ever passed Capitol Hill in our nation's history.\"",
      "Savings versus spending",
      "At the heart of the proposed GOP bill is President Trump's vow to renew his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which introduced lower tax brackets for many Americans. Because those provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025, about 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026 without an extension of the law,\u00a0according\u00a0to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "The Council of Economic Advisers, a White House agency that advises the president on economic issues,\u00a0said\u00a0in a May study that the new bill would \"avert a $4 trillion tax hike\" by extending the TCJA's provisions.",
      "Renewing the law's cuts alone would cost $2.2 trillion over the next decade, estimates Joint Committee on Taxation, which assesses the impact of policy for Congress. The GOP bill also includes other new tax breaks that would add to the bill's long-term costs, the group's analysis found.",
      "For instance, the bill's proposal to provide taxpayers with a more generous standard deduction would result in $1.3 trillion in lost revenue over the next decade, the Joint Committee found. Eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, as well as giving a bigger deduction to senior citizens, would cost an additional $234 billion over the same period, its analysis finds.",
      "The bill does include spending cuts, but they aren't large enough to offset the tax breaks, several recent analyses conclude. The nonpartisan Bipartisan Policy Center\u00a0estimatedin a May 14 analysis that the tax cuts would cost $7.7 trillion over the next decade, while the spending cuts would offset $3.9 trillion over the same period. The result is a gap of $3.8 trillion, it said.",
      "That's the arithmetic that prompted Moody's to cut its rating on U.S. debt, from its top rating of Aaa to Aa1. In its assessment, the credit rating agency noted that the U.S. deficit has spiraled higher as previous administrations and Congress have \"failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend.\"",
      "\"Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat,\" Moody's said on Friday when it became the third major rating agency to cut the nation's credit rating. \"In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher.\"",
      "It added, \"The U.S.' fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to its own past and compared to other highly rated sovereigns.\"",
      "The Trump administration says that the proposed tax bill will spur economic growth by lowering taxes on consumers and businesses. In an interview on Monday with Fox Business, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said the economy is \"going to continue to take off once those policies are actually in place, once we actually have the tax cuts passed.\"",
      "Who wins and loses",
      "The GOP tax bill remains in flux and is likely to change as it winds through the House.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged there are still details to \"iron out\" as conservative Republicans seek to quickly enact work requirements for able-bodied participants in Medicaid. Those rules would take effect in 2029 under the bill passed last week by the Ways and Means Committee. Some House Republicans also want to more quickly end tax breaks for green energy projects being used nationwide.",
      "If the bill passes the House this week, it would then move to the Senate, where Republicans are also eyeing changes.",
      "Democrats have decried the cuts Republicans are proposing to Medicaid and food stamps to offset the costs of the tax breaks, pointing out that the reductions in social safety net programs comes as many wealthy taxpayers would get a big tax break.",
      "\"This spending bill is terrible, and I think the American people know that,\" Rep. Jim Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina, told CNN's \"State of the Union\u2033 on Sunday. \"There is nothing wrong with us bringing the government in balance. But there is a problem when that balance comes on the back of working men and women. And that's what is happening here.\"",
      "The lowest-income Americans would end up paying more under the proposed GOP bill, according to a May 19\u00a0analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania group that studies the fiscal impact of public policies. Even including savings from tax cuts, the bottom 20%, who earn up to $17,000 per year, would take a $1,035 hit in 2026 after the reductions in Medicaid and other programs are factored in.",
      "\"[H]ouseholds most affected by the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP \u2014 those in the bottom income quintile \u2014 experience the largest losses under this bill, averaging $28,000 in lifetime value for the working-age population,\" the Penn Wharton Budget model calculated. \"In contrast, working-age households in the top income quintile generally benefit from lower taxes, gaining an average of $30,000.\"",

    "story": [
      "Former President Joe Biden's diagnosis\u00a0with an advanced stage of prostate cancer that has metastasized, or spread, to his bones prompted an outpouring of concern and questions about his condition. Those questions include how long the cancer may have taken to develop and whether he was screened for it during earlier checkups.",
      "While it's unclear exactly how long Biden has had cancer, its rapid spread is attributed to it being an aggressive form of the disease. His cancer was categorized as having a Gleason score of 9, which places him in Grade Group 5, the most severe category. The Gleason score is a system for grading the severity of prostate cancer based on analysis of cell samples under a microscope.",
      "When prostate cancer is more advanced and spreads, the bones are among the areas most likely to be affected. It\u00a0can also commonly spread to the lymph nodes, liver or lungs, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "Unfortunately, late-stage cancer diagnoses are not uncommon. A 2014 analysis from Cancer Research UK, for example, found that 46% of all cancers\u00a0in that country were diagnosed at an advanced stage. A\u00a02023 study published in the journal Lancet Oncology found disruptions in care amid the pandemic also led to an increase in late-stage diagnoses across nearly all cancer types, including prostate.",
      "Slower-growing cancers can take years to develop and be detected, while more aggressive ones can become apparent more rapidly and also spread to other parts of the body quicker.",
      "Biden, who is now 82, did not undergo prostate cancer screening during his last medical checkup while in office, in February 2024, according to records released at the time. Experts say this is likely due to that fact that these screenings are\u00a0not routinely recommended\u00a0for men 70 years or older.",
      "\"Doctors will stop screening for prostate cancer at 75 or so, because after that, the prostate cancers you typically pick up are very slow growing, and so the harms of all of the testing and treatment for something that may not kill you \u2014 you're talking about risk versus benefit. It may not be worth the risk,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, explained on \"CBS Mornings\" Monday.",
      "Instead, Biden's diagnosis came after he recently saw a doctor due to urinary symptoms. A small nodule was found in the prostate, which necessitated further evaluation, his office said last week.",
      "\"Urinary symptoms are quite common in older men and are usually due to benign conditions like having an enlarged prostate,\" Gounder said. In this case, however, the testing discovered cancer.",
      "Gounder said the situation underscores the importance of tailoring medical decisions to the individual.",
      "\"He had new symptoms and is functionally active, which justified a closer look,\" she said.",
      "There have been advancements in treating advanced prostate cancer, and Gounder said the treatment goal in a case like this would be to control the cancer, slowing its progression and preserving quality of life. Biden's type of cancer is hormone-sensitive, which means it should respond to a testosterone-blocking treatment, Gounder said, adding that this might be combined with other medications or chemotherapy, depending on the specific case.",
      "Back in 2019, Biden was diagnosed with benign enlargement of the prostate, or BPH. That December, his campaign released his medical evaluation, which noted: \"This patient has been treated for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). This was initially treated with medication and was then definitively treated with surgery. He has never had prostate cancer.\"",
      "BPH is very common in older men, with around 80% of men over 70 having it, according to Yale Medicine.",
      "How do doctors screen for prostate cancer?",
      "Prostate cancer testing typically involves two methods: a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, test and a digital rectal exam, or DRE. A PSA test is a type of blood test that can indicate a higher chance of prostate cancer but is not a definitive diagnosis. A DRE involves a doctor using a gloved finger to feel for any bumps on the prostate via the rectum.",
      "The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of national experts, say the decision on screening for prostate cancer among men aged 55 to 69 years should be an individual one \u2014 and it recommends against PSA screening for men 70 and older.",
      "\"Many men will experience potential harms of screening, including false-positive results that require additional testing and possible prostate biopsy; overdiagnosis and overtreatment; and treatment complications, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction,\" the task force's recommendation summary notes. \"Clinicians should not screen men who do not express a preference for screening.\"",
      "Prostate cancer is common, second only to skin cancer as the most common cancer affecting males, according to the\u00a0Cleveland Clinic. According to the\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for every 100 males, 13 will develop prostate cancer at some point in their lives.",

      "Babbitt's death was a rallying point for Trump loyalists and Capitol rioters who alleged police used unnecessary force in stopping the mob on Jan. 6. In the civil lawsuit, Babbitt's estate alleged U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd was negligent in the issue of force and his firearm. The suit also argued Byrd was not in uniform and was wearing a COVID mask when he opened fire against Babbitt. The suit accused Byrd of failing to \"de-escalate.\"",
      "\"Ashli was unarmed,\" the lawsuit said. \"Her hands were up in the air, empty, and in plain view of Lt. Byrd and other officers in the lobby. Ashli posed no threat to the safety of anyone.\"",
      "The case was initially filed in California and then transferred to the Washington, D.C., federal court in 2024 and was defended by the Justice Department under the Biden administration.",
      "Footage from Jan. 6 showed Babbitt trying to climb through a smashed window as the mob sought to breach the House Speaker's Lobby, where the counting of the electoral votes had been interrupted. Members of Congress were evacuating the area during the riot.",
      "In August 2021 internal review, the U.S. Capitol Police said Byrd saved lives and did not engage in misconduct.",

    "summary": "The U.S. Institute of Peace was created by Congress 40 years ago to promote conflict resolution and help prevent conflicts from developing.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Monday blocked the Trump administration's efforts to take over the U.S. Institute of Peace, finding that the moves led by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency were made by leaders who were illegally installed and lacked the legal authority to dismantle the organization.",
      "U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell ruled in favor of several institute board members and its president, who had been fired and challenged their terminations, as well as the administration's efforts to take over and disassemble the organization. The institute's mission is to promote conflict resolution and the prevention of conflict around the world.",
      "The five board members who challenged their removals are Ambassador John Sullivan, Judy Ansley, Joseph Falk, Kerry Kennedy and Mary Swig. The institute's president, Ambassador George Moose, was also ousted by ex officio board members Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Kenneth Jackson was then installed as the acting president of the Institute of Peace.",
      "In March, Howell declined to issue emergency relief to the Institute of Peace, but said that it was \"undisputed\" that the removal of board members was not in accordance with federal law, though the plaintiffs at the time were unable to make the required showing for a temporary restraining order.",
      "But in a 102-page decision granting the former board members request to summarily rule in their favor, Howell wrote that President Trump \"second-guessed the judgment of Congress and President Reagan in creating USIP 40 years ago, and the judgment of every Congress since then, including in 2024,\" when he signed an executive order that effectively dismantled the Institute.",
      "Howell said the purported firings of Institute of Peace board members and its president, Moose, was unlawful and ordered that they remain in their roles. The judge also found that the appointments of Jackson and Nate Cavanaugh as president of the institute are invalid, and said any actions taken by them are voided, including Cavanaugh's efforts to transfer the organization's headquarters to the General Services Administration.",
      "Howell blocked DOGE officials from gaining access to or exercising control over the U.S. Institute of Peace's offices, facilities, computer systems or other records.",
      "In her ruling, the judge criticized Trump and DOGE, writing they \"used brute force and threats of criminal process to take over USIP's headquarters, despite being cautioned that this organization did not fall within the executive branch and its leadership was not subject to the president's unilateral executive branch removal power.\"",
      "The judge said that the Elon Musk-led DOGE's firing of Institute of Peace Board members, staff, and contractors, as well as its shifting of the building to be used for other purposes was unlawful.",
      "\"This administration then went even further, taking severe actions to dissemble USIP, including terminating its appointed board members, its expert management, its dedicated staff and contractors located in both Washington, D.C. and around the world, and dispersing its assets and headquarters building,\" Howell wrote. \"These actions against USIP were unlawful.\"",
      "The judge said that Article II of the Constitution places limits on the president's ability to remove executive branch subordinates, and said Mr. Trump's actions regarding the Institute of Peace were outside his legal authority.",
      "\"The president's efforts here to take over an organization outside of those bounds, contrary to statute established by Congress and by acts of force and threat using local and federal law enforcement officers, represented a gross usurpation of power and a way of conducting government affairs that unnecessarily traumatized the committed leadership and employees of USIP, who deserved better,\" Howell wrote.",
      "The U.S. Institute of Peace is one of several entities that has been targeted by the president and DOGE as part of his efforts to severely slash the size of the federal government. The organization was created by Congress four decades ago through a law signed by President Ronald Reagan and is characterized as an independent nonprofit corporation.",
      "But the administration has winnowed the institute's staff to five employees, and it has ceased conducting programmatic activities. The U.S. Institute of Peace's assets have also been transferred to the General Services Administration. Its Washington, D.C., headquarters is in the process of being leased to the Department of Labor, according to court records.",
      "The dispute between DOGE and the Institute of Peace started in mid-March, when DOGE team members attempted to gain access to the entity's Washington, D.C., headquarters. The institute said in a statement that several DOGE members arrived at its building \"unannounced\" and were accompanied by two FBI agents. DOGE officials left after being rebuffed by an Institute employee but later returned and had \"broken\" into the building and were able to access internal systems through a former security contractor for the building, court filings revealed.",
      "The Metropolitan Police Department became involved when the institute's former outside counsel reported what he said was an unlawful entry by DOGE officials.",
      "In their lawsuit, the institute's fired board members said employees with a former security contractor and DOGE personnel \"engaged in additional attempts to unlawfully access the USIP headquarters building, but were eventually able to enter the building, forcibly occupy it, and expel including the duly appointed USIP President, other USIP personnel, and outside counsel.\"",

      "But in this case, Biden's office said his symptoms led to a prostate exam that resulted in the discovery of a small nodule. Further testing determined it was cancerous.",
      "Some urologists were surprised that the 82-year-old underwent prostate cancer screening at all, according to Dr. Gounder, because routine screening in men over 75 is controversial. Many prostate cancers at that age are slow-growing, and overtreatment can do more harm than good, she said.",
      "Prior to the diagnosis, Biden had received a clean bill of health during a February 2024 physical, in which he was declared \"fit to serve\" while still in office.",
      "His situation underscores the importance of tailoring medical decisions to the individual, Gounder says. The former president had new symptoms and is functionally active, which justified a closer look.",
      "Gleason score and what bone metastasis means",
      "Gleason scores are a grading system for prostate cancer, according to the\u00a0Cleveland Clinic. Pathologists grade each tissue sample on a 1 to 5 scale. The lower the grade, the more cancer cells look like normal cells.",
      "Each area of prostate cancer may have a different grade, so pathologists pick the two areas that make up most of the cancer. They add the two areas' grades to come up with a Gleason score, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "Biden had a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5), which is determined by the pathologist who looked at cells under a microscope.",
      "A score of 9 is the second highest on the scale, which goes to 10. For scores 8, 9 and 10, the \"cells look very different from healthy cells, which is called poorly differentiated or undifferentiated,\" the Cleveland Clinic said.",
      "The categorization suggests a poor prognosis without intervention, Gounder said, but there are treatment options available that can help.",
      "Moreover, Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis came with the presence of bone metastases, meaning the disease has spread. It places him within the high/very high-risk management group.",
      "Is prostate cancer curable?",
      "Prostate cancer is often curable if it's identified and treated early, and many medical advancements have been made in recent years that can help with more severe cases.",
      "\"The good news is that prostate cancer actually has a lot of effective treatments, and so patients even who are diagnosed with more aggressive, more advanced stage disease can live many years and have good quality of life,\" said Dr. Tanya Dorff, an oncologist who treats prostate and other genitourinary cancers at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Los Angeles.",
      "In Biden's case \u2014 given his age and health \u2014 the goal isn't to cure the disease but to control it, to slow progression and preserve quality of life, Gounder said. Since the former president is reportedly in good functional health, more aggressive treatment is on the table. But these decisions always weigh the benefits against the potential risks and side effects, based on the individual's overall condition and priorities.",
      "While Biden's diagnosis represents a more aggressive form of prostate cancer, his office said the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive. This means the cancer should respond to testosterone-blocking treatment, since testosterone fuels prostate cancer growth, Gounder explained.",
      "Based on what is known about his diagnosis, the primary treatment would be to block testosterone with a medication like Lupron, she said. This might be combined with other hormone therapies like Zytiga, or even chemotherapy, depending on the specific case.",
      "Bone-targeted treatments are also part of the strategy when the cancer has spread to the skeleton, Gounder added.",
      "Biden is among an estimated 313,780 new cases of prostate cancer that will be diagnosed in the U.S. this year, according to the American Cancer Society's Cancer Facts & Figures. Approximately 35,770 of them (11%) will die from the disease this year, the organization said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-medicaid-social-services-housing-nutrition/",
    "published": "Mon, 19 May 2025 06:53:37 -0400",
    "summary": "About half of states have broadened Medicaid, the state-federal low-income health care program, to pay for social services such as housing and nutritional support.",
    "story": [
      "During his first administration, President Trump's top health officials gave North Carolina permission to use Medicaid money for social services not traditionally covered by health insurance. It was a first-in-the-nation experiment to funnel health care money into housing, nutrition, and other social services.",
      "Some poor and disabled Medicaid patients became eligible for benefits, including security deposits and first month's rent for housing, rides to medical appointments, wheelchair ramps, and even prescriptions for fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "Such experimental initiatives to improve the health of vulnerable Americans while saving taxpayers on costly medical procedures and expensive emergency room care are booming nationally. Without homes or healthy food, people risk getting sicker, becoming homeless, and experiencing even more trouble controlling chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.",
      "Former President Joe Biden encouraged states to go big on new benefits, and the availability of social services exploded in states red and blue. Since North Carolina's launch, at least 24 other states have followed by expanding social service benefits covered by Medicaid, the health care program for low-income and disabled Americans \u2014 a national shift that's turning a system focused on sick care into one that prioritizes prevention. And though Mr. Trump was pivotal to the expansion, he's now reversing course regardless of whether evidence shows it works.",
      "In Mr. Trump's second term, his administration is throwing participating states from California to Arkansas into disarray, arguing that social services should not be paid for by government health insurance. Officials at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which grants states permission to experiment, have rescinded its previous broad directive, arguing that the Biden administration went too far.",
      "\"This administration believes that the health-related social needs guidance distracted the Medicaid program from its core mission: providing excellent health outcomes for vulnerable Americans,\" CMS spokesperson Catherine Howden said in a statement.",
      "\"This decision prevents the draining of resources from Medicaid for potentially duplicative services that are already provided by other well-established federal programs, including those that have historically focused on food insecurity and affordable housing,\" Howden added, referring to food stamps and low-income housing vouchers provided through other government agencies.",
      "Mr. Trump, however, has also proposed axing funding for low-income housing and food programs administered by agencies including the departments of Housing and Urban Development and Agriculture \u2014 on top of Republican proposals for broader Medicaid cuts.",
      "The pullback has led to chaos and confusion in states that have expanded their Medicaid programs, with both liberal and conservative leaders worried that the shift will upend multibillion-dollar investments already underway. Social problems such as homelessness and food insecurity can cause \u2014 or worsen \u2014 physical and behavioral health conditions, leading to sky-high health care spending. Medical care delivered in hospitals and clinics, for instance, accounts for only roughly 15% of a person's overall health, while a staggering 85% is influenced by social factors such as access to healthy food and shelter for sleep, said Anthony Iton, a policy expert on social determinants of health.",
      "Health care experts warn the disinvestment will come at a price.",
      "\"It will just lead to more death, more suffering, and higher health care costs,\" said Margot Kushel, a primary care doctor in San Francisco and a leading researcher on homelessness and health care.",
      "The Trump administration announced in a March 4 memo that it was rescinding Biden-era guidance dramatically expanding experimental benefits known as health-related social needs. Federal waivers are required for states to use Medicaid funds for most nontraditional social services outside of hospitals and clinics.",
      "Last month, the administration told states that these services, which can also include high-speed internet and storage units, should not be part of Medicaid.",
      "Future waiver requests allowing Medicaid to provide social services \u2014 a liberal philosophy \u2014 will be considered on a \"case-by-case basis,\" the administration said. Rather, it has signaled a conservative shift toward requiring most Medicaid beneficiaries to prove that they're working or trying to find jobs, which puts an estimated 36 million Americans at risk of losing their health coverage.",
      "\"What they're arguing is Medicaid has been expanded far beyond basic health care and it needs to be cut back to provide only basic coverage to those most desperately in need,\" said Mark Peterson, a health policy expert at UCLA. \"They're making the case, which is not widely shared by specialists in the health care field, that it's not the job of taxpayers and Medicaid to pay for all this stuff outside the traditional heath care system.\"",
      "Although states have not received formal guidance to end their social experiments, Peterson and other health policy researchers expect the administration not to renew waivers, which typically run in five-year intervals. Worse, legal experts say programs underway could be halted early.",
      "Evidence supporting social investments by Medicaid is still nascent. An expansion in Massachusetts that provided food benefits reduced ER visits and hospitalizations, for instance. But often, it's a mixed bag.",
      "California is going the biggest, investing $12 billion over five years to provide a slew of new services, from intensive case management to help people with severe behavioral health conditions to housing and food assistance through a pair of federal waivers. The most popular benefits provided by health insurers are those that help homeless people on Medicaid by placing them in apartments or securing beds in recovery homes, covering up to $5,000 for security deposits, and preventing eviction.",
      "Since the CalAIM program launched in 2022, it has served only a small fraction of the state's nearly 15 million Medicaid beneficiaries, with roughly 577,000 referrals for benefits. Yet it has improved and even saved the lives of some of those lucky enough to get help, including Eric Jones, a 65-year-old Los Angeles resident.",
      "\"When I got diabetes, I didn't know what to do and I had a hard time getting to my medical appointments,\" said Jones, who lost his housing this year when his mom died but received services through his Medi-Cal insurer, L.A. Care. \"My case manager got me rides to my appointments and also helped me get into an apartment.\"",
      "California is considering making some of its social services permanent after the CalAIM waivers expire at the end of 2026. Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration is adding more housing services, including up to six months of free rent under a third waiver approved by the Biden administration. Medi-Cal officials contended early evidence shows CalAIM has led to better care coordination and fewer hospital and ER visits.",
      "\"We are fully committed,\" said Susan Philip, a deputy director for the state Department of Health Care Services, which administers the program. \"We have invested so much.\"",
      "Health insurers, which deliver Medicaid coverage and receive greater funding to cover these additional benefits, say they're worried the Trump administration will end or curtail the programs. \"If we do things the same old way, we're just going to generate the same old results \u2014 people getting sicker and health care costs continuing to rise,\" said Charles Bacchi, president and CEO of the California Association of Health Plans, which represents insurers.",
      "Industry leaders say the expansion is already changing lives.",
      "\"We believe wholeheartedly that housing is health, food is health, so seeing these programs disappear would be devastating,\" said Kelly Bruno-Nelson, executive director of Medi-Cal for CalOptima Health, a health insurance provider in Orange County.",
      "Oregon is also providing low-income Medicaid patients with a range of new services, including home-delivered healthy meals and rental payment assistance. Residents can even qualify for air conditioners, heaters, air filters, power generators, and mini fridges. State Medicaid officials say they remain committed to providing the benefits but worry about federal cuts.",
      "\"Climate change and housing instability are huge indicators of poor health,\" said Josh Balloch, vice president of health policy and communications at AllCare Health, a Medicaid insurer in Oregon. \"We hope to prove to the federal government that this is a good return on their investment.\"",
      "But even as the Trump administration curtails waivers, it is retaining discretion to provide social services in Medicaid, just on a smaller scale. Supporters say it's fair to scrutinize where to draw the line on taxpayer spending, arguing that there isn't always a direct health connection.",
      "\"We're seeing these things increase, with the free rent, and we're seeing some states pay for free internet, paying for furniture,\" said Kody Kinsley, who previously served as North Carolina's top health official. \"We know there's evidence for food and housing, but with all of these new benefits, we need to look closely at the evidence and the linkage to what actually drives health.\"",
      "Current North Carolina officials say they're confident the new social services Medicaid provides in their state have resulted in better health and lower overall spending on expensive and acute care. Medicaid recipients there can even use the program to buy farm-fresh produce.",
      "While it's too soon to know whether these experiments have been effective elsewhere in the United States, early evidence in North Carolina shows promise: The state had saved $1,020 per participant a year into its experiment \u2014 operating in mostly rural counties \u2014 by reducing ER trips and hospitalizations.",
      "State health officials also touted the economic benefits of driving business to family farms, home improvement contractors, and community-based organizations providing housing and social services.",
      "\"I welcome the challenge of demonstrating the effectiveness of our programs. It's making for healthier people and healthier budgets,\" said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina's Medicaid program. \"Family farms that were on the verge of collapse after Hurricane Helene are now benefiting from a steady income while they also serve their community.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's domestic policy bill cleared another hurdle in the House late Sunday after\u00a0conservatives rebelled Friday\u00a0over concerns the legislation does not contain steep enough spending cuts.",
      "The opposition stalled the bill while negotiations with Republican leadership carried through the weekend to try to get conservatives on board, culminating with the House Budget Committee scheduling a second vote late Sunday to move it one step closer to a floor vote before the lower chamber's self-imposed Memorial Day deadline.",
      "Four conservative holdouts \u2014 Reps. Chip Roy of Texas, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Andrew Clyde of Georgia \u2014 this time voted present instead of against the legislation, allowing it to advance in a vote where 17 members were in favor and 16 were opposed.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Sunday night that \"talks have gone great\" and there will be some \"minor modifications\" made to the legislation. He called Sunday's outcome \"a big win.\"",
      "Johnson has remained committed to putting the legislation, which would extend tax cuts from Mr. Trump's first term while temporarily ending taxes on tips and overtime, on the floor before Memorial Day, despite some factions in his party being unhappy with the bill as it was originally written. The tax measures, as well as increased spending on the military and border security, would be offset partly by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and clean energy subsidies.",
      "The legislation's next stop is the Rules Committee, which can make updates to the package. The Budget Committee was responsible for stitching together the various parts of the reconciliation package into a single bill, and could not make modifications. Johnson said he expected the Rules Committee to take it up Tuesday or Wednesday to tee it up for a floor vote, which could happen Thursday.",
      "However, the legislation, which Mr. Trump refers to as the \"big, beautiful bill\" is not yet in the clear.",
      "Conservatives have taken issue with the bill's failure to install work requirements for childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities before 2029. They also want to end clean energy subsidies that were implemented under the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law by former President Joe Biden.",
      "A provision on the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, is facing pushback from a group of Republicans from blue states, who have threatened to derail its passage if their demands aren't met. It's also likely to run into other obstacles in the Senate.",
      "\"We've always acknowledged that towards the end, there will be more details to iron out,\" Johnson said. \"We have several more to take care of, but I'm looking forward to very thoughtful discussions, very productive discussions over the next few days. And I'm absolutely convinced we're going to get this in final form and pass it in accordance with our original deadline.\"",
      "On Friday, five Republicans on the Budget Committee voted against advancing the bill, including the four who voted present on Sunday and Rep. Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania. Smucker said his \"no\" vote was a procedural move to be able bring up the legislation again once their issues were resolved.",
      "Roy told reporters after Sunday's vote that \"there's a lot more work to do this week.\" Norman echoed the sentiment, adding that progress was made on Medicaid work requirements and subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act.",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the intelligence community is incorrect in its assessment that Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua is not a proxy force of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government \u2014 an argument that has served as a justification for the Trump administration's swift deportation of suspected gang members.",
      "\"They're wrong,\" Rubio said of the intelligence community assessment on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The National Intelligence Council determined in a report that the Venezuelan government does not direct Tren de Aragua, contradicting the Trump administration's claims used to invoke the Alien Enemies Act, which gives it the power to swiftly remove migrants it identifies as members of the gang. The memo was released under the Freedom of Information Act following a request by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.",
      "\"While Venezuela's permissive environment enables TDA to operate, the Maduro regime probably does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA and is not directing TDA movement to and operations in the United States,\" the report says.",
      "The question of whether the Maduro government controls Tren de Aragua is at the center of a clash over the Trump administration's ability to continue to deport suspected gang members under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. In a March proclamation, President Trump invoked the act, which had only been invoked three previous times in U.S. history, treating suspected gang members like wartime enemies of the U.S. government. Mr. Trump had previously designated Tren de Aragua as a terrorist organization, along with MS-13 and other gangs and cartels.",
      "Shortly after the March proclamation was signed, the administration used the Alien Enemies Act to remove more than 200 men, mostly Venezuelans, to a prison in El Salvador. An analysis by \"60 Minutes\" found that 75% of the Venezuelans deported had no criminal history.",
      "The move has sparked significant clashes with the federal courts, as the administration has pursued the swift apprehension and removal of Venezuelan nationals deemed alien enemies. On Friday, the Supreme Court said it would continue to block the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan men detained in northern Texas while they pursue a challenge to their removals under the wartime Alien Enemies Act, maintaining an April directive.",
      "Last week, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard fired the two top officials who were leading the National Intelligence Council, Mike Collins, acting chair of National Intelligence Council, and his deputy, Maria Lagan-Riekhof, CBS News confirmed. NBC News reported those were the officials who oversaw the Tren de Aragua memo.",
      "Rubio refuted the National Intelligence Council report, while pointing to an FBI assessment that he said he agrees with. He outlined that not only is Tren de Aragua \"exported by the Venezuelan regime,\" but that there are warnings that it's also a terror organization that's \"already been operationalized\" to target an opposition member of another country.",
      "\"The FBI agrees that not only is Tren de Aragua exported by the Venezuelan regime, but in fact, if you go back and see a Tren de Aragua member, all the evidence is there, and it's growing every day, was actually contracted to murder an opposition member, I believe, in Chile a few months ago,\" Rubio said.",
      "Asked whether he completely rejects the intelligence community's findings, Rubio said he agrees \"100%\" with the FBI's findings. The FBI is overseen by the Trump administration's Justice Department.",
      "Rubio said \"this is a prison gang that the Venezuelan government has actively encouraged to leave the country,\" claiming that in some cases, \"they've been in cooperation.\" He added that suspected Tren de Aragua members who have been returned to Venezuela have been \"greeted like heroes\" at the airport.",
      "\"There's no doubt in our mind, and in my mind, and in the FBI's assessment that this is a group that the regime in Venezuela uses, not just to try to destabilize the United States, but to project power, like they did by murdering a member of the opposition in Chile,\" Rubio said.",

Both countries have provided aid to Syria, and Saudi Arabia has offered to pay off some of the country's debts, two activities that could run afoul of sanctions.

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it will let the Trump administration end the Temporary Protected Status program protecting roughly 350,000 Venezuelan migrants from the threat of deportation while legal proceedings over the move continue.",
      "The high court granted the administration's request to lift for now a lower court's injunction that blocked Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's revocation of the Temporary Protected Status program, or TPS, for Venezuelans. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said she would deny the administration's bid for emergency relief.",
      "Noem terminated the designation \u2014 which had been extended by the Biden administration \u2014 in February, a move that would have cleared the way for Venezuelans to lose their government-issued work permits and deportations protections on April 7. But a federal judge in California blocked the action in late March and said her decision to terminate the TPS program for the Venezuelan migrants appeared to be \"predicated on negative stereotypes\" and may have been motivated by unconstitutional animus.",
      "A federal appeals court declined to provide emergency relief to the Trump administration and pause the district court's order, leading the Trump administration to seek the Supreme Court's intervention.",
      "\"So long as the order is in effect, the secretary must permit hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan nationals to remain in the country, notwithstanding her reasoned determination that doing so is 'contrary to the national interest,'\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the administration's emergency appeal with the high court.",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, DHS's assistant secretary for public affairs, called the high court's ruling a \"win for the American people and the safety of our communities.\"",
      "Congress in 1990 created the program that allows the federal government to provide temporary immigration protections for migrants from countries experiencing wars, natural disasters or other \"extraordinary and temporary\" conditions that make it dangerous to send deportees there. The program allows beneficiaries to apply for renewable work permits and deportation deferrals.",
      "During the Biden administration, then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas designated Venezuela for the Temporary Protected Status program, citing \"extraordinary and temporary\" conditions that prevented Venezuelans in the U.S. from returning to their home country. Mayorkas extended the designation, set to last 18 months, in October 2023.",
      "In addition to designating Venezuela for TPS, the Biden administration also created or expanded programs for Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti and Ukraine. The Venezuelan program is the largest and covers roughly 600,000 people through two separate designations, though only the designation from 2023 is at issue in the case before the Supreme Court.",
      "After Mr. Trump took office for his second term, Noem vacated the extension for more than 350,000 Venezuelans, finding that it was \"contrary to the national interest\" to continue the program. The termination was set to take effect April 7. The Trump administration is also revoking TPS protections for tens of thousands of Haitians, with that move set to take effect in August.",
      "TPS beneficiaries and the National TPS Alliance filed a lawsuit in February challenging Noem's decision to end the protections for Venezuelans, and U.S. District Judge Edward Chen ruled in their favor, stopping Noem's termination determination from taking effect nationwide.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, Sauer said the district court's order \"wrested control of the nation's immigration policy away from the Executive Branch and imposed the court's own perception.\"",
      "\"The district court's decision undermines the Executive Branch's inherent powers as to immigration and foreign affairs,\" he wrote, calling the lower court's injunction \"ill-considered.\"",
      "But in response to the request, lawyers for TPS beneficiaries told the Supreme Court in a filing that lifting the district court's injunction would harm the nearly 350,000 people who would immediately lose their right to live and work in the U.S.",
      "\"Staying the district court's order would cause far more harm than it would stop,\" they wrote. \"It would radically shift the status quo, stripping plaintiffs of their legal status and requiring them to return to a country the State Department still deems too dangerous even to visit.\"",
      "They said that the TPS statute does not grant the Homeland Security secretary authority to vacate or rescind an extension, and Noem's terminations of TPS extensions for Venezuela and Haiti were the first and second times that a secretary has set an extension aside in the statute's history.",
      "The request for emergency relief from the Trump administration is one of more than a dozen involving Mr. Trump's second-term agenda that has landed before the Supreme Court, and one of several involving his immigration plans.",

I just had my physical ... I think that test is standard to pretty much anybody getting a physical.\" Biden is 82 years old, and regular testing over the age of 75 is somewhat controversial because of a belief that screening could do more harm than good, and prostate cancers are often slow-growing at that point, CBS News medical contributor Dr. Celine Gounder says.",

      "The U.S. credit rating was downgraded by Moody's Ratings on Friday, highlighting investor concerns about the government's growing debt.",
      "The downgrade from the top rating of Aaa to Aa1 \"reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,\" the credit rating firm said in a statement on Friday.",
      "\"Successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,\" Moody's added.",
      "Moody's also highlighted the environment of heightened policy uncertainty driven by Mr. Trump's evolving trade priorities.",
      "Moody's is the last of the three major credit rating agencies to downgrade U.S. government debt. In August 2011, Standard and Poor's downgraded the U.S. from AAA to AA+, and in August 2023\u00a0Fitch Ratings cut the credit rating a notch from AAA to AA+.",
      "Moody's said it expects federal deficits to grow from 6.4% of GDP in 2024 to 9% of GDP by 2035, driven by \"increased interest payments on debt, rising entitlement spending and relatively low revenue generation.''",
      "\"Even Obama economists warned the Biden administration and congressional Democrats against recklessly wasting trillions on COVID 'stimulus' bills \u2013 spending that piled on our national debt, fueled runaway inflation, and forced the Fed to raise interest rates for everyday Americans,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement Friday to CBS News in response to the downgrade. \"The Trump administration and Republicans are focused on fixing Biden's mess by slashing the waste, fraud, and abuse in government and passing The One, Big, Beautiful Bill to get our house back in order. If Moody's had any credibility, they would not have stayed silent as the fiscal disaster of the past four years unfolded.\"",

    "summary": "The Senate is trying again to take a key procedural vote Monday evening on a first-of-its-kind crypto regulation bill after Democrats tanked it earlier this month.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate is expected to take a key procedural vote Monday evening on a crypto regulation bill after Democratic opposition tanked an initial attempt to advance the measure earlier this month amid concern over ties between the digital asset industry and the Trump family.",
      "The first-of-its-kind legislation, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins \u2014 a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. After the measure advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee with bipartisan support in March, Senate GOP leadership first brought the measure to the floor earlier this month. But the measure had lost Democratic support in the intervening weeks amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune said the upper chamber would try again to advance the legislation on Monday, while criticizing Democrats for blocking the measure from moving forward earlier this month, saying \"this bill reflects the bipartisan consensus on this issue, and it's had an open and bipartisan process since the very beginning.\"",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, argued that Senate Democrats \"inexplicably chose to block this legislation\" earlier this month, while adding that \"I'm hoping that the second time will be the charm.\"",
      "Since the failed vote earlier this month, negotiators returned to the table. And ahead of the procedural vote Monday, the measure saw backing from at least one Democrat as Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia advocated for the measure, calling it a \"meaningful step forward,\" though he added that it's \"not perfect.\"",
      "\"The stablecoin market has reached nearly $250 billion and the U.S. can't afford to keep standing on the sidelines,\" Warner said in a statement. \"We need clear rules of the road to protect consumers, defend national security, and support responsible innovation.\"",
      "Still, Warner pointed to concerns he said are shared among many senators about the Trump family's \"use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,\" after it was announced earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial.",
      "Warner said senators \"have a duty to shine a light on these abuses,\" but he argued \"we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has been among the leading voices advocating for adding anti-corruption reforms to the legislation. Warren has outlined a handful of issues with the bill, saying that it puts consumers at risk and enables corruption. In a speech Monday on the Senate floor, Warren said her concerns have not been addressed and urged her colleagues to vote against the updated version.",
      "\"While a strong stablecoin bill is the best possible outcome, this weak bill is worse than no bill at all,\" Warren said. \"A bill that meaningfully strengthens oversight of the stablecoin market is worth enacting. A bill that turbocharges the stablecoin market, while facilitating the president's corruption and undermining national security, financial stability, and consumer protection is worse than no bill at all.\"",
      "Whether the measure can advance in the upper chamber this time around remains to be seen. The measure fell short of the 60 votes necessary to move forward earlier this month, with all Senate Democrats and two Republicans \u2014 Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri \u2014 opposing. Paul has reservations about overregulation, while Hawley voted against the bill in part because it doesn't prohibit big tech companies from creating their own stablecoins.",
      "Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who sponsored the legislation, defended the measure on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Monday. He outlined that a lack of regulatory framework, which the bill would provide, makes for uncertainty \u2014 and results in innovative technology moving offshore. The Tennessee Republicans urged that \"this will fix it,\" while arguing that the bill has strong bipartisan support.",
      "\"We have broad policy agreement, Democrats and Republicans,\" Hagerty said. \"The question is can we get past the partisan politics and allow us to actually have a victory.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gop-tax-bill-reconcilation-deficit-moodys-debt-spending/",
    "published": "Mon, 19 May 2025 17:10:41 -0400",
    "summary": "Republican tax bill could cost $3.8 trillion over 10 years as its tax cuts surpass spending reductions, according to one analysis.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican-backed tax and spending bill that's now moving forward in the House is getting a reality check from Wall Street. That's because the proposed tax breaks are projected to far outstrip any savings in the bill, potentially leading to mounting U.S. debt and a worsening fiscal outlook, according to economists and policy experts.",
      "If the bill moves forward without significant changes, the U.S. would likely find its debt levels spiraling higher in order to finance the tax cuts, according to several analyses. Over the next decade, the GOP bill could cost the U.S. $3.8 trillion, according to a report\u00a0earlier this month by the Joint Committee on Taxation that examined the impact of the the tax measures versus spending cuts.",
      "Those risks are rattling Wall Street. Moody's Ratings on Friday\u00a0downgraded the nation's debt, citing the potential for the new bill to add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit, which excludes interest payments, over the next decade.",
      "The bill also faces detractors within the Republican party, with the House Freedom Caucus saying in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0on Sunday that the bill \"fails to actually honor our promise to significantly correct the spending trajectory of the federal government and lead our nation towards a balanced budget.\"",
      "The concern, according to both Wall Street economists and policy experts, is that adding billions in debt to the U.S. ledger could eventually squeeze federal spending because the nation would likely face higher interest payments. That, in turn, could make it more difficult to fund programs like Social Security, which is already facing a financial drawdown as baby boomers hit retirement age, or to invest in initiatives like infrastructure that can spur economic growth.",
      "\"It's time for policymakers to hit pause, go back to the drawing board and put forward a plan that actually takes steps toward putting our nation on a sustainable fiscal trajectory,\" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a public policy think tank, in an email.",
      "She added, \"Our federal interest payments are skyrocketing, already surpassing what we spend annually on defense or Medicare.\"",
      "The Trump administration said it disagreed both with the Moody's analysis and forecasts that the legislation could widen the nation's deficit, which is the gap between federal spending and revenue.",
      "\"This bill does not add to the deficit,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Monday in a press conference. \"In fact, according to the Council of Economic Advisers, there's $1.6 trillion worth of savings in this bill \u2014 that's the largest saving for any legislation that has ever passed Capitol Hill in our nation's history.\"",
      "Savings versus spending",
      "At the heart of the proposed GOP bill is President Trump's vow to renew his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which introduced lower tax brackets for many Americans. Because those provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025, about 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026 without an extension of the law,\u00a0according\u00a0to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "The Council of Economic Advisers, a White House agency that advises the president on economic issues,\u00a0said\u00a0in a May study that the new bill would \"avert a $4 trillion tax hike\" by extending the TCJA's provisions.",
      "Renewing the law's cuts alone would cost $2.2 trillion over the next decade, estimates Joint Committee on Taxation, which assesses the impact of policy for Congress. The GOP bill also includes other new tax breaks that would add to the bill's long-term costs, the group's analysis found.",
      "For instance, the bill's proposal to provide taxpayers with a more generous standard deduction would result in $1.3 trillion in lost revenue over the next decade, the Joint Committee found. Eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, as well as giving a bigger deduction to senior citizens, would cost an additional $234 billion over the same period, its analysis finds.",
      "The bill does include spending cuts, but they aren't large enough to offset the tax breaks, several recent analyses conclude. The nonpartisan Bipartisan Policy Center\u00a0estimatedin a May 14 analysis that the tax cuts would cost $7.7 trillion over the next decade, while the spending cuts would offset $3.9 trillion over the same period. The result is a gap of $3.8 trillion, it said.",
      "That's the arithmetic that prompted Moody's to cut its rating on U.S. debt, from its top rating of Aaa to Aa1. In its assessment, the credit rating agency noted that the U.S. deficit has spiraled higher as previous administrations and Congress have \"failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend.\"",
      "\"Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat,\" Moody's said on Friday when it became the third major rating agency to cut the nation's credit rating. \"In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher.\"",
      "It added, \"The U.S.' fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to its own past and compared to other highly rated sovereigns.\"",
      "The Trump administration says that the proposed tax bill will spur economic growth by lowering taxes on consumers and businesses. In an interview on Monday with Fox Business, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said the economy is \"going to continue to take off once those policies are actually in place, once we actually have the tax cuts passed.\"",
      "Who wins and loses",
      "The GOP tax bill remains in flux and is likely to change as it winds through the House.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged there are still details to \"iron out\" as conservative Republicans seek to quickly enact work requirements for able-bodied participants in Medicaid. Those rules would take effect in 2029 under the bill passed last week by the Ways and Means Committee. Some House Republicans also want to more quickly end tax breaks for green energy projects being used nationwide.",
      "If the bill passes the House this week, it would then move to the Senate, where Republicans are also eyeing changes.",
      "Democrats have decried the cuts Republicans are proposing to Medicaid and food stamps to offset the costs of the tax breaks, pointing out that the reductions in social safety net programs comes as many wealthy taxpayers would get a big tax break.",
      "\"This spending bill is terrible, and I think the American people know that,\" Rep. Jim Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina, told CNN's \"State of the Union\u2033 on Sunday. \"There is nothing wrong with us bringing the government in balance. But there is a problem when that balance comes on the back of working men and women. And that's what is happening here.\"",
      "The lowest-income Americans would end up paying more under the proposed GOP bill, according to a May 19\u00a0analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania group that studies the fiscal impact of public policies. Even including savings from tax cuts, the bottom 20%, who earn up to $17,000 per year, would take a $1,035 hit in 2026 after the reductions in Medicaid and other programs are factored in.",
      "\"[H]ouseholds most affected by the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP \u2014 those in the bottom income quintile \u2014 experience the largest losses under this bill, averaging $28,000 in lifetime value for the working-age population,\" the Penn Wharton Budget model calculated. \"In contrast, working-age households in the top income quintile generally benefit from lower taxes, gaining an average of $30,000.\"",

    "summary": "About 12,000 chicks were abandoned within a USPS truck at a Delaware mail distribution center for three days.",
    "story": [
      "A Delaware animal shelter is trying to care for and rehome thousands of chicks that survived being left in a postal service truck for three days. Trapped in a warm enclosure, without food and water, thousands died before they were discovered on May 2, CBS affiliate WBOC reported.",
      "The involved parties are still awaiting answers as to how 12,000 chicks were abandoned within the truck at a Delaware mail distribution center. The United States Postal Service said in an email to the Associated Press that it was aware of a process breakdown and was actively investigating what occurred.",
      "The USPS says it has been working with hatcheries for more than 100 years to transport mail-order chicks and that it transports thousands of chicks every year, according to its website.",
      "\"Chicks can be safely transported without food or water within 72 hours of hatching. In fact, placing food and water inside the hatchery box could jeopardize the integrity of the box and could endanger the health and safety of the animals inside,\"\u00a0the Postal Service website says.",
      "Pennsylvania-based Freedom Ranger Hatchery raised the shipped chicks for their weekly distribution to clients across the country, said a spokesperson for the company. Due to biosecurity concerns, the hatchery cannot take the chicks back.",
      "The chicks were supposed to be delivered to several states, including Texas, Ohio, Florida, and more but the entire shipment was mistakenly sent to Delaware following shipping delays and rejections from distribution centers across the country, WBOC reported.",
      "The hatchery's spokesperson said it would have been best if USPS, after discovering the chicks, had completed delivery, as the recipients would have been adequately equipped to handle the birds \u2014 even malnourished ones.",
      "\"After three and a half days in the heat, these crates were wet with dead fowl. It was a mess,\" John Parana, executive director at First State Animal Center and SPCA, told CBS affiliate WBNS-TV.",
      "For more than two weeks, the surviving chicks have been nursed and cared for at the shelter, Parana said.",
      "Last Tuesday, the shelter began offering the birds for adoption, but only a few hundred out of thousands have been picked up. There is no complete count of the chicks, as the shelter has no feasible way to do so, but Parana estimates there to be more than two thousand available.",
      "Some have inquired about buying the birds for meat, but, as a no-kill shelter and SPCA, those were refused.",
      "The strain has turned the animal care center into a 24/7 operation and necessitated a staffing increase, Parana said. Money remains the biggest concern for the donation-reliant nonprofit. Some employees have begun spending their money to support the operations, he added.",
      "Among the birds were young turkeys, geese and quail, but the vast majority were Freedom Ranger chicks. One concern for the shelter, Parana explained, was the increasing demand for space and feed over time, as Freedom Rangers take about ten weeks to reach maturity.",
      "The Delaware Department of Agriculture, after a call from USPS, directed the animals to the shelter, which shares a memorandum of understanding with the animal center as a state vendor. The department said it is responsible for assisting the shelter with funds \u2014 for chickens, the rate was $5 each per day.",
      "The department's chief of planning, Jimmy Kroon, said negotiations were ongoing, but Parana claims that the department communicated that they had no funds to allocate for the chicks. Both acknowledged the original rate would be unreasonable in the current circumstances.",
      "\"They said that they're gonna try to go after the post office to get recoupment,\" Parana said. \"That doesn't help us in the meantime.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 19 May 2025 15:57:13 -0400",
    "summary": "Extreme weather linked to climate change will likely lead to more Americans losing their homes as foreclosure rates rise, researchers predict.",
    "story": [
      "Extreme weather linked to climate change could spell financial ruin for many American homeowners and lead to billions in losses for lenders, a new study finds.",
      "First Street, a research firm that studies the impact of climate change, projects in an analysis\u00a0released Monday that foreclosures across the U.S. caused by flooding, wind and other weather-related incidents could soar 380% over the next 10 years. By 2035, climate-driven events could account for up to 30% of all foreclosures by 2035, up from roughly 7% this year.",
      "Low- to moderate-income households are particularly vulnerable to the effect of severe weather on their homes, First Street noted. Much of Americans' wealth is tied up in the value of their properties.",
      "A cascade of foreclosures, driven by the mounting costs of repairs and rising insurance premiums stemming from extreme weather, \u00a0wouldn't only hurt homeowners. First Street estimates lenders will lose $1.2 billion a year in 2025 \u2014 and up to $5.4 billion in 10 years \u2014 as they are forced to absorb the cost of mortgage defaults.",
      "Such losses represent the \"hidden risks\" of climate change that lenders often fail to account for in their underwriting practices, Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications at First Street, told CBS MoneyWatch. Lenders consider factors including a borrower's income, debt and credit score in issuing mortgages, but not the potential impact of extreme weather on a property or how it could raise premiums.",
      "First Street also looked at how indirect factors, like rising insurance premiums, are already shaping foreclosure trends. For every 1% increase in insurance costs, the firm projects a roughly 1% increase in the foreclosure rate nationwide.",
      "The findings comes as insurers are jacking up the cost of homeowners policies and in some cases exiting markets around the U.S. altogether, leading to spottier coverage in disaster-prone areas like California. That could leave more individual homeowners on the hook for damage from extreme weather.",
      "First Street said integrating climate risk into loan assessments could help lenders \u2013 and homeowners \u2013 be better prepared for weather-related disasters. But it could also tighten lending conditions, Porter said, putting potential homebuyers at a disadvantage.",
      "\"It's going to increase the price of homes. It's going to increase interest rates,\" he said.",
      "Where climate foreclosures could rise",
      "According to First Street, the communities around the U.S. at greatest risk for climate-related foreclosures in the years to come are densely populated areas with high property values and large numbers of underinsured homeowners. That includes coastal areas vulnerable to storm surge and hurricane winds.",
      "For example, Florida's Duval County in the northeastern corner of the state, home to the city of Jacksonville, could see up to $60 million in credit losses resulting from 900 foreclosures in a \"severe weather\" year, according to CBS MoneyWatch's analysis of First Street's data\u00a0 Florida is home to 8 of the top 10 counties with the highest projected credit losses due to extreme weather, the data shows.",
      "Louisiana, California and swaths of the northeast are also projected to see high climate-related mortgage losses this year. But the impact won't just be felt in coastal areas: First Street also expects extreme rainfall and riverine flooding to drive up foreclosures in inland states.",
      "\"We do expect foreclosures to rise in those areas because the predominant driver is a lack of insurance,\" Porter said.",
      "According to First Street, flooding events in particular is likely to drive up foreclosure rates, as gaps in insurance coverage put more people at risk of defaulting on their mortgages.",
      "Unlike homeowners insurance, flood insurance is only required for people who have federally-backed mortgages in FEMA's Special Flood Hazard Areas. As of August 2023, that amounted to roughly 3.1 million policies, according to National Flood Insurance Program data. But far more people could be at risk.",
      "FEMA's 100-year flood zone maps include just under 8 million properties. But First Street estimates that nearly 18 million homes are at risk of flooding. That's because while the agency takes flooding from major river channels and coastal storm surge into account for its maps, it does not consider extreme precipitation, Porter said.",
      "\"We already know that about half the people with significant flood risk aren't mapped into [FEMA's] Special Flood Hazard Area,\" he said. \"So it leads to a state where we have a lot of underinsurance across the country, in particular from flooding.\"",
      "Meanwhile, whether or not you live in an official FEMA flood zone can make a difference when it comes to the likelihood of foreclosure, First Street found. That's because people outside flood zones often lack insurance.",
      "\"If you don't protect yourselves, then when the event does occur it's completely on you. You end up having to pay out of pocket and you may go into foreclosure,\" Porter said.",
      "In an analysis of 29 historical flood events from 2002-2019, First Street found that damaged properties outside of those FEMA-designated zones experienced foreclosure increases at an average of 52% higher than properties inside the zones.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment on if and how it plans to update its flood maps. According to one estimate by the Association of State Floodplain Managers, it could take up to $11.8 billion to complete updated flood mapping in the U.S.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-dismantling-u-s-institute-of-peace-illegal-judge-rules/",
    "published": "Mon, 19 May 2025 13:40:07 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. Institute of Peace was created by Congress 40 years ago to promote conflict resolution and help prevent conflicts from developing.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Monday blocked the Trump administration's efforts to take over the U.S. Institute of Peace, finding that the moves led by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency were made by leaders who were illegally installed and lacked the legal authority to dismantle the organization.",
      "U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell ruled in favor of several institute board members and its president, who had been fired and challenged their terminations, as well as the administration's efforts to take over and disassemble the organization. The institute's mission is to promote conflict resolution and the prevention of conflict around the world.",
      "The five board members who challenged their removals are Ambassador John Sullivan, Judy Ansley, Joseph Falk, Kerry Kennedy and Mary Swig. The institute's president, Ambassador George Moose, was also ousted by ex officio board members Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Kenneth Jackson was then installed as the acting president of the Institute of Peace.",
      "In March, Howell declined to issue emergency relief to the Institute of Peace, but said that it was \"undisputed\" that the removal of board members was not in accordance with federal law, though the plaintiffs at the time were unable to make the required showing for a temporary restraining order.",
      "But in a 102-page decision granting the former board members request to summarily rule in their favor, Howell wrote that President Trump \"second-guessed the judgment of Congress and President Reagan in creating USIP 40 years ago, and the judgment of every Congress since then, including in 2024,\" when he signed an executive order that effectively dismantled the Institute.",
      "Howell said the purported firings of Institute of Peace board members and its president, Moose, was unlawful and ordered that they remain in their roles. The judge also found that the appointments of Jackson and Nate Cavanaugh as president of the institute are invalid, and said any actions taken by them are voided, including Cavanaugh's efforts to transfer the organization's headquarters to the General Services Administration.",
      "Howell blocked DOGE officials from gaining access to or exercising control over the U.S. Institute of Peace's offices, facilities, computer systems or other records.",
      "In her ruling, the judge criticized Trump and DOGE, writing they \"used brute force and threats of criminal process to take over USIP's headquarters, despite being cautioned that this organization did not fall within the executive branch and its leadership was not subject to the president's unilateral executive branch removal power.\"",
      "The judge said that the Elon Musk-led DOGE's firing of Institute of Peace Board members, staff, and contractors, as well as its shifting of the building to be used for other purposes was unlawful.",
      "\"This administration then went even further, taking severe actions to dissemble USIP, including terminating its appointed board members, its expert management, its dedicated staff and contractors located in both Washington, D.C. and around the world, and dispersing its assets and headquarters building,\" Howell wrote. \"These actions against USIP were unlawful.\"",
      "The judge said that Article II of the Constitution places limits on the president's ability to remove executive branch subordinates, and said Mr. Trump's actions regarding the Institute of Peace were outside his legal authority.",
      "\"The president's efforts here to take over an organization outside of those bounds, contrary to statute established by Congress and by acts of force and threat using local and federal law enforcement officers, represented a gross usurpation of power and a way of conducting government affairs that unnecessarily traumatized the committed leadership and employees of USIP, who deserved better,\" Howell wrote.",
      "The U.S. Institute of Peace is one of several entities that has been targeted by the president and DOGE as part of his efforts to severely slash the size of the federal government. The organization was created by Congress four decades ago through a law signed by President Ronald Reagan and is characterized as an independent nonprofit corporation.",
      "But the administration has winnowed the institute's staff to five employees, and it has ceased conducting programmatic activities. The U.S. Institute of Peace's assets have also been transferred to the General Services Administration. Its Washington, D.C., headquarters is in the process of being leased to the Department of Labor, according to court records.",
      "The dispute between DOGE and the Institute of Peace started in mid-March, when DOGE team members attempted to gain access to the entity's Washington, D.C., headquarters. The institute said in a statement that several DOGE members arrived at its building \"unannounced\" and were accompanied by two FBI agents. DOGE officials left after being rebuffed by an Institute employee but later returned and had \"broken\" into the building and were able to access internal systems through a former security contractor for the building, court filings revealed.",
      "The Metropolitan Police Department became involved when the institute's former outside counsel reported what he said was an unlawful entry by DOGE officials.",
      "In their lawsuit, the institute's fired board members said employees with a former security contractor and DOGE personnel \"engaged in additional attempts to unlawfully access the USIP headquarters building, but were eventually able to enter the building, forcibly occupy it, and expel including the duly appointed USIP President, other USIP personnel, and outside counsel.\"",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice. He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" where he worked with Brennan for two years on the broadcast. Rosen has been a producer for several CBS News podcasts, including \"The Takeout,\" \"The Debrief\" and \"Agent of Betrayal: The Double Life of Robert Hanssen.\""

      "The father of Guy Edward Bartkus is speaking out after news that his son is the person investigators believe to be the suspect in the bombing at a Palm Springs fertility clinic on Saturday.",
      "Richard Bartkus  says that he hasn't spoken to his 25-year-old son in more than a decade and that he is not the person he remembers. He said that, in 2019, his son worked on a school bus with children with special needs in Twentynine Palms.",
      "\"He tried to help people,\" Bartkus said of his son. \"After Twentynine Palms, he just changed.\"",
      "He was unaware that his son was a suspect in the massive investigation that sprawled across Southern California on Saturday, which is still ongoing at his son's home in Twentynine Palms. He was also unaware that his son is believed to be dead following the incident.",
      "\"It didn't say anything about him dying and I read later that he died,\" Bartkus said while speaking with CBS News Los Angeles.",
      "FBI investigators say that Guy Bartkus packed his 2010 silver Ford Fusion with explosives before making the hour-long drive to Palm Springs, where they believe he intentionally parked outside of American Reproductive Centers, an IVF clinic.",
      "Investigators say that they're still digging through a series of Bartkus' online posts and writings, which appear to indicate anti-natalist beliefs, a view that people should not continue to have children.",
      "\"We need the public's help in identifying gaps in our investigation,\" said Akil Davis, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office in a press conference on Sunday. \"We know where Mr. Bartkus was at about 6 a.m. We know the timeline of when he entered the city, but we need the public's help identifying where he traversed within the city before the explosion went off.\"",
      "As that investigation continues, Bartkus says that his son was fascinated with how things worked as a kid. Barktus also said that when his son was 9 years old, he accidentally burned their family home down while trying a trick with matches but never noticed any red flags.",
      "\"He would make a smoke bomb, stink bomb, kid things,\" his father said. \"He didn't make anything dangerous. When I say bombs, it wasn't like a bomb bomb. ... It was like something you just throw on the ground and it pops.\"",
      "Bartkus says that bombing a building, what the FBI is now calling the largest in Southern California history, is something he never imagined his son would do.",
      "\"I don't know what changed his mind. Maybe a girl, maybe people he was hanging out with up there. It wasn't him. Before that, Guy was more for helping people,\" Bartkus said.",
      "Federal investigators say that they're handling the investigation as an international act of terrorism. They did not have a timeline for when the neighborhood surrounding Bartkus' Twentynine Palms home would be reopened as they continued to gather evidence."

      "Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer at age 82. The former president's office said he has an \"aggressive form\" of the cancer, which has spread to his bones.",
      "His cancer was categorized as having a Gleason score of 9, which places him in Grade Group 5, the most severe category.",
      "Here's what to know about the disease, its symptoms and treatments:",
      "Prostate cancer symptoms",
      "Most men are diagnosed with prostate cancer before they start showing symptoms, as early warning signs of prostate cancer are rare, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. The severity of symptoms can depend on the location of the cancerous cells and how advanced the disease has become.",
      "Symptoms can include urinary issues, such as frequent urination, weak or interrupted flow, blood in urine and trouble either holding in or starting urination, according to Johns Hopkins, which says other symptoms can include difficulty getting and maintaining an erection, painful ejaculation and pain or stiffness in the lower back, hips or upper thighs.",
      "Urinary symptoms, such as frequent urination or difficulty urinating, are quite common in older men and are usually due to benign conditions like having an enlarged prostate, CBS News medical contributor Dr. Celine Gounder says.",
      "But in this case, Biden's office said his symptoms led to a prostate exam that resulted in the discovery of a small nodule. Further testing determined it was cancerous.",
      "Some urologists were surprised that the 82-year-old underwent prostate cancer screening at all, according to Dr. Gounder, because routine screening in men over 75 is controversial. Many prostate cancers at that age are slow-growing, and overtreatment can do more harm than good, she said.",
      "Prior to the diagnosis, Biden had received a clean bill of health during a February 2024 physical, in which he was declared \"fit to serve\" while still in office.",
      "His situation underscores the importance of tailoring medical decisions to the individual, Gounder says. The former president had new symptoms and is functionally active, which justified a closer look.",
      "Gleason score and what bone metastasis means",
      "Gleason scores are a grading system for prostate cancer, according to the\u00a0Cleveland Clinic. Pathologists grade each tissue sample on a 1 to 5 scale. The lower the grade, the more cancer cells look like normal cells.",
      "Each area of prostate cancer may have a different grade, so pathologists pick the two areas that make up most of the cancer. They add the two areas' grades to come up with a Gleason score, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "Biden had a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5), which is determined by the pathologist who looked at cells under a microscope.",
      "A score of 9 is the second highest on the scale, which goes to 10. For scores 8, 9 and 10, the \"cells look very different from healthy cells, which is called poorly differentiated or undifferentiated,\" the Cleveland Clinic said.",
      "The categorization suggests a poor prognosis without intervention, Gounder said, but there are treatment options available that can help.",
      "Moreover, Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis came with the presence of bone metastases, meaning the disease has spread. It places him within the high/very high-risk management group.",
      "Is prostate cancer curable?",
      "Prostate cancer is often curable if it's identified and treated early, and many medical advancements have been made in recent years that can help with more severe cases.",
      "\"The good news is that prostate cancer actually has a lot of effective treatments, and so patients even who are diagnosed with more aggressive, more advanced stage disease can live many years and have good quality of life,\" said Dr. Tanya Dorff, an oncologist who treats prostate and other genitourinary cancers at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Los Angeles.",
      "In Biden's case \u2014 given his age and health \u2014 the goal isn't to cure the disease but to control it, to slow progression and preserve quality of life, Gounder said. Since the former president is reportedly in good functional health, more aggressive treatment is on the table. But these decisions always weigh the benefits against the potential risks and side effects, based on the individual's overall condition and priorities.",

    "story": [
      "Charter Communications has agreed to merge with Cox Communications in a $34.5 billion deal that will combine two of the top three cable companies in the U.S.",
      "Cox is the third-largest cable television company in the country, with more than 6.5 million digital cable, internet, telephone, and home security customers. It has a strong foothold in states spanning from California to Virginia. Charter Communications, known more widely as Spectrum, has more than 32 million customers in 41 states.",
      "The cable industry has been under assault for years from streaming services like Disney, Netflix, Amazon and HBO Max, as well as internet plans offered by mobile phone companies. Comcast, which is of nearly equal size to Charter, spun off many of its cable television networks in November as as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms.",
      "So-called \"cord cutting\" has cost the industry millions of customers and left them searching for ways to successfully compete.",
      "Charter said Friday that it will acquire Cox Communications' commercial fiber and managed IT and cloud businesses. Cox Enterprises will contribute Cox Communications' residential cable business to Charter Holdings, an existing subsidiary partnership of Charter.",
      "Cox Enterprises will own about 23% of the combined company's outstanding shares.",
      "The transaction, which needs approval from Charter shareholders as well as regulators, includes $12.6 billion in debt.",
      "The proposed deal is one of the largest in over a year. Mars' announced a $30 billion deal with Kellanova last summer and Exxon Mobil's approximately $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural happened in late 2023.",
      "The combined company will change its name to Cox Communications within a year after closing. It will keep Charter's headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut, and have a significant presence on Cox's Atlanta, Georgia campus following the closing.",
      "After the deal is complete, Charter CEO Chris Winfrey will become president and CEO of the combined company. Cox CEO and Chairman Alex Taylor will serve as chairman.",
      "Cox will be able to keep two directors on the 13-member board. Advance/Newhouse, which is part of Charter, will retain its two board members.",
      "The transaction is expected to close at the same time as Charter's merger with Liberty Broadband, which was approved by Charter and Liberty Broadband stockholders in February.",
      "Shares of Charter rose more than 4% before the market open. Cox is a private company.",

      "A Lufthansa plane flew for about 10 minutes without a pilot when the co-pilot became incapacitated while the captain was outside the cockpit during a flight last February,\u00a0according to Spain's Ministry of Transport and Sustainable Mobility.",
      "The flight on Feb. 17, 2024, from Frankfurt, Germany, to Seville, Spain \u2014 an Airbus A321 carrying 199 passengers and six crew members \u2014  was over the Iberian Peninsula when the captain left the flight deck to go to the bathroom. Shortly afterward, the 38-year-old co-pilot \"suffered a sudden and severe incapacitation,\" a report from the Ministry of Transport said.",
      "The report ultimately concluded that the plane \"flew for about 10 minutes in the cruise phase with the autopilot engaged but without additional supervision by either pilot.\"",
      "When the captain was finished in the bathroom, he could not get back into the cockpit, according to the report. The door to the cockpit can only be opened from the inside, so to get back in, the captain would have to enter a code that would then alert the person inside the cockpit to open the door for them.",
      "The captain entered the code several times but still couldn't get into the flight deck. When a crew member tried to contact the co-pilot from the intercom, there was no response. The captain then used the emergency code \u2014 which would have unlocked the door after a short delay \u2014  to try to get into the flight deck, but before the delay expired, the co-pilot opened the door from the inside to let him in.",
      "The captain noticed the co-pilot was \"pale, sweating and moving strangely,\" according to the report, so he was given first aid by a crew member and a doctor who happened to be traveling on the flight as a passenger. That doctor diagnosed the co-pilot with a possible heart condition, the report said.",
      "The investigation into the incident concluded the co-pilot's incapacitation was \"the symptom of a neurological condition that had not been detected either by the affected person himself or in the previous aeronautical medical examinations.\"",
      "The report found that the co-pilot lost consciousness so suddenly, he didn't have time to warn other crew members.",
      "While the co-pilot was incapacitated, he inadvertently hit several switches in the cockpit, including increasing pressure on one of the foot pedals, according to the report. This caused a 2-degree roll and a 5-degree heading change, both of which were fixed by the plane's autopilot, which remained on the whole time.",
      "About two minutes elapsed from the time the captain first tried to get back into the cockpit to when the door was finally opened, according to the report.",
      "The captain diverted the plane to the nearest airport, which was Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Madrid Barajas Airport, where the flight landed safely about 20 minutes later. The co-pilot did not return to the cockpit for the rest of the flight.",
      "The co-pilot's condition would not have been found during medical screenings unless he was actively experiencing symptoms at the time or had previously experienced them, the report said. The co-pilot's medical certificate was suspended after the flight, with the report noting: \"This illness is disqualifying for obtaining or maintaining medical fitness to fly.\"",

      "\"I'm so pale,\" his mother recalled him saying. \"I look like a vampire!\"",
      "Israel has stepped up its war in Gaza, where the Hamas-run Ministry of Health says more than 53,000 people have now been killed since the fighting began, including more than 500 in the last week alone.",
      "Families of the hostages \u2014 58 of whom are still believed to be held in Gaza, including about 20 thought by Israeli officials to be alive \u2014 have taken to the streets regularly, decrying the renewed offensive as putting their loved ones at even greater risk.",
      "\"Edan told us, so when they heard the bombing, it was very, very concerning, scary,\" said Adi. \"And at some point, one of the tunnels collapsed.\"",
      "\"He told us sometimes he was afraid to go to sleep. Because maybe they are going to bomb this place that he is specifically inside,\" added the father. \"It was very scary.\"",
      "Now back together as a family, their thoughts are still very much with the other hostages.",
      "\"We are still continuing to speak for all the 58 hostages that are still there,\" Yael told CBS News. \"Whatever Edan told me about hostages [who were] with him, you know, during any time of the captivity, I'm calling their moms and dads, and I'm telling them from the hospital \u2014 I've done it already \u2014 and I am telling them whatever Edan told me. You know, to give them a little bit hope that their story could end also soon, and with a good ending.\"",
      "She knows better than most how much power that hope can provide.",
      "\"It's very important, you know. For me, every hostage that got released, it was like, 'Oh my God, maybe he saw Edan. Maybe he can tell me something, and I don't care if it's not from two days, you know. Maybe a year ago he was with Edan, but still, to hear something about my boy, you know, it was very crucial to us.\"",
      "At least one of those previously released hostages came to visit Edan in the hospital last week. Fellow U.S.-Israeli dual national Sagui Dekel-Chen, who was released after 498 days in captivity, said in a statement released Monday by the Hostage Families Forum that he and Edan were together for a while in captivity.",
      "\"Our fates became intertwined in the most complex situation one could imagine,\" Dekel-Chen said in the statement. \"It was important for me to come and welcome Edan upon his return. I know what he went through and what he still has ahead of him. I am very happy for him and his family. I hope that soon I will be able to embrace all the other hostages who remain behind as well.\"",
      "Yael Alexander said \"it was unbelievable to see\" the two men reunited in freedom. \"It was a miracle. This is the victory \u2014 to see the hostages together.\"",
      "\u00adAsked what their family wanted the world to know now, as rumors swirl once again of potential progress in ceasefire talks despite the ramped-up Israeli military operations, Adi said the message was simple: Act now.",
      "\"The urgency,\" he told CBS News. \"Just the urgency. Our son, he was lucky to get out \u2026 Listen, you can't treat agony with more agony. This war needs to end.\"",
      "For the time being, however, there is no end in sight. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated on Monday that Israel intends to keep pushing its offensive in Gaza, to seize complete control of the Palestinian territory.",
      "\"We're grateful for Steve [Witkoff], for President Trump, and for Adam Boehler,\" said the relieved father. \"Great job. But the job is not done. We still have more to do.\"",

    "story": [
      "Spain has ordered Airbnb to block more than 65,000 holiday, or vacation, listings on its platform for having violated rules, the Consumer Rights Ministry said Monday.",
      "The ministry said that many of the 65,935\u00a0Airbnb listings it had ordered to be withdrawn did not include their license number or specify whether the owner was an individual or a company. Others listed numbers that didn't match what authorities had, it said.",
      "Spain is grappling with a housing affordability crisis that has spurred government action against short-term rental companies. In recent months, tens of thousands of Spaniards have taken to the streets protesting rising housing and rental costs, which many say have been driven up by holiday rentals on platforms like Airbnb that have proliferated in cities like Madrid and Barcelona and many other popular tourist destinations.",
      "\"Enough already with protecting those who make a business out of the right to housing,\" Consumer Minister Pablo Bustinduy told reporters on Monday.",
      "He said he aimed to end \"illegality\" and the general \"lack of control\" in the holiday rental business, Reuters reported.",
      "About 321,000 homes in Spain had holiday rental licenses as of November last year, which was 15% more than in 2020, Reuters reported, citing official data. Many others operate without having official licenses.",
      "Airbnb said that it would appeal the decision. Through a spokesperson, the company said it did not think the ministry was authorized to rule on short-term rentals \u2014 and that it had utilized \"an indiscriminate methodology\" to include Airbnb rentals that do not need a license to operate.",
      "Last year, Barcelona announced a plan to close down all of the 10,000 apartments licensed in the city as short-term rentals by 2028 to safeguard the housing supply for full-time residents.",
      "The ministry said it had notified Airbnb of the noncompliant listings months ago, but that the company had appealed the move in court.",
      "Spain's government said Madrid's high court had backed the order sent to Airbnb. Bustinduy said it involved the immediate removal of 5,800 rental listings from the site. Two subsequent orders would be issued until the nearly 66,000 removals are reached, he said.",
      "Spain's government said the first round of affected properties were located across the country, including in the capital, Madrid, as well as in the regions of Andalusia and Catalonia, whose capital is Barcelona.",

    "summary": "The scientists nicknamed one capuchin kidnapper Joker because the scar at the side of its mouth reminded them of the \"Batman\" villain.",
    "story": [
      "A baby howler monkey clung to the back of an older male monkey, its tiny fingers grasping fur. But they're not related and not even the same species.",
      "Scientists spotted surprising evidence of what they describe as monkey kidnappings while reviewing video footage from a small island of Panama. The capuchin monkeys were seen carrying at least 11 howler babies between 2022 and 2023, researchers said Monday.",
      "\"This was very much a shocking finding,\" said Zo\u00eb Goldsborough, a behavioral ecologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany. \"We've not seen anything like this in the animal kingdom.\"",
      "The monkeys' motivations remain under investigation. Capuchins are house cat-sized monkeys found in South America and Central America. They are long-lived, clever and learn new behaviors from each other. One group of capuchins in Panama has even learned to use stone tools to crack open nuts and seafood.",
      "Goldsberg and other researchers at Max Planck and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute had set up more than 80 cameras to study capuchin tool use but were surprised to see the first howler babies appear in early 2022.",
      "Goldsborough initially found four different howler infants being carried. In nearly all cases, the culprit was the same subadult male. The scientists nicknamed the capuchin Joker because the small scar at the side of its mouth reminded them of the \"Batman\" villain.",
      "At first, the scientists thought this was the \"heartwarming story of a weird capuchin adopting these infants,\" Goldsborough said.",
      "Then the researchers started finding other cases not involving Joker. The scientists were puzzled because the capuchins did not eat or prey on the babies, nor did they seem to enjoy playing with them.",
      "Goldsborough said they eventually realized these abductions were a social tradition or \"fad\" among the island's young male capuchins.",
      "Grim fate for abducted babies",
      "The footage showed the capuchins walking and pounding their stone tools with baby howlers on their backs. But cameras did not capture the moments of abduction, which scientists said likely happened up in the trees, where howlers spend most of their time.",
      "\"Our window into this story is constrained,\" said co-author Margaret Crofoot of Max Planck and the Smithsonian. The findings were published Monday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "In most or all cases, the baby howlers died, researchers said. Infant howler monkeys would normally be carried by their mothers while still nursing. All the babies in the video \u2014 from a few weeks to a few months in age \u2014 were too young to be weaned.",
      "\"A hopeful part of me wants to believe some escaped and went back to their mothers, but we don't know,\" said Crofoot.",
      "The videos recorded a few instances of young capuchin males still carrying howler babies that had died, likely from starvation. Many animals \u2014 from gorillas to orcas \u2014 have been observed carrying their dead offspring, though scientists aren't sure the reasons.",
      "Why did the capuchin males do it? There were no signs of deliberate aggression toward the babies and they weren't eaten, ruling out predation.",
      "\"We've all spent hours wracking our brains \u2014 why they would do this?\" said Goldsborough.",
      "The first baby-snatcher may have had a confused \"caring motivation,\" or parental instinct, because he showed gentleness interacting with the infants, she said. Then four other males copied his actions.",
      "The researchers said they don't believe the capuchins harmed the babies on purpose. So far, only one group of capuchins has been known to kidnap.",
      "The research shows the \"remarkable behavioral variation across social groups of the same species,\" said Catherine Crockford, a primatologist at the CNRS Institute for Cognitive Sciences in France, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Cultural fads spreading among animals is rare but not unheard of.",
      "Barrett has previously studied capuchins in Costa Rica that suddenly started grooming porcupines, before growing bored of the trend.",
      "And back in the 1980s, killer whales took to donning dead salmon on their heads off the northwestern U.S. coast. This trend returned decades later when orcas were again spotted wearing these \"salmon hats\" last year.",

Another strike on a family's residence, also in Jabaliya, killed 10, including seven children and a woman, according to the civil defense, which operates under the Hamas-run government.",

      "The announcement was also short on specifics, including which measures would be rolled back, and at what pace. The lack of clarity sent senior officials at Treasury scrambling to understand what he meant.",
      "Now, there are discussions inside Treasury to determine the speed and extent to which the decades-old sanctions \u2014 which restrict economic activity within Syria and its dealings with other countries \u2014 can be rolled back.",

      "Some work was underway at Treasury before the president's announcement for an incremental lifting of sanctions, some of which date back to 1979.",
      "Indeed, Syria's transitional government \u2014 led by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa \u2014 has pushed the Trump administration for sanctions relief in recent months.",
      "The new government has blamed sanctions \u2014 which include penalties on third countries for doing business in Syria \u2014 for its inability to pay civil service salaries, reconstruct sizable chunks of war-ravaged cities and rebuild a health-care system decimated by war.",
      "Turkey and Saudi Arabia, two U.S. allies in the region, have backed normalizing relations with Syria's new government. Both countries have provided aid to Syria, and Saudi Arabia has offered to pay off some of the country's debts, two activities that could run afoul of sanctions. The Saudis see an opportunity to win the new Syrian government over to their side, after decades of the country being allied with their top regional rival, Iran, while the Assad regime was in power.",
      "Relief was a key topic in meetings between Syrian officials, including its Central Bank Governor Abdelkadir Husrieh, and other world leaders at the IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings last month in Washington.",
      "Some of the most punitive measures were imposed over the last two decades on the former regime of Bashar al-Assad for human rights abuses and support for groups designated by the U.S. as terrorist organizations. The Assad government collapsed in December as rebel groups, including fighters led by Sharaa, swept into Damascus, ending a 13-year-long civil war.",
      "In 2003, then-President George W. Bush signed the Syria Accountability Act into law, which centered on Syria's support for U.S.-designated terror groups like Hezbollah, Syria's military presence in Lebanon, alleged development of weapons of mass destruction, oil smuggling and backing of armed groups in Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion.",
      "In 2011, the Obama administration led an international effort to isolate Syria \u2014 culminating in multiple rounds of sanctions \u2014 as Assad's army fought a bloody civil war against rebel forces that led to half a million dead Syrians.",
      "Another package of sanctions was imposed in 2019 as part of the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, also known as the \"Caesar Act\" which Mr. Trump signed into law. The bill imposed stiff sanctions on Assad's government and companies or governments that worked with it, further crippling Syria's already isolated economy.",
      "Rubio indicated in his remarks in Turkey that relief may come in the form of waivers that give permission to do business in Syria without facing penalties for evading sanctions, which the administration can issue under authorities in the \"Caesar Act.\"",
      "\"I think we want to start with the initial waiver, which will allow foreign partners who wanted to flow in aid to begin to do so without running the risk of sanctions,\" Rubio said.

      "Weight-loss medications and bariatric surgery have both been found effective at helping people shed excess pounds \u2014 and now a new study explores their link to obesity-related cancer (ORC) risk.",
      "Obesity is a known risk factor for certain types of cancers, and has also been shown to impact cancer survival.",
      "Obesity-related cancers include multiple myeloma, meningioma, adenocarcinoma of esophagus; stomach, colorectal, liver or bile duct, gallbladder, pancreas, uterus, ovary, renal-cell kidney, thyroid, and postmenopausal breast cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",
      "SEMAGLUTIDE FOUND TO HAVE SHOCKING BENEFIT FOR LIVER DISEASE PATIENTS IN NEW STUDY",
      "Researchers at Clalit Health Services in Tel Aviv, Israel, conducted an observational study of the medical records of 6,356 participants aged 24 and older who had obesity and diabetes, with no history of obesity-related cancer.",
      "Between 2010 and 2018, half of the participants took GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) \u2014 injectable medications for obesity and type 2 diabetes \u2014 with at least\u00a0six drug purchases within 12 months. The other half underwent bariatric metabolic surgery (BMS).",
      "Obesity is a known risk factor for certain types of cancers, and has also been shown to impact cancer survival. (iStock)",
      "Overall, the study determined that \"the direct effect of GLP1-RAs compared to BMS on the risk for ORC beyond their effects on weight-loss is estimated as 41% relative risk reduction.\"",
      "HERE'S WHY BELLY FAT IS MORE COMMON AS WE AGE, AND 3 WAYS TO PREVENT IT",
      "The findings were published in the journal eClinicalMedicine.",
      "\"The results point at the existence of additional pathways beyond weight loss in which GLP-1RAs contribute to the decreased risk of obesity-related cancer,\" lead study author Yael Wolff Sagy, PhD, head of research at Clalit Health Services, told Fox News Digital.",
      "How do GLP-1 RAs affect cancer risk?",
      "Niketa Patel, professor of molecular medicine with the USF Health Morsani College of Medicine in Tampa, Florida, noted that obesity is associated with chronic inflammation.",
      "\"GLP1-RAs are shown to reduce inflammation and thus decrease the risk of developing ORC,\" she told Fox News Digital. (Patel was not involved in the study.)",
      "\"The anti-inflammatory properties of these medications address a known risk factor for various cancers.\"",
      "\"Bottom line: Obesity can cause certain cancers, and treatment of obesity with GLP1-RA reduces the risk of only obesity-related cancers.\"",
      "Dr. Britta Reierson, MD, medical director of knownwell, a provider of metabolic health services, said there are several ways in which GLP-1 RAs could have cancer mitigation properties.",
      "\"First, the anti-inflammatory properties of these medications address a known risk factor for various cancers,\" the Minnesota-based doctor, who also was not part of the research, told Fox News Digital.",
      "Overall, the study determined that \"the direct effect of GLP1-RAs compared to BMS on the risk for ORC beyond their effects on weight-loss is estimated as 41% relative risk reduction.\" (iStock)",
      "\"Second, the metabolic regulation and improvement in metabolic health from these medications, including lowering blood glucose levels and decreasing insulin resistance, can reduce cancer risk.\"",
      "Emerging evidence also suggests that GLP-1 RAs may have direct anti-tumor effects, Reierson noted \u2014 \"potentially through modulation of immune responses and epigenetic changes (changes that occur to gene expression and are passed down to future generations).\"",
      "FIRST GLP-1 PILL FOR WEIGHT LOSS, DIABETES SHOWS SUCCESS IN LATE-PHASE TRIAL",
      "Research suggests that GLP-1 medications help reduce inflammation not just through weight loss, but also in other organs of the body, such as the heart, according to Dr. Susan Savery, MD, a board-certified obesity medicine and primary care physician with PlushCare, a virtual health platform offering primary care, therapy and weight management services.",
      "\"Over time, chronic inflammation can be a risk factor for cancer development, as it may damage cell DNA,\" San Francisco-based Savery, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The metabolic regulation and improvement in metabolic health from these medications, including lowering blood glucose levels and decreasing insulin resistance, can reduce cancer risk.\" (iStock)",
      "\"Our fat cells (adipose tissue) naturally produce inflammatory cells, and GLP-1 medications, similar to bariatric surgery, help reduce this inflammation by decreasing the amount of adipose tissue through weight loss.\"",
      "Potential limitations",
      "The study did have some limitations, the researchers acknowledged.",
      "\"First, it is an observational study. It means that our comparison groups (persons who had surgery versus those who received GLP1-RAs) may still have some residual differences, despite our methodological efforts,\" Sagy told Fox News Digital.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"However, only this type of real-life observational study can provide the long follow-up period that is necessary to evaluate the risk of developing cancer, which often has very long latency periods.\"",
      "Another limitation is that the primary drug included in the study was liraglutide (Saxenda, Victoza), with smaller numbers of people taking exenatide (Byetta) and dulaglutide (Trulicity).",
      "While GLP-1 RAs are \"wonderful tools\" that can support people on weight-loss journeys, Savery pointed out that maintaining a healthy lifestyle through nutritious eating and regular physical activity is \"the foundation for cancer prevention and better overall health.\" (iStock)",
      "\"It will be important to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the newer GLP1-RA drugs, which are expected to have a larger effect,\" Sagy said.",
      "\"Although the direction of the results is promising, we should wait and see if and how clinical guidelines will consider it.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Reierson agreed that much more research is needed before GLP-1 RAs could ever be considered as cancer prevention options.",
      "\"Larger, randomized, controlled trials are necessary to confirm the observed effects and better understand the underlying mechanisms,\" she said.",
      "\"It will also be important to investigate the impact of GLP-1 RAs on different types of cancer and assess the long-term safety and potential side effects of using GLP-1 RAs as a cancer therapy.\" (American Cancer Society/Getty Images)",
      "\"It will also be important to investigate the impact of GLP-1 RAs on different types of cancer and assess the long-term safety and potential side effects of using GLP-1 RAs as a cancer therapy.\"",
      "Savery agrees that it\u2019s likely too early to predict FDA approval for cancer therapy, but noted that \"weight reduction plays an important role in cancer prevention, and GLP-1s seem to offer an additional benefit through inflammation reduction.\"",

      "Check washing fraud happens when a scammer steals a check you have written, erases the ink using chemicals like acetone or nail polish remover, and rewrites it to a new recipient. Often, they will change the amount to something much higher. The altered check is then deposited or cashed, and the funds are drained from your account before you even realize something is wrong.",

      "3. Sign up for USPS Informed Delivery: Stay ahead by signing up for\u00a0USPS Informed Delivery. You will receive digital previews of incoming mail so you can monitor for any missing items early. Learn more about why it's important\u00a0here.",
      "4. Monitor your bank accounts: Set up real-time alerts for check clearing and review your statements weekly to catch any suspicious activity. Also, ask your bank about any other fraud-prevention tools they offer to protect your accounts.",
      "5. Switch to digital payments when possible: Use your bank\u2019s mobile app to deposit checks without mailing or physically delivering them, reducing the risk of theft or tampering.",
      "6. Use checks with built-in security features: Choose checks printed on paper with watermarks, chemical-sensitive coatings or other security features that make check washing much harder.",
      "7. Limit the information on checks: Avoid unnecessary personal details. Do not print your Social Security number, driver\u2019s license number or phone number on your checks. The less information available, the less a fraudster can use.",
      "HOW CYBERSCAMS ARE DRAINING AMERICANS WALLETS BY THE BILLIONS",
      "8. Store checks securely: Keep blank checks in a safe place. Store your checkbook in a locked drawer or safe, not in your purse, car or an easily accessible location at home.",
      "9. Check your mailbox security: Install a\u00a0locking mailbox. If possible, use a mailbox with a lock to prevent thieves from stealing outgoing or incoming mail.",
      "10. Be cautious with endorsements: When endorsing checks, write \"For Deposit Only\" along with your account number to prevent others from cashing the check.",
      "11. Enroll in identity theft protection with check fraud specialization: Choose services that specifically monitor for compromised check details on dark web marketplaces and alert you to suspicious check-cashing patterns.

      "12. Invest in personal data removal services: Minimize exposure of sensitive details (like addresses or banking affiliations) that fraudsters could exploit for check-washing scams. Removing your personal information from these sites can help reduce your risk of becoming a victim. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "13. Shred sensitive documents: Shred old checks and bank statements. Don\u2019t just throw them away. Shred any documents with sensitive banking information.",
      "14. Report suspicious activity immediately: If you suspect check fraud or missing mail, report it to your bank and the\u00a0U.S. Postal Inspection Service right away.",
      "15. Use Positive Pay if you are a business:\u00a0Positive Pay is a fraud prevention service offered by most banks to business customers. It works by matching the checks you issue with the ones presented for payment. If something doesn\u2019t add up, like a changed amount or payee, the bank flags it for your review before it\u2019s processed. You usually need to sign up through your bank, and there might be a fee, but it\u2019s a smart way to protect your business from check fraud, especially if you write a lot of checks.",

      "The mission: From launch to splashdown",
      "Phoenix 1 launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, as part of the Bandwagon-3 rideshare mission. After reaching a 45-degree inclination orbit, the capsule completed one full trip around Earth. A carefully timed de-orbit maneuver then sent Phoenix 1 back toward the planet. During its descent, the capsule deployed an innovative inflatable heat shield, a technology designed by\u00a0Atmos to protect the capsule during the intense heat and friction of reentry.",
      "FIRST PRIVATE SPACEX POLAR MISSION SPLASHES DOWN NEAR CALIFORNIA",
      "As Phoenix 1 reentered Earth's atmosphere, it transmitted critical system and payload data to ground stations in South America. The capsule splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean, about 1,240 miles off the Brazilian coast. Because of the remote landing location, recovery of the capsule was not planned. However, the mission's main objectives were met, and the data collected is now being analyzed to inform future missions.",

      "329,000 MPH NUCLEAR ROCKET LEADING THE NEXT ERA OF SPACE TRAVEL",
      "Why Phoenix 1 is a big milestone",
      "The success of Phoenix 1 establishes Atmos as the fastest-moving private space logistics company in Europe to conduct an orbital return mission. This achievement demonstrates that Europe is on the path to developing independent, sovereign return capabilities.",
      "It also shows that private industry can lead the way in building essential space infrastructure. Atmos' rapid prototyping approach allowed the team to develop, qualify and fly Phoenix 1 in less than a year. This speed is almost unheard of in the space industry and highlights the company's commitment to innovation and hands-on problem-solving.

      "The technology: Inflatable heat shield and rapid prototyping",
      "The inflatable heat shield is a breakthrough in reentry technology. Traditional capsules rely on heavy, single-use heat shields or parachutes to survive reentry. Atmos' design is lighter, more efficient and potentially reusable, which could dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of returning cargo from space.",
      "Atmos' development philosophy is based on rapid prototyping and real-world testing. The team believes in building and testing hardware quickly, learning from each iteration and making improvements based on real data rather than relying solely on simulations. This approach allowed Phoenix 1 to go from concept to space in record time.",
      "Phoenix 1\u00a0\u00a0 (Atmos Space Cargo)",
      "The road ahead",
      "Atmos is already working on Phoenix 2, which will include its own propulsion system. This upgrade will allow the capsule to control its reentry trajectory and choose its splashdown zone, making recovery much easier and more practical. The company's vision is to create a flexible, cost-efficient and reliable logistics platform for space, supporting both commercial and institutional missions.",
      "With a payload efficiency of 1:2, Phoenix already offers the highest mass efficiency on the market. This opens new opportunities for microgravity research, in-space manufacturing and biotechnology. The technology will also support Europe's defense sector and strengthen the continent's independent space infrastructure.",
      "Phoenix 1\u00a0 (Atmos Space Cargo)",
      "What this means for you",
      "The success of Phoenix 1 is not just a technical achievement for engineers and scientists. It has the potential to assist with many aspects of everyday life. Faster and more affordable access to space means that new technologies, medicines and materials can be developed and tested in microgravity and then brought back to Earth for use.",
      "Universities, startups and small companies will have more opportunities to conduct experiments in space without the high costs and long wait times that have been barriers in the past.

This can be particularly helpful for large photo and video libraries, which can be set to upload automatically from your phone or computer.

      "5. Regularly update your operating system and applications: Keep your devices and software\u00a0up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "6. Be cautious with public Wi-Fi: Avoid accessing sensitive information when connected to\u00a0public networks, or use a VPN for added security. Using a\u00a0VPN (Virtual Private Network) service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "7. Backup your data regularly: Create\u00a0multiple backups of your important files, including at least one offline copy.",
      "8. Use secure file transfer methods: When sharing files, use encrypted transfer methods or\u00a0password-protected links.",
      "By following these steps, you can significantly enhance the security of your data and protect yourself from potential cyber threats.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Your PC\u2019s storage can fill up fast, but you can always free up some space. I personally prefer storing images and videos that take up too much space on an external drive. This way, I can access them whenever I need to while keeping my PC storage free. If an external drive feels like too much of a hassle, you can always opt for cloud storage.

      "When most people hear the term \"data broker,\" on the other hand, they draw a blank. Is it a person or company that buys and sells data? Basically, yes.

      "Types of data brokers: Who's collecting and selling your information?",
      "The most visible data brokers are commonly known as people search sites or people finder sites. These are the sites that show up when you Google yourself, or a hacker Googles you. They are just the tip of the iceberg, though. There are other data brokers that do not bother indexing individual profiles with search engines, preferring instead to deal with other companies and even governments directly. These are the other major types of data brokers, in addition to people search sites:",
      "Marketing data brokers focus more on your browsing habits, past purchases and interests. They are responsible for \"personalized marketing\" as well as helping other companies target you with those surprisingly relevant ads you see online.",
      "Recruitment data brokers collect and process personal information to offer background screening services to organizations evaluating job candidates or performing background checks before making an offer. Unfortunately, although illegal, there is nothing actually stopping unscrupulous employers from using the much less regulated and reliable people search sites for the same purposes.",
      "Risk mitigation brokers aggregate a variety of background, criminal, property and other information to provide assessment reports to various investment and business companies. The information they collect is aimed at helping such companies manage risk in taking on new business.",
      "Financial information brokers collect various personal finance and background information for credit companies and banks to calculate your credit score and may influence your eligibility to get loans and lines of credit.",
      "Health information data brokers collect information about your general health and sell it to companies in healthcare and related fields. This information can be used to target you with health product ads and even set your insurance premiums.",
      "Hackers are most likely to use people search sites, though; they are easily accessible, eminently searchable, relatively cheap (with trial offers for as little as a dollar) and do not ask any questions. Other data brokers may also sell personal information to hackers, but they tend to sell profiles in bulk.",
      "DATA REMOVAL DOES WHAT VPNS DON\u2019T: HERE\u2019S WHY YOU NEED BOTH",
      "Want your data taken off this market?",
      "It is perfectly normal to want no part in any of this. Unfortunately, there is no federal law on the books in the U.S. that would either prevent this kind of data trade or give you an easy, legally enforced way to opt out.",
      "The good news is that, thanks to an incomplete patchwork of state laws, personal information removal services can approach hundreds of individual data brokers on your behalf with legally binding data-removal requests.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "It is easy to feel overwhelmed when you realize just how much of your personal information is out there, and how many different players are collecting, selling and using it. But knowing how data brokers operate is the first step to taking back control. Whether it is people search sites or the less visible brokers working behind the scenes, your data is valuable, and you deserve to know who has it and what they are doing with it. The good news is, there are tools and services out there that can help you clean up your digital footprint and protect your privacy. So, do not just sit back and hope for the best \u2014 take action and make your data work for you, not against you.",

It rides on a 108.9-inch wheelbase and features a five-foot bed that is slightly longer and wider than the Maverick's, offering 37 cubic feet of cargo space. The truck is powered by a single rear-mounted electric motor producing 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, delivering rear-wheel drive only and accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in about 8 seconds, with a top speed near 90 mph.",

The Slate Truck has a maximum payload capacity of 1,433 pounds and can tow up to 1,000 pounds, making it practical for everyday hauling needs.",

The vehicle\u2019s exterior can be wrapped in different colors and designs instead of painted, allowing owners to easily change its look or even do it themselves with a DIY kit.

A warning popped up saying 'software updating \u2013 do not turn off PC,' and I could see my entire file system being scanned.

      "Fake PayPal scam email (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How this scam works",
      "This type of scam is known as a remote access scam. It often begins with a fake email that appears to come from a trusted company like PayPal. The message claims there is an issue, such as an unauthorized charge, and urges the victim to call a phone number or click a link.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Once the scammer makes contact, they guide the victim to enter a code into their browser or install a program, claiming it will fix the problem. In reality, this grants the scammer full control of the victim\u2019s computer.",
      "Once inside, scammers often search for sensitive files, access banking websites, steal login credentials or install malware to maintain long-term access. Even if the immediate scam is stopped, hidden malware can allow scammers to reenter the system later.",

      "Fake emails are harder to spot than ever: Scammers create emails that look almost identical to real ones from trusted companies like PayPal. They copy logos, formatting and even fake customer support numbers. Always double-check the sender\u2019s email address and verify communications by visiting the official website or app directly instead of clicking links inside emails.",
      "Remote access scams can escalate fast: Once scammers gain control of your device, they can steal sensitive data, move funds between accounts and install hidden malware that stays behind even after the scammer disconnects. It often takes only minutes for serious damage to be done, making fast recognition critical.",
      "Psychological pressure plays a big role: Scammers rely on creating a sense of urgency and fear. By keeping you on the phone and urging secrecy, they isolate you from help and rush you into making bad decisions. Recognizing when you are being pressured is key to breaking the scammer\u2019s control.",
      "Fast action can make all the difference: By quickly disconnecting his computer and contacting his bank, John limited the scammer\u2019s access to his accounts.

      "Taking simple but strong security steps can protect you from falling victim.",
      "1. Never call a number listed in a suspicious email: Scammers often set up fake phone numbers that sound professional but are designed to manipulate you into handing over control or information. Always find verified contact information through a company's official website or app, not links/numbers provided in suspicious messages.",
      "2. Be skeptical of unusual instructions: No legitimate company will ask you to install software or enter strange codes to protect your account. If anything seems unusual, trust your instincts and stop the communication immediately.",
      "3. Install strong antivirus software on all devices:\u00a0Antivirus programs can detect suspicious downloads, block remote access attempts and help prevent hackers from taking over your system. Having strong antivirus protection installed across all your devices is the best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware and attempt to access your private information. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Use identity theft protection: These services monitor financial accounts, credit reports and online activity for signs of fraud, alerting you to suspicious transactions.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5. React immediately if you suspect a scam: Disconnect your device from the internet, contact your bank or credit card company immediately and change your passwords, especially for banking and email accounts. Monitor your accounts closely for unauthorized activity and report the scam to the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission as well as the company that was impersonated. Acting quickly can prevent further access and limit the damage scammers can cause.",
      "6. Use multifactor authentication (MFA):\u00a0MFA adds a critical layer of security beyond passwords, blocking unauthorized logins even if credentials are stolen. Enable MFA on all accounts, especially banking, email and payment platforms, to stop scammers from bypassing stolen passwords.",
      "7. Update devices and software immediately:\u00a0Regular updates patch security flaws that scammers exploit to install malware or hijack systems. Turn on automatic updates wherever possible to ensure you\u2019re always protected against newly discovered vulnerabilities.",
      "8. Employ a password manager with strong, unique passwords: Avoid password reuse and use complex passphrases to minimize credential-stuffing attacks. A\u00a0password manager generates and stores uncrackable passwords, eliminating the risk of weak or repeated credentials. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "9. Never share screen access or grant remote control: Scammers exploit screen-sharing tools to steal passwords and manipulate transactions in real time. Legitimate tech support will never demand unsolicited screen access; terminate the call immediately if pressured.",
      "10. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0These services automate requests to delete your personal information from data brokers and people-search sites, reducing publicly available details scammers could exploit for phishing or impersonation. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "The travel expert's tips come as the U.S. State Department, in conjunction with the U.S. Embassy in Mexico, has issued an urgent travel warning for Baja California Sur, La Paz, Los Cabos, Cabo San Lucas due to escalating security concerns in these popular tourist destinations.",

      "The travel alert reported that cartels have made threats against officials. It added that Americans in Cabo San Lucas, San Jose del Cabo, and La Paz should \"expect to see increased security presence [and] public transportation restrictions.\"",

      "For travelers planning to visit Mexico in the near future, especially those heading to Baja California Sur, it is crucial to heed the advice provided by the embassy and local officials, Awodele said.",
      "If driving, Awodele suggested travelers plan their route by using designated safety corridors in Mexico. The country has highway systems that are monitored more closely and has frequent security checkpoints that may provide tourists an extra set of eyes during their trip.",

      "When packing, bring at least one credit card and two debit cards to prevent being stranded if one is lost or stolen, she said.",
      "For Awodele, the issue is personal after she was robbed and scammed out of $250 while traveling in Tulum, Mexico.",
      "She explained that she arrived at the port well ahead of her flight to take a water taxi to the airport, but missed one that had just left. A man approached her and claimed that, due to COVID-related changes, the next water taxi wouldn\u2019t arrive on time, and she would miss her flight.",
      "The man, she said, insisted that she needed to take a small private aircraft\u2014and that it required $250 in cash.",
      "Despite her suspicions, Awodele complied, because she was panicked about missing her flight. She withdrew the money from an ATM and was rushed onto a small aircraft. Notably, she was the only passenger, which added to her discomfort.",
      "Upon arriving at the airport, with plenty of time left, she realized that the urgency may have been fabricated.",
      "After looking into it, Awodele found out this type of scam, where fear and urgency are used to trick tourists into overpaying for transportation, is not uncommon. Since the payment was in cash, she had no recourse to get the money back.",
      "Mexico is a popular vacation destination for Americans, but one travel advisor warns that travelers should take precautions. (Chichen Itza- iStock)",

      "\"Don't travel with one card. If you're going somewhere, you need a credit card and at least two debit cards. The credit card gets locked, or the debit card gets stolen,\" she said. \"You need a third card to make sure that you're good.\"",
      "She also suggested bringing a power bank and downloading offline maps that include your hotel, the nearest police station and other key locations in case of emergency or poor cell signals.",
      "While in Mexico, stay aware of your surroundings and avoid looking lost, as this can mark you as a target. Women travelers should consider using drink covers like scrunchie lids, carrying a whistle or personal alarm and storing valuables in different places.",
      "If something goes wrong\u2014like being scammed or robbed\u2014contact the U.S. embassy immediately, cancel compromised cards, and get to a safe, populated area, Awodele said.",

      "Throughout the visit, Trump emphasized points that directly reflect Israeli priorities. On Tuesday, he condemned the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, called for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords and warned Iran over its nuclear ambitions. On Wednesday, he even extended the normalization initiative to Syria.",

      "According to two Arab officials quoted by The Times of Israel, U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff told mediators in Doha that Washington does not intend to pressure Israel into ending the war in Gaza \u2014 aligning with Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s firm stance.",
      "On Friday, President Trump was asked in an interview with Fox News Chief political anchor, Bret Baier on Special Report, if he was frustrated with Netanyahu. Trump responded, \"No, look, he's got a tough situation. You have to remember there was an October 7th that everyone forgets, it was one of the most violent days in the history of the world.

      "\"The missed opportunity here is enormous,\" he said. \"There were two major levers Israel had \u2014 Israeli consent to U.S. arms deals with Saudi Arabia and American consent to lifting sanctions on Syria.

      "TRUMP SAYS US HAS GIVEN IRAN PROPOSAL FOR NUCLEAR DEAL",
      "The sense of urgency grew last week when Trump abruptly paused U.S. airstrikes on Iranian-backed Houthis just days after a missile landed near Ben Gurion Airport.

      "Reuters later confirmed the shift. Meanwhile, Saudi officials made clear that progress on the Palestinian issue remains a prerequisite for any nuclear deal \u2014 something seen as unlikely while the war in Gaza continues.",
      "\"After the Saudi story, where we were thrown under the bus, I said we need to stop and investigate,\" Haiman said. \"We shouldn\u2019t just say it\u2019s the president\u2019s whims. We need to ask, \u2018What depends on us? What needs to change?\u2019 I\u2019m not sure they\u2019re doing that.\"",
      "The sharpest potential rift remains Iran. Jerusalem views a nuclear-armed Tehran as an existential threat. Haiman calls this \"a historic window\" to stop it, by force if needed. \"The American interest is to finish wars, not enter them, and to seal a deal better than Obama\u2019s,\" he said, warning that a diplomatic track pursued over Israel\u2019s head could soon limit Israeli military options.",

      "Within Israel, the Gaza war continues to divide strategists over whether to keep pressing Hamas or stop the war for a hostage deal. Haiman called the current \"fight, deal, fight\" rhythm \"boiling the frog,\" but acknowledges that without a hostage deal now, the 21 living hostages might not survive.",

      "Last year, an Associated Press investigation found that two court employees in whom the alleged victim confided came forward with the accusation in May. That was a few weeks before Khan sought arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu, his former Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders on war crimes charges.",

The entire tribunal, including his prosecutorial team and judges, enabled his blood libel. The scandal points to the inherent defects of the institution - a total lack of accountability.\"",

Khan himself wasn't questioned at the time.",
      "While the court\u2019s watchdog could not determine wrongdoing, it nonetheless urged Khan in a memo to minimize contact with the woman to protect the rights of all involved and safeguard the court\u2019s integrity.",

The day before announcing the warrant application, Khan abruptly canceled a trip to Israel and Gaza that he had previously said was important to make his decision.\"",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported the ICC employee\u2019s graphic account of Khan\u00a0allegedly raping the woman and sexually molesting her.",

      "With respect to information that Khan exploited the ICC to save his own skin by charging Israeli leaders,\u00a0Carter-Ruck Solicitors said \"The decision to announce that arrest warrants for individuals including Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Gallant and leaders of Hamas, our client also wishes to make clear that the fact that ICC Judges approved the applications for those warrants underscores that the evidence on which they were based met the rigorous legal threshold required under the Rome Statute.\u00a0Suggestions that the Prosecutor\u2019s applications were linked to, or precipitated by, unrelated allegations of misconduct are totally false.\"",

      "Kontorovich said about the ICC case against Israeli leaders: \"This fundamentally undermines the integrity of the case, and in a normal judicial system, would lead not just to these charges being thrown out, but cast doubt on all his prior cases.\"",
      "He continued that \"Given that the ICC has only managed to secure final convictions against six people for atrocity crimes in its quarter-century of existence, a massive scandal of prosecutorial misconduct should be grounds for shutting down the institution, not just removing the prosecutor.\"",

    "summary": "It\u2019s the first such order in the mounting legal saga surrounding President Donald Trump\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport hundreds of men to a supermax prison in El Salvador.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Texas ordered the Trump administration Monday to facilitate contact between a Venezuelan man deported to El Salvador and his lawyers, giving the federal government until Wednesday afternoon.",
      "It\u2019s the first such order in the mounting legal saga surrounding President Donald Trump\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport hundreds of men to a supermax prison in El Salvador notorious for human rights abuses. The Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, generally offers zero contact between inmates and the outside world, including their lawyers and families.",
      "The order by Judge Keith P. Ellison of the Southern District of Texas gives the government 24 hours to confirm the location of the plaintiff \u2014 a 24-year-old Venezuelan man \u2014 and 48 hours to \u201crestore and help maintain attorney-client communication\u201d with him.",
      "\u201cThis shows that the court is as concerned as we are as to the whereabouts of this individual and the illegal justification for his continued detention,\u201d said Javier Rivera, the Houston lawyer representing Widmer Josneyder Agelviz Sanguino, the incarcerated Venezuelan man.",
      "The Trump administration is expected to appeal the order to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The federal government has been ordered before, including by the Supreme Court, to facilitate the return to the United States of people deported to El Salvador, most notably Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and has argued in response that it has no jurisdiction or ability to do so. Until now, it has not been ordered to facilitate contact between inmates and their lawyers.",
      "Agelviz initially traveled to the United States in September with his mother and two younger brothers as part of the U.S.\u2019 refugee resettlement program, a process that involves extensive vetting and background checks. When they arrived at the airport in Houston, immigration agents detained Agelviz.",
      "Documents reviewed by NBC News show that Agelviz was detained because of a tattoo on his forearm that includes a clock and a rose, images a Customs and Border Protection agent wrote are \u201cassociated\u201d with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The documents show that he had no criminal record and that there was no additional evidence linking him to the gang.",
      "\u201cMy son is not a gang member,\u201d said Agelviz\u2019s mother, Lisbeth Carolina Sanguino, who is now living in San Antonio with her two other sons. \u201cHe\u2019s a young man who\u2019s never hurt anyone.\u201d",
      "Sanguino hired a lawyer to prove her son\u2019s innocence in immigration court. But only two weeks before the immigration court case was set to be resolved, Agelviz and hundreds of other men from Venezuela were shipped with no warning or court hearings to El Salvador. Attorneys for the men argue that their sudden deportations violated their due process rights, an issue now at the center of legal challenges to return them to the United States and prevent further similar deportations.Advocates and lawyers representing the men in CECOT have found that a majority of them had no criminal records. Many also did not violate any immigration laws when they came to the United States, according to a recent analysis by the Cato Institute, often crossing the U.S.-Mexico border with appointments through the CBP One app.",
      "But at least three, including Agelviz, came to the United States under the refugee resettlement program, according to Michelle Bran\u00e9, executive director of Together and Free, a nonprofit group assisting more than a hundred families of deported Venezuelans.",
      "Applicants for refugee status go through months of vetting conducted at the migrants\u2019 locations abroad, not at the border, including extensive background checks by both U.S. and international law enforcement agencies to ensure they do not pose public safety threats to the United States.",
      "\u201cRefugees are always very carefully screened before they are admitted into the United States,\u201d Bran\u00e9 said. \u201cIt seems particularly unlikely that they would have made it through that entire process and really have some serious indication of being such a dangerous criminal.\u201d",
      "In a statement, a White House official said: \u201cDHS intelligence assessments go well beyond just gang affiliate tattoos and social media. Tren De Aragua is one of the most violent and ruthless terrorist gangs on planet earth. They rape, maim, and murder for sport. President Trump and Secretary Noem will not allow criminal gangs to terrorize American citizens.\u201d",
      "The statement did not offer any additional evidence linking any of the refugees deported to CECOT to Tren de Aragua or to criminal activity of any kind. However, the official added: \u201cWe are confident in our law enforcement\u2019s intelligence, and we aren\u2019t going to share intelligence reports and undermine national security every time a gang member denies he is one. That would be insane.\u201d",
      "The Department of Homeland Security document explaining the reasons for Agelviz\u2019s detention indicates that he had no criminal record or incriminating information in his social media. It lists no evidence of gang affiliation beyond his tattoos.",
      "Those tattoos, Sanguino said, are references to her son\u2019s childhood: his grandmother\u2019s rose garden and an owl that visited their home every night at 3 a.m., which is the time shown on the clock.",
      "\u201cI never approved of the tattoos,\u201d Sanguino said. \u201cBut he asked me so much that when he turned 18, I finally said, \u2018Go ahead, but I don\u2019t want to see them.\u2019\u201d",
      "Agelviz also tattooed his mother\u2019s name and his brothers\u2019 initials on his arm. \u201cHe thought because he got my name tattooed that I wouldn\u2019t get mad at him,\u201d she said. Her two younger sons do not have tattoos.",
      "The family were living in Ecuador when they applied for refugee status and went through the screening process, which lasted around 10 months and involved several in-person interviews during which Agelviz was asked about his tattoos. They had fled Venezuela for reasons they asked not to divulge to protect family members still at risk.",
      "The refugee program is reserved for people fleeing armed conflict and targeted persecution; it is rarely granted to Venezuelans or other migrants from the Americas, and it is typically associated with people fleeing war in the Middle East and Africa.",
      "Like all loved ones of men deported to CECOT, Sanguino has had no contact with her son for more than two months.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for me as a mother to have to imagine the situation my son is in without being able to do anything about it, without knowing how he is,\u201d she said. \u201cHow is his health, how is he eating, what is going through his mind?\u201d",
      "The first and only glimpse at the conditions under which the men are being held came last week, when former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., as part of his show on One America News, accompanied a congressional delegation to the wing of CECOT holding Venezuelan deportees. (No other media outlets have been allowed access to that wing of the facility.) The prisoners there repeatedly shouted \u201cLiberty!\u201d and made the international hand signal for help.",
      "Watching the video, Sanguino said, only made things harder.",
      "\u201cI eat and I feel guilty, because I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s eating, or if he\u2019s eating,\u201d Sanguino said. She often wakes up anxious thinking of him. \u201cAnd I want to think that it\u2019s a nightmare but feel sad every time I remember that it\u2019s reality.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Investors largely shrugged off a downgrade of the U.S.' credit rating in Monday trading, as stocks ended the day mostly flat.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average added more than 130 points for an increase of 0.32%. The broader S&P closed up 0.09% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.02%.",
      "Late Friday, Moody\u2019s became the third and final major ratings agency to downgrade U.S. debt, reducing it by one notch from AAA to Aa1. Credit ratings agencies help determine how reliably a country can pay off its debt.",
      "Yet the market for U.S. government debt has so far remained mostly stable. As of 4 p.m., the yield on the 10-year Treasury note \u2014 the government\u2019s benchmark loan asset \u2014 was only a few percentage points above where it traded Friday, climbing to 4.46%. That remans well below the most recent high of 4.59% briefly seen last month.",
      "\u201cThe downgrade itself doesn\u2019t seem so far to have made much of a market splash,\u201d analysts at the Capital Economics research consultancy wrote in a note.",
      "While the government\u2019s debt yield \u2014 or the percentage return demanded by investors for lending to it\u00a0\u2014  briefly climbed Monday, the analysts said, \u201cthe moves haven\u2019t been enormous.\u201d They noted similar market reactions to the prior U.S. credit downgrades, which occurred in 2011 and 2023.",
      "While stock and bond buyers went largely unscathed Monday, home buyers now face higher mortgage costs as a result of the downgrade. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed-rate loan hit as much as 7.04% on Monday, according to Mortgage News Daily. That was the highest level since April 11.",
      "\u201cThe average mortgage lender had to account not only for the market movement in Friday\u2019s closing minutes, but also to the additional weakness seen this morning. That makes for a fairly big jump, day-over-day, but it does very little to change the bigger picture,\u201d Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily, said according to CNBC.",
      "In remarks accompanying its downgrade, Moody\u2019s said America\u2019s ability to control its balance sheet has eroded over the years, something that has forced yields higher.",
      "\u201cSuccessive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,\u201d it said. \u201cWe do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from current fiscal proposals under consideration.\u201d",
      "But while Friday's downgrade garnered international headlines, individual stock buyers continue to prop up the market, helping to counterbalance the declines.",
      "These \"retail\" buyers, who are largely individual investors as opposed to larger firms like pension funds or hedge funds, have fueled the broader market recovery since President Donald Trump's shock \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement sent stocks tumbling.",
      "A popular investment instrument from Vanguard that has become a proxy for retail buying was flat Monday, suggesting there remained little appetite among retail traders for selling.",
      "The U.S. is by no means out of the woods. In the first place, the prior years' downgrades have done little to alter America's fiscal trajectory. Meanwhile, third-party budget experts like the Congressional Budget Office and the Penn Wharton Budget Model say the spending bill sought by Trump now working its way through Congress would likely fail to address the U.S.'  predicament.",
      "As stocks wavered, one of the most prominent voices on Wall Street warned they are likely to go lower. According to CNBC, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon told investors Monday that he believes the odds of stagflation in the U.S. economy, which he described as \"basically a recession with inflation,\u201d are roughly double what the market thinks \u2014\u00a0a scenario Dimon said will cause corporate earnings to decline.",
      "But in a call with reporters Monday, the White House dismissed concerns about the deficit, saying they fail to account for how much growth it says Trump's economic policies could generate and neglect what it says are ongoing government spending cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency and revenue streams from tariffs.",
      "Others remain unconvinced by that rosy picture.",
      "\"In the short run, the U.S. is still the world\u2019s reserve currency and store of wealth,\" Mike Goosay, chief investment officer and global head of fixed income at\u00a0Principal\u00a0Asset Management financial group, wrote in a note to clients.",
      "\"But the bigger issue is long-term,\" he continued. \"If global investors start to question the U.S. role in the global order, that\u2019s when we could see real consequences.\""

      "Federal prosecutors pressed forward in Diddy\u2019s sex trafficking trial today by calling three witnesses who testified to how the music mogul appeared to control his longtime girlfriend, R&B singer and model Casandra Ventura.",
      "As the government\u2019s key witness, Ventura testified in unsparing detail last week about sexual encounters with paid male escorts that she said Diddy forced her to endure under physical and psychological abuse.",
      "With today\u2019s witnesses, the government attempted to bolster its allegations. The last witness of the day, David James, a personal assistant who worked for Diddy from 2007 to 2009, sobbed on the stand as he recounted interviewing for his job: There was a picture of Diddy on the wall, and James said he was told, \u201cThis is Mr. Combs\u2018 kingdom, and we are all here to serve in it.\u201d",
      "Dawn Richard, a singer who worked with Diddy as a member of his girl group, Danity Kane, and the trio Diddy \u2014 Dirty Money, returned to the stand today. \u201cHe would punch her, choke her, drag her, slap her in the mouth,\u201d Richard said of Diddy\u2019s alleged violence against Ventura. She said that Ventura would wear makeup and sunglasses to cover bruises on her face, and that she and another member of Diddy \u2014 Dirty Money wore sunglasses alongside Ventura during a Central Park appearance to support her.Ventura\u2019s former best friend, Kerry Morgan, testified that she witnessed Diddy assault Ventura twice, once in Jamaica and once in Los Angeles. \u201cI heard Cassie screaming, so I ran into the hallway,\u201d Morgan said on the stand about the Jamaica trip, adding that she saw him dragging her by the hair. She also testified that Diddy assaulted her in Ventura\u2019s home, which led to her and Ventura\u2019s friendship falling out.James also testified to the first time he interacted with Ventura as Diddy\u2019s personal assistant. He said Ventura told him, \u201cThis place is crazy,\u201d and when he asked her why she didn\u2019t leave, she said Diddy \u201ccontrols my career, pays my allowance and pays my rent.\u201d He also said he once heard Diddy call Ventura his \u201cqueen\u201d and \u201cvery moldable.\u201d",

      "The view from inside",
      "Diddy\u2019s team brought the heat in today\u2019s line of questioning of Richard, appearing to poke holes in her testimony. It was the first time we\u2019ve seen a very aggressive cross-examination from the defense.",
      "Defense lawyer Nicole Westmoreland had multiple mic-drop moments when she used Richard\u2019s own words against her and suggested inconsistencies in what Richard recalled about an alleged 2009 incident when she said Diddy attacked Ventura with a skillet of eggs. On Friday, Richard testified that Diddy attempted to hit Ventura with the skillet, differing from a previous statement in which Richard said he did hit her and another time when she said Diddy threw eggs before setting the pan down. On redirect, Richard told prosecutor Mitzi Steiner that she tried \u201cto erase those things from my memory,\u201d but \u201cevery day, I remember certain things.\u201d",
      "In other news: Before the jury was brought in for Richard\u2019s testimony,\u00a0Judge Arun Subramanian questioned the value of some of what may be shared on the stand. Testimony that relies on hearsay, he warned,\u00a0\u201cstrikes me as a case built on gossip.\u201d",
      "Marc Agnifilo, one of Diddy\u2019s lawyers, responded that he\u2019s worried that the testimony is being prejudicial to his client. \u201cI think this is becoming sort of a bad act free-for-all,\u201d he said.",
      "Analysis: Is it coercion?",
      "James testified today that he suggested to Ventura she leave the \u201cparty life\u201d with Diddy and that Ventura told him she depended on Diddy for her career, her home and her salary. That may sound like a \u201ccoercive\u201d environment. And, \u201ccoercion\u201d is a necessary element for the sex trafficking charge. But is this the kind of \u201ccoercion\u201d envisioned by the sex trafficking law?",
      "Sex trafficking under the law with which Diddy is charged includes the use \u201cof force, threats of force, fraud, coercion ..., or any combination of such means\u201d \u201cto cause [a] person to engage in a commercial sex act.\u201d The act defines \u201ccoercion\u201d as \u201cthreats of serious harm to or physical restraint against any person\u201d or \u201cany scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person to believe that failure to perform an act would result in serious harm to or physical restraint against any person.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no question Diddy physically abused Ventura. We have seen as much in the infamous hotel beating video. Her testimony about being harmed and restrained would likely satisfy the \u201ccoercion\u201d element. But, would depending on Diddy for her career, her home and her salary be \u201ccoercion\u201d for sex trafficking purposes? Probably not.",
      "The government will surely clarify this in its closing argument: that jurors should focus on the violent coercion, and not be thrown by the defense\u2019s likely argument that mere dependency isn\u2019t enough \u2014 because it isn\u2019t.",
      "What\u2019s next",
      "James returns to the stand tomorrow. Other expected witnesses in the coming days include Sharay Hayes, an exotic dancer; Regina Ventura, the mother of Cassie Ventura; and Jourdan Atkinson, a former personal chef for Diddy.",
      "PSA: Every night during Diddy\u2019s trial, NBC\u2019s \u201cDateline\u201d will drop special episodes of the \u201cTrue Crime Weekly\u201d podcast to get you up to speed on the case. \u201cDateline\u201d correspondent\u00a0Andrea Canning\u00a0chats with NBC News\u2019\u00a0Chloe Melas\u00a0and special guests \u2014 right in front of the courthouse.\u00a0Listen here."

President Trump and Secretary Noem will not allow criminal gangs to terrorize American citizens.\u201d",
      "The statement did not offer any additional evidence linking any of the refugees deported to CECOT to Tren de Aragua or to criminal activity of any kind. However, the official added: \u201cWe are confident in our law enforcement\u2019s intelligence, and we aren\u2019t going to share intelligence reports and undermine national security every time a gang member denies he is one. That would be insane.\u201d",
      "The Department of Homeland Security document explaining the reasons for Agelviz\u2019s detention indicates that he had no criminal record or incriminating information in his social media. It lists no evidence of gang affiliation beyond his tattoos.",
      "Those tattoos, Sanguino said, are references to her son\u2019s childhood: his grandmother\u2019s rose garden and an owl that visited their home every night at 3 a.m., which is the time shown on the clock.",
      "\u201cI never approved of the tattoos,\u201d Sanguino said. \u201cBut he asked me so much that when he turned 18, I finally said, \u2018Go ahead, but I don\u2019t want to see them.\u2019\u201d",
      "Agelviz also tattooed his mother\u2019s name and his brothers\u2019 initials on his arm. \u201cHe thought because he got my name tattooed that I wouldn\u2019t get mad at him,\u201d she said. Her two younger sons do not have tattoos.",
      "The family were living in Ecuador when they applied for refugee status and went through the screening process, which lasted around 10 months and involved several in-person interviews during which Agelviz was asked about his tattoos. They had fled Venezuela for reasons they asked not to divulge to protect family members still at risk.",
      "The refugee program is reserved for people fleeing armed conflict and targeted persecution; it is rarely granted to Venezuelans or other migrants from the Americas, and it is typically associated with people fleeing war in the Middle East and Africa.",
      "Like all loved ones of men deported to CECOT, Sanguino has had no contact with her son for more than two months.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for me as a mother to have to imagine the situation my son is in without being able to do anything about it, without knowing how he is,\u201d she said. \u201cHow is his health, how is he eating, what is going through his mind?\u201d",
      "The first and only glimpse at the conditions under which the men are being held came last week, when former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., as part of his show on One America News, accompanied a congressional delegation to the wing of CECOT holding Venezuelan deportees. (No other media outlets have been allowed access to that wing of the facility.) The prisoners there repeatedly shouted \u201cLiberty!\u201d and made the international hand signal for help.",
      "Watching the video, Sanguino said, only made things harder.",
      "\u201cI eat and I feel guilty, because I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s eating, or if he\u2019s eating,\u201d Sanguino said. She often wakes up anxious thinking of him. \u201cAnd I want to think that it\u2019s a nightmare but feel sad every time I remember that it\u2019s reality.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Details released so far about former President Joe Biden\u2019s prostate cancer diagnosis suggest his case is uncommon but not unheard of, according to doctors who treat the disease.",
      "Biden, 82, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer on Friday, following the discovery of a nodule on his prostate, his personal office said in a statement. The cancer has spread to the bone, his office said, but seems likely to respond to treatment.",
      "Most cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed at an early stage, often with the help of routine screenings involving blood tests or rectal exams.",
      "But in around 8% of cases, the cancer has already metastasized \u2014 or spread to other organs \u2014 by the time it\u2019s diagnosed. At that point, the patient has likely had prostate cancer for several years to a decade, multiple oncologists said.",
      "In Biden\u2019s case, \u201cwe definitely would anticipate that he has had prostate cancer for many, many years,\u201d said Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer for the American Cancer Society.",
      "There are exceptions, however.",
      "\u201cMost prostate cancers are slow-growing, but some people can develop a high-risk cancer that happens relatively quickly and can spread quickly,\u201d said Dr. Alon Weizer, a urologist and chief medical officer of Mount Sinai Medical Center. \u201cIs that super common? No. But it can occur and it all depends on the underlying biology of that individual cancer.\u201d",
      "Though screenings can help with early detection, medical professionals don\u2019t always agree on who should get screened for prostate cancer.",
      "Many doctors do not screen men in their late 70s or 80s, since those individuals are likely to die of another medical condition before they die of prostate cancer. But as people continue to live longer, some doctors feel that screenings are appropriate for older men in good health.",
      "The American Cancer Society recommends that men in their 50s and 60s get screened every two years. Men whose blood tests show elevated levels of prostate-specific antigen, a protein produced by the prostate gland, should get annual screenings, according to the ACS. And men with a higher risk of prostate cancer, such as African Americans or those with a family history of the disease, should start screenings in their 40s.",
      "But the current guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \u2014 an independent panel of experts whose recommendations often determine whether screenings are covered by insurance \u2014 say that men ages 55 to 69 should merely discuss getting a blood test with their physician. The task force is weighing new guidelines for prostate cancer screenings, with many doctors calling for a more expansive and emphatic recommendation.",
      "Weizer said doctors used to screen more widely for prostate cancer in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which led to diagnosing and treating cases that might not have otherwise impacted a person\u2019s life. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force from 2012 to 2018 recommended against blood tests that helped identify prostate cancer, which led to a drop-off in screenings.",
      "\u201cProstate cancer is an unusual type of cancer in the sense that we now know there\u2019s a lot of prostate cancers that will never cause a problem in a person,\u201d Weizer said. \u201cSo you don\u2019t really even want to find those cancers. You want to find the ones that are going to behave more aggressively.\u201d",
      "In recent years, he said, the pendulum has swung back in the direction of more screenings, as doctors have gotten better at knowing which cases to treat and which to monitor over time.",
      "But Dahut said there\u2019s still some lingering concerns among patients and physicians that the benefits of screening don\u2019t outweigh the risks of overdiagnosis or overtreatment. Screening rates have steadily declined since 2012 \u2014 which Dahut said has contributed, in part, to a 5% annual increase in men being diagnosed with more advanced prostate cancer.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether Biden has been screened for prostate cancer in recent years. His annual physical exam in February 2024 did not indicate that a screening had taken place, though it would not have been expected for his age. According to his physical exam from 2019, he had an enlarged prostate, but had not been diagnosed with prostate cancer by that point.",
      "Dr. David Shusterman, a New York-based urologist, said Biden\u2019s advanced diagnosis would be considered unusual for someone who was screened regularly.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s rare to present with bone [metastasis] \u2026 in someone who\u2019s checking with their urologist once a year,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this 25 years and I\u2019ve never had a patient like that.\u201d",
      "The diagnosis is more common in patients who don\u2019t regularly see a doctor, he added. That was the case with Rick Gum, who had never been screened before he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2018. Gum, the 73-year-old owner of a trucking company in Big Rock, Illinois, originally sought care for a hernia, only to learn he had aggressive cancer that had spread to his bones.",
      "\u201cI learned the hard way,\u201d he said. \u201cI should have been going to the doctor.\u201d",
      "Gum said his cancer was too far progressed to receive standard treatments, so he participated in various clinical trials at Northwestern Medicine involving chemotherapy, radiation and a pharmaceutical drug containing radioactive isotopes.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had seven good years since they diagnosed me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been quality years. I ride motorcycles. We travel some. I love my job. I\u2019ve been able to do it all.\u201d",
      "Around 37% of patients whose prostate cancer has metastasized survive at least five years after their diagnosis, according to the American Cancer Society.",
      "Dr. Peter Nelson, vice president of precision oncology at Fred Hutch Cancer Center, said patients like Biden have a more than 90% chance of responding to therapies that lower testosterone \u2014 a hormone that can feed the cancer\u2019s growth. These so-called hormone therapies often come in the form of an injection or pill.",
      "\u201cMost likely, he will get multiple medications at the initiation of his therapy, and could expect several years of response to that therapy before that cancer becomes resistant,\u201d Nelson said. Some patients receive chemotherapy or radiation at the same time or following hormone therapy, he added.",
      "Biden and his family are considering \u201cmultiple treatment options,\u201d including hormone therapy, according to a source familiar with the family\u2019s thinking."

    "story": [
      "A bombing this weekend at a fertility clinic in California\u00a0is raising fears that the threat of violence that has long loomed over abortion providers is now extending to other areas of reproductive health.",
      "Authorities said four people were injured when a car bomb exploded outside the American Reproductive Centers clinic in Palm Springs Saturday, and the 25-year-old suspect was killed. The facility was badly damaged in the blast.",
      "Law enforcement officials said the suspect\u2019s writings expressed anti-natalist views, a belief that procreation is morally wrong. They characterized the blast as an act of terrorism and said it was believed to be an isolated incident.",
      "But security experts and women\u2019s health advocates said the violence should serve as a wake-up call for all fertility facilities, especially as reproductive issues \u2014 not just abortion \u2014 have become increasingly politicized.",
      "Several high-profile fertility clinics across the country declined to comment for this article out of fear that publicly discussing security concerns could draw unnecessary attention or increase their vulnerability to copycat attacks.",
      "Philip Klein, a security consultant and president of Texas-based Klein Investigations, said Monday he was fielding calls from clients at multiple reproductive health sites who have asked for advice following the attack.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s a little bit nervous right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I am deathly scared about is that we may see this escalate.\u201d",
      "While abortion clinics have faced safety threats for decades, fertility clinics have generally been insulated. But in recent years, particularly since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, in vitro fertilization \u2014 an assisted reproductive technology that tens of thousands of patients use to start families every year \u2014 has drawn scrutiny, too, with embryos a new target, in part from antiabortion organizations that believe embryos should have the same legal rights as people.",
      "Last year, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos created through IVF were considered children under state law, a decision that exposed families and clinics to potential criminal charges or damages.",
      "In response, the state\u2019s largest hospital and at least two other providers paused IVF treatments. The issue made national news and became a major talking point in the 2024 presidential election, with Democrats seizing on the potential for more fallout. The state later passed a bill granting immunity, civil and criminal, for providers and patients.",
      "Eric Sean Clay, former president of the International Association for Healthcare Security and Safety, a professional safety guideline organization, said he was confident other fertility clinics would seek to bolster their protections after the attack in California, even if they hadn\u2019t considered extra precautions before.",
      "\u201cWhen we think of this level of violence, we think about abortion clinics. We don\u2019t think about IVF clinics,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they see that there\u2019s a potential vulnerability or threat, they move very quickly to try to address it.\u201d",
      "He advised clinics to take a holistic approach to security: forging relationships with local law enforcement agencies, securing the exteriors of their buildings with buzzer access, installing fences around the facilities, prohibiting overnight parking and ensuring there is adequate lighting in the clinics, among other measures.",
      "Klein said that, aside from increasing security, enforcing basic rules is helpful.",
      "\u201cI know it\u2019s so clich\u00e9: If you see something, say something. Have eyes in your building,\u201d he said.",
      "Saturday\u2019s bombing has cast a dark shadow on not just providers but also those who seek out fertility treatments, said Barbara Collura, president and CEO of Resolve, a national infertility advocacy group. She said the violence has added an extra emotional burden that families dealing with infertility already face.",
      "She said in a statement to NBC News that it was \u201cdeeply distressing members of our community, many of whom are navigating complex treatment regimens to try to build their families.\u201d Her organization was also contacting clinics to gauge how they plan to ensure the continued safety of patients and the embryos they entrust with their fertility doctors.",
      "While violence at fertility clinics is unusual, attacks on abortion clinics and providers are becoming alarmingly common. Of the more than 1,600 death threats or threats of harm since 1977, nearly 300 occurred in 2023 and 2024, according to the National Abortion Federation, which monitors incidents of harassment against abortion providers.",
      "And those opposed to abortion often take issue with other reproductive rights, too, said Melissa Fowler, chief program officer and head of the security team at the National Abortion Federation.",
      "\u201cWe know that opposition to abortion is not just about abortion,\u201d\u00a0she said, adding that she was worried that other reproductive health sites could face increased threats.",
      "She said IVF clinics could learn from abortion providers who consider security at every stage, from selecting locations for their clinics where patients can walk in without intimidation and harassment to installing bulletproof glass and regularly training employees on how to respond to threats.",
      "\u201cGiven this incident and given the environment that we\u2019re in, I think there\u2019s a lot that people can learn from abortion providers, and people should be doing everything they can to think about safety in a proactive way,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really unfortunate and unacceptable that we even have to have this conversation.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 An initial wave of bipartisan sympathy for Joe Biden\u2019s cancer diagnosis has started to ebb, giving way to suggestions from Donald Trump\u2019s allies that the former president\u2019s inner circle masked his condition while he was in office to create an illusion that he was still up to the job.",
      "In a social media post Sunday showing a picture of Biden with the caption, \u201cPolitics aside, we wish him a speedy recovery,\u201d the president\u2019s eldest son, Don Trump Jr., wrote, \u201cAgreed 100%.\u201d",
      "Come Monday, he posted a darker message: \u201cEveryone was in on the coverup! Who was running the country? We need accountability!\u201d",

      "The revelation Sunday that Biden, 82, is suffering from an aggressive form of prostate cancer has rekindled the old accusations at an especially inopportune time for his inner circle and Democrats more broadly.",
      "Fresh reporting suggests that Biden\u2019s decline was more pronounced than previously known and that protective advisers misled the public about his health.",
      "The alarming news of Biden\u2019s illness, coupled with the damage to Biden-world\u2019s credibility when it comes to his fitness, are the tinder for unfounded speculation that he knew he was sick and concealed it until he left office.",
      "Speaking to reporters on Monday, Trump said, \u201cI think it\u2019s very sad, actually. I\u2019m surprised that ... the public wasn\u2019t notified a long time ago because to get to stage nine [the stage of disease that Biden faces is] a long time.\"",
      "He added that \u201csomebody is not telling the facts. \u2026 It\u2019s a big problem.\u201d",
      "Vice President JD Vance told reporters Monday that he hoped Biden \u201cmakes the right recovery.\u201d But Vance then pivoted to Trump-world\u2019s familiar talking point: \u201cWe really do need to be honest about whether the former president was capable of doing the job.\u201d",
      "Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., called the timing of Biden\u2019s announcement \u201cinteresting,\u201d suggesting it was an attempt to \u201cdistract the American people\u201d from a tough news cycle.",
      "Former Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., who ran against Biden in the 2024 Democratic primary, also suggested that the former president held off in revealing his diagnosis for strategic reasons, looking to blunt the latest round of attacks on his competence.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s coincidental that this was announced this week,\u201d Phillips told The New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to comport otherwise.\u201d",
      "Biden hasn\u2019t revealed much about the diagnosis, apart from a social media post on X thanking people for their \u201clove and support.\u201d His office released a statement saying the cancer had spread beyond the prostate, but that the illness could be managed through treatment.",
      "As president, Biden received regular physicals attesting to his health and was under constant watch from the White House medical team. Given the care and attention he received, the advanced state of the illness left some medical experts surprised.",
      "Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist who served on the Biden transition\u2019s Covid advisory board, said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d Monday that the cancer had likely been \u201cgrowing there and spreading\u201d for years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little surprising to many of us oncologists that he wasn\u2019t diagnosed earlier,\u201d said Emanuel, who was not part of Biden\u2019s personal medical team.",
      "One former Biden aide, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, said the ex-president would be better served if he answered a few pressing questions: Why was the cancer detected late, did doctors test for it earlier and what are Biden\u2019s prospects for recovery?",
      "\u201cLast week, President Joe Biden was seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms,\u201d a statement from Biden\u2019s personal office said. \u201cOn Friday, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone. While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management. The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.\u201d",

      "\u201cUnbelievable this was missed, but the truth is, his physician was more concerned about assisting with the political coverup than providing world class medical care.\u201d",
      "Some of Biden\u2019s detractors point to a public appearance in 2022 in which he mentioned that he had cancer, portraying it as a clue that explains his current illness. Yet at the time, a White House spokesman clarified that Biden was referring to skin cancer that had been removed before he took office.",
      "Steve Schale, who headed a super PAC backing Biden in 2020, rejected Republican suggestions that Biden\u2019s latest disclosure was part of some sort of conspiracy.",
      "\u201cPeople can talk about the other stuff all they want, but I don\u2019t know that the two things have any connection whatsoever at all,\u201d Schale said. \u201cJust because Republicans say it does, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s actually a thing.\u201d",

She also testified that Diddy assaulted her in Ventura\u2019s home, which led to her and Ventura\u2019s friendship falling out.",
      "James also testified to the first time he interacted with Ventura as Diddy\u2019s personal assistant. He said Ventura told him, \u201cThis place is crazy,\u201d and when he asked her why she didn\u2019t leave, she said Diddy \u201ccontrols my career, pays my allowance and pays my rent.\u201d He also said he once heard Diddy call Ventura his \u201cqueen\u201d and \u201cvery moldable.\u201d",
      "The view from inside",
      "Diddy\u2019s team brought the heat in today\u2019s line of questioning of Richard, appearing to poke holes in her testimony. It was the first time we\u2019ve seen a very aggressive cross-examination from the defense.",
      "Defense lawyer Nicole Westmoreland had multiple mic-drop moments when she used Richard\u2019s own words against her and suggested inconsistencies in what Richard recalled about an alleged 2009 incident when she said Diddy attacked Ventura with a skillet of eggs. On Friday, Richard testified that Diddy attempted to hit Ventura with the skillet, differing from a previous statement in which Richard said he did hit her and another time when she said Diddy threw eggs before setting the pan down. On redirect, Richard told prosecutor Mitzi Steiner that she tried \u201cto erase those things from my memory,\u201d but \u201cevery day, I remember certain things.\u201d",
      "In other news: Before the jury was brought in for Richard\u2019s testimony,\u00a0Judge Arun Subramanian questioned the value of some of what may be shared on the stand. Testimony that relies on hearsay, he warned,\u00a0\u201cstrikes me as a case built on gossip.\u201d",
      "Marc Agnifilo, one of Diddy\u2019s lawyers, responded that he\u2019s worried that the testimony is being prejudicial to his client. \u201cI think this is becoming sort of a bad act free-for-all,\u201d he said.",
      "Analysis: Is it coercion?",
      "James testified today that he suggested to Ventura she leave the \u201cparty life\u201d with Diddy and that Ventura told him she depended on Diddy for her career, her home and her salary. That may sound like a \u201ccoercive\u201d environment. And, \u201ccoercion\u201d is a necessary element for the sex trafficking charge. But is this the kind of \u201ccoercion\u201d envisioned by the sex trafficking law?",
      "Sex trafficking under the law with which Diddy is charged includes the use \u201cof force, threats of force, fraud, coercion ..., or any combination of such means\u201d \u201cto cause [a] person to engage in a commercial sex act.\u201d The act defines \u201ccoercion\u201d as \u201cthreats of serious harm to or physical restraint against any person\u201d or \u201cany scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person to believe that failure to perform an act would result in serious harm to or physical restraint against any person.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no question Diddy physically abused Ventura. We have seen as much in the infamous hotel beating video. Her testimony about being harmed and restrained would likely satisfy the \u201ccoercion\u201d element. But, would depending on Diddy for her career, her home and her salary be \u201ccoercion\u201d for sex trafficking purposes? Probably not.",
      "The government will surely clarify this in its closing argument: that jurors should focus on the violent coercion, and not be thrown by the defense\u2019s likely argument that mere dependency isn\u2019t enough \u2014 because it isn\u2019t.",
      "What\u2019s next",
      "James returns to the stand tomorrow. Other expected witnesses in the coming days include Sharay Hayes, an exotic dancer; Regina Ventura, the mother of Cassie Ventura; and Jourdan Atkinson, a former personal chef for Diddy.",
      "PSA: Every night during Diddy\u2019s trial, NBC\u2019s \u201cDateline\u201d will drop special episodes of the \u201cTrue Crime Weekly\u201d podcast to get you up to speed on the case. \u201cDateline\u201d correspondent\u00a0Andrea Canning\u00a0chats with NBC News\u2019\u00a0Chloe Melas\u00a0and special guests \u2014 right in front of the courthouse.\u00a0Listen here."

      "3 sticky issues facing Trump's big bill \u2014 and how GOP leaders are trying to resolve them",
      "It\u2019s a huge week for House Republicans as they seek to pass a massive bill for President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda through their narrow majority along party lines, as various factions of holdouts continue to demand changes.",
      "GOP leaders cleared an important hurdle late Sunday night, when four conservative hard-liners on the House Budget Committee relented and allowed the bill to advance after blocking it two days earlier. Now the package goes to the Rules Committee, where party leaders want to make changes and meet Wednesday at 1 a.m. ET to send it to the floor.",
      "And Trump is getting involved in the final push ahead of Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s Memorial Day deadline: He\u2019s expected to join a House Republican conference meeting Tuesday morning.",
      "Medicaid cuts and limits: Conservatives have complained about provisions in the bill that front-load benefits and delay the spending cuts. That includes cuts to Medicaid \u2014 in the form of stricter work requirements that were slated to begin in 2029, among other things. To appease right-wing holdouts, that date will move to the beginning of 2027, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said Monday on CNBC.",
      "But would that cost votes among more moderate Republicans? Scalise didn\u2019t make any guarantees that they\u2019d stay on board, saying only that leadership is \u201ctalking to all those members\u201d about it, and that \u201ceverybody knew this was something that we were working on.\u201d",
      "It will be a difficult balance to strike as swing-district Republicans are already facing political attacks over the Medicaid cuts.",
      "Clean energy cuts: There\u2019s a similar dilemma on clean energy funding cuts. The legislation repeals major pieces of the Inflation Reduction Act, which Democrats passed in 2022 along party lines, that provide funding and tax credits to promote clean energy",
      "But conservatives want to be more aggressive in rolling back the money, in part to reduce the added red ink under the bill. The problem is a lot of the funds benefit red and purple districts represented by Republicans. And politically endangered members don\u2019t like taking funds away. GOP leaders need to find a way to placate both those factions.",
      "SALT deduction: The state and local tax deduction has become perhaps the biggest nuisance for party leaders. It is a unique problem because a group of blue-state Republicans have insisted on a significant expansion of the SALT deduction of $10,000 per tax filer, which the party instituted in 2017.",
      "Top Republicans have offered to raise it to $30,000, but that\u2019s still not enough for a handful of members who have made it a red line to win their support for the bill. Raising the deduction is expensive, and risks alienating not just ultra-conservative members but other center-right Republicans in districts where SALT isn\u2019t a big issue.",
      "Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., the loudest GOP voice advocating a bigger SALT deduction, has even suggested raising marginal tax rates on the wealthy in order to help finance it. That idea is strongly opposed by many in the party.",
      "Trump taps his most trusted officials to do as many as four jobs \u2014 at the same time",
      "President Donald Trump has taken some Cabinet members and senior administration officials and layered on additional work that calls for wholly different sets of skills.",
      "The dual postings give rise to a tangle of managerial challenges, constitutional questions and potential conflicts of interest, critics contend.",
      "Jamieson Greer: As U.S. trade representative, Greer has been flying around the world to negotiate with countries over the tariffs that the president imposed. On top of that, he is the government\u2019s official watchdog. The White House has appointed Greer both acting director of the Office of Government Ethics and acting head of the Office of Special Counsel.",
      "Daniel Driscoll: He is not only secretary of the Army, but the acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The first job is about keeping soldiers in fighting trim; the second includes cracking down on contraband cigarettes.",

He is also the acting administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development \u2014 or what\u2019s left of it after the Trump administration effectively dismantled it.",
      "Todd Blanche: In addition to being deputy attorney general, Trump recently named Blanche as the acting head of the Library of Congress.

      "The April surge in mortgage rates did have a direct effect on the housing market, causing it to pull back right in the heart of the usually busy spring season. Pending sales of existing homes in April, counted by signed contracts, dropped 3.2% compared with April of last\u00a0year, according to Realtor.com.",

      "There was a bit of a comeback in\u00a0mortgage demand from homebuyers in the first two weeks of May, according to a weekly index from the Mortgage Bankers Association, but that was when rates were just sitting right around 6.9%. There has been a marked slowdown among buyers recently, whenever the rate goes over that 7% threshold. In addition, any rate increase will knock some people out of even qualifying for a mortgage.",

      "James Lee, president of the Identity Theft Resource Center, said it\u2019s not unusual for scammers to take a government action \u2014 whether that\u2019s a new program or policy \u2014 and use it for the basis of a scam.",
      "Scammers \u201cwill use the fact that people don\u2019t know a lot about tariffs,\u201d Lee said.",
      "The PreCrime Labs team at BforeAI, a cybersecurity company,\u00a0discovered\u00a0about 300 domain registrations from cybercriminals related to tariffs in the first few months of the year. Some spread misinformation while others are financial scams aimed at businesses and consumers.",
      "One site the company found was a newly registered phishing domain positioned to lead consumers to believe they are required to make payments to a legitimate governmental entity.",
      "\u201cSuch payment requests are likely to be spread using email or messaging campaigns with a theme of urgent, pending payments, directing victims to the fraudulent site where their actions will result in financial losses,\u201d researchers noted.",
      "Some package payment requests are real",
      "There are some cases where consumers might legitimately pay for products purchased from another country, namely, customs duties. Sometimes the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will\u00a0charge consumers a processing fee\u00a0in order to release an imported good.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not common, but it\u2019s also not unusual,\u201d said Lee. \u201cIt really does depend on what it is, where it\u2019s coming from.\u201d",
      "Some consumers have also recently reported receiving\u00a0legitimate payment requests\u00a0from carrier companies after a purchase in order to receive their shipments, the Washington Post reports.",
      "Some carriers are acting as the importer of record, meaning they are responsible for any duties, taxes and fees that are applied to the delivery, said Bernie Hart, vice president of customs of Flexport, a logistics firm.",
      "If the carrier did not collect those additional fees for the product up front, the carrier will charge the end consumer those additional costs through a follow-up bill, he said.",
      "This tactic might not last, because it creates a lot of inconvenience for both companies and shoppers, Hart said: \u201cIt\u2019s not good for anybody in this process to give somebody a surprise bill.\u201d",
      "Tariff scam red flags",
      "It\u2019s easy for anyone to fall victim to a fraud scheme, said Ruth Susswein, director of consumer protection at Consumer Action.",
      "If tariff policies continue to be in flux for longer, criminals will have more time to craft sophisticated attacks on consumers, said the ITRC\u2019s Lee.",
      "Your top priority is to avoid sharing personal information like Social Security numbers, bank details or account login credentials, especially under the guise of \u201ctariff processing,\u201d said Payton.",
      "Here are three red flags to watch out for, according to scam experts:",
      "1. Unsolicited and urgent messages",
      "Emails, texts, or social media ads promising \u201ctariff relief,\u201d \u201cvouchers,\u201d \u201cexemptions,\u201d or urgent offers like \u201cpay now to avoid tariffs\u201d are likely scams, Payton said.",
      "Not only are legitimate retailers unlikely to encourage tariff evasion tactics, but also the urgency is meant to pressure consumers into accepting, she said.",
      "Also question unsolicited phone calls, emails or text messages about a package held up in the post office because of an unpaid fee, said Lee.",
      "If you receive a request to pay import fees or duties on a purchase, look for the\u00a0form 7501, which is an official government document detailing the import, said Hart.",
      "2. Suspicious site links, emails",
      "Scammers will create fake websites, emails and phone numbers to mimic retailers or government agencies, Payton said. If you receive a message, check for misspellings and URLs or email addresses that don\u2019t match that of the supposed company or entity \u2014 say, a message from a \u201cU.S. government official\u201d that does not come from a dot-gov email.",
      "You can use tools like WHOIS, a database that stores information about registered domain names and IP addresses, to authenticate the website and confirm registration details, she said.",
      "3. Lack of transparency",
      "Reputable merchants would clearly label tariff-related fees at checkout and provide contact information for inquiries, Payton said. Otherwise, the \u201clack of transparency is a red flag.\u201d",

The radio outage will affect transmitters across northern and central Alabama, including in Winfield, Oneonta, Birmingham, Anniston, Tuscaloosa, Demopolis, Selma, Montgomery, Auburn and Texasville.",
      "The NWS did not immediately return a request for comment, but the agency said in a statement online that its forecast office in Birmingham will remain open and staffed while the software update takes place. Forecast operations will also be performed with a backup office in Peachtree City, Georgia, \u201cto minimize any potential interruption to services.\u201d",
      "NOAA Weather Radio is a national network of radio stations that broadcast official forecasts, weather warnings and other information from the National Weather Service. The 24/7 service also broadcasts warnings and information on other types of hazards, including earthquakes, avalanches, oil spills and public safety announcements.",

      "While this week\u2019s radio outages coincide with bad weather in Alabama, it\u2019s hardly the only state that is forecasted to get walloped with extreme weather.",
      "Around 31 million people are at risk of severe storms Monday within a band of the country that extends from central Texas north to Iowa. Damaging winds, large hail and several strong tornadoes are possible from Monday afternoon through the evening.",
      "On Tuesday, the risk of severe storms will shift slightly, from Louisiana north to Indiana, where large hail, damaging winds and several strong tornadoes will be possible once again.",
      "Meanwhile, a heat wave is bringing temperatures in the upper 90s or triple digits to Texas and parts of Florida early this week.",
      "These warnings come after a violent weekend of storms that resulted in tornado reports in at least 10 different states, including Texas, Kansas, Missouri and Kentucky. At least 28 weather-related deaths were confirmed over the weekend.",
      "The deadly storms struck as NOAA is scrambling to fill crucial forecasting jobs around the country after the Trump administration made deep cuts at the National Weather Service. Critics have said staffing shortages at the NWS could have major public safety consequences, particularly as hurricane season approaches, wildfires ramp up and extreme heat takes hold this summer."

    "story": [
      "Investors largely shrugged off a downgrade of the U.S.' credit rating in Monday trading, as stocks ended the day mostly flat.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average added more than 130 points for an increase of 0.32%. The broader S&P closed up 0.09% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.02%.",
      "Late Friday, Moody\u2019s became the third and final major ratings agency to downgrade U.S. debt, reducing it by one notch from AAA to Aa1. Credit ratings agencies help determine how reliably a country can pay off its debt.",
      "Yet the market for U.S. government debt has so far remained mostly stable. As of 4 p.m., the yield on the 10-year Treasury note \u2014 the government\u2019s benchmark loan asset \u2014 was only a few percentage points above where it traded Friday, climbing to 4.46%. That remans well below the most recent high of 4.59% briefly seen last month.",
      "\u201cThe downgrade itself doesn\u2019t seem so far to have made much of a market splash,\u201d analysts at the Capital Economics research consultancy wrote in a note.",
      "While the government\u2019s debt yield \u2014 or the percentage return demanded by investors for lending to it\u00a0\u2014  briefly climbed Monday, the analysts said, \u201cthe moves haven\u2019t been enormous.\u201d They noted similar market reactions to the prior U.S. credit downgrades, which occurred in 2011 and 2023.",
      "While stock and bond buyers went largely unscathed Monday, home buyers now face higher mortgage costs as a result of the downgrade. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed-rate loan hit as much as 7.04% on Monday, according to Mortgage News Daily. That was the highest level since April 11.",
      "\u201cThe average mortgage lender had to account not only for the market movement in Friday\u2019s closing minutes, but also to the additional weakness seen this morning. That makes for a fairly big jump, day-over-day, but it does very little to change the bigger picture,\u201d Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily, said according to CNBC.",
      "In remarks accompanying its downgrade, Moody\u2019s said America\u2019s ability to control its balance sheet has eroded over the years, something that has forced yields higher.",
      "\u201cSuccessive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,\u201d it said. \u201cWe do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from current fiscal proposals under consideration.\u201d",
      "But while Friday's downgrade garnered international headlines, individual stock buyers continue to prop up the market, helping to counterbalance the declines.",
      "These \"retail\" buyers, who are largely individual investors as opposed to larger firms like pension funds or hedge funds, have fueled the broader market recovery since President Donald Trump's shock \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement sent stocks tumbling.",
      "A popular investment instrument from Vanguard that has become a proxy for retail buying was flat Monday, suggesting there remained little appetite among retail traders for selling.",
      "The U.S. is by no means out of the woods. In the first place, the prior years' downgrades have done little to alter America's fiscal trajectory. Meanwhile, third-party budget experts like the Congressional Budget Office and the Penn Wharton Budget Model say the spending bill sought by Trump now working its way through Congress would likely fail to address the U.S.'  predicament.",
      "As stocks wavered, one of the most prominent voices on Wall Street warned they are likely to go lower. According to CNBC, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon told investors Monday that he believes the odds of stagflation in the U.S. economy, which he described as \"basically a recession with inflation,\u201d are roughly double what the market thinks \u2014\u00a0a scenario Dimon said will cause corporate earnings to decline.",
      "But in a call with reporters Monday, the White House dismissed concerns about the deficit, saying they fail to account for how much growth it says Trump's economic policies could generate and neglect what it says are ongoing government spending cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency and revenue streams from tariffs.",
      "Others remain unconvinced by that rosy picture.",
      "\"In the short run, the U.S. is still the world\u2019s reserve currency and store of wealth,\" Mike Goosay, chief investment officer and global head of fixed income at\u00a0Principal\u00a0Asset Management financial group, wrote in a note to clients.",

      "Investment banking revenue is headed for a \u201cmid-teens\u201d percentage decline in the second quarter compared with the year-earlier period, while trading revenue was trending higher by a \u201cmid-to-high\u201d single digit percentage, said Troy Rohrbaugh, a co-head of the firm\u2019s commercial and investment bank.",
      "On the ever-present question of Dimon\u2019s timeline to hand over the CEO reins to one of his deputies, Dimon said that nothing changed from his\u00a0guidance last year, when he said he would likely remain for less than five more years.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m here for four more years, and maybe two more\u201d as executive chairman, Dimon said, \u201cthat\u2019s a long time.\u201d",

Joel wordlessly answers all her questions by shaking his head or nodding.",
      "\u201cMaking a cure would have killed you,\u201d Joel says.",

      "Later, Lowe sat down with TODAY.com to answer a burning question on everyone\u2019s mind: Will there be a sequel to the 1985 movie \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire\u201d?",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a script due any minute,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cAnd hopefully it will be good, and we\u2019ll go off and make it.\u201d",
      "He also revealed which of the cast members were interested in returning and, apparently, it looks like all of them are on board.",
      "\u201cEverybody wants to do it,\u201d he told TODAY.com.",
      "Lowe also took a few minutes to chat about the plot of his upcoming horror film, \u201cThe Third Parent,\u201d which will be released later this year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very, very creepy. It\u2019s based on sort of a sub Reddit thread. It\u2019s like a grassroots cult legend,\u201d he said of the new movie.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s basically about a stranger that gets into our house and holds us captive while he teaches us how to be a \u2018good family.\u2019 Let\u2019s just say that the lessons are not ones you would like to have taught to you.\u201d",

      "At just 20 years old, Ilia Malinin has already made history. In 2022, the champion men\u2019s figure skater became the first \u2014 and only \u2014 skater to ever land a quadruple axel in competition.",
      "\u201cI had many emotions going through my head. It was crazy, like, just landing it. I felt really relieved, and I was excited that it happened,\u201d Malinin told TODAY.com on Monday.",
      "\u201cBut I knew I had the rest of the performance to go. So, I was like, \u2018OK, I landed it, I have to put it aside for now and keep going.\u2019 But once the program ended, I was really happy for it.\u201d",
      "In 2024, he took home the men\u2019s singles title at the World Figure Skating Championships and did it yet again in March of this year. Next stop? He\u2019s eyeing the Winter Olympic Games in Milan.",
      "Competing on the world stage is, of course, no easy feat. How does Malinin keep his stress in check?",
      "\u201cFor me, music helps a lot,\u201d he explained. \u201cJust being able to listen to different types of music to either calm myself down or get myself into the right mood and the right mindset is what I use before my competitions.\u201d",

      "Whiskey is the comedian\u2019s latest passion, and during a conversation Monday with TODAY.com, Gaffigan explained why he decided to embark on the venture.",
      "\u201cThe bourbon thing \u2014 that\u2019s just for fun,\u201d he said. \u201cThe great irony is that people are like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re doing this to make money.\u2019\u201d But the truth is that he actually just loves American whiskey culture and finds the distilling process fascinating.",
      "\u201cSometimes people on social media are like, \u2018I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re lowering yourself to sell alcohol.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018It\u2019s even worse than that; I\u2019m not doing it for the money,\u2019\u201d he laughed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like gardening,\u201d he said about his other great passion. \u201cAnyone who gardens is losing money.\u201d",
      "Yet he loves it.",
      "\u201cSome of it\u2019s luck, some of it\u2019s hard work and some of it\u2019s self-education,\u201d Gaffigan explained.",
      "Either way, both of his current hobbies offer the occasional reprieve from his full-time job parenting his five children, all of whom are between ages 12 and 21.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like living in a psych ward,\u201d he joked with TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cThe task and sacrifice of parents of most teenagers, it\u2019s enormous,\u201d Gaffigan said. He added that getting into the minds of teenagers can be tricky business.",

      "Blake Shelton considers himself a \u2018traditional\u2019 country artist. But his new single \u2018Texas\u2019 is \u2018different than anything\u2019  he\u2019s done before",
      "Blake Shelton just dropped his 13th studio album, \u201cFor Recreational Use Only,\u201d a project he told TODAY.com was four years in the making. On Tuesday, he hit the plaza for TODAY\u2019s Citi Concert Series and later told us about how this album came together.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really think of the album as, like, inspired by anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always kind of just approached making an album \u2014 just find the best songs I can possibly get my hands on, you know? I never set out with a direction.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s probably why my music\u2019s been all over the map for my entire career,\u201d he added, laughing.",
      "When compiling the myriad of songs for an album, Shelton said he looks for \u201ca great lyric\u201d or \u201csomething that\u2019s challenging as a vocalist.\u201d",
      "At the same time, Shelton noted that he aims to remain true to himself as an artist through the process.",
      "\u201cWho I am as a country artist, I think I lean more traditional, probably, but I\u2019m always trying to find something new, push the boundaries a little bit,\u201d he said.",
      "Shelton joked that he\u2019s \u201cway behind when you listen to the radio,\u201d but he\u2019s still always searching for \u201cwhat the next thing is.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think \u2018Texas\u2019 is a good example of that, way different than anything I\u2019ve done before,\u201d he said of his new single.",

      "Annie Murphy, who won an Emmy Award for her role as Alexis on the beloved sitcom \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek,\u201d weighed in on fans never-ending question: Will there be a reboot?",
      "\u201cListen, I want that as badly as other people seem to. I\u2019m not going to stop trying to manifest that,\u201d she told TODAY.com on Tuesday.",
      "Whether another version of \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d ever comes to fruition, Murphy said much of the cast has reunions of their own.",
      "\u201cWe all like try to keep in touch as much as we can,\u201d Murphy said, acknowledging their \u201cbeyond busy\u201d schedules. \u201cBecause it was such a special show for all of us. And we all love each other so much.\u201d",
      "Though the comedy, which ran for six seasons, wrapped five years ago, Murphy said she\u2019s still stopped on the street for one of her character\u2019s iconic lines. When Alexis would bicker with her brother (Dan Levy), she was known to memorably yell, \u201cEw, David!\u201d",
      "Murphy only actually said the line three times in the entire series, but her Valley Girl accent was so memorable that any \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d fan would recognize the phrase.",
      "When fans do remember the line, Murphy said it\u2019s sometimes \u201cscreamed in my face,\u201d while others firmly command the actor, \u201c\u2018Do it now.\u2019\u201d But, she told TODAY.com, she found a way out.",

      "Now, Murphy stars in Season 2 of the Hulu drama \u201cNine Perfect Strangers\u201d as Imogen, a character far different from Alexis. But would the two ever be friends?",
      "\u201cThat is a very good question. No, I think Imogen would write Alexis off as a ditz \u2014 even though Alexis is not a ditz,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cBut I think Imogen is a very judgy little minx, and I think she would make a pretty hard judgment and judge a book by its cover and never look back.\u201d"

    "summary": "President Donald Trump is set to speak Monday with Vladimir Putin, in what the U.S. president said is an attempt to stop the \u201cbloodbath\u201d of the war in Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump spoke with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other leaders in separate calls Monday, in an attempt to stop the \u201cbloodbath\u201d of the war in Ukraine.",
      "But the president\u2019s outreach was inconclusive, and there was little sign of a breakthrough. Russia and Ukraine would hold direct talks on a ceasefire \u201cimmediately,\u201d Trump said afterward in a post on his social network Truth Social, but it was unclear what form those talks would take or when they would happen. The Vatican, Trump said, has expressed interest in hosting the negotiations.",
      "\u201cThe conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump\u2019s call with Putin lasted more than two hours and \u201cwas very informative and very open,\u201d Putin told Russian state media.",
      "Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office Monday afternoon, Trump said he had asked Putin to meet with him, but did not say whether Putin had agreed.",
      "Trump said little about his conversation with Zelenskyy, with whom he spoke first, other than to say that he had informed Zelenskyy and the leaders of other NATO countries of the negotiations. White House officials declined to offer any further details.",
      "Trump spoke with Zelenskyy twice on Monday, according to Zelenskyy, once one-on-one, before Trump\u2019s call with Putin, and again during a conference call with the Ukrainian and NATO leaders.",
      "\u201cI reaffirmed to President Trump that Ukraine is ready for a full and unconditional ceasefire,\u201d Zelenskyy tweeted. \u201cIf the Russians are not ready to stop the killings, there must be stronger sanctions,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPressure on Russia will push it toward real peace \u2014 this is obvious to everyone around the world.\u201d",
      "In a Monday interview with NBC News in Rome, where he was received by Pope Leo XIV, Vice President JD Vance said, \u201cWe talked about a couple of what I would call the president\u2019s major peace initiatives with the pope. We talked a lot about what\u2019s going on in Israel and Gaza. We talked a lot about the Russia-Ukraine situation. It\u2019s hard to predict the future, but I do think that, not just the pope, but the entire Vatican, has expressed a desire to be, you know, really helpful, and to work together on facilitating, hopefully, a peace deal coming together. Can\u2019t predict the future, but that was very meaningful, and I think will hopefully bear fruit for the country.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Putin\u2019s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said before the call that Russia \u201chighly values\u201d and is \u201cgrateful to the American side.\u201d In a briefing with journalists, he said that if the U.S. can \u201chelp to achieve our goals through peaceful means, then this is indeed preferable.\u201d",
      "Peskov was also asked about the chance of Trump and Putin meeting in person, a possibility the American president floated on Friday.",
      "\u201cIt will largely depend on what they themselves decide,\u201d Peskov said. The meeting \u201cneeds to be worked out\u201d by the two leaders in terms of dates and other details, he added.",
      "Ahead of the much anticipated Trump-Putin call, leaders from Britain, France, Germany and Italy said they spoke Sunday with Trump. The British government said in a statement that it was urging \u201cPutin to take peace talks seriously.\u201d",
      "Those leaders \u201calso discussed the use of sanctions if Russia failed to engage seriously in a ceasefire and peace talks,\u201d the statement said \u2014 something Trump has previously threatened.",
      "\u201cTomorrow, President Putin must show he wants peace by accepting the 30-day unconditional ceasefire proposed by President Trump and backed by Ukraine and Europe,\u201d French President Emmanuel Macron said on X.",
      "Trump has been widely criticized for appearing to offer concessions to Russia while demanding sacrifices from Ukraine. Those voices were joined last week by former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink, who gave details of why she stepped down last month.",
      "\u201cThe policy since the beginning of the Trump administration has been to put pressure on the victim, Ukraine, rather than on the aggressor, Russia,\u201d she wrote in an opinion piece Friday for the Detroit Free Press.",
      "\u201cPeace at any price is not peace at all \u2015 it is appeasement,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cwe must show leadership in the face of aggression, not weakness or complicity.\u201d",
      "While the diplomatic activity carries on, the violence in Ukraine continues. Russia has continued its near-nightly drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian civilians, more than three years after it launched a full-scale invasion and tried to seize Kyiv.",
      "On Sunday, Russia shelled residential neighborhoods of the eastern Ukrainian city of Kherson, killing a 75-year-old woman and injuring two other people, the city council posted on the Telegram messaging site.",
      "As well as being widely blamed for launching an unprovoked war, Russia is condemned across the West for the highly repressive and authoritarian state fashioned by Putin's Kremlin.",
      "On Monday, the Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s Office labeled one of those critics, Amnesty International, as an \"undesirable organization\" and effectively banned it. The authority accused the London-based human rights watchdog of being \"Russophobic,\" trying to prolong the war, wanting to \"justify the crimes of Ukrainian neo-Nazis\" and its staffers of supporting \"extremist organizations.\"",
      "Trump, who has often spoken warmly of Putin, rarely if ever mentions these human rights concerns.",
      "Trump said in a Truth Social post on Saturday that he would be speaking with Putin at 10 a.m. Monday with the purpose of \u201cstopping the \u2018bloodbath\u2019 that is killing, on average, more than 5,000 Russian and Ukrainian soldiers a week.\u201d NBC News has not independently verified the numbers that Trump cited.",
      "Apparently referring both to his planned call with Putin and his slated talks with Zelenskyy and other European leaders, Trump added that \u201chopefully it will be a productive day, a ceasefire will take place, and this very violent war, a war that should have never happened, will end.\u201d",
      "Despite promising on multiple occasions to end the war in 24 hours of taking office, Trump has since found the reality much different since beginning his second term.",
      "U.S.-brokered negotiations saw Russia and Ukrainian delegations meet in person in Istanbul last week for the first time since the early days of the war.",
      "However, the demands of the two sides remain far apart, with Russia saying it will only agree to a truce if Ukraine effectively surrenders. Ukraine has said these demands are unacceptable."

      "Israeli bombardment had killed more than 300 people in the 72 hours to early Monday, the Health Authority in Gaza said. Children were among the dead after a wave of airstrikes in the southern city of Khan Younis that came even after Netanyahu said his forces would allow in limited amounts of food to avoid the risk of famine.",
      "In a statement Monday, Gaza's Hamas-run government urged the international community to pressure Israel to allow the entry of at least 500 aid trucks and 50 fuel trucks daily, adding that \u201csigns of famine and humanitarian collapse are worsening at a terrifying rate.\u201d",
      "That came after the Israeli government announced plans Sunday that, if actioned, would end its 11-week aid blockade of Gaza and allow in \u201cbasic\u201d quantities of food. Netanyahu doubled down Monday on his decision, responding on Telegram to critics from Israel\u2019s political right wing.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of criticism from the right this morning regarding the humanitarian issue \u2014 and that\u2019s understandable. But it\u2019s important to know the facts,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe must avoid a situation of famine, both in substance and in perception.\u201d",

      "It was in his statement Monday that Netanyahu said that \u201cthere is intensive and large-scale military activity in Gaza\u201d and that the Israeli military was \u201cmoving toward full control of the entire Strip.\u201d",
      "Israel says the operation is aimed at defeating Hamas and ensuring the return of the remaining hostages of the 250 taken captive during the Hamas-led terror attacks\u00a0in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, during which around 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli counts.",
      "The ensuing war in Gaza has killed more than 53,000 people in the enclave, Palestinian health officials say. That death toll is still rising.",
      "Those killed in airstrikes added to what has become one of\u00a0the deadliest weeks\u00a0of the conflict since a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas collapsed in March.",
      "In a statement Monday, Hamas said that the Israeli military had launched \u201chundreds of highly destructive shells, missiles, and bombs daily, targeting residential neighborhoods and densely populated civilian areas.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said Monday that it had struck 160 of what it called \u201cterror targets\u201d in the past 24 hours.",
      "The attacks come as international aid groups have repeatedly warned in recent weeks of the risk of famine\u00a0in Gaza after the Israeli government maintained a complete aid blockade since March 2.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a race against time to avoid famine,\u201d the United Nations' World Food Programme said in an X post Sunday, in which it urged the international community to \u201cact urgently to get aid flowing again.\u201d",
      "Those warnings have sparked alarm among even Israel\u2019s closest allies, with President Donald Trump telling reporters Friday that \u201ca lot of people are starving\u201d in Gaza.",
      "The United Nations said Monday that 92% of homes in Gaza have already been destroyed or damaged, in a post on X, adding that \u201ccountless people have been displaced multiple times, and shelter is scarce.\u201d",
      "In footage captured Sunday by NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground, Israeli missiles struck a cluster of tents sheltering displaced families in the Al-Mawasi area, west of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, killing at least 40 people and injuring dozens of others.",

    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 On Mother\u2019s Day, Yael Alexander got perhaps the best gift: the news that her son Edan Alexander would be released from Hamas captivity the following day.",
      "One week after that life-changing phone call, NBC News spoke to Yael Alexander and her husband, Adi Alexander, about their son\u2019s more than a year in captivity and his eventual release.",
      "Edan Alexander, who was believed to be\u00a0the last living U.S. citizen\u00a0held captive in Gaza, was freed on May 12 after having been captured by Hamas during its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "Born in Tel Aviv, Edan, 21, grew up in New Jersey but had returned to Israel to serve in the army. His parents said he recounted to them the details of his capture and his time in captivity.",
      "Attacked on his army base on Oct. 7, Edan faced off with almost 30 militants by himself before he was kidnapped, Adi Alexander said. His son called the first year in captivity \u201ccomplete hell,\u201d he said, because he was frequently moved around to various locations above ground, underground and in tents, at one point during the war living in a tent that, his father recounted, Edan said he couldn\u2019t leave for weeks.",
      "\u201cThe conditions in those tents are not easy. They couldn\u2019t get out,\u201d Adi said, noting that Edan\u2019s time in the tent was his \u201ctoughest period\u201d in captivity.",
      "Edan was in good physical shape when he was taken, whereas a number of other captives, including injured people, children and the elderly, weren\u2019t, Adi said, so Edan helped those being held with him, especially when they moved between locations.",
      "Edan endured hunger, eating only hummus, pita bread, rice and whatever his captors served him from cans, his father said, a reflection of the food scarcity in Gaza since the start of the war. Fears of famine have heightened there in recent weeks as Israel has carried out a nearly three-month blockade on the enclave \u2014\u00a0the longest of its kind since the start of the conflict.",
      "Israel said Sunday it would begin allowing limited resources to flow into the Gaza Strip to avoid a \u201chunger crisis.\u201d Worries of such a crisis aren\u2019t new, with aid groups warning about such conditions for months as a result of Israel\u2019s military operation.",
      "Food began to flow more regularly during the fragile January ceasefire brokered during the Biden administration, offering the hostages an opportunity to eat meat, Adi Alexander said. Edan told his parents conditions improved during what Adi called the \u201csecond phase\u201d of his son's captivity \u2014 after Donald Trump was elected president.",
      "By then, he said, Edan, who had lost about a quarter of his body mass, stayed in one \u201csecure and safe\u201d location for the rest of his time in Gaza and was able to regain some weight.",
      "Adi lauded his son\u2019s \u201cwisdom to get along with the captors and survive,\u201d even when death from bombardments by the Israeli army \u2014 which he said Edan described as \u201clike an earthquake\u201d \u2014 seemed possible. At one point, Edan also survived a tunnel collapse, his father said.",
      "\u201cWe consider ourselves lucky that he survived that day,\u201d Adi said of the collapse. \u201cHe has some injury from that event, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something major now.\u201d",
      "Adi said he and his family were devastated when the ceasefire collapsed and \u201cthe war re-started.\u201d",
      "On May 5, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced an intensive military operation aiming to take the whole of the Gaza Strip in an effort to eliminate Hamas, a move approved by the country\u2019s security Cabinet.",
      "But the plan hasn\u2019t been without pushback. A number of military reservists have rejected the call to serve in the operation, saying it is part of a war that has become politically motivated. At a Knesset committee\u00a0meeting this month, the father of one of the remaining hostages called on soldiers \u201cnot to report for reserve duty for moral and ethical reasons.\u201d",

      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip \u2014 Israel says it will allow a limited amount of humanitarian aid into Gaza after a nearly three-month blockade to avoid a \u201chunger crisis,\u201d after global experts on food crises warned of famine.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday his Cabinet approved a decision to allow a \u201cbasic\u201d amount of food into the territory of over 2 million people. Israel imposed a complete blockade on humanitarian aid starting March 2.",
      "Netanyahu said allowing some aid in would enable Israel to expand its new military operation, which began Saturday.",
      "It was not immediately clear when aid would enter Gaza, or how. Netanyahu said Israel would work to ensure that Hamas will not control aid distribution and ensure the aid does not reach Hamas militants.",
      "Earlier on Sunday, Israel launched \u201cextensive\u201d new ground operations in\u00a0Gaza. Airstrikes in its\u00a0new offensive\u00a0killed at least 103 people, including dozens of children, overnight and into Sunday, hospitals and medics said. The bombardment forced northern Gaza\u2019s main hospital to close as it reported direct strikes.",
      "Israel began the offensive \u2014 the largest since it\u00a0shattered a ceasefire\u00a0in March \u2014 with the aim of seizing territory and displacing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.",
      "Israel is pressuring Hamas to agree to a temporary ceasefire that would free hostages from Gaza but not necessarily end the war. Hamas says it wants a full withdrawal of Israeli forces and a path to ending the war as part of any deal.",
      "\u201cWhen the Jews want a truce, Hamas refuses, and when Hamas wants a truce, the Jews refuse it. Both sides agree to exterminate the Palestinian people,\u201d said Jabaliya resident Abu Mohammad Yassin, who was among those fleeing the new offensive on foot or in donkey carts. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, have mercy on us. We are tired of displacement.\u201d",
      "Israel\u2019s military, which recently called up tens of thousands of reservists, said the ground operations are throughout the Palestinian territory\u2019s north and south. Israel\u2019s chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, said that plans include \u201cdissecting\u201d the strip.",
      "Before the announcement, airstrikes killed more than 48 people \u2014 including 18 children and 13 women \u2014 in and around the southern city of Khan Younis, according to Nasser Hospital, which said it struggled to count the dead because of the condition of bodies.",
      "In northern Gaza, a strike on a home in Jabaliya killed nine members of a family, according to the Gaza Health Ministry\u2019s emergency services. Another strike on a residence there killed 10, including seven children and a woman, according to the civil defense, which operates under the Hamas-run government.",
      "Israel\u2019s military had no immediate comment. Its statement announcing the ground operations said preliminary strikes over the past week killed dozens of militants and struck more than 670 targets. Israel blames civilian casualties on Hamas because the militant group operates from civilian areas.",
      "Shortly afterward, Israel\u2019s military said that it intercepted a projectile from central Gaza and another fell in an open area, with no injuries reported.",
      "Talks in Qatar",
      "Israel had said it would wait until the end of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to the Middle East before launching its offensive, saying it was giving ceasefire efforts a chance. Trump didn\u2019t visit Israel on his trip that ended Friday.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s office said his negotiating team in Qatar was \u201cworking to realize every chance for a deal,\u201d including one that would end fighting in exchange for the release of all remaining 58 hostages, Hamas\u2019 exile from Gaza and the disarmament of the territory.",
      "Hamas has refused to leave Gaza or disarm.",
      "Israel ended the previous eight-week ceasefire in March. Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry has said almost 3,000 people have been killed since then.",
      "Days before resuming the war, Israel cut off all food, medicine and other supplies to Gaza. The blockade is now in its third month, with global food security experts warning of famine across the territory of more than 2 million people.",
      "Frustration in Israel has been rising. A small but growing number of Israelis are refusing to show up for military service, even risking imprisonment. Other Israelis have been displaying photos of children killed in Gaza during weekly rallies demanding a deal to free all hostages and end the war.",
      "The war in Gaza began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and abducting 251 others. Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians, many of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count.",
      "Hospital cites Israeli \u2018siege\u2019",
      "Health officials said fighting around the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza and an Israeli military \u201csiege\u201d prompted it to shut down. It was the main medical facility in the north after Israeli strikes last year forced the Kamal Adwan and Beit Hanoun hospitals to stop offering services.",
      "\u201cThere is direct targeting on the hospital, including the intensive care unit,\u201d Indonesian Hospital director Dr. Marwan al-Sultan said in a statement, adding that no one could reach the facility that had about 30 patients and 15 medical staff inside.",
      "Israel\u2019s military said that troops were operating against militant infrastructure sites in northern Gaza, including the area \u201cdirectly adjacent\u201d to the hospital.",
      "Israel has repeatedly targeted hospitals, accusing Hamas of being active in and around the facilities. Human rights groups and U.N.-backed experts have accused Israel of systematically destroying Gaza\u2019s health care system.",

One in Zweida town killed seven people, including two children and four women, according to al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah.

    "story": [
      "Young people in Taiwan are used to living with uncertainty when it comes to China \u2014 a situation they generally say is for the best for the time being, particularly when recent actions by the Trump administration have some of them asking a certain question.",
      "\u201cCan Taiwan continue to view the U.S. as an ally?\u201d said Chan Yu-hsiang, 25, a graduate student at National Taiwan University.",
      "Chan\u2019s question reflects growing concern in Taiwan over the reliability of the U.S. as a security partner under President Donald Trump, who has expressed support for the Beijing-claimed island in the face of Chinese military threats but also made critical remarks and upended trade relations.",
      "In a Taiwan government poll released in March, the percentage of respondents who said the U.S. military would \u201cdefinitely\u201d intervene in the event of a Chinese invasion dropped to 14% from 19% a year earlier. Almost half of respondents said the U.S. military was unlikely to intervene, the same as a poll by the Brookings Institution conducted the same month.",
      "According to the same Taiwan government poll, 36% of respondents said U.S.-Taiwan relations would get worse under Trump, a 12% increase since January.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s rising wariness toward the U.S. comes amid growing pressure from China, which claims the self-governing democracy as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force in achieving its unification goal. Beijing sends warplanes and ships toward the island on near-daily sorties.",
      "Last month, the Chinese military conducted large-scale drills around Taiwan in what it said was a warning to \u201cseparatist\u201d forces. The Taiwan government has warned that Beijing could hold more drills in the coming days as the island marks one year under President Lai Ching-te, whom China describes as a \u201cseparatist\u201d and \u201ctroublemaker.\u201d",
      "China has rebuffed multiple offers of talks from Lai, who says only Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people can decide its future. Beijing insists the island\u2019s future is \u201cby no means an \u2018internal affair of Taiwan,\u2019\u201d warning that Taiwanese authorities would \u201csuffer an apocalypse\u201d if they sought formal independence.",
      "Strategic ambiguity",
      "The U.S. has no formal relations with Taiwan but is its most important international backer, bound by law to provide it with defensive weapons. On Monday, Taiwan test-fired for the first time a new rocket system provided by the U.S. that Ukraine has also used against Russia.",
      "Washington has long maintained a policy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d when it comes to whether the U.S. military would defend Taiwan against a Chinese attack, not giving a definitive answer either way.",
      "Trump has not given any indication of a change in that policy. But he has unnerved Taiwan with comments accusing it of stealing semiconductor business from the U.S. and calling for Taiwan to pay more for its own defense, which it has pledged to do.",
      "Last month, he also slapped Taiwan with a 32% tariff on its goods, with an exemption for the chip industry, which makes up a big part of the Taiwan economy and which the U.S. relies on heavily.",
      "Taiwan has said it will not retaliate against the U.S. and that it is ready for trade talks \u201cat any time,\u201d offering a package of zero tariffs on American goods and increased U.S. investment.",
      "The duties came as a surprise to Taiwan after state-backed chipmaker TSMC announced a plan in March to invest an additional $100 million in the U.S., where it is already building multiple factories.",
      "For Chan, this suggested that even Taiwan\u2019s \u201csilicon shield\u201d \u2014 the semiconductor industry that makes the island so indispensable to the global economy \u2014 is not enough to guarantee U.S. support.",
      "\u201cIf you keep giving away Taiwan\u2019s last line of defense, the U.S. will take advantage of it, but they won\u2019t necessarily treat you well,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhy would Taiwan still believe that Trump would definitely deploy troops if it was to fall?\u201d",
      "Maintaining the status quo",
      "Though some U.S. officials and Taiwan\u2019s military point to 2027 \u2014 the 100th anniversary of the founding of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army \u2014 as a possible timeline for China to attack, polls show that most Taiwanese believe an invasion is unlikely in the next five years.",
      "A survey last year by National Chengchi University in Taipei showed that over 88% of people in Taiwan support maintaining the status quo, in which Taiwan operates as a de facto independent country without formally declaring independence, a move that would risk all-out war with China.",
      "That\u2019s especially true for Taiwan\u2019s youngest voters, said Lev Nachman, a political scientist and assistant professor at National Taiwan University who has studied their views.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s Gen Zers \u201care by no means pro-China relative to other generations, but they don\u2019t have the same attitude towards Taiwan independence\u201d as millennials do, he said.",
      "\u201cInstead, we see younger generations having a much more sort of pro-status-quo approach to politics,\u201d Nachman said.",
      "Young people in Taiwan were too young to be radicalized in political upheavals such as the island\u2019s Sunflower Movement in 2014 and the martial law era, he said.",
      "They don\u2019t want to \u201crock any major boat\u201d with any \u201cradical change\u201d in the Taiwan Strait, Nachman added, though the desire for unification with mainland China is still \u201cincredibly low.\u201d",
      "The Taiwan government poll found that over a third of respondents ages 18 to 29 viewed China as the island\u2019s \u201cprimary threat\u201d despite efforts by Beijing to win them over with preferential policies for studying and working in the mainland, as well as various activities including sponsored trips, internships and cultural events.",
      "Last year, over 4 million people from Taiwan visited mainland China for tourism, study or work, a year-over-year increase of 54.3%, according to official data released by Chinese authorities. According to China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office, young people were the \u201cmost active\u201d group.",
      "\u201cYou are also Chinese. You are our family,\u201d Chan said he and other students from Taiwan were told by a tour guide last year on a Beijing-sponsored trip to the Chinese province of Henan.",
      "While some accuse Beijing of using such efforts to strengthen its sovereignty claims, these measures are \u201cquite good\u201d and enable young people in Taiwan to visit and explore different places, said Chen Pin-yin, a student at the National Taiwan University of Arts.",
      "Chen, 21, who is also pro status quo, said not everything is about politics. Young people in Taiwan are mainly concerned about practical issues such as the cost of living and their job prospects, she said.",
      "Chen did a one-month internship last summer for a variety show in the southern Chinese province of Hunan that was partly funded by Chinese organizers.",
      "The experience was \u201ca dream come true\u201d for Chen, who said the Chinese TV industry is \u201chighly developed.\u201d She said she plans to pursue a master\u2019s degree in mainland China next year and that she would also consider working there.",
      "The most important thing \u201cis to avoid wars for now,\u201d Chen said. \u201cI hope the U.S. can play the role of a mediator when tensions are high.\u201d"

      "BASEL, Switzerland \u2014 Austria was crowned the winner at Saturday\u2019s grand finale of the Eurovision Song Contest, the world\u2019s most popular singing tournament, beating strong competition from Israel and Switzerland to come in first place on an evening full of glitz and glamour.",
      "Austria\u2019s song, \u201cWasted Love\u201d by JJ, was awarded 436 points by a combination of votes from viewers and juries of music professionals from each participating country.",
      "JJ is a countertenor opera singer, and the song makes use of his impressive vocal range. It starts with a swelling orchestral sound that builds to a dance club finish.",
      "Despite widespread rumors and high anticipation for a homecoming appearance by Celine Dion, who won the contest while representing Switzerland in 1988 (artists don\u2019t have to be from the country they represent), the Canadian star was unable to attend. The singer has curtailed her recent public appearances due to a diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome. She had earlier sent a video message, played during Tuesday\u2019s semifinal, in which she said she \u201cwould love nothing more\u201d than to attend Eurovision, calling winning the contest \u201clife-changing.\u201d",
      "Every country that competes in Eurovision also votes on the winner,  meaning rivalries and regional alliances from the real world spill over into the results.",
      "Allies Greece and Cyprus have a long history of giving each other 12 points (the most possible), which is often met with boos from the crowd. Only Greece made it to this year\u2019s final, and Cyprus gave it 12 points.",
      "On the other hand, neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan, which have fought wars over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, has awarded its neighbor more than a handful of points. This year, Azerbaijan didn\u2019t make it to the final. Azerbaijan yet again did not give any jury points to Armenia.",
      "The most geopolitically divisive entrant was Israel\u2019s Yuval Raphael, whose song \u201cNew Day Will Rise\u201d is about finding hope after tragedy. While the song does not mention any specific events, Raphael survived the Hamas-led terror attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and another 250 were taken hostage.",
      "Israel\u2019s subsequent assault on Gaza has killed over 53,000 people and has brought the surviving population of about 2 million to the brink of starvation. For many critics, Israel\u2019s inclusion in Eurovision is tantamount to accepting its military campaign, and protesters demand Israel\u2019s expulsion from the contest, just as Russia was in 2022 following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Raphael\u2019s song, which was met with scattered boos as well as cheers, came in second place, racking up 357 points.",
      "There were gasps of disbelief in the audience when the other top contender, Switzerland, was awarded no points from the public.",
      "Sweden\u2019s failure to triumph was a surprise amid its favored status, buoyed by KAJ\u2019s \u201cBara Bada Bastu,\u201d a humorous ode to the Nordic tradition of going to the sauna. The performance by the act\u2019s trio of Finns featured a faux sauna complete with backup dancers in towels \u2014 a vision of European culture, just not a winning one on Saturday.",
      "The event was a jamboree of glitz and showbiz glamour, with fans from across the continent cheering on their favored contestants as a TV audience of hundreds of millions watched at home and at viewing parties.",
      "Eurovision began in Switzerland in 1956 as a way to test new television technology, and to help bring postwar Europe together. At the time, the contest only featured seven countries. This year, there were 37 nations taking part, whittled down to 26 finalists over two semifinals earlier this week. And the production is now a behemoth, with hundreds of crew members and 22 cameras capturing the action.",

      "Poland\u2019s Justyna Steczkowska made her return to Eurovision after 30 years with a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d-inspired performance that saw the 52-year-old lifted into the air by ropes as a CGI dragon swooped behind her on an 8,000-square-foot LED video wall.",
      "Some 163 million people watched the Eurovision final and the two semifinals last year. Final viewing figures are not yet available for this year\u2019s competition, but it is sure to remain one of the most-watched events in the world. It attracts more viewers than the Super Bowl, which had 123.4 million viewers last year, according to CBS.",

      "\u201cTrump said that he will give us a chance, and we deserve that chance,\u201d Qallab, a mother of four from the port city of Latakia, told NBC News. \u201cAfter 14 years, I felt that the American president cared about us,\u201d she added. \u201cIt was a historic moment. It gave us hope for a better life.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a chance at relief after a grim 14 years in a country that until now has been one of the world\u2019s most sanctioned.",
      "\u201cFor years, sanctions have caused severe damage to the Syrian economy, directly impacting citizens\u2019 lives and hindering development and production,\u201d said Syrian economy minister spokesperson Hassan Al-Ahmad in a statement sent to NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis decision presents a genuine opportunity to revive the economy, restore national production cycles, and open doors to investments, technology, and markets,\u201d he added. \u201cFrom the Syrian government\u2019s perspective, this decision marks a turning point that we aim to leverage wisely and rationally.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere have been very few positive things happening in Syria,\u201d said  Aron Lund, a Syria expert and a fellow at Century International, a progressive think tank based in New York. \u201cAssad going was, of course, positive in the sense that you got rid of this mass murderer,\u201d but the \u201ceconomic morass\u201d has persisted.",
      "Assad\u2019s 2011 crackdown morphed into one of the most devastating and complex civil wars of modern times. Iran, Russia and Hezbollah lined up behind Assad, and the U.S., Turkey and others supported different rebel groups. Amid all of that, the Islamic State terroist organization thrived.",
      "Assad stayed in power by killing his own people, deploying chemical weapons and Russian bombs, and torturing and murdering them in an underground network of gulags. The U.N. estimates more than 300,000 people were killed; another 13 million were forced to flee their homes.",
      "In recent years, however, most international aid has flown into places like Ukraine and Gaza. Now it will be far easier for cash to enter Syria, Lund said. He called Trump\u2019s move \u201ca big, good thing for Syria\u2019s chances of recovering and stabilizing as a functioning nation state.\u201d",
      "Such a development would be welcomed by Syria\u2019s neighbors in the Gulf and Middle East. And indeed, Trump said his decision to lift sanctions came at the behest of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mohammed bin Salman and Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. They want to see a stable Syria, one that does not disseminate refugees, instability and terrorism, and acts as an ally against Iran.",
      "\u201cI hope to see Syria like the UAE, Qatar or Saudi Arabia,\u201d said Nasser Eido, 49, a lawyer who fled to Norway during the war but has since returned to Damascus since Assad fell. \u201cI\u2019m confident we can achieve this. The old regime stole the country\u2019s resources, kept the people poor and left them hungry.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s move does not come without risk, however.",
      "Questions still hang over al-Sharaa, who led Assad\u2019s overthrow and says he has reformed since his days as the leader of the Islamist insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which spearheaded the offensive against Assad in early December.",
      "He has given some moderate signals, appointing women and minorities to government positions and saying Sharia, the strict interpretation of Islamic law, will not be imposed. Yet some groups remain uneasy about their place in the new Syria, where there have already been mass killings of Alawites, Assad\u2019s minority Muslim sect.",
      "\u201cThere is the risk that the Syrian government, which is pretty hardcore Islamist, ends up doing horrible things: more massacres, or Christians getting killed, or something else that would not play well in Washington,\u201d Lund said. The White House could be in the position of having to defend itself \u201cagainst the charges that it maybe enabled that,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not a risk free decision.\u201d",
      "In 1979, the country was blacklisted on the State Department\u2019s first list of state sponsors of terror, alongside Iraq, Libya and former South Yemen. Today, Syria is the only one left, the others being replaced by North Korea, Cuba and Iran. This classification imposes financial restrictions, as well as banning any American military-related imports or exports.",
      "More U.S. sanctions came in 2004, followed by the first measures from the United Nations and European Union a year later. In 2011, when Assad began brutally suppressing demonstrations, the U.S., U.N. and E.U. imposed further import and export controls.",
      "After rebels toppled Assad in just 11 days with little fightback, the U.S. eased some of these restrictions, granting a six-month license that allowed humanitarian aid to enter the country.",
      "Since then, the Trump administration had shown few signs of offering easy progress. It demanded that Syria fulfill a list of conditions that included protecting minorities before any sanctions could be shifted \u2014 hence the surprise at Trump's announcement.",
      "It could be a game changer for millions.",
      "Jumana Hayek, 23, risked imprisonment and torture for receiving 100 euros (around $115) every month from her brother, who had fled to Germany.",
      "\u201cIt was hard and dangerous because sending money to Syria wasn\u2019t allowed due to American and international sanctions,\u201d said Hayek, a university student from Aleppo studying electrical engineering. \u201cMy brother took risks sending the money, and we took risks receiving it,\u201d she added.",
      "\u201cWe suffered a lot, but things will change now.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A day after 59 white South Africans were welcomed to America as refugees, more than 86,000 South African farmers \u2014 who are mostly white \u2014 are gathering this week at the NAMPO Harvest Day trade fair, an annual agricultural exhibition considered the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.",
      "Over four days, the attendees will discuss innovations in technology, collaborations and various other elements of an industry that last year generated nearly $14 billion in revenue.",
      "Notably, according to one participant, there is no planned discussion of violence against white farmers or \u201cAfrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored, race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation\u201d without compensation, as President Donald Trump wrote in a Feb. 7 executive order that opened the way for the 59 South Africans to come to U.S., despite a ban on refugees from other nations.",
      "The executive order referenced South Africa\u2019s Expropriation Act enacted last year, which in some cases allows the government to seize unused land without compensation, something Cyril Ramaphosa, the country\u2019s president, said has not happened.",
      "The act awakened a profoundly troubling argument over land rights. South Africa's dark history of racism includes the confiscation of land from Black residents, both before and during the apartheid. Afrikaners, the minority white descendants of Dutch and French settlers who arrived in South Africa in the 1600s, were leaders of the apartheid regime that ended in 1994.",
      "The purported goal of the Expropriation Act is to shrink the vast land ownership disparity that came with the oppressive rule. According to the organization Action for Southern Africa, 72% of farms and agricultural holdings are owned by whites, who make up 7.3% of the population. Black Africans, representing 81.4%, own only 4% of the land.",
      "Trump asserted on Monday, ahead of the refugees\u2019 arrival in the U.S., that \u201cwhite farmers are being brutally killed and the land is being confiscated in South Africa.\u201d",
      "Yet Wandile Sihlobo, chief economist of the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa, said that the spirit of NAMPO this week reaffirms that \u201cgenocide\u201d of white South African farmers \u201cwas imaginary and not happening in our country.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all disturbed that the U.S. side is alleging that there\u2019s genocide and mistreatment of white farmers in South Africa. It is incorrect,\u201d said Sihlobo, who is also co-author of the book \u201cThe Uncomfortable Truth About South Africa\u2019s Agriculture.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf anything, the sector continues to flourish. [Trump's] comments are misinformed and not mirroring the reality on the ground in the country,\u201d\u00a0he said.",
      "The New York Times reported 225 people were killed on South African farms over a four-year period ending in 2024. Of those deaths, 101 were Black current or former workers living on farms, and 53 were farmers, who are usually white.",
      "Nico Harris, a farmer of Afrikaans heritage, told Daily Maverick South African newspaper that the problems he sees can be overcome and stem from the government not being \u201cpro-farmer.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the refugees that have gone [to the U.S.] are not well-established family farming businesses like we are,\u201d Harris told the paper. \u201cI think they don\u2019t have an opportunity in the country and they might think that, \u2018This is an opportunity for us.\u2019 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re really fleeing because they are scared or worried, I think they see it as an opportunity.\u201d",
      "Harris added, \u201cI think there are racially discriminating laws against white farmers, and I think they have problems and haven\u2019t got sympathy from the government. But there are no real land grabs, and I don\u2019t think there are real threats. There are individual farm attacks, but it\u2019s more related to criminal activity. We just hope our government is going to wake up and realize that they need the farmers, Black and white.\u201d",
      "One of the South Africans who arrived in the U.S. on Monday told The Washington Post that she had been advised not to speak with the media and said it had been a \u201cvery emotional, very rough couple of weeks.\u201d",
      "Theo Boshoff, CEO of AgBiz, which represents companies across the agricultural value chain, including South African and multinational companies, said crime in rural farming areas is high but \u201cnot targeted against any racial or ethnic group.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no genocide in South Africa,\u201d Boshoff added. \u201cPeople who live in rural areas, who are often farmers, are simply more vulnerable to crime and violent crime because they live in remote areas.\u201d",
      "And because they are remote, law enforcement often is not nearby to protect them. \u201cThere is no cultural or racial bias at play. White farmers, Black farmers, white farmworkers, Black farmworkers are\u00a0all equally at risk and united in combatting this challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cI also don\u2019t agree with insinuations that rural crime is motivated by politics or in any way related to South Africa\u2019s affirmative action efforts to remedy our checkered past.\u201d",
      "Solidarity, a South African trade union that represents 600,000 Afrikaner families, said in a statement in February that it does not agree with the African National Congress, which wants to close the farmland disparity gap. \u201cBut we love our country. As in any community, there are individuals who wish to immigrate, but repatriation of Afrikaners as refugees is not a solution for us,\u201c the group wrote.",
      "President Ramaphosa said on X that the country\u2019s laws \u201cbalance the need for public usage of land and the protection of rights of property owners.\u201d He said that a meeting with President Trump about the country\u2019s land reform policy would result in them sharing \u201ca better and common understanding over these matters.\u201d",
      "Trump adviser Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa, has talked of his home country having \u201cracist ownership laws\u201d in a genocidal effort against white farmers.",
      "Fadial Adams, a member of the National Assembly of South Africa, a political body that passes legislation and analyzes executive action, warned of Musk\u2019s influence on the president. \u201cLet us not forget that Elon Musk is a beneficiary of our suffering and our slavery in South Africa, and it is not something that he hides. He was raised on a system which benefited white South Africans exclusively,\u201d\u00a0Adams said. \u201cElon Musk should stop acting like the minister for foreign affairs for South Africa. He\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration and Musk representative did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Afriforum, a nongovernmental South African agency that supports the interests of white citizens, have called for farm murders to be classified as priority crimes requiring special attention, like gender-based violence or rhino-poaching. It does not support the Expropriation Act.",
      "\u201cMany laws identified by the Afrikaner lobby groups as racist are viewed by the African National Congress as being necessary, intentional measures to redress past wrongs,\u201d said Thula Simpson, an associate professor of history at the University of Pretoria in South Africa. \u201cSo the present developments strike at the heart of the post-apartheid consensus.\u201d",
      "As for the farmers in South Africa as a whole, Sihlobo, the economist from the Agricultural Business Chamber, pointed at how the country's earnings from exporting produce have grown from $2 billion in the year 2000 to nearly $14 billion in 2024.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re self-sufficient,\u201d Sihlobo said. \u201cThat speaks to the progress the sector has been making. You can\u2019t see numbers like that where there\u2019s a genocide.\u201d",
      "Jaco Minnaar, the chairman of AGRI SA, the largest agriculture organization in South Africa, says the larger problem is South Africa\u2019s crime rate.",
      "\u201cWe can see that farm murders in South Africa have a slightly higher rate per capita than murders in general, but it\u2019s farmers and farmworkers, which is not all necessarily white,\u201d Minnaar said.",
      "\u201cOur murder rate is one of the highest per capita in the world, even higher than some of the war-torn countries. That\u2019s something that we need to address,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t specifically see from the statistics that white people or any other demographic group are targeted. Or that there\u2019s a genocide.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "BUCHAREST, Romania \u2014 The pro-European Union candidate in Romania\u2019s tense presidential runoff has taken a lead in the polls, preliminary electoral data shows, in a closely watched vote against a hard-right nationalist that could determine the geopolitical direction of the NATO member country.",
      "The race pitted front-runner George Simion, the 38-year-old leader of the hard-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, against incumbent Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan. It was held months after the cancellation of the previous election plunged Romania into its worst political crisis in decades.",
      "After 8.5 million of 11.6 million votes had been counted, Dan was ahead with 53.56%, while Simion trailed at 46.44%, according to official data.",
      "Thousands gathered outside Dan\u2019s headquarters near Bucharest City Hall to await the final results, chanting \u201cNicusor!\u201d Each time his lead widened as more results came in, the crowd, many waving the flags of Europe, would erupt in cheers.",
      "Higher voter turnout than in first round",
      "When voting closed at 9 p.m., official electoral data showed a 64% voter turnout. About 1.64 million Romanians abroad, who have been able to vote since Friday at specially set-up polling stations, participated in the vote.",
      "Dan told the media that \u201celections are not about politicians\u201d but about communities and that in Sunday\u2019s vote, \u201ca community of Romanians has won, a community that wants a profound change in Romania.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen Romania goes through difficult times, let us remember the strength of this Romanian society,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is also a community that lost today\u2019s elections. A community that is rightly outraged by the way politics has been conducted in Romania up to now.\u201d",
      "Turnout was significantly higher in Sunday\u2019s runoff and is expected to play a decisive role in the outcome. In the first round on May 4, final turnout stood at 53% of eligible voters.",
      "Romania\u2019s political landscape was upended last year when a top court voided the previous election in which far-right outsider Calin Georgescu topped first-round polls, following allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference, which Moscow denied.",
      "Standing on the steps of Romania\u2019s colossal Communist-era parliament building after polls closed, Simion predicted a significant victory, which he called a \u201cvictory of the Romanian people.\u201d Simion said that Georgescu was \u201csupposed to be the president\u201d before last year\u2019s election was annulled. He also called for vigilance against election fraud, but said that overall he was satisfied with the conduct of the vote.",
      "Shortly after 6 p.m., Romania\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Andrei Tarnea said in a post on X that the election was subject to a \u201cviral campaign of fake news\u201d on the Telegram messaging app and other social media platforms, which tried to influence the electoral process and had \u201cthe hallmarks of Russian interference.\u201d",
      "Networks of coordinated disinformation have emerged as a pervasive force throughout Romania\u2019s entire election cycle. Romanian authorities debunked the deluge of fake news, Tarnea said.",
      "Simion appeared alongside Georgescu at a Bucharest polling station on Sunday and told reporters that he voted against the \u201chumiliations to which our sisters and brothers have been subjected.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s going on in Romania?",
      "Years of endemic corruption and growing anger toward Romania\u2019s political establishment have fueled a surge in support for anti-establishment and hard-right figures, reflecting a broader pattern across Europe. Both Simion and Dan have made their political careers railing against Romania\u2019s old political class.",
      "Most recent local surveys indicated that the runoff would be tight, after earlier ones showed Simion holding a lead over Dan, a 55-year-old mathematician who rose to prominence as a civic activist fighting against illegal real estate projects.",
      "After voting in his hometown of Fagaras, Dan told reporters that he voted for Romanians \u201cwho are quiet, honest, and hardworking, and who have not felt represented for a long time,\u201d and \u201cfor strong cooperation with our European partners, not for Romania\u2019s isolation.\u201d",
      "Dan founded the reformist Save Romania Union party in 2016, but later left, and is running independently on a pro-European Union ticket reaffirming Western ties, support for Ukraine and fiscal reform.",
      "Simion\u2019s rhetoric in the lead-up to Sunday had raised some concerns that he wouldn\u2019t respect the outcome if he lost. In the early afternoon, he told reporters that his team was confident in a \u201clandslide victory,\u201d if the election was \u201cfree and fair.\u201d",
      "However, he repeated allegations of voting irregularities among Romanian citizens in neighboring Moldova and said that his party members would conduct a parallel vote count after polls close. He told The Associated Press that the ballot so far had proceeded properly.",
      "Adrian Nadin, a 51-year-old musician who supported Georgescu in the previous election, said that he chose Simion.",
      "\u201cA part of Romania prefers conservatism,\u201d he said.",
      "Luminita Petrache, a 32-year-old financial crimes analyst, didn\u2019t want to say who she voted for but described the runoff as a geopolitical choice between East and West.",
      "\u201cIt is very important because the next president will be our image in Europe, and (decide) how Romania will evolve in the next five years,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope for changes in Romania in good ways.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s ahead?",
      "The president is elected for a five-year term and has significant decision-making powers in matters of national security and foreign policy. The winner of Sunday\u2019s race will be charged with nominating a new prime minister after Marcel Ciolacu stepped down following the failure of his coalition\u2019s candidate to advance to the runoff.",
      "After coming fourth in last year\u2019s canceled race, Simion backed Georgescu, who was banned in March from running in the election redo. Simion then surged to front-runner in the May 4 first round after becoming the standard-bearer for the hard right.",
      "A former activist who campaigned for reunification with neighboring Moldova, Simion says he would focus on reforms: slashing red tape and reducing bureaucracy and taxes. Still, he insists that restoring democracy is his priority, returning \u201cthe will of the people.\u201d",
      "His AUR party says it stands for \u201cfamily, nation, faith, and freedom\u201d and rose to prominence in a 2020 parliamentary election. It has since grown to become the second-largest party in the Romanian legislature.",
      "A stark choice: Russia or the E.U.?",
      "His critics say Simion is a pro-Russia extremist who threatens Romania\u2019s longstanding alliances in the EU and NATO.",
      "In an AP interview, he rejected the accusations, saying that Russia is his country\u2019s biggest threat and that he wants Romania to be treated as \u201cequal partners\u201d in Brussels.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think he is a pro-Russian candidate, I also don\u2019t think that he\u2019s an anti-Russian candidate,\u201d said Claudiu Tufis, an associate professor of political science at the University of Bucharest. \u201cI think what is driving him is \u2026 his focus on what I call identity politics.\u201d",
      "In the first-round vote, Simion won a massive 61% of Romania\u2019s large diaspora vote, with his calls to patriotism resonating with Romanians who moved abroad."

    "published": "Sun, 18 May 2025 14:17:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Vice President JD Vance returned to Rome for the inaugural Mass of Pope Leo XIV, continuing a spiritual journey that has weathered criticism from leaders of the Catholic Church.",
    "story": [
      "VATICAN CITY \u2014 After leaving the Marines and beginning his higher education, Vice President JD Vance drifted into atheism \u2014 struggling, he would eventually write, with feelings of \u201cirrelevance\u201d in his faith and with \u201ca desire for social acceptance among American elites.\u201d",
      "Vance, who later converted to Catholicism, this weekend made his second trip to the Vatican in less than a month. On the first visit, Vance met with Pope Francis on Easter, hours before he died. On Sunday, Vance led a U.S. delegation at the inaugural Mass of the first U.S.-born pope, Leo XIV.",
      "Both pontiffs \u2014 Francis during his papacy, Leo in his prior service as Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost \u2014 offered veiled but easily decipherable rebukes of President Donald Trump and Vance\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d worldview. Vance, somewhat uncharacteristically for someone who so relishes debate, has chosen to politely sidestep criticism. But the circumstances of the last few weeks have put an unexpected spotlight on his religion, reinforcing his status as one of the world\u2019s highest-ranking Catholics in political office.",
      "At Sunday\u2019s Mass, the vice president scored a prime seat in the first row to the right of the dais, near delegations from Italy and Peru, where the pope is a naturalized citizen and served as a bishop and archbishop.",
      "In his homily, delivered in Italian, Leo spoke of \u201ctoo many wounds caused by hatred, violence, prejudice, the fear of difference, and an economic paradigm that exploits the Earth\u2019s resources and marginalizes the poorest,\u201d according to an English translation provided by the Vatican.",
      "Vance and second lady Usha Vance briefly greeted the pope before leaving the Vatican on Sunday.",
      "\u201cOf course, the American pope \u2014 the United States is very proud of him, very thrilled with him, and certainly our prayers go with him,\u201d Vance said during the opening of a trilateral meeting Sunday afternoon in Rome with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "The White House was eager to frame this weekend's visit in historic terms.",
      "\u201cPope Leo XIV is the first American Pope. Vice President Vance is the first Catholic convert to serve as Vice President,\u201d Vance\u2019s office emphasized when announcing the trip.",
      "Vance is the second Catholic to serve as vice president, after Joe Biden, who went on to become the second Catholic president, after John F. Kennedy. Biden grew up in the Catholic Church, while Vance came to it as an adult. Joining Vance in Rome and at the Vatican this weekend was Father Henry Stephan, the priest who baptized him in 2019.",
      "After landing in Rome at sunset on Saturday night, Vance\u2019s motorcade first sped to the Basilica of St. Mary Major, where he and the second lady paid their respects at Francis\u2019 tomb.",
      "In February, Francis sent a letter to U.S. bishops that was viewed by many as a scolding of Trump\u2019s immigration policy in general and of Vance\u2019s justification of it in particular. Vance responded by trying to defuse any tensions. Speaking at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast that same month, Vance said that while Francis\u2019 criticism surprised him, the pope was \u201cfundamentally a person who cares about the flock of Christians under his leadership.\u201d",
      "The remark came after Vance, who is known for his combative online presence, lamented to his audience that the rise of social media was unhealthy for religious discourse. (Vance excused Trump\u2019s recent post featuring an AI image depicting the president as the pope as a joke.)",
      "\u201cWe are not called as Christians to obsess over every social media controversy that implicates the Catholic Church,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWhether it involves a clergy or a bishop or the Holy Father himself, I think that we should frankly take a page out of the books of our grandparents, who respected our clergy, who looked to them for guidance, but didn\u2019t obsess or fight over every single word that came out of their mouth and entered social media. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good.\u201d",
      "Vance struck a similar tone this month after Leo\u2019s election as pope drew attention to stories he had shared on social media as a cardinal that were critical of Trump and Vance. While wrestling with Leo\u2019s politics in an interview with conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt, Vance offered a nuanced answer and said he prefers \u201cnot to play the politicization of the pope game.\u201d",
      "Yet for all of Vance\u2019s social media bluster, he telegraphed years before his vice presidency that the papacy is an authority that he is reluctant to cross.",
      "In a 2020 essay he wrote about his conversion in The Lamp, a Catholic journal, Vance recalled confronting \u201ca conservative Catholic writer about his criticism of the pope.\u201d Vance asserted that \u201ctoo many American Catholics have failed to show proper deference to the papacy, treating the pope as a political figure to be criticized or praised according to their whims.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s conversion is a less plumbed part of his past. Aside from The Lamp essay and thoughts he shared with a conservative writer friend who attended his baptism, away from public audiences, Vance has talked rather sparingly about his spiritual journey.",
      "At the Catholic prayer breakfast in February, Vance noted his interfaith marriage to Usha, who is Hindu, and how they are raising their three children Catholic while allowing them to decide when to be baptized. He said his most exciting moment last November \u2014 the month he was elected vice president \u2014 was when his 7-year-old son chose to be baptized.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that I try to remind myself of as a convert is that there is a lot I don\u2019t know,\u201d Vance said that day. \u201cWhen I was a kid, we used to call new converts to the faith baby Christians. And I recognize very much that I am a baby Catholic, that there are things about the faith that I don\u2019t know. And so I try to be humble as best I can when I talk about the faith publicly, because of course I\u2019m not always going to get it right.\u201d"

Schoolchildren eat simple breakfasts while squatting on sidewalks, and even a local official complained that the remote mountain villages lacked access to the latest 5G internet connection.",
      "But Chinese officials point to overall progress in this thickly forested, highly mountainous border region in southwest China as a reason for their \u201cconfidence\u201d in the country\u2019s development model and in its ability to weather any trade war with the United States.",
      "\u201cWe have full confidence and the capability to overcome all difficulties,\u201d Vice Foreign Minister Hua Chunying said last week during a government-sponsored trip to the rural county of Malipo in Yunnan province, on the border with Vietnam.",
      "\u201cAs for what the United States is doing, we really don\u2019t want any kind of war, but if we have to face up to reality, then we have no fear at all,\u201d she told reporters at a middle school. \u201cThe ordinary people already feel the suffering from the tariff war, so I really hope the [U.S.] administration will come back to normal.\u201d",

      "She and other officials said Malipo, where 233,000 people are spread among several towns and hundreds of \u201cvillage groups,\u201d is a model for China\u2019s poverty alleviation efforts in recent decades. Per capita disposable income in Malipo was $2,300 a year last year, compared with about $69 a year in 1992.",

      "Hua said the strength of China\u2019s system is its ability to \u201cconcentrate resources\u201d on people\u2019s urgent needs. Beijing is thought to have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on poverty alleviation since 2015.",
      "China\u2019s approach to reducing inequality combines \u201ccoercive top-down control\u201d with high social spending in an effort to \u201chighlight the perceived failures of liberal free-market capitalism,\u201d Rana Mitter, a historian and political scientist at the Harvard Kennedy School, wrote in a new Foreign Affairs article.",

      "The local media outlet Suspilne said the passengers on the bus were being evacuated from the town when the strike happened. Authorities are working to identify some of the victims, most of them elderly women.",
      "Russia\u2019s defense ministry claimed its forces hit a military staging area in the Sumy region on Saturday morning, some 50 kilometers (31 miles) southeast of Bilopillia, without mentioning any other attacks there.",
      "According to a Washington-based think tank, Ukrainian forces have been inching forward into Russian territory in the Kursk region, just north of Bilopillia. The Institute for the Study of War said last week Ukrainian troops had advanced south of the Russian border village of Tyotkino.",
      "Russia\u00a0said last month that its forces had fully reclaimed the Kursk region, nearly nine months after a\u00a0lightning incursion by Kyiv\u00a0captured more than 100 settlements there and promised to hand Ukraine a bargaining chip in possible negotiations with the Kremlin. Ukrainian officials claimed fighting in Kursk is ongoing.",
      "Russian shelling, drones and airstrikes killed at least five other civilians on Friday and overnight across Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk, Kharkiv and Kherson regions, according to local officials there.",
      "Russian forces overnight also launched 62 drones, Ukraine\u2019s air force reported. It said 36 of the drones were shot down and six more veered off course, likely due to electronic jamming.",
      "Impact on peace efforts?",
      "Russian and Ukrainian officials met Friday in Istanbul in an attempt to reach a temporary ceasefire, but the talks ended after less than two hours without a breakthrough. It was the first face-to-face dialogue between the two sides since the early weeks of\u00a0Moscow\u2019s February 2022 full-scale invasion\u00a0of Ukraine.",
      "Hopes for a breakthrough were dashed after Russian President Vladimir Putin\u00a0spurned Zelenskyy\u2019s offer\u00a0to meet face-to-face in Turkey. Putin\u2019s no-show came days after he himself proposed negotiations in Istanbul \u201cwithout preconditions,\u201d as an alternative to the \u201cfull and unconditional\u201d ceasefire urged by Ukraine and its Western allies, including the U.S.",
      "While both sides agreed on a large prisoner swap, they remained far apart on key conditions for ending the fighting.",
      "One such condition for Ukraine, backed by its Western allies, is a temporary ceasefire as a first step toward a peaceful settlement. The Kremlin has pushed back against such a truce, which remains elusive.",
      "Zelenskyy said he had discussed the outcome of the Istanbul talks with U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of France, Germany, Britain and Poland. In a post on X from a\u00a0European leadership meeting in Albania\u00a0on Friday, he urged \u201ctough sanctions\u201d against Moscow if it rejects \u201ca full and unconditional ceasefire and an end to killings.\u201d",
      "Kyiv and Moscow agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war each, according to the heads of both delegations, in what would be their\u00a0biggest such swap. Ukraine\u2019s intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, said on Ukrainian TV on Saturday the exchange could happen as early as next week.",
      "The sides also discussed a ceasefire and a meeting between their heads of state, according to the chief Ukrainian delegate, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov.",
      "Russian delegation head Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to President Vladimir Putin, said both sides also agreed to provide each other with detailed ceasefire proposals, with Ukraine requesting the heads of state meeting, which Russia took under consideration.The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, on Saturday held open the possibility of Putin holding talks with Zelenskyy, providing the agreed prisoner swap goes ahead and if Russian and Ukrainian delegations reached unspecified further \u201cagreements.\u201d",
      "Peskov also told reporters that Moscow will present Ukraine with a list of conditions for a ceasefire but gave no timeframe, or say what needed to happen before Zelenskyy and Putin can meet.",
      "European backing",
      "In Tirana, Albania, Zelenskyy met with leaders of 47 European countries to\u00a0discuss security, defense and democratic standards\u00a0against the backdrop of the war., including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk.",
      "\u201cPressure on Russia must be maintained until Russia is ready to end the war,\u201d Zelenskyy said on X.",
      "Macron in Tirana on Saturday accused Putin of \u201ccynicism\u201d and said that Russia has failed to \u201crespect\u201d ceasefire proposals backed by the U.S. and other Western nations.",
      "The French president reiterated that a European \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d is ready to give Ukraine security guarantees and \u201cput pressure on Russia,\u201d something he said he expected Trump would support.",
      "\u201cFaced with President Putin\u2019s cynicism, I believe that ... in fact, I\u2019m sure that President Trump, concerned about the credibility of the United States of America, will react,\u201d he said."

      "Marked by high-level talks and lavish displays of regional hospitality, the trip showcased Trump\u2019s self-styled role as a dealmaker and peacemaker. Still, his loftiest targets \u2014 resolving the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine \u2014 remain elusive.",
      "In Abu Dhabi, Trump capped his weeklong tour with a visit to Qasr Al Watan, the emirate\u2019s presidential palace, where he toured exhibits showcasing investments in energy, health care and aviation. Accompanied by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the president met with business leaders and took shots at his predecessor.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just thinking, we have a president of the United States doing the selling,\u201d Trump said, taking a swipe at former President Joe Biden. \u201cYou think Biden would be doing this? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d A large screen at the event repurposed his campaign slogan to proclaim \u201cMaking Energy Great Again,\u201d a nod to the economic focus of the trip.",
      "Throughout the week, Trump announced major investments by Middle Eastern nations in American businesses, including a $600 billion investment deal from Saudi Arabia and an agreement with Qatar Airways to buy hundreds of planes from Boeing and GE Aerospace.",
      "White House spokesman Harrison Fields lauded the trip as an \"incredibly formative visit that forged America\u2019s Golden Age through its partnerships with a critical region of the world.\"",
      "The visit came amid controversy over Trump's eagerness to accept a planned gift from the Qatari government: a $400 million luxury plane which he hopes to use as Air Force One. The offer has drawn backlash from Democrats and some Republicans back home over potential ethical, security and financial challenges.",
      "Trump repeatedly dismissed concerns about the plane, saying he \"thought it was a great gesture.\" He also brushed off accusations that the trip, which came as his namesake company expands into the Middle East, created a potential conflict of interest.",
      "Yet, even as he celebrated his economic victories, the president faced the reality upon departure of the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine, conflicts he has vowed to resolve.",
      "The president has made ending some of the world\u2019s thorniest conflicts a top priority of his administration, vowing to stop the bloodshed and bring about a lasting peace. And in a show of strong commitment, he has dispatched top aides to the cause, with special envoy Steve Witkoff hopscotching the globe in pursuit of the president\u2019s goal.\u00a0Before departing Washington, Trump announced the release of Edan Alexander, an American held by Hamas, with Qatar playing a central role in the negotiations.",
      "However, the president acknowledged that significant challenges remain. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at Gaza,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he left Abu Dhabi. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to get that taken care of. A lot of people are starving.\u201d",
      "As Trump concluded his trip Friday, Israeli airstrikes had killed more than 100 people in the last 24 hours, according to local health authorities.",

      "Earlier, Trump had expressed disappointment but not surprise when Putin failed to attend a planned meeting in Turkey. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was possible for him to go if I didn\u2019t go,\u201d Trump said, noting that his schedule had made the trip untenable.",
      "Instead, he teased the near possibility of a breakthrough in nuclear talks with Iran. Trump told reporters Friday that his administration had submitted a proposal for a deal with Tehran, after describing earlier their efforts \u201cin very serious negotiations with Iran for long-term peace.\u201d Earlier in the week, Trump hinted that he hoped an agreement was near, stating that \u201cwe\u2019re not going to be making any nuclear dust in Iran.\u201d",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said later Friday that his government had not \"received any written proposal from the United States\" and that there was \"no scenario\" in which Tehran would abandon its nuclear program to reach a deal with the U.S.",
      "\"Iran nonetheless remains determined and straightforward: Respect our rights and terminate your sanctions, and we have a deal,\" he said on X. \"Mark my words: there is no scenario in which Iran abandons its hard-earned right to enrichment for peaceful purposes: a right afforded to all other [Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty] signatories, too.\"",
      "Trump also said Friday that recognizing the new Syrian government \u2014 and lifting what he called \"brutal\" and \"biting\" sanctions \u2014 was \"the right thing to do\" as the new leadership cements its control.",
      "Trump said Wednesday that the trip did not sideline Benjamin Netanyahu by forgoing a visit with the Israeli prime minister, explaining that his relationships with Arab leaders are \u201cvery good for Israel.\u201d He also said he reached out to Netanyahu on the decision to lift sanctions on Syria.",
      "Analysts see parallels between this trip and Trump\u2019s 2017 Middle East tour.",
      "\u201cThe key thing to watch is what comes next in the region and what big steps his administration takes,\u201d said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. After 2017, the Gulf region saw a rift that isolated Qatar for three years and a U.S. \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Iran that he said failed to deliver lasting results. Yet, the trip also laid the groundwork for the Abraham Accords, the 2020 agreement normalizing ties between Israel and several Arab states, which remains Trump\u2019s signature foreign policy achievement and which Biden sought to continue.",
      "Trump is aiming higher. \u201cThis time around, Trump is looking for a historic breakthrough with Iran on the nuclear talks and also dreams of getting a Nobel Prize if he gets that Iran deal or expands the Abraham Accords to include a Saudi-Israeli normalization accord,\u201d Katulis said.",
      "Trump\u2019s hosts this week have also played important roles in these efforts, helping to mediate the conflicts and offering support to negotiations, and the president acknowledged there was more to do as he departed Abu Dhabi.",
      "\u201cUnexpected surprises and events have a way of knocking U.S. administrations off balance,\u201d Katulis said. \u201cThe ongoing war in Gaza and the growing misery of Palestinians living there will be a critical test.\u201d"
