      "South Korean author Han Kang, this year\u2019s winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, says she was shocked at this week\u2019s martial law announcement in her home country",
      "STOCKHOLM -- South Korean author Han Kang, this year's winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, said Friday that she was shocked by this week's martial law announcement in her home country.",
      "Han, awarded by the Nobel committee \u201cfor her intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life,\" spoke to journalists at a news conference in Stockholm after days of political turmoil back home.",
      "She recalled how she studied martial law imposed in her country in 1979 for her book \u201cHuman Acts.\u201d The book is set in 1980 in her birth city of Gwangju following a bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters that left around 200 people dead and hundreds of others injured.",
      "She described the shock of living through another attempt at martial law, this one live-streamed in real-time, when the president announced martial law in a surprise late-night address on Tuesday. It brought back memories for many South Koreans of the country\u2019s past military-backed dictatorships.",
      "\u201cLike everyone else that night, I was deeply shocked,\u201d the 54-year-old said through a translator. \u201cFor me to witness a similar situation unfold before my eyes in 2024 was startling.\"",
      "Han, known for her experimental and often disturbing stories that explore human traumas and violence and incorporate the brutal moments of South Korea\u2019s modern history, is South Korea's first writer to win the preeminent award in world literature.",
      "President Yoon Suk Yeol sent heavily armed soldiers into Seoul\u2019s streets after announcing martial law. But parliament forced him to lift his order within hours and the president is now facing possible impeachment.",
      "Opposition parties are pushing for a vote on Saturday on the impeachment motion, which needs support from two-thirds of the National Assembly to advance to the Constitutional Court, which would decide whether to remove Yoon from office.",
      "Saturday is also the day Han will deliver her Nobel lecture in Stockholm, the Swedish capital. There will be a ceremony and banquet for her and the other laureates next Tuesday, which is December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel\u2019s death.",
      "Despite the problems in the world, Han said she is celebrating her Nobel win but celebrating \u201cquietly.\u201d",
      "Speaking through a translator, she said that the state of the world has been making her question many things. \u201cAnd sometimes I wonder: do we have any hope left in this world?\" Han said she decided that \u201choping for hope is a hope.\u201d",

      "\u201cI was shaking,\u201d the viola leader recalled of that day in Prague\u2019s Rudolfinum. \u201cHe smiled at me and from this moment, I knew that I can do it. He told me very nice words after \u2014 he told me that this is exactly what my viola section needs.\u201d",
      "Celebrating the end of the 100th anniversary Year of Czech Music, an event held every decade in the year ending in 4, Bychkov is conducting through pain in leading the Czech Philharmonic on a North American tour to New York and Toronto.",
      "He had lumbar decompression surgery in September after finishing the new production of Wagner\u2019s \u201cTristan und Isolde\u201d at the Bayreuth Festival and the 72-year-old was limping slightly at Carnegie Hall this week, holding a podium railing and music stands for support as he walked on and off stage.",
      "He used a crutch on his left arm immediately after Thursday night's performance during a reception with Czech Republic President Petr Pavel and is to have a hip replacement after the tour.",
      "Czech composers have a connection to years ending in 4. Bed\u0159ich Smetana was born in 1824 and died in 1884, Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek was born in 1854 and Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k died in 1904. Bychkov's tour programs features that trio plus Gustav Mahler, born in what is now the Czech Republic.",
      "Bychkov said the music is innately part of his musicians. He cited the Vltava (Moldau) section of Smetana\u2019s \u201cM\u00e1 vlast (My country),\u201d which premiered in 1875.",
      "\u201cThey were still playing from the original parts. I mean, you can hardly see the notes,\u201d he said.",
      "Bychkov caused panic in the orchestra when he introduced a new critical edition.",
      "\u201cHe really thinks about every single note and he wants preciseness and he wants really that everything is perfect,\u201d said Jana Bou\u0161kov\u00e1, the harp leader since 2005.",
      "Bychkov was born in Leningrad to Jewish parents and his family left Russia for Vienna in 1974, then settled in the U.S. one year later. He attended the Mannes School of Music and got to know Julius Rudel, New York City Opera\u2019s general director. Bychkov became music director of the Grand Rapids Symphony Orchestra from 1980-85, gaining U.S. citizenship.",
      "Bychkov made his Berlin Philharmonic debut on Jan. 8, 1985, as a replacement for Riccardo Muti. On June 1, 1969, Bychkov was arrested while he and three friends tried to sneak through an open window into a Berlin Phil concert in Leningrad led by Herbert von Karajan.",
      "\"I ended up in the ladies room and a lady was there. I was trying to convince her that it was not her I was interested in but van Karajan, which was adding insult to an injury. So she yelled and the police was just outside,\u201d Bychkov said, adding he quickly was released. \u201cWhat would they do with me in the end? It wasn\u2019t political. I was not an agent of foreign influence.\u201d",
      "A few weeks after his Berlin debut, Bychov returned to the Philharmonie when Eugen Jochum canceled, and Bychkov met van Karajan for the first time.",
      "\u201cAt some point he said, `So you\u2019re in Grand Rapids now?\u2018\u201d Bychkov remembered. \u201cI said, yes, I\u2019m in Grand Rapids. I said, this is my Ulm, because that was the place that he started, and he laughed like crazy. He said, `You\u2019re so right. A few years of that and you\u2019re ready for anything.\u2018\u201d",
      "Bychkov succeeded Rudel as music director of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra from 1985-89. He then took similar roles at the Orchestre de Paris from 1989-98 and the WDR Symphony Orchestra in Cologne, Germany, from 1997-2010.",
      "He first conducted the Czech Philharmonic in 2013, filling an opening caused by a late cancellation, and Decca Records asked him the following year to record a Tchaikovsky symphony cycle with the orchestra. Following the death of chief conductor Jir\u00ed Belohl\u00e1vek in 2017, Bychkov was appointed to the role starting in 2018-19.",
      "Bychkov was in Prague as a guest conductor when Josef \u0160pa\u010dek, one of the first concertmasters, entered his dressing room following a performance.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still sweaty and haven\u2019t even changed,\u201d Bychkov said. \u201cHe said, `You bring the best in us and we\u2019d like you to be our next music director and we want you to be our daddy.\u2019 I had absolutely no thoughts of accepting any permanent position since I left Cologne in 2013 but when he said, \u2018We want you to be our daddy,\u2019 how can you say no to 124 orphans?\u201d",
      "A chain-smoker off stage, Bychkov is elegant on the podium with balletic side-to-side arm sweeps, wearing loose black clothes resembling pajamas, his bushy gray hair accentuated by the lights. His tenure will have spanned a decade by the time he leaves at the end of 2027-28.",
      "He lives on the French Basque coast with his second wife, pianist Marielle Lab\u00e8que. Bychkov\u2019s favorite airport is in Biarritz.",
      "\u201cWhy? Because when I arrive, 15 minutes later I\u2019m in my house,\u201d he said.",
      "It\u2019s also the one he hates most.",

      "BERLIN -- An annual festival on a German North Sea island that had drawn criticism over a practice of men hitting women with cow's horns passed without reports of assaults this year, police said Friday.",
      "The Klaasohm festival on Borkum, the westernmost of a string of German islands, takes place on Dec. 5 ahead of St Nicholas' Day. A report by ARD public television aired late last month showed women being stopped by costumed men and hit on the buttocks with a cow's horn at the 2023 festival, and anonymous witnesses discussing aggressive behavior at the event.",
      "The association that organizes the festival said ahead of this year's festival that the practice would be scrapped and it would no longer tolerate violence against women.",
      "The island's mayor, J\u00fcrgen Akkermann, said that the violence had developed from \u201ca tradition of a kind of chastisement\u201d of people who approach the \u201cKlaasohms\u201d \u2014 men dressed up in masks, sheepskin and feathers \u2014 without permission. He said that, following earlier incidents, a rethinking had already started over the past decade, but the matter hadn't been pursued emphatically enough until now, German news agency dpa reported.",
      "For Thursday's festival, police said they raised their presence on Borkum significantly. About 500 people took part in the parade, which drew a large crowd of spectators.",
      "Police said Friday that, when the festival ended around midnight, they had received no reports of bodily harm or any assaults. Regional police chief Thomas Memering said in a statement that, if offenses from this year's or past festivals come to light after the event, they will be prosecuted.",
      "\u201cCustoms and traditions don't provide protection against prosecution,\u201d he said."

      "LONDON -- Beatles legend Paul McCartney is being honored in a specially minted British coin collection.",
      "The Royal Mint, which has struck the coins of monarchs from Alfred the Great in the ninth century through to King Charles III, revealed Friday that it is launching a McCartney coin collection for collectors to buy.",
      "On one side of the coins, as is custom, will be the king. On the other, it will be all about McCartney's career in the wake of the Beatles split in 1970.",
      "The Royal Mint said the range will come in a variety of finishes as well as colored editions. The most valuable one will be the 2-ounce gold proof coin, which will have a face value of 200 pounds ($255), but will go on sale at a recommended retail price of 5,890 pounds ($7,510).",
      "Though legal tender, but with the price differential, it's unlikely \u2014 if not irrational \u2014 for anyone using the coins in everyday to use them to pay for, say, a McCartney concert.",
      "Among other features, the coins feature McCartney\u2019s iconic Magic Piano. a multicolored upright he first used in 1967 while still in arguably the greatest band of all with John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. A replica was made for McCartney's 1989/1990 world tour and been used in subsequent tours.",
      "There are other references too, including piano notes chosen by McCartney, his famous H\u00f6fner Violin Bass guitar, the logo of his post-Beatles band, Wings, as well as his signature.",
      "\u201cThis feels like a huge honor,\u201d McCartney said. \u201cIt\u2019s not anything I would have ever expected to happen when I was a kid.\u201d",
      "The Royal Mint also said it has created a special edition plectrum-shaped version of the coin to gift to the 82-year-old McCartney, who in his early days played with pennies as guitar picks.",
      "The coins are part of the Royal Mint\u2019s Music Legends collection that also features the likes of David Bowie, George Michael and the Rolling Stones.",
      "\u201cOur coins recognize the greatest icons and events in British history, so it\u2019s fitting that Paul McCartney\u2019s remarkable music career is now celebrated on an official U.K. coin,\" said Rebecca Morgan, Director of Commemorative Coin at The Royal Mint.",
      "\u201cWhat makes this coin extra special is that Paul has been involved throughout the design process,\u201d she added.",
      "The Royal Mint also said that it will auction a signed, gold edition of McCartney\u2019s coin. The bespoke gold coin weighs five kilograms and took over 250 hours to make, including three days of hand polishing. It was signed by McCartney during his 2024 \u201cGot Back\u201d tour in Paris and will be auctioned alongside four silver five-kilogram editions."

      "LOS ANGELES -- Although the friendly competition is fierce each day among the four talented young pass rushers on the Los Angeles Rams\u2019 defensive front, this week was a whole new tune.",
      "Defensive tackle Braden Fiske won the NFL's defensive rookie of the month award Thursday \u2014 but he had to share the spotlight with nose tackle Kobie Turner, who was revealed Wednesday night as one of the final four costumed performers on \u201cThe Masked Singer,\u201d Fox's celebrity musical competition show.",
      "Fiske, Turner and edge rushers Jared Verse and Byron Young inspire and challenge each other as they build the new core of the Rams' defense together. They regularly compare everything from their sack totals \u2014 they've combined for a whopping 21 1/2 this season \u2014 to their pickup basketball skills, always attempting to outdo each other with a smile.",
      "But when Turner pulled off his mask on television following his elimination after a season of impressive vocal performances, the rest of the Rams' defensive front knew Turner had won this round.",
      "\u201cIt really caught me by surprise,\u201d Fiske said with a laugh. \u201cWe saw it in the group chat last night, and it was all over social media. But knowing Kobie, knowing who he is, that's pretty cool. I know it was pretty special to him and his family with how his upbringing was with music and how much he appreciates that. I'm glad to see he had that opportunity. That's definitely not my forte, to be out there singing in front of people.\u201d",
      "Fiske got plenty of congratulations for his own performance after a five-sack November in which the second-round draft pick established himself alongside Turner as two of the league's top young interior pass rushers. Fiske is the third member of the Rams' young group to get the defensive rookie of the month honor in the past two years, joining Verse (September 2024) and Turner (December 2023).",
      "Meanwhile, Turner wowed another segment of the entertainment world with his powerful voice.",
      "The second-year pro has indulged his musical talent in several venues, even singing the national anthem before Lakers and Kings games. Turner conducts a few notes of an imaginary orchestra during his signature celebration after each sack.",
      "He balanced choral classes and weightlifting classes during high school and college, maintaining both of his passions. But the challenge of singing and dancing in the heavy costumes on \u201cThe Masked Singer\u201d was a whole new experience.",
      "\u201cTo be up under that mask and be the silly, goofy version of myself that I always have been wasn\u2019t something I was really expecting,\u201d Turner said, adding that he fell asleep onstage during one break in filming while wearing his costume, which was extra bulky because of his athletic strength.",
      "Turner said his marketing agent got him onto the show. Turner taped his first episode way back during the Rams' organized team activities last summer, but he had to keep his participation secret until this week.",
      "\u201cOnce the recording was done, it was like, \u2018OK, let\u2019s get back to ball,\u2019\u201d Turner said. \u201cAnd then when the show started coming on (this fall), I got really excited.\u201d",
      "Turner admits he was \u201cfrustrated\u201d not to advance to the show's finale, saying he maintains a competitive fire even in his musical side. He still doesn't forget to have fun, however.",
      "\u201cSometimes there are expectations on how you handle yourself on a football field, and with my personality, I've pushed those limits,\u201d Turner said. \u201cLast year, AD (Aaron Donald) used to always pick on me about doing crazy dance moves in walkthrough. But when it's time to go, I was completely locked in.\u201d",
      "NOTES: Verse was limited in practice Thursday by an ankle injury. ... LT Alaric Jackson (foot) returned to practice on a limited basis after sitting out Wednesday. ... WR Demarcus Robinson (hand) was a full participant after being limited Wednesday, while QB Matthew Stafford (ankle) had his second straight full day of work.",

      "Jagde\u2019s appearance as Don Alvaro opposite soprano Anna Netrebko will mark his third performance at Milan\u2019s storied Teatro alla Scala. He appeared twice as a substitute tenor opposite Netrebko, replacing Roberto Alagna in \u201cTurandot\u201d this summer, and now he will replace Jonas Kaufmann in the coveted season opener.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy to be their guy,\u2019\u2019 Jagde told The Associated Press in a phone interview.",
      "While it is not unheard of for Americans to sing on La Scala\u2019s opening night, a highlight of the European cultural calendar, it remains a rarity in an opera house where Europeans tend to dominate.",
      "Beside Maria Callas last century, American Brian Hymel opened the 2016 season in \u201cMadame Butterfly\u201d and Lisette Oropesa was cast in \u201cLucia di Lammermoor\u201d but sang in a gala concert to an empty theater when the 2020 season premiere was shuttered by the pandemic.",
      "In 2008, American tenor Stuart Neill was promoted from understudy to the \u201cDon Carlo\u201d opening night cast after the headlining tenor made too many dress rehearsal mistakes. Neill received generous applause from the tough La Scala crowd.",
      "\u201cIt's definitely one of the things that every artist dreams about,\u2019\u2019 Jagde said. \u201cI think it is about the artist and meeting the moment at the right time. I think that is more of what it's about than necessarily where they are from.\u201d",
      "Jagde said singers are drawn to La Scala's \u201crich tradition.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery artist wants to not just perform there, but have great success there,\u201d Jagde said. \u201cThe public is known to be a very devoted fanship \u2014 and they can love you or they can hate you. You really want to be embraced by that audience specifically.\u201d",
      "So far, the reviews from La Scala\u2019s upper balconies of exacting opera fans have been positive on his previous two outings, Jagde said, adding that artists should accept all feedback.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s our job as artists to embrace the fact that we are making people feel something. Whatever they feel is appropriate to them,\" he said.",
      "Jagde, 45, grew up outside of New York City, and started singing in musicals in high schools and choirs in college, but never gave a thought to the opera. He started studying computer science and business upstate but then a classical music program at Purchase College closer to home grabbed his attention, thinking it might lead him to Broadway.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know at the time that classical voice meant opera,\" he said laughing. He got accepted off the waiting list, and quickly fell in love with opera as the purest expression of the unadulterated voice.",
      "\u201cI remember being on stage and experiencing something I had never experienced on stage before, which was a completely acoustic, magical sound,\" Jagde said. \u201cThis was completely natural, hearing an orchestra underneath me, and my voice carrying over that. I remember committing full-heartedly (to opera) on stage at the moment.\u201d",
      "His college teachers pegged him as a baritone, and he spent eight years doing auditions and artists programs in that range until he realized that \u201cI was still warming up to high Cs and still had no low notes.\u201d",
      "Once he started auditioning as a tenor, the offers started rolling in. He made his principal role debut at the Metropolitan opera in 2021 in the role of Cavaradossi in \u201cTosca,\" and has sung on such renowned stages as the Paris Opera, the Vienna Staatsoper and Naples' Teatro di San Carlo.",
      "During the 2023/24 season, he warmed up his Don Alvaro at the Metropolitan Opera House and London's Royal Opera House. His La Scala debut last spring was as Turiddu in \u201cCavalleria rusticana.\u201d",
      "La Scala general manager Dominique Meyer said his only consideration in casting an opera is whether a singer \u201cis up to the role.\u201d Jagde, he said, is among five or six tenors who could sing the Don Alvaro role, \u201cand he was available.\u201d",
      "Jagde finished his Barcelona performances on Nov. 18, and showed up for rehearsals at La Scala the next day. Don Alvaro, he said, is a role, \"that has kind of grown with me, as I have grown as an artist.\u201d",
      "Jagde said singing alongside an international opera star like Netrebko for the second time this year will help take some of the jitters out of the gala premiere.",
      "\u201cShe is a wonderful colleague. She is a good person to work with, always available to you. She is nothing but smiles and fun,\" he said."

      "Couples who look awkward on skates have gotten a chance to celebrate their cute clumsiness in a Rocky and Adrian look-alike contest at Philadelphia\u2019s RockyFest",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Couples who look awkward on skates \u2014 and on dates \u2014 had a chance to celebrate their cute clumsiness in a Rocky and Adrian look-alike contest at Philadelphia\u2019s RockyFest on Friday.",
      "The evening event at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s 1923 Ice Rink was meant to echo the pair\u2019s first date in \u201cRocky.\u201d In the classic 1976 film, the eponymous boxer never actually dons ice skates in the scene, but instead shuffles alongside his best friend Paulie\u2019s sister as she tries to stay upright.",
      "The contest's winning prize was a dinner at South Philadelphia\u2019s iconic Victor Caf\u00e9, where the servers also sing opera, along with a hotel stay and a $250 certificate for a Rocky-themed gift shop.",
      "New York City firefighter Jason Carrion and his wife, Roxanne Carrion, took first place.",
      "\u201cI wanted to do something because we\u2019re the biggest \u2018Rocky\u2019 fans, I think, ever. I mean, just look at us,\u201d said Jason Carrion, dressed in a leather jacket and hat identical to Rocky's street wear in the movie.",
      "Roxanne Carrion called the event her dream date. \u201cI\u2019m going ice skating, going to the \u2018Rocky\u2019 steps dressing up, and now we\u2019re going to see \u2018Rocky\u2019 film at the movie theater. So this has been the perfect date for us,\u201d she said.",
      "She said the film has garnered such widespread appeal because of the \u201cunderdog\u201d theme: \"It\u2019s an inspirational story that transcends any age or a person, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d",
      "Philadelphia served as a backdrop to the popular \u201cRocky\u201d franchise, something the city is celebrating nearly 50 years later with a five-day festival that grew out of the inaugural Rocky Day in 2023.",
      "The events this week have included a mural unveiling, movie marathons, talks on the enduring appeal of the Sylvester Stallone character and a bus tour of favorite scenes.",
      "Meanwhile, a second cast of the Rocky statue was unveiled at the top of the Rocky steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art \u2014 the original was featured in \u201cRocky III\u201d \u2014 and will remain there through Dec. 31.",
      "\u201cThis statue represents everything that the Rocky films stand for: resilience, heart, and the unbreakable bond between Rocky and the people of Philadelphia,\u201d Stallone said in a statement."

      "\u201cI\u2019m having the time of my life,\u201d the EGOT-winning Goldberg says between rehearsals as she readies to tell the tale of a spunky young orphan with her dog Sandy set during the Depression.",
      "\u201cI thought, \u2018Who can we cast in that iconic role that would be right artistically and right for a large venue and right for an audience?\u2019 And it just felt like she was the right person,\u201d says Carolyn Rossi Copeland, who is producing the new tour.",
      "Goldberg will help lead the show at The Theater at Madison Square Garden from Dec. 11-Jan. 5. The tour has a deep connection to the first version of the hit show: It is being directed by Jenn Thompson, who at the age of 10 stepped into the role of Pepper in the original Broadway production.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a really beautiful journey. I have a lot of ghosts I got to exorcise and revisit and reclaim,\u201d says Thompson, who for the new show has chipped away at the layers of productions and charted a course back to the original production.",

      "Goldberg laughs when she says she signed on before realizing how much was going to be required of her. \u201cI\u2019m rusty. I\u2019m old,\u201d says the \u201cThe View\u201d co-host.",

      "\u201cI love the dark side of it,\" says Thompson. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of joy and there\u2019s a lot of rage and they are in conversation with each other. And it\u2019s what makes it a great musical in my mind.\"",
      "\u201cAnnie\u201d has been adapted many times for the screen, including a 1982 film version, another in 1999 and one in 2014 starring Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis, and a live TV version in 2021 on NBC with Harry Connick Jr. and Taraji P. Henson.",
      "The tour after the new year will head to Maryland, Alabama, Illinois, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, California, Washington, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nebraska, Colorado, Texas and Wisconsin.",
      "The musical was born in the wake of the Vietnam War and the Nixon administration and the creators have said they were seeking to offer some hope. \u201cI think it is a story about survival and choosing the light when you are in the dark,\u201d says Thompson.",
      "The musical first premiered on Broadway in 1977 and was revived in 1997 and 2012. The 1977 original show won the Tony Award as best musical and ran for 2,300 performances, inspiring tours and revivals that never went out of style. It last played New York on Broadway in 2012-14.",
      "\u201cThe original show was just endowed with so much hope and optimism and the comedy in it was honest,\u201d says Copeland. \u201cIt\u2019s really back to its roots. There\u2019s no gags and gimmicks.\u201d",
      "Others who have played Hannigan include Carol Burnett, Kathy Bates, Dorothy Loudon, Nell Carter, Katie Finneran, Jane Lynch and Henson. Goldberg says she's stayed away from watching any versions \u201cso I wouldn\u2019t copy other people.\u201d",

      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- The parents of a 14-year-old Missouri boy who fell to his death from an Orlando amusement park ride in 2022 have won a $310 million verdict against the attraction's Austrian builder.",
      "Late Thursday, the Orange County jury ordered that the manufacturer Funtime pay $155 million each to Tyre Sampson's parents, Nekia Dodd and Yarnell Sampson. He died on March 24, 2022, after falling 70 feet (21 meters) from the Orlando Free Fall ride at Icon Park. The trial lasted only a day as Funtime never appeared in court to defend itself.",

      "\u201cThe jury\u2019s decision confirms what we have long argued: Tyre\u2019s death was the result of blatant negligence and a failure to prioritize safety over profits,\u201d the family's lawyers, Ben Crump and Natalie Jackson, said in a statement. \u201cThe ride\u2019s manufacturers neglected their duty to protect passengers, and (Thursday's) outcome ensures they face the consequences.\"",
      "The family will now have to seek an order from an Austrian court to collect the damages.",
      "Funtime did not respond to an email sent to its headquarters Friday seeking comment. The company's website shows that it manufactures thrill rides that throw, drop and spin passengers at high speeds and from tall elevations, including attractions named Vomatron, Sling Shot and Chaos Pendle.",
      "Sampson, a football standout who stood 6 foot, 2 inches tall (1.9 meters) and weighed 380 pounds (172 kilograms), was visiting Orlando on spring break from the St. Louis area when he went with friends to the downtown amusement park.",
      "They rode the Orlando Free Fall, which placed 30 riders in seats attached to a tower, secured them with a shoulder harness and then dropped them 430 feet (131 meters). It didn't have seat belts, something most drop rides have as an additional safety measure.",
      "Because of Sampson's size, the harness didn't lock properly and he was ejected from his seat when the ride braked 70 feet from the ground.",
      "His parents argued that Orlando Slingshot and Funtime should have warned their son about the risks of someone his size going on the ride and didn\u2019t provide an appropriate restraint system. Adding seat belts would have cost $660.",
      "The state ordered the ride closed after the accident and it never reopened. It is now being demolished.",

      "\u201cFlow\u201d is quite easily the best animated movie of the year and one of the most poetic ecological parables in recent memory, writes AP Film Writer Jake Coyle in his review",
      "Of all the post-apocalyptic landscapes we've been treated to over the years, none is as beautiful nor peaceful as that of \u201cFlow.\u201d",
      "In Gints Zilbalodis' wondrously shimmering animated fable, a solitary black cat, after escaping a cataclysmic flood, navigates a water world. What brought things to this point is never explained. We're left to look upon this strange, verdant and overgrown landscape through the amber eyes of our unnamed feline protagonist. Humans are completely absent, and it's part of this beguilingly meditative film to wonder not just about what role we played in the flood, but to ponder the grace of the animal life left to inherit the Earth.",
      "As much as I didn't have a wordless Latvian animated movie on my 2024 bingo card, \u201cFlow\u201d \u2014 an expected Oscar contender currently in theaters \u2014 is quite easily the best animated movie of the year and one of the most poetic ecological parables in recent memory. It's an all-audiences movies, and by that, I'm tempted to include not just young and old, but cats and dogs, too.",
      "When the waters rise, the cat encounters a friendly Labrador, a long-legged secretary bird, a dozing capybara and a bauble-hoarding ring-tailed lemur. Cute as they are, they aren't quite your typical animated animals. Part of the allure of \u201cFlow\u201d is seeing animal characters that would normally be anthropomorphized and voiced by celebrity actors \u2014 the lemur, in particularly, has until now been ruled by Sacha Baron Cohen's King Julian of \u201cMadagascar\" \u2014 move and sound authentically.",
      "Well, mostly. Circumstances bring these five together aboard a small sailboat, an ark sans Noah. And while \u201cFlow\u201d doesn't exactly go for realism \u2014 the secretary bird, for instance, proves an especially adept captain in steering the rudder \u2014 it is most decidedly drawn in closer harmony to the natural world than your average animation. Together they sail through mountain tops-turned-islands and an abandoned city with rivers for streets.",
      "That \u201cFlow\u201d is made with computer generated animation adds to its dreamy, curiously real surrealism. Zilbalodis created \u201cFlow\u201d with Blender, the free, open-source graphics software tool. His camera moves less with the prescribed, storyboarded form of traditional animation than as a nimble, roving perspective within a virtual world. That such a natural and sensory movie is made possible by cutting-edge technology is one reason why the dystopic world of \u201cFlow\u201d always feels more hopeful than it ought to.",
      "Another reason is the animals. Though they come from different species and have little means of communication, they together form an odd partnership. The cat is initially wary of each, but they slowly form an evident bond. Their survival hinges on their cooperation, which is occasionally threatened by the self-interest of others (there's a pack of less community-minded dogs) or the cat's own timid reluctance.

      "A new documentary chronicles Sudan's 2019 revolution and the period of time immediately after the ouster of military dictator Omar Al-Bashir",
      "MARRAKECH, Morocco -- In the early days of Sudan's 2019 revolution, Shajane Suliman brought sandwiches, coffee and mint tea to demonstrations in closed-off sections of Khartoum. But as hope made way for despair, she decided more than food was needed to nourish the movement.",
      "Public outcry had sprung up against Sudan's longtime military dictator and his mismanagement of the country's economy. Throughout months of demonstrations, hundreds were killed or injured by security forces suppressing protests.",
      "So Suliman donned a gas mask and headed to the streets carrying posters adorned with lines like, \u201cSouls cannot be killed, let alone ideas.\u201d",
      "A continent away, filmmaker Hind Meddeb was finishing \u201cParis Stalingrad,\u201d a documentary about the plight of refugees living in encampments near the edge of the French capital. Sudanese refugees encouraged her to go to Khartoum and film their nascent revolution.",
      "Such is the origin story of \u201cSudan, Remember Us,\" Meddeb's 75-minute documentary being shown in competition at the Marrakech Film Festival this week after screening at festivals in Venice and Toronto.",
      "Sudan, a predominantly Arab country on the edge of sub-Saharan Africa, descended into civil war in 2023, as fighting erupted between the military and a paramilitary group known as the Rapid Support Forces that grew out of Darfur\u2019s notorious Janjaweed militia.",
      "Though estimates are difficult to come by, at least 24,000 people have been killed and millions displaced in a conflict that has largely been eclipsed in the world\u2019s attention by wars in the Middle East and Ukraine.",
      "To Suliman, who ended up as one of its protagonists, the documentary\u2019s purpose is similar to what she wrote on a poster five years ago: an effort to motivate a despairing public years after revolution failed to cement civilian rule.",
      "The revolution, she said, felt like \u201ca piece of heaven\u201d despite the violence, full of music, poetry and optimism about Sudan's future.",
      "\u201cEveryone forgot or lost hope,\u201d Suliman said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s different for us now than when the revolution started. We were together so it was easy. Now we need to change how we want to continue.\"",
      "\u201cSudan, Remember Us\u201d begins with a series of voice messages to Meddeb from April 2023, the month that civil war broke out. Activists describe their feelings of shock and disbelief about how what U.N. officials have called a \u201cforgotten war\" has ruined life and made their country unrecognizable.",
      "Mostly, it brings viewers to 2019, the year that Sudan's military ousted President Omar al-Bashir, paving the way for power-sharing and a short-lived transitional government led by generals and civilians.",
      "Largely shot on a handheld camera in a country that has at times blocked the internet, banned foreign news channels and arrested its own journalists, the movie is both a story of collective hope and a feat of reportage.",
      "Meddeb\u2019s observational approach and lingering on poems differs from gripping streaming-friendly protest documentaries such as Jehane Noujaim\u2019s \u201cThe Square\u201d (2013), Evgeny Afineevsky\u2019s \u201cWinter on Fire\u201d (2015) or Kiwi Chow\u2019s \u201cRevolution of Our Times\u201d (2021). She captures a revolution documentary\u2019s requisite images \u2014 the chaos and terror as well as solidarity and joy of demonstrators facing off against security forces.",
      "But the movie aims for a different kind of storytelling.",
      "A former France 24 journalist, Meddeb gravitated toward documentary for the breathing room it offered to let stories unfold in an unpredictable way, she said in an interview.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very spontaneous film. I was diving into what was happening and and filming what was inspiring me,\" she said at the Marrakech Film Festival.",
      "What she found and was inspired by was a country described as a \u201cland of literature\u201d and a revolution in which women played a central role.",
      "The protests rendered in the documentary pulsate with drums beating at marches and through the rhythm of poems recited at sit-ins. Meddeb takes the audience from phone camera-filmed street fighting to underground cafes to the Nile River as young people discuss their hopes for Sudan.",
      "\u201cThe revolution was a time of beautiful feelings and projects,\u201d one woman says after security forces killed more than 100 people in a June 2019 massacre. \u201cIt made you want to take part. A painting, a poem, anything to bring people together.\u201d"

      "A final plea hearing for the five is set for Dec. 17 and Willis filed a motion Friday asking that a trial begin on Feb. 24. She estimates that a trial would last about three months.",
      "A grand jury in May 2022 indicted 28 people, including Young Thug, and charged them with racketeering. The indictment said the rapper co-founded a violent street gang that committed multiple murders, shootings and carjackings over roughly a decade and promoted its activities in songs and on social media.",
      "A trial for Young Thug, whose given name is Jeffery Williams, and five others began in November 2023 after it took nearly 10 months to seat a jury. The rapper and three other defendants pleaded guilty in October. Young Thug was freed on probation with a variety of conditions, including an order to stay away from the Atlanta area for a decade.",
      "A jury on Tuesday found the two remaining defendants in the trial not guilty of racketeering, murder and gang-related charges, though one of them was convicted on a gun charge.",
      "Nine of the defendants, including the rapper Gunna, had accepted plea deals before the trial began, and prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case.",
      "That left a dozen defendants still facing charges after the trial. One pleaded guilty Wednesday after reaching a deal with prosecutors and prosecutors said the same day that they were dropping the charges against six others."

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Nearly two decades after a pair of ruby slippers that were worn by Judy Garland in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d were stolen from a Minnesota museum, the iconic shoes are set to be auctioned off to the highest bidder Saturday.",
      "Heritage Auctions estimates the slippers will fetch $3 million or more. Online bidding opened last month and by Friday had reached $1.55 million, or $1.91 million including the buyer's premium, a commission that the buyer pays, said Robert Wilonsky, a vice president with the Dallas-based auction house. Over 800 people were tracking the slippers, and the company's web page for the auction had hit nearly 43,000 page views by Thursday, he said.",
      "As Rhys Thomas, author of the book, \u201cThe Ruby Slippers of Oz,\u201d puts it, the sequined shoes from the beloved 1939 musical have seen \u201cmore twists and turns than the Yellow Brick Road.\u201d",
      "They were on display at the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids, Minnesota, in 2005 when Terry Jon Martin used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum\u2019s door and display case.",
      "Their whereabouts remained a mystery until the FBI recovered them in 2018. Martin, now 77, who lives near Grand Rapids in northern Minnesota, wasn't publicly exposed as the thief until he was indicted in May 2023. He pleaded guilty in October 2023. He was in a wheelchair and on supplementary oxygen when he was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health.",
      "His attorney, Dane DeKrey, explained ahead of sentencing that Martin, who had a long history of burglary and receiving stolen property, was attempting to pull off \u201cone last score\u201d after an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. But a fence \u2014 a person who buys stolen goods \u2014 later told him the rubies were just glass, DeKrey said. So Martin got rid of the slippers. The attorney didn't specify how.",
      "The alleged fence, Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of the Minneapolis suburb of Crystal, was indicted in March. He was also in a wheelchair and on oxygen when he made his first court appearance. He's scheduled to go on trial in January and hasn't entered a plea, though his attorney has said he's not guilty.",
      "The shoes were returned in February to memorabilia collector Michael Shaw, who had loaned them to the museum. They were one of several pairs that Garland wore during the filming, but only four pairs are known to have survived. In the movie, to return from Oz to Kansas, Dorothy had to click her heels three times and repeat, \u201cThere\u2019s no place like home.\u201d",
      "Among those bidding will be the Judy Garland Museum. The city of Grand Rapids raised money for the slippers at its annual Judy Garland festival to supplement the $100,000 set aside this year by Minnesota lawmakers to help the museum purchase the slippers.",
      "\u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d story has gained new attention in recent weeks with the release of the movie \u201cWicked,\u201d an adaptation of the megahit Broadway musical, a prequel of sorts that reimagines the character of the Wicked Witch of the West.",

      "The inspiration for Kate Hamill\u2019s latest play came from across centuries and the planet",
      "NEW YORK -- The inspiration for Kate Hamill's latest play came from across centuries and the planet.",
      "The actor-playwright was honeymooning in Italy in 2020 when she walked into the Uffizi Gallery in Florence and spotted a painting by pioneering Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi created around 1620. The art immediately stirred more art.",
      "\u201cI was standing in front of this painting, just like crying and shaking for like 20 minutes. And then I was like, \u2018I\u2019m going to write a play about this woman,\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "The result is \u201cThe Light and the Dark\" \u2014 a Primary Stages production at 59E59 Theatres \u2014 which looks at the hard but inspiring life of Gentileschi, who created bold works despite a society keen on keeping her down. Hamill calls the play a \u201cfeminist primal scream.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am disheartened by how extremely relevant this play is right now,\u201d Hamill says. \u201cMuch of the same things that Artemisia Gentileschi was dealing with then are still true now.\u201d",
      "Gentileschi rebelled against the male-dominated art world \u2014 even using herself as a nude model \u2014 and has lately become a symbol of courageous women for testifying in court, even while being tortured, against a prominent painter who raped her. \u201cPlease don\u2019t let her give up \u2014 she is a survivor,\u201d Hamill writes in the play\u2019s notes.",
      "Hamill \u2014 consistently among the most produced playwrights in America \u2014 not only wrote the work, but she also stars as Gentileschi, nightly reliving the traumas and the betrayals but also the triumphs of her sister-in-art.",
      "\u201cIt was important to me as a female artist to put my own body in the line of the service of a female artist who used the power of her body to say something,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cI felt like if what I need to do to get survivors' stories heard is take off all my clothes and scream in the middle of off-Broadway, then that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d",
      "The painting in Italy that stirred so much in Hamill was Gentileschi's Judith Slaying Holofernes, which depicts the Biblical story of Judith, who saved her people by beheading the Assyrian general Holofernes.",
      "It came at a time when Hamill was disheartened by #MeToo stories at home and wondered how \u2014 or even if \u2014 she could continue as a feminist playwright.",
      "\u201cI swear to you, I felt this woman reach through time and reach into that room and slap me up across the face and go \u2018Snap out of it! You have a voice. You have privilege. You\u2019re going to let those guys beat you? Get louder, get bolder!\u2019\u201d",
      "Hamill\u2019s husband, actor-director Jason O\u2019Connell, recalls seeing her transfixed in front of the painting. \u201cIt was like she was seized,\u201d he says, adding that her stillness and the light on her face made her look like a painting herself. \u201cI just watched her commune with it for a while and it was very moving.\u201d (Hamill soon ordered more than a dozen books about Gentileschi that were waiting for her on her return home.)",
      "The painting depicts Gentileschi and her maid plunging a sword into their enemy, inspiring the play's final powerful speech: \u201cEvery daughter of mothers who ever sees this work/Will know she is not alone/She will see what it means/To survive, despite the hands at your throat.\u201d",
      "The play has plenty of signature Hamill touches \u2014 strong women, humor and an encouragement to mix in modern elements despite whatever period the play is set. \u201cThe Light and the Dark\u201d has actors in jeans beneath Renaissance silhouettes, and Hamill kept her piercings in.",
      "\u201cWe wanted it to feel like we are gesturing at a time that is both back then and now, because I\u2019m going to argue all of this story could happen now,\u201d she says.",
      "Hamill has built a reputation as a foremost adapter of novels to the stage, including dust-blowing-off versions of \u201cVanity Fair,\u201d \u201cMansfield Park,\u201d \u201cThe Scarlet Letter,\u201d \u201cLittle Women\u201d and \u201cPride and Prejudice.\u201d In her \u201cSense and Sensibility,\u201d she added a Greek chorus of gossips to represent social pressures.",
      "\u201cI come at adaptation from a sort of a new play lens,\u201d she says. \u201cSo, I think of it as a collaboration between myself and an author who\u2019s often currently dead. So, in a way, it\u2019s sort of the same muscle.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Connell, who often acts alongside his wife, has two roles in the new play \u2014 an art appraiser who testifies against Gentileschi and a court officer who tortures her. \u201cI betray her two different ways in one scene,\u201d he says, turning to his wife: \u201cThe play is just so her. Her voice is so strong.\u201d",
      "Hamill says she is tapping into the same thing Gentileschi tapped into \u2014 extreme dissatisfaction with how the world is and this feeling that the world could be different.",
      "\u201cFeminist stories are about envisioning a future that\u2019s more egalitarian for women and men and people who do not identify on that binary. I think there is a healthy proportion of people who really want to live in that world or who want to see the ways in which our current world is not like that world.\u201d"

      "The smooth rice wine that plays a crucial role in Japan's culinary traditions was enshrined on Wednesday by UNESCO on its list of the \u201cintangible cultural heritage of humanity.\"",
      "At a meeting in Luque, Paraguay, members of UNESCO\u2019s committee for safeguarding humanity's cultural heritage voted to recognize 45 cultural practices and products around the world, including Brazilian white cheese, Caribbean cassava bread and Palestinian olive oil soap.",
      "Unlike UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage List, which includes sites considered important to humanity like the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt, the Intangible Cultural Heritage designation names products and practices of different cultures that are deserving of recognition.",

      "\u201cSake is considered a divine gift and is essential for social and cultural events in Japan,\u201d Takehiro Kano, the Japanese ambassador to UNESCO, told The Associated Press.",
      "The basic ingredients of sake are few: rice, water, yeast and koji, a rice mold, which breaks down the starches into fermentable sugars like malting does in beer production. The whole two-monthlong process of steaming, stirring, fermenting and pressing can be grueling.",
      "The rice \u2014 which wields tremendous marketing power as part of Japan's broader cultural identity \u2014 is key to the alcoholic brew.",
      "For a product to be categorized Japanese sake, the rice must be Japanese.",
      "The UNESCO recognition, the delegation said, captured more than the craft knowledge of making high-quality sake. It also honored a tradition dating back some 1,000 years \u2014 sake makes a cameo in Japan\u2019s famous 11th century novel, \u201cThe Tale of Genji,\u201d as the drink of choice in the refined Heian court.",
      "Now, officials hope to restore sake's image as Japan's premier alcoholic drink even as the younger drinkers in the country switch to imported wine or domestic beer and whiskey.",
      "\u201cIt means a lot to Japan and to the Japanese,\u201d Kano said of the UNESCO designation. \"This will help to renew interest in traditional sake elaboration.\u201d",
      "In Tokyo, Hitoshi Utsunomiya, the director of the Japan Sake and Shochu Makers Association, a trade group, agreed. \u201cI hope that this will also be an opportunity for Japanese people to take another look at sake, shochu and awamori, which are the essence of their culture. I would like them to try it even once and see what it tastes like,\u201d he said.",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, in a statement, said he was \u201cdelighted\u201d by the inscription of traditional sake-making, the traditional technic that Japan is proud of. Ishiba congratulated those who dedicated to preserving and promoting the tradition.",
      "Also, Japanese breweries have expressed hope that the listing could give a little lift to the country's export economy as the popularity of sake booms around the world and in the United States amid heightened interest in Japanese cuisine.",
      "Sake exports, mostly to the U.S. and China, now rake in over $265 million a year, according to the association.",
      "Japan's delegation appeared ready to celebrate on Wednesday \u2014 in classic Japanese style.",
      "After the announcement, Kano raised a cypress box full of sake to toast the alcoholic brew and cultural rite.",

      "UNESCO has listed the restoration techniques for the zinc roofs of Paris as an Intangible Cultural Heritage",
      "PARIS -- From before sunrise to after sunset, in slippery winters and scorching summers, the roof restorers of Paris toil away, replacing the zinc sheets that help define the city\u2019s famous skyline.",
      "A special spotlight is now shining on their little-noticed skills: UNESCO inscribed the zinc roof restoration techniques on its list of Intangible Cultural Heritage on Wednesday.",
      "\u2033The restoration of a roof involves removing the old pieces of zinc, measuring and custom-cutting new pieces using a Parisian folding machine, and assembling and fixing the pieces onto the roof,\u2033 UNESCO said in its citation. \u2033With nearly 80 percent of the roofs in Paris covered in zinc, the city is a living archive of these skills that shape the unique identity of its urban landscape.\u2033",
      "Most of the roofers are men, most are young. They often like heights, architecture, and working outdoors.",
      "Fantine Dekens, 21, is a climber who worked as a bartender but wanted a profession that took her outside and high up. She has been working as a roofer since 2021.",
      "\u2033There is a sort of romanticism around the roofs of Paris that attracted me,\u2033 she told the Associated Press.",
      "\u2033It\u2019s super to be outdoors. But there is a physical reality that you can\u2019t ignore. It\u2019s often very cold, or very hot, the things to carry are heavy,\u2033 she said. \u2033You can\u2019t do this trade eternally.\u2033",
      "Roofers are hoping the UNESCO recognition will inspire others to join their ranks and improve their working conditions.",
      "The profession is short of workers with the specialized skills for preserving the zinc roofs that have been a distinctive feature of Paris since the 19th century Haussmann era, from balconied apartment buildings along tree-lined avenues to historic churches that dot the French capital.",
      "\u2033It\u2019s a recognition for our trade, but for me, it\u2019s only useful if it is accompanied by a reflection on why there are so few roofers,\u2033 she said.",
      "Using welding techniques from the 1800s, they measure each new sheet of zinc so it fits the shape of the roof just right. Then they mount the often slippery roofs to affix the sheets to their new home.",
      "\u2033There\u2019s a very poetic side when you\u2019re up high,\u2033 she said. \u2033I feel very free in my movements. We take naps during our breaks. Often we sing, we shout. No one is watching us. And we can observe all of Paris at the same time. It\u2019s pretty incredible.\u2033",
      "\u2014\u2014\u2014-",
      "This story has been corrected to show that the roof techniques were inscribed as UNESCO\u2019s Intangible Culture Heritage, instead of World Heritage."

      "Kevin Kisner is the next lead analyst for NBC Sports",
      "Kevin Kisner would not have guessed his stock was starting to rise as his golf game was starting to age.",
      "A year ago, he had finished out of the top 200 on the PGA Tour for the first time in 10 years as he struggled to find his form when NBC called and asked if he'd like to try his hand in the broadcast booth for The Sentry at Kapalua.",
      "On Wednesday, NBC Sports announced Kisner would be the lead analyst for its portfolio of golf coverage that includes two majors and the Ryder Cup.",
      "What makes Kisner with his homespun outlook and South Carolina drawl a good fit to follow Paul Azinger and Johnny Miller?",
      "\u201cI've wondered that myself,\u201d Kisner said. \u201cI think I offer a different perspective that is more player-centric. I'm not going to give you fluff because I've got an analyst's job. I'll tell it like it is. I'm not going to hinder my relationship with players, but I'll tell you if you hit a bad shot or make a bad decision.\u201d",
      "NBC had what amounted to a game of musical chairs since splitting with Azinger after the 2023 Ryder Cup outside Rome. Kisner, Brandel Chamblee of Golf Channel, Luke Donald, Paul McGinley and Brad Faxon all had stints in the chair next to lead announcer Dan Hicks. The network did not want to rush to fill the role permanently.",
      "The music stopped on Kisner.",
      "\u201cKevin always shared frank and honest opinions about the game of golf during our various conversations through the years,\u201d said Tommy Roy, the lead golf producer for NBC. \"Those kinds of opinions and his engaging personality make Kiz a great fit for our broadcast team. He knows these players, he knows this game, and the audience will get to hear more of those opinions and that personality this season.\u201d",
      "Kisner is not done with his own game. With just over $29 million in career earnings, he is using a one-time exemption from the PGA Tour career money list to be exempt for 2025.",
      "He is a four-time winner, including a World Golf Championship title at the Match Play and two other appearances in the championship match. He played in the Presidents Cups in 2017 and 2022 and was an assistant this year at Royal Montreal.",
      "The plan is for him to work 10 tournaments, which would include the U.S. Open and British Open, the FedEx Cup playoffs and The Players Championship. He is likely to play at least two events during the Florida swing that NBC broadcasts.",
      "He still considers himself a player and has seen signs that his swing is getting to where it was.",
      "\u201cThey were so supportive of that, and that's why I was willing to negotiate with them,\u201d Kisner said. \u201cThey want me there for the big events that I'm not exempt into, and they've been accommodating if I do get in. It's a great deal for me. NBC loves the idea that the weeks CBS is covering golf I'm playing, and hopefully playing great.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s fond of saying about golf, \u201cThis ain\u2019t no hobby.\u201d Even so, he likely will be in a far more prominent role in the NBC booth than inside the ropes next year.",

    "title": "Australia is banning social media for people under 16. Could this work elsewhere \u2014 or even there?",
    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 16:42:33 -0500",
    "summary": "It is an ambitious social experiment of our moment in history",
    "story": [
      "It is an ambitious social experiment of our moment in history",
      "It is an ambitious social experiment of our moment in history \u2014 one that experts say could accomplish something that parents, schools and other governments have attempted with varying degrees of success: keeping kids off social media until they turn 16.",
      "Australia's new law, approved by its Parliament last week, is an attempt to swim against many tides of modern life \u2014 formidable forces like technology, marketing, globalization and, of course, the iron will of a teenager. And like efforts of the past to protect kids from things that parents believe they're not ready for, the nation's move is both ambitious and not exactly simple, particularly in a world where young people are often shaped, defined and judged by the online company they keep.",
      "The ban won't go into effect for another year. But how will Australia be able to enforce it? That's not clear, nor will it be easy. TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram have become so ingrained in young people's lives that going cold turkey will be difficult.",
      "Other questions loom. Does the ban limit kids' free expression and \u2014 especially for those in vulnerable groups \u2014 isolate them and curtail their opportunity to connect with members of their community? And how will social sites verify people's ages, anyway? Can't kids just get around such technicalities, as they so often do?",
      "This is, after all, the 21st century \u2014 an era when social media is the primary communications tool for most of those born in the past 25 years who, in a fragmented world, seek the common cultures of trends, music and memes. What happens when big swaths of that fall away?",
      "Is Australia's initiative a good, long-time-coming development that will protect the vulnerable, or could it become a well-meaning experiment with unintended consequences?",
      "The law will make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent children younger than 16 from holding accounts. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that social media companies have to be held accountable, which is what Australia is trying to do,\u201d said Jim Steyer, president and CEO of the nonprofit Common Sense Media.",
      "Leaders and parents in countries around the world are watching Australia\u2019s policy closely as many seek to protect young kids from the internet's dangerous corners \u2014 and, not incidentally, from each other. Most nations have taken different routes, from parental consent requirements to minimum age limits.",
      "Many child safety experts, parents and even teens who have waited to get on social media consider Australia's move a positive step. They say there\u2019s ample reason to ensure that children wait.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s most important for kids, just like adults, is real human connection. Less time alone on the screen means more time to connect, not less,\" said Julie Scelfo, the founder of Mothers Against Media Addiction, or MAMA, a grassroots group of parents aimed at combatting the harms of social media to children. \u201cI\u2019m confident we can support our kids in interacting in any number of ways aside from sharing the latest meme.\u201d",
      "The harms to children from social media have been well documented in the two decades since Facebook\u2019s launch ushered in a new era in how the world communicates. Kids who spend more time on social media, especially as tweens or young teenagers, are more likely to experience depression and anxiety, according to multiple studies \u2014 though it is not yet clear if there is a causal relationship.",
      "What's more, many are exposed to content that is not appropriate for their age, including pornography and violence, as well as social pressures about body image and makeup. They also face bullying, sexual harassment and unwanted advances from their peers as well as adult strangers. Because their brains are not fully developed, teenagers, especially younger ones the law is focused on, are also more affected by social comparisons than adults, so even happy posts from friends can send them into a negative spiral.",
      "Many major initiatives, particularly those aimed at social engineering, can produce side effects \u2014 often unintended. Could that happen here? What, if anything, do kids stand to lose by separating kids and the networks in which they participate?",
      "Paul Taske, associate director of litigation at the tech lobbying group NetChoice, says he considers the ban \u201cone of the most extreme violations of free speech on the world stage today\" even as he expressed relief that the First Amendment prevents such law in the United States",
      "\"These restrictions would create a massive cultural shift,\u201d Taske said.",
      "\u201cNot only is the Australian government preventing young people from engaging with issues they\u2019re passionate about, but they\u2019re also doing so even if their parents are ok with them using digital services,\" he said. \"Parents know their children and their needs the best, and they should be making these decisions for their families \u2014 not big government. That kind of forcible control over families inevitably will have downstream cultural impacts.\u201d",
      "David Inserra, a fellow for Free Expression and Technology, Cato Institute, called the bill \u201cabout as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike\u201d in a recent blog post. While Australia's law doesn't require \u201chard verification\u201d such as an uploaded ID, he said, it calls for effective \u201cage assurance.\u201d He said no verification system can ensure accuracy while also protecting privacy and not impacting adults in the process.",
      "Privacy advocates have also raised concerns about the law's effect on online anonymity, a cornerstone of online communications \u2014 and something that can protect teens on social platforms.",
      "\u201cWhether it be religious minorities and dissidents, LGBTQ youth, those in abusive situations, whistleblowers, or countless other speakers in tricky situations, anonymous speech is a critical tool to safely challenge authority and express controversial opinions,\u201d Inserra said.",
      "A spot check of kids at one mall in the Australian city of Brisbane on Wednesday didn't turn up a great deal of worry, though.",
      "\u201cSocial media is still important because you get to talk to people, but I think it\u2019s still good that they\u2019re like limiting it,\u201d said Swan Son, a 13-year-old student at Brisbane State High School. She said she has had limited exposure to social media and wouldn\u2019t really miss it for a couple of years. Her parents already enforce a daily one-hour limit. And as for her friends? \u201cI see them at school every day, so I think I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d",
      "Conor Negric, 16, said he felt he\u2019d dodged a bullet because of his age. Still, he considers the law reasonable. \u201cI think 16 is fine. Some kids, I know some kids like 10 who\u2019re on Instagram, Snapchat. I only got Instagram when I was 14.\"",
      "His mom, Sive Negric, who has two teenage sons, said she was happy for her boys to avoid exposure to social media too early: \u201cThat aspect of the internet, it\u2019s a bit `meanland.'\"",
      "Parents in Britain and across Europe earlier this year organized on platforms such as WhatsApp and Telegram to promise not to buy smartphones for children younger than 12 or 13. This approach costs almost no money and requires no government enforcement. In the United States, some parents are keeping kids off social media either informally or as part of an organized campaign such as Wait Until 8th, a group that helps parents delay kids' access to social media and phones.",
      "This fall, Norway announced plans to ban kids under 15 from using social media, while France is testing a smartphone ban for kids under 15 in a limited number of schools \u2014 a policy that could be rolled out nationwide if successful.",
      "U.S. lawmakers have held multiple congressional hearings \u2014 most recently in January \u2014 on child online safety. Still, the last federal law aimed at protecting children online was enacted in 1998, six years before Facebook\u2019s founding. In July, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation designed to protect children from dangerous online content, pushing forward with what would be the first major effort by Congress in decades to hold tech companies more accountable. But the Kids Online Safety Act has since stalled in the House.",
      "While several states have passed laws requiring age verification, those are stuck in court. Utah became the first state to pass laws regulating children\u2019s social media use in 2023. In September, a judge issued the preliminary injunction against the law, which would have required social media companies to verify the ages of users, apply privacy settings and limit some features. NetChoice has also obtained injunctions temporarily halting similar laws in several other states.",
      "And last May, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said there is insufficient evidence to show social media is safe for kids. He urged policymakers to treat social media like car seats, baby formula, medication and other products children use.",
      "\u201cWhy should social media products be any different? Scelfo said. \u201cParents cannot possibly bear the entire responsibility of keeping children safe online, because the problems are baked into the design of the products.\u201d",

      "Three days after the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, police still did not know the gunman's name or whereabouts or have a motive for the killing, Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told reporters. Investigators were looking at whether the shooter may have been a disgruntled employee or client of the insurer, he said.",

      "Police have video of the man entering the bus station but no video of him exiting, leading them to believe he left the city, Kenny said.",
      "Investigators on Friday found a backpack in the park that had been worn by the gunman during the shooting, police said, following a massive sweep to find it in a vast area with lakes and ponds, meadows, playgrounds and woods.",
      "Police didn\u2019t immediately reveal what, if anything, it contained but said it would be analyzed for clues.",
      "The gunman made sure to conceal his identity with a mask during almost all of his time in the city, including during the attack and while he ate, yet left a trail of evidence in view of the nation\u2019s biggest city and its network of security cameras.",
      "The gunman arrived in New York City on Nov. 24 and shot Thompson 10 days later outside his company\u2019s annual investor conference at a hotel just blocks from Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center.",
      "The gunman got off a bus that originated in Atlanta and made several stops along the way, Kenny said. Police have not determined where he got on the bus. Investigators have a list of passengers, but none of them would have had to provide an ID when they climbed aboard, Kenny said.",
      "Investigators believe the suspect used a fake identification card and paid cash, Kenny said, when he checked in at the hostel, which has a caf\u00e9 along with shared and private rooms and is blocks from Columbia University.",

We\u2019re painstakingly going through every bit of evidence that we can come across. Eventually, when an apprehension is made, we will have to present all of these facts to a judge and jury, so we\u2019re taking our time, doing it right and making sure we\u2019re going to get justice for this victim and closure for his family.\u201d",
      "Security video of the shooting shows the killer approaching Thompson from behind, firing several shots with a gun equipped with a silencer, barely pausing to clear a jam while the executive fell to the sidewalk.",
      "Police were looking into the possibility that the weapon was a veterinary pistol, which is a weapon commonly used on farms and ranches if an animal has to be euthanized quietly, Kenny said \u2014 though he stressed that hadn't been confirmed.",
      "The words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were scrawled on the ammunition, one word on each of three bullets, Kenny said.

      "An alternative healer who advocated \u201cslapping therapy\u201d to treat a range of maladies has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for the death of a 71-year-old diabetic woman who stopped taking insulin during his workshop",
      "LONDON -- An alternative healer who advocated \u201cslapping therapy\u201d to treat a range of maladies was sentenced Friday to 10 years in prison for the death of a 71-year-old diabetic woman who stopped taking insulin during one of his workshops.",
      "Hongchi Xiao, 61, was convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence for failing to get medical help for Danielle Carr-Gomm as she howled in pain and frothed at the mouth during the fourth day of a workshop in October 2016.",
      "Xiao, of Cloudbreak, California, promoted paida lajin therapy, getting patients to slap themselves repeatedly to release \u201cpoisonous waste\u201d from the body. The technique has its roots in Chinese medicine, but critics say it has no scientific basis and patients often end up with bruises, bleeding \u2014 or worse.",
      "Carr-Gomm was one of two of Xiao\u2019s patients who died.",
      "He was extradited from Australia, where he had been convicted of manslaughter after a 6-year-old boy died when his parents withdrew his insulin medication after attending one of his workshops in Sydney.",

      "Carr-Gomm was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 1999 and was desperate to find a cure that didn't involve injecting herself with needles, her son, Matthew, said.",
      "She sought out alternative treatments and had attended a previous workshop by Xiao in Bulgaria a few months before her death in which she also became seriously ill after ceasing her medication.",
      "However, she recorded a video testimonial, calling Xiao a \u201cmessenger sent by God\u201d who was \u201cstarting a revolution to put the power back in the hands of the people to cure themselves and to change the whole system of healthcare.\"",
      "Xiao had congratulated Carr-Gomm when she told other participants at the English retreat that she had stopped taking her insulin.",
      "By day three, Carr-Gomm was \"vomiting, tired and weak, and by the evening she was howling in pain and unable to respond to questions,\u201d prosecutor Duncan Atkinson said.",
      "A chef who wanted to call an ambulance said she deferred to those with holistic healing experience.",
      "\u201cThose who had received and accepted the defendant\u2019s teachings misinterpreted Mrs. Carr-Gomm\u2019s condition as a healing crisis,\u201d Atkinson said."

      "A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat",
      "A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat. Researchers found at higher temperatures and humidity, the heat kills far more young people under 35 than those older than 50.",
      "For decades, health and weather experts have warned that the elderly and the youngest children were most vulnerable in heat waves. But this study looking at all deaths in Mexico from 1998 to 2019 shows that when the combination of humidity and temperature reach uncomfortable levels, such as the mid to upper 80s Fahrenheit (around 30 degrees Celsius) and 50% relative humidity, there were nearly 32 temperature-related deaths of people 35 years old for every temperature-related death of someone 50 and older.",
      "The study in Friday's journal Science Advances shows an especially surprising spike of heat-related deaths in an age group thought to be young and robust: People between 18 and 35. That age group alone had nine times as many temperature-related deaths as those older than 50.",
      "Study authors and outside experts are scrambling to figure out why. Demographics alone don't explain why more young adult Mexicans are dying in high heat than their elders. Two theories: Outdoor workers who can't escape the heat, and young people who don't know their limits.",
      "The trend is likely to widen as the world warms from human-caused climate change, according to computer simulations run by the study team.",
      "\u201cWe found that younger people are especially vulnerable to humid heat,\u201d study co-author Jeffrey Shrader, a climate economist at Columbia University, said. \u201cAs the climate warms, we're really going to be shifting the burden of temperature-related mortality towards younger individuals and away from older individuals who tend to be more vulnerable to cold temperatures.\u201d",
      "Data from cold weather shows more than 300 deaths of Mexican residents 50 and older for every young person dying from cold temperatures, according to the study.",
      "\u201cPeople of all ages are increasingly at risk from the rising temperatures, and this study shows that those that we might have considered relatively safe from heat-related adverse health outcomes might not be so much so,\u201d said Marina Romanello, executive director of the Lancet Countdown that monitors health effects of climate change. She was not part of the study team.",
      "\u201cHeat is a much more dangerous silent killer than most people acknowledge it to be, and that heat is increasingly putting our health and survival at risk,\" Romanello said in an email.",
      "Study authors decided to examine weather-related deaths in Mexico because that country not only has detailed mortality data, but it has a variety of different climates making it an ideal place to study in depth, Shrader said.",
      "Researchers also want to figure out whether this is just a situation in Mexico or other warmer sections of the globe have similar spikes in young adult deaths in high heat and humidity.",
      "Initially the team just wanted to look at deaths and what scientists call wet-bulb globe temperatures, but when they looked at age differences, they were surprised and looked in more detail, Shrader said. Wet-bulb temperature, which is intended to mirror how the body cools itself, is derived using a complicated measurement system that factors in humidity and solar radiation. A wet-bulb globe temperature of 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) is thought to be the limit for human survivability. Most places don\u2019t reach that level.",
      "Researchers determined temperature-related mortality by complex statistical analysis that compares numerous factors in the number of deaths and removes everything they can except temperature fluctuations, said study co-author Andrew Wilson, a Columbia climate economics researcher.",
      "Researchers also calculated the ideal temperature for when there are the fewest excess deaths at each age group. Younger adults' sweet temperature spot is about nine degrees Fahrenheit (five degrees Celsius) cooler than it is for older people, Shrader and Wilson said.",
      "Some outside health and climate experts were initially puzzled at the higher youth mortality seen in the study. Co-author Patrick Kinney, a professor of urban health and sustainability at Boston University, said it was likely the study included a higher proportion of outdoor workers exposed to heat than prior studies did.",
      "Study co-author Tereza Cavazos, a climate scientist at the Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education in Mexico, said she remembers her father's generations taking siestas in the high heat of the day and that was healthy. That doesn't happen so much now, she said.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of population that is vulnerable in the future. Not even in the future, right now,\u201d Cavazos said. She mentioned three Mexican heat waves this year that hit in the middle of the country and kept the deadly heat going overnight so people had little relief. Usually cool nights allow a body to recover.",
      "Younger people often have a sense of invulnerability to weather extremes and do things that increase their risk, such as play sports in high heat, Cavazos said.",
      "\u201cHigh humidity makes it a lot harder for the body to cool itself through sweating \u2013 which is how our body primarily stays cool,\" said Dr. Renee Salas, an emergency medicine physician and climate change expert at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. She was not part of the study team. \"So someone young and healthy working outside in heat and high humidity can reach a point where the body can no longer cool itself safely \u2013 causing a deadly form of heat injury called heat stroke.\u201d",

      "Democrats in Michigan are pressing to pass reproductive health care legislation before the party loses its majority with the new legislative session next year",
      "LANSING, Mich. -- Michigan Democrats are pushing this month to pass legislation they say will improve reproductive health care, in particular the safety of digital health data, ahead of Republicans taking over the state House in 2025.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is backing a bill designed to protect reproductive health data including data logged on menstrual cycle tracking apps. Similar legislation that has passed in other states is aimed at keeping the data from being used to target people seeking abortions.",
      "\u201cThis feels like a very urgent need for us to get this done while we have a window in Michigan with the Democratic majority for the next few weeks,\u201d said state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, sponsor of the digital privacy bill.",
      "The rush is a reaction to expectations that it will be harder to pass the reproductive health care policies Democrats favor after Republicans take control of the state House in January. Democrats kept control of the state Senate in the November election.",
      "Republicans have opposed the digital privacy bill over a section they say will stifle anti-abortion advertising.",
      "Other reproductive health bills to be considered during the December session that began Tuesday include a package on Black maternal health and an expansion of access to birth control.",
      "After the overturn of Roe v. Wade, some women in states with strict abortion bans began to worry that their health information could be used to track their reproductive status. Apps that track menstrual cycles became a major focus point.",
      "Abortion is constitutionally protected in Michigan. But McMorrow does not trust President-elect Donald Trump's campaign promise to veto any possible national abortion ban nor his campaign's efforts to distance itself from Project 2025, which proposed a rollback on abortion and contraception access.",
      "Period tracking apps allow women to take detailed day-by-day notes about their health, from how heavy their period flow is to additional symptoms such as cramping. They can log pregnancies and miscarriages.",
      "\u201cThese tools are really valuable,\u201d McMorrow said. \u201cI just want to make sure that the guardrails are there when indications from the incoming federal administration is they would potentially weaponize the data in a way that is very dangerous.\u201d",
      "Federal law bars medical providers from sharing health data without a patient\u2019s consent but doesn\u2019t prevent digital tech companies from tracking menstrual cycles or an individual\u2019s location and selling it to data brokers. Legislation for federal bans have never gained momentum, largely because of opposition from the tech industry.",
      "How the legislation works varies from state to state. Washington state has digital privacy law that broadly covers all health-related data while Virginia has a law that explicitly prohibits the issuance of search warrants, subpoenas or court orders for electronic or digital menstrual health data.",
      "Michigan\u2019s proposal would require businesses or organizations to use reproductive health data only for the services it provides, and consumers must be informed of how the data is being used. In order to sell that data, an entity would need explicit, signed consent from the consumer. Consumers would also have the option to opt out from their data being sold at any time.",
      "It would also regulate retailers, who often compile data to target consumers with advertisements, and the use of geofencing, which allows marketers to target consumers with ads based on their location.",
      "The bill would prohibit identifying who is receiving reproductive health care by using location information and targeting them with advertisements. This would apply to people visiting fertility or abortion clinics.",
      "The geofencing provision of the bill has drawn objection from anti-abortion advocates. Genevieve Marnon, legislative director for Right to Life of Michigan, said in committee testimony Tuesday that the bill would prevent women visiting an abortion clinic from being reached by anti-abortion ads.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t safeguarding women\u2019s reproductive health data,\" she said. \u201cIt is limiting the options presented to women.\u201d",
      "Republican Sen. John Damoose, who voted against the bill in committee, believes the geofencing provision encroaches on freedom of speech and religion by preventing anti-abortion advertising.",
      "The bill was voted out of committee Tuesday on party lines and advanced Thursday toward a final vote in the Senate chamber.",
      "Kimya Forouzan, principal state policy director at the Guttmacher Institute, expects the topic to be taken up by other state legislatures next year. Guttmacher, which supports abortion rights, tracks reproductive health trends.",
      "Over the past two years, Michigan Democrats have passed bills repealing a number of anti-abortion laws, including the state\u2019s 1931 ban, and adding surrogacy protections to state law. Lawmakers are considering a number of others related to reproductive health this month.",
      "A group of bills focused on improving maternal health for Black women would create a doula scholarship, among other measures. The Senate voted its package on the topic through to the House on Tuesday.",
      "Rep. Jaime Churches, a Democrat from the downriver area of Detroit who lost her seat in November, is trying to gain traction for two bills that would require insurance to cover fertility treatments, including in vitro fertilization and intrauterine insemination.",
      "Three bills seeking to expand access to birth control through insurance have passed the state House. McMorrow also introduced a series of bills aimed at providing long-lasting reversible contraception, such an implants or intrauterine devices, to patients who have given birth before they are discharged from a hospital.",
      "There is competition among Democrats for time during this short, lame duck session. Advocates for economic development, infrastructure and gun control measures are among the many looking to push through bills in the month that is left. Major contention over new paid sick leave and minimum wage requirements is likely to garner attention. Those discussions could reduce the amount of time available to debate reproductive health measures.",

    "story": [
      "Planned Parenthood wanted to resume offering abortions in several Missouri clinics on Friday, immediately after the state's new constitutional amendment rolling back a near total ban took effect",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Planned Parenthood wanted to resume offering abortions in several Missouri clinics on Friday, immediately after a newly passed constitutional amendment rolling back the state\u2019s near-total ban took effect, but they remain on hold as a complicated court battle drags on.",
      "The issue is that the amendment does not specifically override any state laws. And even before the end of Roe v. Wade enabled Missouri's Republican-led legislature to approve a near-total ban, the state's numerous restrictions left it with just one abortion clinic, in St. Louis.",
      "Missouri\u2019s Republican attorney general says many of those old laws \u2014 like a 72-hour waiting period \u2014 should still be enforced despite the amendment; Planned Parenthood says they shouldn't.",
      "Prosecutors are caught in the middle. They want a preliminary injunction halting enforcement of the old laws while attorneys argue about what to do.",
      "But so far, Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang hasn't acted on that request.",
      "\u201cAs of today, Missourians have an unrealized constitutional right,\u201d said Emily Wales, president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood Great Plains in a written statement. \"They are entitled to access abortion under the state\u2019s constitution, and every day they cannot get that care here at home, their rights are being violated.\u201d",
      "Here is what to know about the complicated legal battle and the state of abortion access:",
      "Missouri is one of five states where voters approved ballot measures in November adding the right to an abortion to their state constitutions. Ultimately approved by almost 52% of voters, it guarantees people\u2019s right to make decisions about their reproductive health, such as whether to get an abortion, take birth control or get in vitro fertilization.",
      "While the amendment is widely understood to prevent the state from restricting abortions up to the point of viability, abortion-rights advocates must persuade judges to prevent old regulations from being enforced.",
      "\u201cThere were certainly people who thought the issue was decided after the vote \u2014 that we would have access,\" Wales said Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ve had patients calling for weeks now saying, \u2018Can I get in? Can I stay close to home?\u2019 Of course, that\u2019s not true.\u201d",
      "Reproductive rights activists are also suing to dismantle Arizona's 15-week abortion ban that conflicts with the fundamental right to abortion voters approved.",
      "Maryland's new abortion rights amendment won't make an immediate difference, since the state already allows access to abortion. It's a similar situation in Montana, where abortion is already legal until viability. Colorado's measure enshrined already-existing access and undoes an earlier amendment that prohibited state and local government funding for abortion, opening the possibility of state Medicaid and government employee insurance plans covering care.",
      "The day after voters approved Missouri's amendment, the two Planned Parenthood branches asked a judge to find the state\u2019s near-total ban and most of its other abortion regulations unenforceable.",
      "Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey has already conceded that most abortions are now legal. He issued an opinion last month, stating that he will not enforce Missouri\u2019s ban on abortions before viability.",
      "But his office is still fighting to keep a 72-hour waiting period before an abortion can be performed; bans on abortions based on race, sex or a possible Down syndrome diagnosis; and a requirement that medical facilities that provide abortions be licensed as ambulatory surgical centers, among other regulations.",
      "This patchwork of old laws is a big problem for abortion providers. They say those restrictions had effectively blocked abortions across most of the state even before Missouri enacted a law banning all abortions except in cases of medical emergency, minutes after Roe was toppled.",
      "\u201cWe have already been living in a post-Roe world,\u201d Dr. Iman Alsaden, the medical director of the Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said at the time.",
      "But Missouri Solicitor General Josh Divine has defended these laws, arguing that most women regret their abortions and that the requirements are designed to give them the time to think through their decisions.",
      "\"What we are trying to do is create a situation where women can in fact make the choice they want to do \u2014 and we know that most of the time that is childbirth,\u201d Divine said after a court hearing Wednesday.",
      "Wales, of Planned Parenthood, said Missourians showed at the ballot box that they value reproductive rights. And she expressed frustration with what she described as \"an Attorney General\u2019s office that has made clear it will fight tooth and nail to prevent Missourians from accessing their new constitutional right to reproductive freedom.\u201d",

      "The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded slightly different numbers, with 376 cases and 79 deaths. The discrepancy was caused by problems with surveillance and case definition, the head of the Africa CDC, Jean Kaseya, said.",

      "Mwamba said that Panzi was already a \u201cfragile\u201d zone, with 40% of its residents experiencing malnutrition. It was also hit by an epidemic of typhoid fever two years ago, and there is currently a resurgence of seasonal flu across the country.",
      "Oscar Kazwa, a resident of Panzi, said his 28-year-old daughter died two weeks ago from the mystery disease.",
      "\u201cShe had a high fever, coughing, vomiting and was very weak.\u201d Kazwa said. \u201cAs there was no adequate care, she died.\"",
      "WHO experts are joining the National Rapid Response Team in Panzi to support the response to the outbreak. The team, which includes epidemiologists and clinicians, will deliver medicines and sample kits to help identify the cause of the disease. It will also collaborate with community leaders to enhance surveillance and promote infection prevention.",
      "Since late November, a local WHO team has been helping Kwango\u2019s health authorities with disease surveillance, the organization's statement said.",
      "While Kamba said he was not aware of any reports of the disease in health zones other than Panzi, the WHO said in its statement Friday that the disease has been reported in seven of the 30 health zones in Kwango province."

      "Nearly four days after the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, police still do not know the gunman\u2019s name or whereabouts or have a motive for the killing",
      "NEW YORK -- The gunman who killed the CEO of the largest U.S. health insurer likely left New York City on a bus soon after the brazen ambush that has shaken corporate America, police officials said. But he left something behind: a backpack that was discovered in Central Park.",
      "Nearly four days after the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, police still did not know the gunman\u2019s name or whereabouts or have a motive for the killing. Investigators were looking at whether the shooter may have been a disgruntled employee or client of the insurer, Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told reporters.",
      "The FBI announced Friday night it was offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction.",
      "Video of the gunman fleeing Wednesday\u2019s shooting showed him riding a bicycle into Central Park and later taking a taxi to a bus terminal that offers commuter service to New Jersey and Greyhound routes to Philadelphia, Boston and Washington, D.C, according to Kenny.",
      "Police have video of the man entering the bus station but no video of him exiting, leading them to believe he left the city, Kenny said.",
      "Investigators on Friday found a backpack in the park that had been worn by the gunman during the shooting, police said, following a massive sweep to find it in a vast area with lakes and ponds, meadows, playgrounds and woods.",
      "Police didn\u2019t immediately reveal what, if anything, it contained but said it would be analyzed for clues.",
      "The gunman made sure to conceal his identity with a mask during almost all of his time in the city, including during the attack and while he ate, yet left a trail of evidence in view of the nation\u2019s biggest city and its network of security cameras.",
      "The gunman arrived in New York City on Nov. 24 and shot Thompson 10 days later outside his company\u2019s annual investor conference at a hotel just blocks from Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center.",
      "The gunman got off a bus that originated in Atlanta and made several stops along the way, Kenny said. Police have not determined where he got on the bus. Investigators have a list of passengers, but none of them would have had to provide an ID when they climbed aboard, Kenny said.",
      "Investigators believe the suspect used a fake identification card and paid cash, Kenny said, when he checked in at the hostel, which has a caf\u00e9 along with shared and private rooms and is blocks from Columbia University.",
      "Investigators have tested a discarded water bottle and protein bar wrapper in a hunt for his DNA. They also were trying to obtain additional information from a cellphone found along the gunman\u2019s escape route.",
      "Photos of the suspected shooter that were taken in the lobby of a hostel on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side appear to from the only time he removed his mask, Kenny said. The images, showing a man smiling in the lobby of the HI New York City hostel. They are among a collection of photos and video circulated since the shooting \u2014 including footage of the attack, as well as images of the suspected gunman at a Starbucks beforehand.",
      "\u201cFrom every indication we have from witnesses, from the Starbucks, from the hostel, he kept his mask on at all times except for the one instance where we have him photographed with the mask off,\u201d Kenny said.",
      "His roommates at the hostel also said he didn\u2019t speak to them. Nothing of investigative value was found in a search of the suspected shooter\u2019s hotel room.",
      "Asked how close he felt police were to making an arrest, Kenny said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t \u2018Blue Bloods.\u2019 We\u2019re not going to solve this in 60 minutes. We\u2019re painstakingly going through every bit of evidence that we can come across. Eventually, when an apprehension is made, we will have to present all of these facts to a judge and jury, so we\u2019re taking our time, doing it right and making sure we\u2019re going to get justice for this victim and closure for his family.\u201d",
      "Security video of the shooting shows the killer approaching Thompson from behind, firing several shots with a gun equipped with a silencer, barely pausing to clear a jam while the executive fell to the sidewalk.",
      "Police were looking into the possibility that the weapon was a veterinary pistol, which is a weapon commonly used on farms and ranches if an animal has to be euthanized quietly, Kenny said \u2014 though he stressed that hadn\u2019t been confirmed.",
      "The words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were scrawled on the ammunition, one word on each of three bullets, Kenny said. A law enforcement official previously told The Associated Press the words were \u201cdeny,\u201d \u201cdefend\u201d and \u201cdepose.\u201d The messages mirror the phrase \u201cdelay, deny, defend,\u201d which is commonly used by lawyers and critics about insurers that delay payments, deny claims and defend their actions.",
      "Thompson, a father of two sons who lived in a Minneapolis suburb, had been with Minnesota-based UnitedHealthcare since 2004 and served as CEO for more than three years.",
      "The insurer\u2019s parent company, UnitedHealth Group Inc., was holding its annual meeting in New York for investors. The company abruptly ended the conference after Thompson\u2019s death.",
      "UnitedHealth Group said it was focused on supporting Thompson\u2019s family, ensuring the safety of employees and assisting investigators. \u201cWhile our hearts are broken, we have been touched by the huge outpouring,\u201d the company said.",
      "UnitedHealthcare provides coverage for more than 49 million Americans. It manages health insurance coverage for employers and state and federally funded Medicaid programs.",
      "In October, UnitedHealthcare was named along with Humana and CVS in a Senate report detailing how its denial rate for prior authorizations for some Medicare Advantage patients has surged in recent years.",
      "The shooting has rocked the health insurance industry in particular, causing companies to reevaluate security plans and delete photos of executives from their websites. A different Minnesota-based health care company said Friday it was temporarily closing its offices out of an abundance of caution, telling employees to work from home.",

      "The fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare's CEO has opened the door for many people to vent their frustrations and anger over the insurance industry",
      "For years, patients in the U.S. health care system have grown frustrated with a bureaucracy they don\u2019t understand.",
      "Doctors are included in an insurer\u2019s network one year but not the next. Getting someone on the phone to help can be next to impossible. Coverage of care and prescriptions is often unceremoniously denied.",
      "This week\u2019s fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has unleashed a wave of public feeling \u2014 exasperation, anger, resentment, helplessness \u2014 from Americans sharing personal stories of interactions with insurance companies, often seen as faceless corporate giants.",
      "In particular, the words written on ammunition found at the shooting scene \u2014 \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose,\u201d echoing a phrase used to describe how insurers dodge claim payouts \u2014 amplified voices that have long been critical of the industry.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden, I am fired up again,\u201d said Tim Anderson, describing how his wife, Mary, had to deal with UnitedHealthcare coverage denials before she died from Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in 2022.",
      "Anderson said they couldn\u2019t get coverage for machines to help his wife breathe or talk \u2014 toward the end, she communicated by blinking when he showed her pictures. The family had to rely on donations from a local ALS group, he said.",
      "\u201cThe business model for insurance is don\u2019t pay,\u201d said Anderson, 67, of Centerville, Ohio.",
      "\u201cWhen Mary could still talk, she said to me to keep fighting this,\u201d he added. \u201cIt needs to be exposed.\u201d",
      "For Anderson and others, Thompson's death and the message left at the scene have created an opportunity to vent their frustrations. Conversations at dinner tables, office water coolers, social gatherings and on social media have pivoted to the topic, as police efforts to find the gunman keep the case in the news.",
      "Hans Maristela said he understands why the chatter is bubbling up. The 54-year-old caregiver in California was moved to comment on Facebook about UnitedHealthcare's reputation of denying coverage. As a Catholic, he said, he grieves Thompson's death and feels for his family, especially with the holidays around the corner.",
      "But he sees frustration with insurers even among his clients, most of them wealthy older people who've not been shielded from high out-of-pocket costs.",
      "\u201cAnd then you know the CEO of this company you pay a lot of money to gets $10 million dollars a year, you won\u2019t have a lot of sympathy for the guy,\" Maristela said, citing Thompson's compensation package that included base pay and stock options. \u201cHealth care is a business, I understand, but the obsession with share price, with profit, has to be reevaluated.\u201d",
      "University of Pennsylvania researcher Michael Anne Kyle said she's not surprised by the growth of conversation around insurers.",
      "\u201cPeople are often struggling with this by themselves, and when you see someone else talk about it, that may prompt you to join the conversation,\u201d she said.",
      "Kyle studies how patients access care and said she's seen frustration with the system build for years. Costs are rising, and insurers are using more controls such as prior authorizations and doctor networks to manage them. Patients are often stuck in the middle of disputes between doctors and insurers.",
      "\u201cPatients are already spending a lot of money on health care, and then they\u2019re still facing problems with the service,\u201d she said.",
      "Insurers often note that most of the money they bring in goes back out the door to pay claims, and that they try to corral soaring costs and the overuse of some care.",
      "In Ohio, Anderson said his initial reaction to the CEO shooting was to question whether it was connected to a coverage denial, like the ones he'd experienced with his wife.",
      "\u201cI definitely do not condone killing people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I read it and said, 'I wonder if somebody had a spouse whose coverage was denied.\u2019\u201d",
      "It's something Will Flanary, a Portland-based ophthalmologist and comedian with a large social media following, saw online a lot in the shooting's immediate aftermath and found very telling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s zero sympathy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the lesson to take away from that is not, \u2018Let\u2019s shame people for celebrating a murder.\u2019 No, it\u2019s: \u2018Look at the amount of anger that people have toward this system that\u2019s taken advantage of people and do something to try to fix that.\u2019\u201d",
      "Flanary's content, published under the name Dr. Glaucomflecken, started out as niche eye doctor jokes and a way to cope with his own experiences with two cancer diagnoses and a sudden cardiac arrest. But it has evolved, featuring character skits that call attention to and satirize the decisions of large health insurers, including UnitedHealthcare.",
      "He said he's never seen conversations around health insurance policy take off the way they did this week \u2014 and he hopes these new voices can help bring about change.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always talking about how powerful social media can be with advocacy,\" he said, \"because it really is the only way to put a significant amount of pressure on these corporations who are doing bad things for patients.\u201d",

      "The Hospital de Jesus in Mexico City\u2019s bustling historic center covers most of a city block",
      "MEXICO CITY -- In Mexico City\u2019s bustling historic center, the Hospital de Jesus covers most of a city block. Its faded unassuming yellow facade, characteristic of the middle of the last century, obscures the medical center within founded 500 years ago by Spanish conqueror Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s.",
      "Entering between street-level shoe stores, visitors find the oldest continuously operating hospital in the Americas. Stone arches lead to expansive patios filled with lush vegetation.",
      "The hospital was founded to treat the conquering Spanish, then later opened to the local Indigenous inhabitants to ensure a healthy workforce. Today it provides 24/7 emergency care, as well as affordable access to medical specialists for current residents of what was at the time of its founding the center of the Aztec empire.",
      "\u201cYou can feel the Mexican heritage here,\u201d said Dr. Pedro \u00c1lvarez S\u00e1nchez. \u201cFor 500 years, the hospital has never closed its doors.\u201d",
      "On Nov. 8, 1519, Cort\u00e9s and his soldiers entered Tenochtitlan, the Aztec name for the capital, and met Aztec emperor Moctezuma in a place known as Huitzilan, just in front of the present-day hospital.",
      "Cort\u00e9s had conquered the city by 1521, and to honor that original encounter, he founded the hospital in 1524.",
      "The meeting of Cort\u00e9s and Moctezuma is depicted in a floor-to-ceiling tile mural beside one of the central patios. The main temple of Tenochtitlan \u2014 only a few blocks from the hospital \u2014 sits in the background. The union of two suns represents the meeting of two cultures.",
      "Cort\u00e9s is buried in a small church adjacent to the hospital. Descendants of him and Moctezuma met here in 2019 to mark the anniversary of that initial encounter.",
      "Around the world, only a handful of hospitals can boast such longevity. For example, St. Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital in London founded in 1123 and Bellevue Hospital in New York City founded in 1736 also continue to provide full medical services.",
      "Much of the hospital has remained intact thanks to a board of trustees founded in the 16th century. Over the years, countless doctors have quietly worked to conserve the hospital\u2019s mission of affordable care and to preserve the building\u2019s unique architectural features.",
      "\u201cWe want to ensure that this hospital continues to provide quality medical attention to patients,\u201d said Dr. Octaviano Rosalez Seraf\u00edn, 71, president of the hospital\u2019s board of trustees. \u201cWe want to continue the tradition of care the hospital has had for years.\u201d",
      "Celia Ch\u00e1vez Escamilla, 56, arrived at the hospital at dawn recently for an appointment with her dermatologist. \u201cHere they take good care of us,\u201d said Ch\u00e1vez. \u201cThe prices here are accessible. If you go somewhere else it\u2019s too expensive.\u201d Her consultation was just 400 pesos or under $20.",
      "Escamilla was accompanied by her daughter Myriam Rafael Sanchez, 26, who was fascinated by the medical center. \u201cI\u2019ve seen (the hospital) a lot in movies and TV shows,\u201d she said excitedly. \u201cWe have all of Mexico\u2019s history around us.\u201d",
      "The hospital didn\u2019t always serve the entire public, according to Sandra Elena Guevara Flores, an anthropologist focusing on medicine at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.",
      "Guevara said the hospital was not open to the Indigenous population initially, but only to the Spanish who had recently arrived in the Americas.",
      "However, as epidemics began to spread, the hospital opened its doors to more patients. \u201cIt was a strategy by the Spanish governors in the new Spain to treat the whole population,\u201d said Guevara. \u201cIt (was) so the servants and the whole labor system wouldn\u2019t die.\u201d",
      "Early Spanish doctors at the hospital often used native Mexican herbs to cure their patients. \u201cIt\u2019s said that traditional Galenic Hippocratic medicine was used in the hospital, but really it was Indigenous medicine,\u201d said Guevara. \u201cThey (Indigenous peoples) would share their knowledge.\u201d",
      "The Spanish imprint can be seen in the hospital\u2019s architecture, said Hugo Antonio Arciniega \u00c1vila, a historian and archaeological expert from the National Autonomous University of Mexico.",
      "The hospital, like some other colonial structures in Mexico City, is \u2018encapsulated\u2019 inside a newer building from the 1950s.",
      "Because the Spanish built low stone structures on huge lots with massive stone walls, people who wanted to build newer facilities a century or two later would often just build over, around or among the colonial-era structures. Sometimes they would incorporate the old masonry walls into the new building, either for preservation reasons or because it was cheaper to use them than to tear them down. So from the street, there is often no sign that behind a Victorian or functionalist facade, there is a partially preserved Spanish structure within.",
      "The hospital was built in the form of a T, with two large patios and a grand staircase devised by Spanish architect Claudio de Arciniega in the 16th century. The design provided constant ventilation and sunshine to patients. The architect also included a chapel on each of the two original floors.",
      "\u201cThe architecture of this hospital is fascinating,\u201d said Arciniega about the intentional layout of religious spaces and access to open air. \u201cIf you cure the soul, you can cure the body \u2013 it\u2019s the same way the doctors thought.\u201d",
      "For the 67-year-old \u00c1lvarez, who has worked at the hospital for nearly 50 years and also serves as the board of trustees\u2019 treasurer, the center has been a constant in his life. He began working at the hospital as a lab assistant at age 18.",
      "\u201cA lot of people ask me, why do you keep working at the Hospital de Jesus?\u201d he said. \u201cI tell them because I love it.\u201d",

      "The U.S. government on Friday ordered testing of the nation's milk supply for bird flu to better monitor the spread of the virus in dairy cows.",
      "Raw or unpasteurized milk from dairy farms and processors nationwide must be tested on request starting Dec. 16, the Agriculture Department said. Testing will begin in six states \u2014 California, Colorado, Michigan, Mississippi, Oregon and Pennsylvania.",
      "Officials said the move is aimed at \u201ccontaining and ultimately eliminating the virus,\" known as Type A H5N1, which was detected for the first time in March in U.S. dairy cows. Since then, more than 700 herds have been confirmed to be infected in 15 states.",
      "\u201cThis will give farms and farmworkers better confidence in the safety of their animals and ability to protect themselves, and it will put us on a path to quickly controlling and stopping the virus\u2019 spread nationwide,\u201d Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement.",
      "The risk to people from bird flu remains low, health officials said. Pasteurization, or heat treatment, kills the virus in milk, leaving it safe to drink.",
      "Veterinarians, farmers, scientists and academics have been calling for nationwide milk testing for months, said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, who led the efforts.",
      "\u201cIt's another step in the right direction,\u201d Poulsen said. \u201cThey're coming around that we need a better handle on it.\u201d",
      "Dairy farmers and processors across the U.S. have been reluctant to test animals or milk for the virus, fearing economic or other repercussions. Jamie Jonker, chief science officer of the National Milk Producers Federation, said the industry supports USDA efforts to eliminate the virus.",
      "Under the federal order, dairy farmers and those who handle raw milk intended for pasteurization must provide samples of the milk on request for testing for bird flu. It requires reporting of positive tests to the USDA and it requires herd owners to provide basic information to allow tracing of the disease in cattle.",
      "The move follows an April 24 federal order that mandated testing of certain dairy cattle before they could move between states and required reporting of any positive tests. Despite that order, the virus has continued to spread, Poulsen noted.",
      "Raw milk from infected cows contains high loads of live virus, testing has shown.",
      "At least 58 people in the U.S. have been infected with bird flu, mostly farm workers who became mildly ill after close contact with infected cows, including their milk, or infected poultry.",
      "Bird flu has also been spreading among wild birds and a number of other animals.",
      "Federal officials continue to warn against drinking raw milk, which can contain a host of germs that make people sick. In California, officials quarantined a farm and halted distribution of milk after bird flu virus was detected in raw milk sold in stores. Raw Farm of Fresno issued a voluntary recall of raw milk and cream produced after Nov. 9.",

      "A judge is weighing which of Missouri's sweeping abortion restrictions will fall under a new constitutional amendment",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Abortion-rights advocates on Wednesday asked a judge to overturn Missouri\u2019s near-total ban on the procedure, less than a month after voters backed an abortion-rights constitutional amendment.",
      "Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang did not immediately rule after the hearing. Planned Parenthood and other plaintiffs had asked her to issue a temporary order blocking enforcement of Missouri\u2019s numerous abortion laws.",
      "Emily Wales, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said abortions could begin Friday in clinics in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis if the judge issues the order.",
      "\u201cEvery single day that they cannot access abortion rights they are being denied critical care,\" Wales said of Missouri residents.",
      "Several anti-abortion protesters knelt on the ground as they prayed outside the courthouse during the hearing. They covered their mouths with a red piece of tape that read \u201clife.\u201d",
      "Missouri is one of five states where voters approved ballot measures this year to add the right to an abortion to their state constitutions. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "Reproductive rights advocates in Arizona on Tuesday sued to undo a 15-week abortion ban that conflicts with that state's new constitutional amendment expanding access up to fetal viability.",
      "The Missouri amendment does not specifically override any state laws. Instead the measure leaves it to advocates to ask courts to knock down bans that they believe would now be unconstitutional.",
      "Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, an abortion opponent, last week issued an opinion agreeing that most abortions will be legal when the amendment takes effect Thursday.",
      "But Bailey\u2019s office is still fighting for a ban on most abortions after viability, along with a number of regulations that Planned Parenthood argues made it nearly impossible to offer abortions in the state even before abortion was almost completely banned in 2022.",
      "Missouri\u2019s constitutional amendment allows lawmakers to restrict abortion after viability, with exceptions to \u201cprotect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.\u201d",
      "The term \u201cviability\u201d is used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Though there\u2019s no defined time frame, doctors say it is sometime after the 21st week of pregnancy.",
      "Other abortion laws that Bailey is defending include a 72-hour waiting period before an abortion can be performed; bans on abortions based on race, sex or a possible Down syndrome diagnosis; and a requirement that medical facilities that provide abortions be licensed as ambulatory surgical centers.",
      "Missouri Solicitor General Josh Divine argued in court that the right to reproductive freedom includes the right to childbirth, which he said supports laws such as the state's 72-hour waiting period.",
      "\u201cThose laws are enabling childbirth,\u201d he said. \"They are giving time to choose childbirth.\u201d",
      "But Planned Parenthood Federation of America attorney Ella Spottswood during the hearing told the judge that by 2019, the slew of Missouri laws regulating abortion had effectively limited access to a single St. Louis clinic.",
      "\u201cThe voters have changed all that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe questions should begin and end with the amendment.\u201d",
      "It is unclear when Zhang will rule on the request for a preliminary injunction.",

      "The move followed recalls of two lots of Raw Farm products after bird flu was first detected in retail milk on Nov. 21.",
      "No known cases of bird flu virus have been confirmed in people who drank raw milk, health officials said. Pasteurized milk is heat-treated to kill the virus and remains safe to drink.",
      "Pet owners also should avoid feeding Raw Farm products sold nationwide as \u201cpet food topper\u201d or \u201cpet food kefir\u201d to their animals, who can become ill, health officials said. Cats on farms with infected cows have developed brain damage and died after drinking contaminated raw milk.",
      "Bird flu virus, also known as Type A H5N1 avian influenza, was detected for the first time in U.S. dairy cows in March. The virus has been spreading rapidly, particularly in California, where nearly 500 of the more than 700 infected U.S. herds have been detected.",
      "The virus has infected 57 people in the U.S. this year, including 31 in California, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mild illnesses have been seen in dairy and poultry workers who had close contact with infected animals. In two cases, an adult in Missouri and a child in California, no known source of the illnesses have been identified. No cases of bird flu spreading between people have been detected in the U.S.",
      "Health officials have long warned against drinking raw milk because it can contain germs that cause illnesses that range from mild to life-threatening.",
      "Raw Farm\u2019s owner, Mark McAfee, has called for less raw milk regulation. In an Instagram post on Wednesday, farm officials said they were working to restore supply quickly.",
      "\u201cThere are no illnesses associated with H5N1 in our products. But rather this is a political issue,\u201d the post said. \u201cThere are no food safety issues with our products or consumer safety. We are working towards resolving this political issue while being cooperative with our government regulatory agencies.\u201d",
      "Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who has been tapped as the nation's top health official, has vowed to allow wider distribution of raw milk. McAfee told The Associated Press that Kennedy is a customer of his products. Kennedy has criticized agriculture departments for cracking down on raw milk and promised that the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s \u201c aggressive suppression \u201d of unpasteurized milk would end under President-elect Donald Trump.",

      "At least 26 states have adopted laws restricting or banning such care for minors, and most of those states face lawsuits.",
      "Here's the latest:",
      "Chase Strangio, the ACLU attorney who represented the families challenging the ban, said he was \u201chumbled and honored\u201d to appear before the court.",
      "Strangio said the arguments Tennessee used for its ban could also be used to justify a national ban. Strangio is the first transgender attorney to argue before the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cNo matter what happens, we will keep fighting,\u201d Strangio said.",
      "Speaking outside the Supreme Court building after the arguments, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said the state\u2019s argument would allow other states to set their own policies on whether or not to restrict the case.",
      "\u201cEach state is allowed to make its own decisions,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cToday marks a pivotal moment in Tennessee and our country\u2019s history. The Supreme Court of the United States heard oral arguments for a first-of-its-kind case that shows every state in the country what it really looks like to stand up for children,\u201d Tennessee state Sen. Jack Johnson said in a statement.",
      "Listen in full here.",
      "Arguments begin at 1:12:38.",
      "She pointed out that the arguments in favor of Tennessee\u2019s law could also potentially support nationwide restrictions on transgender health care for minors.",
      "The issue could remain at the center of the political conversation after the inauguration next month of President-elect Donald Trump, who made opposition to transgender rights central to his campaign\u2019s closing message.",
      "The arguments in front of the justices wrapped up after more than two hours.",
      "\u201cOur fundamental point is there is no sex-based line here,\u201d Rice said.",
      "Rice argued that the Tennessee law is instead aimed at the purpose of the treatment.",
      "Children can get puberty blockers to treat early onset puberty, but not as a treatment for gender dysphoria.",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked Tennessee Solicitor General Matt Rice about the possible impact of both laws restricting women and girls from women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports competitions \u2014 and those that keep them out of women\u2019s and girls\u2019 bathrooms in schools or other public buildings.",
      "At least 24 states have sports laws. At least 11 have bathroom laws.",

      "Strangio cited laws against cross-dressing and previous bans on military service by transgender people.",
      "President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed a Trump-era policy that largely barred transgender people from serving in the military. Trump has indicated he plans to reinstate that ban when he takes office in January.",
      "\u201cThe Constitution leaves that question to the people\u2019s representatives, rather than to 9 people, none of whom is a doctor,\u201d Roberts said in questioning Strangio.",

      "Transgender youth in the United States have been flooding crisis hotlines since the election of Donald Trump, who made anti-transgender themes central to his campaign.",
      "ACLU attorney Chase Strangio has begun his arguments against Tennessee's ban. He follows U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who finished answering questions after spending more than an hour at the podium.",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said she saw some parallels between the case and a 1967 landmark decision that legalized interracial marriage.",

      "Barrett wasn\u2019t on the court when the 2020 case was decided so this is her first time diving into the issue as a justice.",
      "She sounded skeptical of the administration\u2019s argument that the law discriminates because of sex. She was equally skeptical that the court should for the first time declare that discrimination against transgender people should be viewed as similar to bias based on race, sex and national origin, all of which have a special legal status.",
      "Barrett said transgender people have not experienced the same long history of discrimination written into the law in the same way those other groups faced.",
      "\u201cAll other suspect classes do have that long de jure history of discrimination,\u201d Barrett said, using the Latin phrase for \u201caccording to law.\u201d",

      "\u201cIf you prevail here on the standard of review, what would that mean for women and girls sports?\u201d he asked. \u201cWould transgender athletes have a constitutional right to participate in girls\u2019 sports?\u201d",
      "At least 24 states have adopted restrictions on transgender women and girls in women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports competitions. There have also been legal challenges to those laws, with mixed verdicts so far.",

      "She pointed to West Virginia\u2019s as one that might fare better because it gives a path for treatment for teens who are considered by medical providers to be at risk for self-harm or suicide.",
      "During questioning by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Prelogar noted that every major medical organization has supported gender-affirming care for transgender youth, and many have filed briefs supporting the challenge to Tennessee\u2019s law.",
      "\u201cSome children suffer incredibly with gender dysphoria, some attempt suicide,\u201d Sotomayor said.",

      "The votes of Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Amy Coney Barrett probably will decide this case.",

      "Roberts and Gorsuch joined the court\u2019s liberal justices (Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson) in the 2020 workplace discrimination case won by LGBTQ+ plaintiffs.",
      "Three conservative justices, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas, dissented on that case.",
      "Barrett has no high court track record on transgender issues, although she votes with the other conservatives in most of the high-profile cases.",
      "If the parties challenging the Tennessee law hope to win, they need at least two conservative justices on their side, along with the three liberal members of the court.",
      "Alito, who seems likely to vote to uphold the Tennessee ban, is using his questioning of Prelogar to persuade his colleagues that this case is different from the one four years ago where the court sided with LGBTQ+ people.",
      "The Bostock decision in 2020 found that the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 banned discrimination against LGBTQ+ people in the workplace.",
      "That \u201cinvolved the interpretation of particular language in a particular statute,\u201d Alito said.",
      "This case involves the Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause, a key provision of the 14th Amendment.",
      "Alito focused on where European countries stand on gender-affirming care for minors, noting that Finland, Norway and Sweden have policies discouraging it from being available routinely to minors.",
      "Prelogar noted that those countries don\u2019t go as far as Tennessee\u2019s outright ban on the treatments for transgender minors.",
      "The report asserts there is \u201cno good evidence on the long-term outcomes of interventions to manage gender-related distress.\u201d",
      "But advocates for transgender people have a lot of questions about the report.",
      "\u25b6The AP delved into it here",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts, who is one of the most closely watched justices in this case and previously voted in favor of transgender rights in the workplace, is asking whether this question might be best left to state legislatures.",
      "Prelogar responds that the state does have regulatory powers, but argues Tennessee\u2019s law is too broad.",
      "Supreme Court arguments have begun over Tennessee\u2019s ban on health care for transgender minors. The first attorney to argue is U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, arguing against the ban.",
      "The Republican-controlled Statehouse and GOP Gov. Bill Lee have signed off on legislation banning transgender athletes from participating in girls\u2019 sports.",
      "Republicans have also blocked businesses from setting their own rules about bathroom access \u2014 a move that critics have warned targets transgender people.",
      "This year, they placed a ban on the spending of state money on hormone therapy or sex reassignment procedures for prisoners and required public school employees to out transgender students to their parents.",
      "Shortly after enacting the ban on gender-affirming care, the Republican-dominant Legislature also passed legislation penalizing adults who help minors receive gender-affirming care without parental consent.",
      "Supporters of the proposal couldn\u2019t point to any examples of minors leaving the state to receive gender-affirming care without their parent\u2019s consent, but said it was needed anyway to protect children.",
      "Republican Gov. Bill Lee later signed off on the first-in-the-nation proposal.",
      "Over the years, Republican-dominant Tennessee has not only been among the top states to introduce the most anti-LGBTQ+ legislation but also the top state to enact such legislation.",
      "According to the Human Rights Campaign, Tennessee has enacted more anti-LGBTQ+ laws than any other state since 2015, identifying more than 20 bills that advanced out of the Legislature earlier this year. That includes Gov. Bill Lee signing off on bills banning the spending of state money on hormone therapy or sex reassignment procedures for prisoners \u2014 though it would not apply to state inmates currently receiving hormone therapy \u2014 and requiring public school employees to out transgender students to their parents.",
      "Attorneys for the families challenging Tennessee\u2019s law have warned a ruling upholding the measure could open the door for more attempts to restrict the care for transgender adults as well as youth.",
      "Florida is the only state that has enacted a law restricting gender-affirming care for transgender adults, though similar restrictions have been attempted in at least two other states.",
      "Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine\u2019s administration earlier this year proposed and then backed off rules that advocates said would have blocked access to gender-affirming care provided by independent clinics and general practitioners.",
      "Missouri\u2019s Republican attorney general last year pushed for an emergency rule that would have placed limits on care for adults, but state officials abruptly dropped it. Missouri later this year enacted a law banning some gender-affirming care for minors.",
      "Most adults still are allowed to access gender-affirming health care under the Missouri law, but Medicaid won\u2019t cover it.",
      "Arguing for the Biden administration is U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar. She\u2019s the second woman to serve in the role in the country\u2019s history, and this could be the last major case she argues as solicitor general \u2014 essentially the federal government\u2019s top lawyer before the Supreme Court.",
      "Matt Rice, Tennessee\u2019s state solicitor general, will defend the law before the high court. He served in 2019 as a clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, who dissented from a ruling that term that a landmark civil rights law protects LGBTQ+ workers.",
      "The treatments at the heart of today\u2019s arguments are also used by minors who are not transgender, including intersex people. Tennessee and other states have not tried to ban puberty blockers or hormone treatments for those uses.",
      "Puberty blockers can be used to delay sexual development in children who go through puberty before age 8 or 9. Adolescents with delayed puberty can be treated with hormones.",
      "Thomas was famously silent during arguments for years at a time because he said he relied on written briefs and thought his colleagues interrupted too much.",
      "But when the court started hearing cases remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, the justices altered their practice and asked questions one by one, instead of the usual free-for-all. Even after they returned to the courtroom, the justices have informally agreed to allow Thomas, the longest-serving member of the court, to go first.",
      "He has asked questions at every argument session he\u2019s attended since the court\u2019s first remote arguments in May 2020.",
      "Don\u2019t be fooled by the hour the court has allotted. The session could easily go twice as long.",
      "Gone are the days when Chief Justice William Rehnquist would cut lawyers off mid-sentence when the red light went on at their podium. Chief Justice John Roberts was more lenient even before the coronavirus pandemic forced changes to the structure of the arguments.",
      "But the administration\u2019s position seems likely to change after Trump takes office.",
      "He campaigned against transgender rights, using demeaning language and misrepresentations as he pledged to remove \u201ctransgender insanity\u201d in schools and restrict participation in women\u2019s sports.",
      "Brian Williams of Nashville, Tennessee, says his transgender daughter, L.W., has to travel to another state to receive the health care that \u201cwe and her doctors know is right for her.\u201d",
      "Williams, speaking on a Zoom call arranged by the legal team representing the family and others at the Supreme Court, said L.W. approached him and his wife, Samantha, several years ago to share \u201chonestly and openly her pain\u201d over her gender identity.",
      "She began taking puberty-blocking drugs at age 13 and started hormone therapy a year later, Williams says.",
      "Today, her father says, she is a \u201c16-year-old planning for her future, making her own music and looking at colleges.\u201d",
      "Williams says he\u2019s not expecting people to understand everything about the family. But he asks others to \u201copen your hearts and listen.\u201d",
      "President-elect Trump backed a national ban on such care as part of his 2024 campaign in which he demeaned and mocked transgender people. Trump and his allies also promised to roll back protections for transgender people throughout the campaign.",
      "Meanwhile, in its waning days, the Biden administration, along with families of transgender adolescents, will appeal to the justices to strike down the Tennessee ban as unlawful sex discrimination and protect the constitutional rights of vulnerable Americans.",
      "Earlier this year, the administration and Democrat-led states extended protections for transgender people, including a new federal regulation that seeks to protect transgender students.",
      "People on both sides of the issue are gathered outside the court for demonstrations that are increasing in volume ahead of arguments.",
      "They carried signs reading \u201cChampion God\u2019s Design\u201d and \u201cKids Health Matters\u201d on one side and \u201cFight like a Mother for Trans Rights\u201d and \u201cFreedom to be Ourselves\u201d on the other.",
      "Speeches and music filled the air on the sidewalk outside the court\u2019s marble steps.",
      "Multiple bills related to transgender youth have already been filed in Texas\u2019 legislature ahead of its session next year.",
      "The proposals include a bill that would make it easier to sue providers of gender-affirming medical care for children.",
      "Other bills include restrictions on which public restrooms transgender people can use, and limits on how topics related to sexual orientation and gender identity are taught in schools.",
      "At least 26 states have adopted laws banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors. Federal judges in Arkansas and Florida have struck down the bans in those states as unconstitutional, though an appeals court has put the Florida ruling on hold. The ban in New Hampshire is to take effect on Jan. 1.",
      "Several Democratic-controlled states have policies seeking to protect access to gender-affirming care.",
      "Additionally, at least 24 states have bans barring transgender women and girls from competing in certain women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports competitions. And at least 11 have laws barring transgender women and girls from using girls\u2019 and women\u2019s bathrooms at public schools \u2014 and in some cases, in other government facilities.",
      "Most laws are reviewed and upheld under the lowest level of scrutiny, known as rational basis review. Indeed, the federal appeals court in Cincinnati that allowed the Tennessee law to be enforced held that lawmakers acted rationally in adopting the law to address the risks they perceived in gender-affirming care for minors.",
      "But when discrimination is present, judges take a closer look.",
      "Sex discrimination gets heightened scrutiny, which requires states to identify an important objective and show that the law helps accomplish it. Racial discrimination, not at issue here, is reviewed under strict scrutiny \u2014 the highest level \u2014 and laws rarely survive such a demanding examination.",

Barrett has no track record on transgender issues, although she votes with the other conservatives in most of the high-profile cases.",
      "The Supreme Court almost always issues its decisions by early summer, usually before the end of June. The transgender health case could be one of the last cases decided, which is typical of highly contentious issues. One additional potential cause for delay is the Trump administration could weigh in soon after he takes office. It\u2019s not clear how that might affect the case.",
      "Chase Strangio will be the first openly transgender attorney to argue before the nation\u2019s highest court, representing families who say Tennessee\u2019s ban on health care for transgender minors leaves their children terrified about the future.",

      "The court concluded in separate cases involving a gay man and a transgender woman that they were discriminated against because of their sex. Justice Neil Gorsuch, an appointee of Donald Trump\u2019s in his first term in the White House, wrote the 6-3 opinion for the court. Chief Justice John Roberts was the only other conservative member of the court in the majority.",

      "Transgender attorney Chase Strangio will represent families who say Tennessee\u2019s ban leaves them terrified for the future and that access to this kind of care is life-saving.",
      "Tennessee, meanwhile, will argue before the Supreme Court that treatments like puberty blockers and hormones carry risks for young people and its law protects them from making treatment decisions prematurely."

    "story": [
      "Thirteen children under the age of 14 have died at hospitals in central Mexico, and authorities suspect contaminated IV feeding bags",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Thirteen children under the age of 14 have died in central Mexico and authorities said Thursday they suspect contaminated IV feeding bags as the culprit.",
      "The federal Health Department ordered doctors across the country not to use IV nutrition bags made by the company Productos Hospitalarios S.A de C.V., though the exact source of the infections is still under investigation. Phone calls to numbers listed for the company and emails seeking comment went unanswered.",
      "The outbreak appeared to be Klebsiella oxytoca, a multidrug-resistant bacteria. It was first detected in November at three government hospitals and one private one in the State of Mexico, on the outskirts of Mexico City.",
      "The department said the children appeared to have died from a blood infection.",
      "So far, of 20 possible cases, the bacteria was ruled out in one case, suspected in four and confirmed in 15 cases. Of the 19 patients, 13 died and the six others are being treated at hospitals.",
      "Asked about the cluster of cases, President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday that health officials \"told me about a case yesterday, but let's say, it's under control.\u201d",
      "It was the latest public blow to Mexico\u2019s tottering, underfunded health care system. Last week, the director of the country\u2019s flagship national cardiology institute said the hospital didn\u2019t have money to buy essential supplies, calling the situation \u201ccritical.\u201d",
      "Dr. Jorge Gaspar, the hospital's director, wrote an internal letter saying that budget cuts \u201chave affected the acquisition of supplies necessary for the institution's functioning.\u201d In a subsequent public letter the next day, he clarified that the initial message was intended for an \u201cinternal\u201d audience and assured the public that \u201cwe are working to solve the situation.\u201d",
      "Mexico has been plagued by contaminated medical supply scandals for years.",
      "In 2023, authorities arrested an anesthesiologist they blamed for an outbreak of meningitis that killed 35 patients and sickened 79.",
      "The doctor, whose name was withheld, apparently carried his own morphine from one private hospital to another, spreading a fungal infection that contaminated the medication at the first clinic, authorities said.",
      "The drug may not have been stored properly. Some smaller hospitals or maternity clinics in Mexico don\u2019t have their own dispensing pharmacies or are not authorized to handle controlled medications like opiates, and thus long relied on anesthesiologists to bring their own.",
      "In 2020, 14 people died after a hospital run by Mexico\u2019s state-owned oil company gave a drug to dialysis patients that was contaminated with bacteria. More than 69 patients were sickened in that outbreak.",
      "Former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who left office on Sept. 30, complained frequently that drug supply companies were charging too much, and so he essentially revamped the whole medical purchasing system, pledging to provide Mexicans a health care that is \u201cbetter than in Denmark.\u201d",
      "However, the new system of government-run warehouses has foundered, plagued by chronic shortages of supplies and drugs, while a gargantuan government supply depot L\u00f3pez Obrador set up and called the \u201cmega drug store\u201d now sits largely empty.",

      "A study shows blood tests that check for fetal disorders can sometimes hint at cancer in pregnant women",
      "Many moms-to-be opt for blood tests during pregnancy to check for fetal disorders such as Down syndrome. In rare instances, these tests can reveal something unexpected \u2014 hints of a hidden cancer in the woman.",
      "In a study of 107 pregnant women whose test results were unusual, 52 were ultimately diagnosed with cancer. Most of them were treated and are now in remission, although seven with advanced cancers died.",
      "\"They looked like healthy, young women and they reported themselves as being healthy,\u201d said Dr. Diana Bianchi, the senior author of the government study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "Of the discovered cancers, lymphoma blood cancers were the most common, followed by colon and breast cancers.",
      "The blood test is called cell-free DNA sequencing. It looks for fetal problems in DNA fragments shed from the placenta into the mother\u2019s bloodstream. It also can pick up DNA fragments shed by cancer cells.",
      "Of the millions of pregnant women each year who have a cell-free DNA test, 1 in 10,000 will get a result back that is unusual and difficult to interpret, neither positive or negative for a fetal abnormality. This small number of people \u2014 perhaps only 250 a year in the U.S. \u2014 may be at risk for cancer.",
      "\u201cThey and their care providers need to take the results seriously and have additional testing because in that population there is a 48% risk of cancer,\u201d said Bianchi, who leads the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.",
      "The study looked at what should be done next, and the researchers concluded that it's best to do a whole-body MRI to look for cancer. A physical exam or taking a family history is not enough, Bianchi said.",
      "About five years ago, commercial labs that do these tests and doctors started telling women with unusual results about the study. The National Institutes of Health paid for study volunteers to travel to its research hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, where the participants had their family and medical histories reviewed, a complete physical examination, whole-body MRI scans and other tests performed.",
      "The research identified a recognizable \u201cvery chaotic\u201d pattern in the DNA sequencing of the women diagnosed with cancer, Bianchi said. The study is continuing to look for more evidence to indicate who should be screened for cancer.",
      "Many medical groups now recommend offering cell-free DNA tests during pregnancy, though many expectant parents decide against the optional test. Considered reliable for detecting Down syndrome and two other disorders, the tests have come under scrutiny for too many false alarms for extremely rare fetal problems.",
      "The new finding will help educate doctors about a rare result of DNA tests in pregnancy, said Dr. Neeta Vora, director of reproductive genetics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who wrote an editorial in the journal.",
      "Doctors who care for pregnant women are not accustomed to ordering whole-body MRI tests, Vora said, and these scans, which can cost $1,000 to $2,000, may not be covered by health insurance.",

      "In the wake of Leah Seneng's death on Nov. 22, public health officials are warning the public about the dangers of bats, which are the most common source of human rabies in the U.S. Even though fewer than 10 people in the country die from rabies each year, it is almost always fatal if not treated quickly.",
      "Seneng, 60, found a bat in her classroom in mid-October, her friend Laura Splotch told KFSN-TV. She tried to scoop it up and take it outside but it bit her, Splotch said.",
      "Seneng did not immediately have symptoms of rabies but she fell ill weeks later and was taken to the hospital, where she was put into a medically-inducted coma and died days later, Splotch told the TV station.",
      "The Dos Palos-Oro Loma Joint Unified School District, in a statement, called Seneng \u201ca dedicated and compassionate educator.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe were shocked to learn that Leah\u2019s passing was related to contracting rabies, most likely from being bitten by a bat and we are cooperating with the Merced County Department of Public Health on their investigation,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe live and work in a community known to have bats and other wildlife around school grounds, and we will continue to help educate our community regarding the dangers associated with coming into direct contact with any wild animal, including bats.\u201d",
      "Merced County confirmed the rabies exposure but, due to privacy laws, did not release the deceased's name. The California Department of Public Health confirmed that the victim died after contracting rabies."

      "The redeployment away from the provinces of Daraa and Sweida came as Syria\u2019s military sent large numbers of reinforcements to defend the key central city of Homs, Syria\u2019s third largest, as insurgents approached its outskirts.",
      "The rapid advances by insurgents is a stunning reversal of fortunes for Syria's President Bashar Assad, who appears to be largely on his own, with erstwhile allies preoccupied with other conflicts.",
      "His chief international backer, Russia, is busy with its war in Ukraine, and Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah, which at one point sent thousands of fighters to shore up his forces, has been weakened by a yearlong conflict with Israel. Iran, meanwhile, has seen its proxies across the region degraded by Israeli regular airstrikes.",
      "Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Syria war monitor, reported Saturday that Iran\u2019s military advisers have started leaving Syria. He added that Iran-backed fighters in eastern Syria, mainly from Afghanistan and Pakistan, have withdrawn into central Syria.",
      "The shock offensive began Nov. 27 led by the jihadi Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, during which gunmen captured the northern city of Aleppo, Syria\u2019s largest, and the central city of Hama, the country\u2019s fourth largest city. The group has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the United Nations.",
      "HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani told CNN in an exclusive interview Thursday from Syria that the aim of the offensive is to overthrow Assad\u2019s government.",
      "The Britain-based Observatory said Syrian troops have withdrawn from much of the two southern provinces and are sending reinforcements to Homs, where a battle is looming. If the insurgents capture Homs, they would cut the link between Damascus, Assad\u2019s seat of power, and the coastal region where the president enjoys wide support.",
      "The Syrian army said in a statement Saturday that it has carried out redeployment and repositioning in Sweida and Daraa after its checkpoints came under attack by \u201cterrorists.\u201d The army said it is setting up a \u201cstrong and coherent defensive and security belt in the area,\u201d apparently to defend Damascus from the south.",
      "Since Syria\u2019s conflict broke out in March 2011, the Syrian government has been referring to opposition gunmen as terrorists.",
      "In the gas-rich nation of Qatar, the foreign ministers of Iran, Russia and Turkey were scheduled to meet to discuss the situation in Syria. Turkey is a main backer of the rebels seeking to overthrow Assad.",
      "Qatar's top diplomat, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, criticized Assad for failing to take advantage of the lull in fighting in recent years to address the country\u2019s underlying problems. \u201cAssad didn\u2019t seize this opportunity to start engaging and restoring his relationship with his people,\u201d he said.",
      "Sheikh Mohammed said he was surprised by how quickly the rebels have advanced and said there is a real threat to Syria\u2019s \u201cterritorial integrity.\u201d He said the war could \u201cdamage and destroy what is left if there is no sense of urgency\u201d to start a political process.",

      "On Friday, U.S.-backed fighters of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces captured wide parts of the eastern province of Deir el-Zour that borders Iraq as well as the provincial capital that carries the same name. The capture of areas in Deir el-Zour is a blow to Iran\u2019s influence in the region as the area is the gateway to the corridor linking the Mediterranean to Iran, a supply line for Iran-backed fighters, including Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah.",

      "ACCRA, Ghana -- Ghanaians headed to the polls Saturday in presidential and legislative elections poised to be a litmus test for democracy in a region shaken by extremist violence and coups.",
      "Some 18.7 million people are registered to vote in the West African country hit by one of the worst economic crises in a generation. However, the two main candidates offer little hope for change for the nation.",
      "Polls opened at 7 a.m. GMT and will close at 5 p.m. GMT, with early results expected late on Saturday. The first official results will be released by Tuesday.",
      "Ghana used to be a poster child for democracy in the region. At a time when coups threatened democracy in West Africa, Ghana has emerged as a beacon of democratic stability with a history of peaceful elections. It had also been an economic powerhouse, priding itself on its economic development.",
      "But in recent years, it has struggled with a profound economic crisis, including surging inflation and a lack of jobs.",
      "According to an opinion poll released earlier this year by Afrobarometer, a research group, 82% of Ghanaians feel their country is headed in the wrong direction",
      "Although 12 candidates are running to become Ghana\u2019s next president, Saturday\u2019s election \u2014 like previous ones since the return of multiparty politics in 1992 \u2014 has emerged as a two-horse race.",
      "Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia is the candidate of the ruling New Patriotic Party, or NPP, which has struggled to resolve the economic crisis. He faces off against former President John Dramani Mahama, the leader of the main opposition party National Democratic Congress, or NDC. He was voted out in 2016 after failing to deliver on promises for the economy.",
      "Opinion polls point at a potential comeback for Mahama. A local research company, Global InfoAnalytics says he is projected to get 52.2% of the vote, followed by Bawumia, with 41.4%.",
      "The NDC prides itself as a social democratic party, while the ruling NPP tags itself as leaning to the right. But in fact, analysts and voters said, the programs of their presidential candidates do not differ in a significant way.",
      "Two hundred seventy-six members of parliament will also be elected Saturday. The ruling NPP party and the main opposition NDC each have 137 members in the 275-member legislature, with one independent member who has been voting mostly along with the ruling party. One more constituency will be allowed to vote in this election, bringing the number of deputies to 276.",
      "In their final campaign rallies Thursday, both candidates made a last push to pitch their political parties as the answer to Ghana\u2019s economic woes.",
      "Bawumia, 61, an Oxford-educated economist and former deputy governor of the country\u2019s central bank, promised to build on the outgoing administration\u2019s efforts and stabilize the economy.",
      "Mahama, 65, on the other hand, restated his promise to \u201creset\u201d the country on various fronts. \u201cWe need to reset our democracy, governance, economy, finances, agriculture, infrastructure, environment, health sector, and all that we hold dear as a people,\u201d the former president said.",
      "Across the the capital of Accra, the mood for the election has been upbeat in posters and billboards with bikers displaying stunts, political rallies on the streets, election jingles and songs blasting from public speakers.",
      "But the concern for many is also palpable for the key thing at stake: The country\u2019s ailing economy, which has been challenged on various fronts in recent years.",
      "The country defaulted on most of its foreign debt last year as it faced a worsening economic crisis that spiked the price of fuel, food and other essential items. The inflation rate had hit 54% by the end of last year and though it\u2019s been coming down since then, not many Ghanaians can still tell the difference when they go to the market.",
      "Ebenezer Kotey Dsane, a 69-year-old driver said he voted for Mahama because \u201che is a good man\u201d who \u201cset up much infrastructure when he was in office.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe current regime hasn't done much,\u201d he said, pointing to the La General Hospital in Accra, one of the capital's main medical facilities, pulled down in July 2020 by the current government with a pledge to reconstruct it. \u201cUntil today, nothing has happened.\u201d",
      "Some chose not to vote at all. Ruth Mensah, 42, an unemployed resident of Nima, a working-class suburb in Accra, said she decided not to cast a ballot.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see how voting will bring about a change to my life,\u201d she said.",
      "Patricia Seyram Hagbevor, 20, a first-time voter and student at Accra Technical University said she wished for a change. She didn't disclose whom she voted for, but said she \u201choped for a change for the better that will help develop our future.\u201d",
      "The chronic challenge of illegal gold mining \u2014 known locally as galamsey \u2014 has also been a major issue in the campaign and a source of concern for voters, triggering protests and criticism against the outgoing government.",
      "Ghana is Africa\u2019s top gold producer and the world\u2019s sixth largest, but the commodity has been increasingly mined illegally as people become more desperate to find jobs in an economy that has been crumbling. The mining has polluted rivers and other parts of the environment despite government actions to clamp down on the practice."

      "PARIS -- France's iconic Notre Dame Cathedral is formally reopening its doors on Saturday for the first time since a devastating fire nearly destroyed the 861-year-old landmark in 2019.",
      "The restoration, a spectacular achievement in just five years for a structure that took nearly two centuries to build, is seen as a moment of triumph for French President Emmanuel Macron, who championed the ambitious timeline \u2014 and a welcome respite from his domestic political woes.",
      "Under the luminous stained glass, many world leaders, dignitaries, and worshippers will gather in the evening to mark the occasion \u2014 a rare moment of unity against the backdrop of global divisions and conflicts.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, America's first lady Jill Biden and Britain's Prince William, along with dozens of state and government and personalities \u2014 1,500 guests in all \u2014 will attend the reopening celebration under Notre Dame\u2019s soaring Gothic arches, led by Archbishop Laurent Ulrich.",
      "Instead of starting from the cathedral's forecourt as initially planned and because of strong winds forecast for Saturday evening in Paris, the French presidential palace and the Paris diocese said Friday the entire opening ceremony will be held inside Notre Dame.",
      "Notre Dame\u2019s rector, Rev. Olivier Ribadeau Dumas, says the cathedral is \"more than just a French monument\u201d and a beloved treasure of world's cultural heritage.",
      "\u201cThe cathedral is a magnificent symbol of unity,\" the rector said. \"A sign of hope, because what seemed impossible has become possible.\u201d",
      "Saturday\u2019s events will blend solemn religious tradition with cultural grandeur, starting with Ulrich symbolically reopening Notre Dame\u2019s grand wooden doors.",
      "Tapping them three times with a staff crafted from charred wood salvaged from the cathedral\u2019s fire-ravaged roof, he will declare the cathedral open for worship once more.",
      "Psalms, prayers, and hymns will fill the cavernous space as the cathedral\u2019s thunderous organ, silenced since the fire, is reawakened. The 8,000-pipe instrument, painstakingly restored and cleaned of toxic lead dust, will respond to the archbishop\u2019s invocation, with four organists performing an improvised interplay of melodies.",
      "Later in the evening, a star-studded concert will take center stage inside the cathedral and pay tribute to its resurrection and to those who labored to restore it, offering a universal message of harmony. Pianist Lang Lang, cellist Yo-Yo Ma, and soprano Pretty Yende are among the world-famous artists slated to perform.",
      "On Sunday, Ulrich will lead the inaugural Mass and consecrate the cathedral\u2019s new altar, designed by contemporary artist Guillaume Bardet to replace the one crushed beneath the flaming spire in the blaze.",
      "Nearly 170 bishops from France and abroad will attend, alongside priests from all 113 parishes of the Paris diocese.",
      "The reopening of Notre Dame comes at a time of profound global unrest, with wars raging in Ukraine and the Middle East.",
      "For Catholics, Notre Dame's rector said the cathedral \"carries the enveloping presence of the Virgin Mary, a maternal and embracing presence.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is a magnificent symbol of unity, a sign of hope,\u201d Dumas said.",
      "The range of dignitaries coming to Paris from Africa to the Mideast and the U.S. underline the cathedral's significance as a symbol of shared heritage and peace.",
      "The celebration is expected to give a much-needed boost to embattled Macron, whose prime minister resigned this week, plunging the nation\u2019s political scene into more turmoil.",
      "The French president, who has called Notre Dame's reopening \u201ca jolt of hope,\u201d will address the gathering. He had hoped the occasion would briefly silence his critics and showcase France\u2019s unity and resilience under his leadership.",
      "The ambitious five-year restoration timeline, announced just a day after the 2019 fire, had seemed improbable to many.",
      "Macron's presidency faces its gravest crisis after the government's collapse this week in a historic no-confidence vote that toppled Prime Minister Michel Barnier.",
      "The vote followed months of political gridlock after snap elections. Calls are now growing louder from opposition forces for Macron to resign. But he vowed in an address to the nation on Thursday to remain in office until the end of his term in 2027, and said he'll name a new prime minister within days.",
      "As France struggles with economic woes and mounting social unrest, Notre Dame's rebirth celebrations form a stark contrast to the crisis.",
      "Security will be tight all through the weekend, echoing measures taken during the Paris Olympics earlier this year.",
      "The \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 \u2014 the small island in the River Seine that is home to Notre Dame \u2014 will be closed to tourists and non-residents, with access restricted to invitees and those who live on the island.",
      "Public viewing areas along the Seine\u2019s southern bank will accommodate 40,000 spectators, who can follow the celebrations on large screens.",
      "The archbishop's reopening of the cathedral doors will be followed by a liturgical service and the reawakening of the grand organ, ending with the celebratory concert that will honor Notre Dame\u2019s cultural and spiritual significance.",
      "For many, Notre Dame\u2019s rebirth is not just a French achievement but a global one \u2014 after the reopening, the cathedral is set to welcome 15 million visitors annually, up from 12 million before the fire.",
      "Following the 2019 fire, nearly $1 billion in donations quickly poured in from around the world, testifying to Notre Dame's universal appeal.",

      "Pope Francis is installing 21 new cardinals, many of whom are key figures in his reform agenda",
      "ROME -- Pope Francis is installing 21 new cardinals, many of whom are key figures in his reform agenda: A Dominican preacher who acted as the spiritual father for Francis' recent gathering of bishops, a Neapolitan \u201cstreet priest\u201d like himself, and a Peruvian bishop who has strongly backed his crackdown on abuse.",
      "Francis\u2019 10th consistory to create new princes of the church is also the biggest infusion of voting-age cardinals in his 11-year pontificate, further cementing his imprint on the group of men who will one day elect his successor. With Saturday's additions, Francis will have created 110 of the 140 cardinals under 80, thus eligible to vote in a conclave.",
      "This consistory also brings the number of voting-age cardinals well over the 120-man limit set by St. John Paul II. But 13 existing cardinals will turn 80 next year, bringing the numbers back down.",
      "This consistory is notable too because the 21 men being elevated aren\u2019t the same ones Francis named Oct. 6 when he announced an unusual December consistory.",
      "One of Francis\u2019 original picks, Indonesian Bishop Paskalis Bruno Syukur, the bishop of Bogor, asked not to be made a cardinal \u201cbecause of his desire to grow more in his life as a priest,\u201d the Vatican said. Francis quickly substituted him with the Naples archbishop, Domenico Battaglia, known for his pastoral work in the slums and rough parts of Naples.",
      "Battaglia is one of five Italians getting the red hat, keeping the once-dominant Italian presence in the College of Cardinals strong. Turin is getting a cardinal in its archbishop, Roberto Repole, as is Rome: Baldassare Reina, who on the same day Francis announced he was becoming a cardinal also learned that Francis had promoted him to be his top administrator for the diocese of Rome.",
      "Francis, who is technically bishop of Rome, has been conducting a years-long reorganization of the Rome diocese and its pontifical universities. Reina \u2013 who is also grand chancellor of the pre-eminent Pontifical Lateran University \u2013 will be expected to execute the reform.",
      "Another Italian is the oldest cardinal: Angelo Acerbi, a 99-year-old retired Vatican diplomat. He is the only one among the 21 new cardinals to be older than 80 and thus ineligible to vote in a conclave. Francis' picks on Saturday also include the youngest cardinal: the 44-year-old head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in Melbourne, Australia, Mykola Bychok.",
      "Yet another Italian is one of two Vatican priests who do jobs in the Holy See that don\u2019t usually carry the red hat: Fabio Baggio is undersecretary in the Vatican development office. Francis also decided to make a cardinal out of George Jacob Koovakad, the priest who organizes the pope\u2019s foreign travels.",
      "Other picks have high-profile roles in Francis\u2019 reforms.",
      "The archbishop of Lima, Peru, Carlos Gustavo Castillo Mattasoglio, made headlines recently because of an extraordinary essay he penned for El Pais newspaper in which he called for the suppression of an influential Peruvian Catholic movement, the Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, which also has a presence in the U.S.",
      "Castillo called the group a \u201cfailed experiment\u201d of the church in Latin America, one of several conservative, right-wing movements that cropped up in the 1970s and 1980s as a counterweight to the more left-leaning liberation theology.",
      "\u201cMy hypothesis is that the Sodalitium obeys a political project,\u201d Castillo wrote. \u201cIt is the resurrection of fascism in Latin America, artfully using the church by means of sectarian methods.\u201d",
      "Francis has recently expelled the Sodalitium's founder and several top members following a Vatican investigation.",
      "Castillo is one of five new Latin American cardinals named by history\u2019s first Latin American pope. They include the archbishop of Santiago del Estero, Argentina, Vicente Bokalic Iglic; the archbishop of Porto Alegre, Brazil, Jaime Spengler; the archbishop of Santiago, Chile, Fernando Natalio Chomali Garib and the archbishop of Guayaquil, Ecuador, Luis Gerardo Cabrera Herrera.",
      "Francis has long sought to broaden the geographic diversity of the College of Cardinals to show the universality of the church, particularly where it is growing. Asia got two new cardinals: Tarcisio Isao Kikuchi, the archbishop of Tokyo; and Pablo Virgilio Sinogco David, the bishop of Kalookan, Philippines. Africa also got two new cardinals: the archbishop of Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Ignace Bessi Dogbo, and the bishop of Algiers, Algeria, Jean-Paul Vesco.",
      "\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been an African pope, but it\u2019s a possibility in the church,\" Dogbo said in an interview on the eve of his installation. \"And I think that this eventuality \u2014 which is not necessarily a demand \u2014 if this eventuality were to arise, the universal church would have to be ready to take it on.\u201d",
      "Francis also tapped the archbishop of Tehran, Iran, Dominique Joseph Mathieu, the bishop of Belgrade, Serbia, Ladislav Nemet, while the lone North American cardinal named is the archbishop of Toronto, Frank Leo.",
      "The Lithuanian-born cardinal-elect, Rolandas Makrickas, has a special job in this pontificate: As the archpriest of the St. Mary Major basilica, he hosts Francis every time the pope returns from a foreign trip, since the pope likes to pray before an icon of the Madonna in the church. Additionally, Makrickas oversaw a recent financial reform of the basilica and would have been involved in identifying the future final resting place for Francis, since the Argentine pope has said he will be buried there.",
      "Perhaps the most familiar new cardinal to anyone who has been following Francis\u2019 reform agenda is the Dominican Timothy Radcliff, the spiritual father of the just-concluded synod, or gathering of bishops. The years-long process aimed to make the church more inclusive and responsive to the needs of rank-and-file Catholics, especially women.",
      "A British theologian, the white-robed Radcliffe often provided clarifying, if not humorous interventions during the weeks-long debate and retreats. At one point he set off a mini-firestorm by suggesting that external financial pressures influenced African bishops to reject Francis' permission to allow blessings for gay couples. He later said he just meant that the African Catholic Church is under pressure from other well-financed faiths.",
      "As the synod was winding down, he offered some valuable perspective.",
      "\u201cOften we can have no idea as to how God\u2019s providence is at work in our lives. We do what we believe to be right and the rest is in the hands of the Lord,\u201d he told the gathering. \u201cThis is just one synod. There will be others. We do not have to do everything, just try to take the next step.\u201d",

      "Trump wrote when he accepted the invitation earlier this week that French President Emmanuel Macron had done \"a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day for all!\u201d",
      "Since Trump touched down at Paris\u2019 Orly Airport on Saturday morning, more than 20 French government security agents have been helping ensure his safety alongside the Secret Service, according to French national police. A special French police van has also provided anti-drone protection for Trump\u2019s convoy.",
      "Security is tighter than usual outside the U.S. Embassy and other sites around Paris for the grandiose Notre Dame reopening, where dozens of international VIPs are expected.",
      "Macron, who has had an up-and-down relationship with Trump, has made a point of cultivating a relationship with the president-elect since he defeated Vice President Kamala Harris last month. But his office nonetheless played down the significance of the invitation, saying that other politicians who do not currently hold office had been invited as well.",
      "Trump was invited as president-elect of a \u201cfriendly nation,\u201d Macron's office said, adding, \u201cThis is in no way exceptional, we\u2019ve done it before.\"",

      "Trump and the U.S. first lady last encountered one another shortly after the election, when he visited the White House for the traditional meeting between outgoing and incoming presidents.",

      "Macron will convene separately Saturday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. It's not clear whether Trump will meet Zelenskyy, too. Trump has vowed to end the war in Ukraine swiftly but has not specified how, raising concerns in Kyiv about what terms may be laid out for any future negotiations.",
      "In an effort to build trust with the incoming U.S. administration, Zelenskyy\u2019s top aide Andriy Yermak met key members of Trump\u2019s team on a two-day trip earlier this week. A senior Ukrainian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak publicly, described the meetings as productive, but declined to disclose details.",
      "Relations between France and the U.S. during Trump\u2019s first term began warmly enough but grew increasingly strained over time.",
      "Macron was the guest of honor at Trump\u2019s first state dinner, and Trump traveled to France several times. But the relationship suffered after Macron criticized Trump for questioning the need for NATO and raising doubts about America\u2019s commitment to the mutual defense pact.",
      "On the campaign trail this year, Trump often mocked Macron, imitating his accent and threatening to impose steep tariffs on wine and champagne bottles shipped to the U.S. if France tried to tax American companies.",
      "But Macron was one of the first global leaders to congratulate Trump last month after the election.",
      "Trump was president in 2019 when a massive fire engulfed Notre Dame, collapsing its spire and threatening to destroy one of the world\u2019s greatest architectural treasures, known for its mesmerizing stained glass.",

      "The NDC prides itself as a social democratic party, while the ruling NPP tags itself as leaning to the right. But in fact, analysts and voters said, the programs of their presidential candidates do not differ in a significant way.",
      "Two hundred seventy-six members of parliament will also be elected Saturday. The ruling NPP party and the main opposition NDC each have 137 members in the 275 member legislature, with one independent member who has been voting mostly along with the ruling party. One more constituency will be allowed to vote in this election, bringing the number of deputies to 276.",
      "In their final campaign rallies Thursday, both candidates made a last push to pitch their political parties as the answer to Ghana\u2019s economic woes.",
      "Bawumia, 61, an Oxford-educated economist and former deputy governor of the country\u2019s central bank, promised to build on the outgoing administration\u2019s efforts and stabilize the economy.",
      "Mahama, 65, on the other hand, restated his promise to \u201creset\u201d the country on various fronts. \u201cWe need to reset our democracy, governance, economy, finances, agriculture, infrastructure, environment, health sector, and all that we hold dear as a people,\u201d the former president said.",
      "Across the the capital of Accra, the mood for the election has been upbeat in posters and billboards with bikers displaying stunts, political rallies on the streets, election jingles and songs blasting from public speakers.",
      "But the concern for many is also palpable for the key thing at stake: The country\u2019s ailing economy, which has been challenged on various fronts in recent years.",
      "The country defaulted on most of its foreign debt last year as it faced a worsening economic crisis that spiked the price of fuel, food and other essential items. The inflation rate had hit 54% by the end of last year and though it\u2019s been coming down since then, not many Ghanaians can still tell the difference when they go to the market.",
      "The chronic challenge of illegal gold mining \u2014 known locally as galamsey \u2014 has also been a major issue in the campaign and a source of concern for voters, triggering protests and criticism against the outgoing government.",
      "Ghana is Africa\u2019s top gold producer and the world\u2019s sixth largest, but the commodity has been increasingly mined illegally as people become more desperate to find jobs in an economy that has been crumbling. The mining has polluted rivers and other parts of the environment despite government actions to clamp down on the practice."

    "published": "Sat, 07 Dec 2024 06:50:17 -0500",
    "summary": "The last time Syrian President Bashar Assad was in serious trouble was 10 years ago",
    "story": [
      "The last time Syrian President Bashar Assad was in serious trouble was 10 years ago",
      "BEIRUT -- The last time Syrian President Bashar Assad was in serious trouble was 10 years ago, at the height of the country\u2019s civil war, when his forces lost control over parts of the largest city, Aleppo, and his opponents were closing in on the capital, Damascus.",
      "Back then, he was rescued by his chief international backer, Russia, and longtime regional ally Iran, which along with Lebanon\u2019s powerful Hezbollah militia helped Assad's forces retake Aleppo, tipping the war firmly in his favor.",
      "Now, as insurgents pursue a shock offensive that quickly captured not just Aleppo, but the key city of Hama and a string of other towns across the country\u2019s northwest, the Syrian leader appears to be largely on his own.",
      "Russia is preoccupied with its war in Ukraine, and Hezbollah, which at one point sent thousands of its fighters to shore up Assad\u2019s forces, has been weakened by a yearlong conflict with Israel. Iran, meanwhile, has seen its proxies across the region degraded by Israeli airstrikes.",
      "Moreover, Syrian troops are exhausted and hollowed out by 13 years of war and economic crises, with little will left to fight.",
      "So will Assad's rule collapse in the near future?",
      "\u201cThe coming days and weeks will be critical in determining whether the rebel offensive poses an existential threat to the Assad regime or whether the regime manages to regain its footing and push back on recent rebel gains,\u201d said Mona Yacoubian, an analyst with the United States Institute for Peace.",
      "\u201cWhile weakened and distracted, Assad\u2019s allies are unlikely to simply cave to the rebels\u2019 offensive,\u201d she wrote in an analysis.",
      "Until recently, it seemed that Syria\u2019s president was almost out of the woods. He never really won the long-running civil war, and large parts of the country were still outside his control.",
      "But after 13 years of conflict, it appeared that the worst was over and that the world was ready to forget. Once viewed as a regional pariah, Assad saw Arab countries warming up to him again, renewing ties and reinstating Syria\u2019s membership in the Arab League. Earlier this year, Italy also decided to reopen its embassy in Damascus after a decade of strained relations.",
      "In the aftermath of one of the world's largest humanitarian crises, aid groups and international donors in Syria began pivoting toward spending more on the country's recovery than on emergency assistance, providing a lifeline for Syrians and restoring basic services.",
      "But then the sudden offensive launched by insurgents on Nov. 27 reignited the war and caught everyone off guard with its scope and speed.",
      "It also left Syria\u2019s neighbors anxious, wary that violence and refugees could spill across borders and worried about the growing influence of Islamist groups, a major concern for most of Syria\u2019s Arab neighbors.",
      "Analysts say a confluence of geopolitical developments beginning with Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, followed by the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza that started on Oct. 7, 2023, helped create the opportunity for Assad\u2019s opponents to pounce.",
      "As the rebels advanced this past week, Syrian forces appeared to melt away, putting up no resistance, with several reports of defection. Russian forces carried out occasional airstrikes. Hezbollah\u2019s leader in Lebanon said the group will continue to support Syria, but made no mention of sending fighters again.",
      "\u201cThe rebel assault underscores the precarious nature of regime control in Syria,\u201d Yacoubian wrote.",
      "\u201cIts sudden eruption and the speed with which rebel groups managed to overtake Aleppo ... expose the complex dynamics that reside just below the surface in Syria and can transform superficial calm into major conflict.\u201d",
      "Aron Lund, a Syria expert with Century International, a New York-based think tank and a researcher with the Swedish Defense Research Agency, said the developments in Syria are a geopolitical disaster for Russia and Iran.",
      "\u201cThey too were surely surprised by what happened, and they have all sorts of resource constraints,\" including Russia's war in Ukraine and Hezbollah's losses in Lebanon and Syria.",
      "While the country\u2019s conflict lines have been largely stalemated since 2020, Syria\u2019s economic woes have only multiplied in the past few years.",
      "The imposition of U.S. sanctions, a banking crisis in neighboring Lebanon and an earthquake last year contributed to the fact that almost all Syrians face extreme financial hardship.",
      "That has caused state institutions and salaries to wither.",
      "\u201cIf you can\u2019t pay your soldiers a living wage, then maybe you can\u2019t expect them to stay and fight when thousands of Islamists storm\u201d their cities, Lund said. \u201cIt is just an exhausted, broken and dysfunctional regime\u201d to start with.",
      "Part of the insurgents\u2019 attempt to reassert their grip on Aleppo, the city where they were ousted in 2016 after a grueling military campaign, was to issue a call to government soldiers and security agencies to defect, granting them what they called \u201cprotection cards,\u201d which offer some sort of amnesty and assurances that they won\u2019t be hunted down.",
      "The spokesman for the insurgents, Hassan Abdul-Ghani, said more than 1,600 soldiers have applied for the cards over two days in Aleppo city.",
      "Hundreds of defectors lined up outside city police stations Thursday to register their details with the insurgents.",
      "Hossam al-Bakr, 33, originally from Hama who served in Damascus and defected four years earlier to Aleppo, said he came to \u201csettle his position\u201d and get a new ID.",
      "The laminated card handed out to each defector was titled the \u201cdefection card.\u201d It showed the name, ID number and place of service of each defector. It is issued by \u201cThe General Command: Military Operations Room.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, Maj. Mohamed Ghoneim, who was in charge of registering the defectors, said more than 1,000 soldiers or police officers came to register. Some who were in possession of their official guns handed them over, he added.",
      "\u201cThere are thousands who want to apply,\u201d he said.",
      "Charles Lister, a longtime Syria expert, said while most of the international community has written off the conflict as either frozen or finished, the armed opposition has never given up and has been training for such a scenario for years.",
      "A ragtag group of militias, plagued by infighting and rivalry, spent years preparing and organizing, propelled by a dream to regain control of territory from Assad.",
      "\u201cThe regime has been more vulnerable over the last year or two than it has perhaps been throughout the entirety of the conflict,\" Lister said. \"And it has gotten used to the idea that if it can wait things out, it will ultimately prove to be the victor.\u201d",

      "The Hospital de Jesus in Mexico City\u2019s bustling historic center covers most of a city block",
      "MEXICO CITY -- In Mexico City\u2019s bustling historic center, the Hospital de Jesus covers most of a city block. Its faded unassuming yellow facade, characteristic of the middle of the last century, obscures the medical center within founded 500 years ago by Spanish conqueror Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s.",
      "Entering between street-level shoe stores, visitors find the oldest continuously operating hospital in the Americas. Stone arches lead to expansive patios filled with lush vegetation.",
      "The hospital was founded to treat the conquering Spanish, then later opened to the local Indigenous inhabitants to ensure a healthy workforce. Today it provides 24/7 emergency care, as well as affordable access to medical specialists for current residents of what was at the time of its founding the center of the Aztec empire.",
      "\u201cYou can feel the Mexican heritage here,\u201d said Dr. Pedro \u00c1lvarez S\u00e1nchez. \u201cFor 500 years, the hospital has never closed its doors.\u201d",
      "On Nov. 8, 1519, Cort\u00e9s and his soldiers entered Tenochtitlan, the Aztec name for the capital, and met Aztec emperor Moctezuma in a place known as Huitzilan, just in front of the present-day hospital.",
      "Cort\u00e9s had conquered the city by 1521, and to honor that original encounter, he founded the hospital in 1524.",
      "The meeting of Cort\u00e9s and Moctezuma is depicted in a floor-to-ceiling tile mural beside one of the central patios. The main temple of Tenochtitlan \u2014 only a few blocks from the hospital \u2014 sits in the background. The union of two suns represents the meeting of two cultures.",
      "Cort\u00e9s is buried in a small church adjacent to the hospital. Descendants of him and Moctezuma met here in 2019 to mark the anniversary of that initial encounter.",
      "Around the world, only a handful of hospitals can boast such longevity. For example, St. Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital in London founded in 1123 and Bellevue Hospital in New York City founded in 1736 also continue to provide full medical services.",
      "Much of the hospital has remained intact thanks to a board of trustees founded in the 16th century. Over the years, countless doctors have quietly worked to conserve the hospital\u2019s mission of affordable care and to preserve the building\u2019s unique architectural features.",
      "\u201cWe want to ensure that this hospital continues to provide quality medical attention to patients,\u201d said Dr. Octaviano Rosalez Seraf\u00edn, 71, president of the hospital\u2019s board of trustees. \u201cWe want to continue the tradition of care the hospital has had for years.\u201d",
      "Celia Ch\u00e1vez Escamilla, 56, arrived at the hospital at dawn recently for an appointment with her dermatologist. \u201cHere they take good care of us,\u201d said Ch\u00e1vez. \u201cThe prices here are accessible. If you go somewhere else it\u2019s too expensive.\u201d Her consultation was just 400 pesos or under $20.",
      "Escamilla was accompanied by her daughter Myriam Rafael Sanchez, 26, who was fascinated by the medical center. \u201cI\u2019ve seen (the hospital) a lot in movies and TV shows,\u201d she said excitedly. \u201cWe have all of Mexico\u2019s history around us.\u201d",
      "The hospital didn\u2019t always serve the entire public, according to Sandra Elena Guevara Flores, an anthropologist focusing on medicine at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.",
      "Guevara said the hospital was not open to the Indigenous population initially, but only to the Spanish who had recently arrived in the Americas.",
      "However, as epidemics began to spread, the hospital opened its doors to more patients. \u201cIt was a strategy by the Spanish governors in the new Spain to treat the whole population,\u201d said Guevara. \u201cIt (was) so the servants and the whole labor system wouldn\u2019t die.\u201d",
      "Early Spanish doctors at the hospital often used native Mexican herbs to cure their patients. \u201cIt\u2019s said that traditional Galenic Hippocratic medicine was used in the hospital, but really it was Indigenous medicine,\u201d said Guevara. \u201cThey (Indigenous peoples) would share their knowledge.\u201d",
      "The Spanish imprint can be seen in the hospital\u2019s architecture, said Hugo Antonio Arciniega \u00c1vila, a historian and archaeological expert from the National Autonomous University of Mexico.",
      "The hospital, like some other colonial structures in Mexico City, is \u2018encapsulated\u2019 inside a newer building from the 1950s.",
      "Because the Spanish built low stone structures on huge lots with massive stone walls, people who wanted to build newer facilities a century or two later would often just build over, around or among the colonial-era structures. Sometimes they would incorporate the old masonry walls into the new building, either for preservation reasons or because it was cheaper to use them than to tear them down. So from the street, there is often no sign that behind a Victorian or functionalist facade, there is a partially preserved Spanish structure within.",
      "The hospital was built in the form of a T, with two large patios and a grand staircase devised by Spanish architect Claudio de Arciniega in the 16th century. The design provided constant ventilation and sunshine to patients. The architect also included a chapel on each of the two original floors.",
      "\u201cThe architecture of this hospital is fascinating,\u201d said Arciniega about the intentional layout of religious spaces and access to open air. \u201cIf you cure the soul, you can cure the body \u2013 it\u2019s the same way the doctors thought.\u201d",
      "For the 67-year-old \u00c1lvarez, who has worked at the hospital for nearly 50 years and also serves as the board of trustees\u2019 treasurer, the center has been a constant in his life. He began working at the hospital as a lab assistant at age 18.",
      "\u201cA lot of people ask me, why do you keep working at the Hospital de Jesus?\u201d he said. \u201cI tell them because I love it.\u201d",

    "published": "Sat, 07 Dec 2024 07:22:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Most ruling party lawmakers are boycotting a parliamentary vote sought by the opposition to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived imposition of martial law",
    "story": [
      "Most ruling party lawmakers are boycotting a parliamentary vote sought by the opposition to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived imposition of martial law",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Most ruling party lawmakers were boycotting a parliamentary vote Saturday to deny a two-thirds majority sought by the opposition to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived imposition of martial law, as protests grew nationwide calling for his removal.",
      "The likely defeat of the motion is expected to intensify public protests calling for Yoon\u2019s ouster and deepen political chaos in South Korea, with a survey suggesting a majority of South Koreans support the president\u2019s impeachment. Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration drew criticism from his own ruling conservative party, but it is also determined to oppose Yoon\u2019s impeachment apparently because it fears losing presidency to liberals.",
      "Impeaching Yoon would require support from two-thirds of the National Assembly, or 200 of its 300 members. The opposition parties who brought the impeachment motion have 192 seats, meaning they need at least eight additional votes from Yoon\u2019s People Power Party.",
      "The opposition-controlled parliament began a vote earlier Saturday, but only three lawmakers from PPP took part with opposition members. If the number of lawmakers who cast ballots doesn\u2019t reach 200, the motion will be scrapped at midnight without the ballot counting, according to the National Assembly. Opposition parties could submit a new impeachment motion after a new parliamentary session opens next Wednesday.",
      "There are worries that Yoon won\u2019t be able to serve out his remaining 2 \u00bd years in office because his leadership took a huge hit. Many experts say some ruling party lawmakers could eventually join opposition parties\u2019 efforts to impeach Yoon if public demands for it grow further.",
      "If Yoon is impeached, his powers will be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to remove him from office. If he is removed, an election to replace him must take place within 60 days.",
      "National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik urged ruling party members to return to the chamber to participate in the vote, stressing that it was closely watched by the nation and also the world.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t make a shameful judgment and please vote based on your convictions,\u201d Woo said.",
      "Democratic Party leaders visited a hall on the floor below the main chamber where PPP lawmakers were gathered, attempting to persuade them to vote. After being blocked from entering, they angrily accused the conservatives' leadership of preventing its lawmakers from voting freely.",
      "Earlier Saturday, Yoon issued a public apology over the martial law decree, saying he won\u2019t shirk legal or political responsibility for the declaration and promising not to make another attempt to impose martial law. He said would leave it to his party to chart a course through the country\u2019s political turmoil, \u201cincluding matters related to my term in office.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe declaration of this martial law was made out of my desperation. But in the course of its implementation, it caused anxiety and inconveniences to the public. I feel very sorry over that and truly apologize to the people who must have been shocked a lot,\u201d Yoon said.",
      "Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has struggled to push his agenda through an opposition-controlled parliament and grappled with low approval ratings amid scandals involving himself and his wife. In his martial law announcement on Tuesday night, Yoon called parliament a \u201cden of criminals\u201d bogging down state affairs and vowed to eliminate \u201cshameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces.\u201d",
      "The turmoil resulting from Yoon\u2019s bizarre and poorly-thought-out stunt has paralyzed South Korean politics and sparked alarm among key diplomatic partners like the U.S. and Japan.",
      "Tuesday night saw special forces troops encircling the parliament building and army helicopters hovering over it, but the military withdrew after the National Assembly unanimously voted to overturn the decree, forcing Yoon to lift it before daybreak Wednesday. The declaration of martial law was the first of its kind in more than 40 years in South Korea. Eighteen lawmakers from the ruling party voted to reject Yoon\u2019s martial law decree along with opposition lawmakers.",
      "Yoon\u2019s speech fueled speculation that he and his party may push for a constitutional amendment to shorten his term, instead of accepting impeachment, as a way to ease public anger over the marital law and facilitate Yoon\u2019s early exit from office.",
      "Lee Jae-myung, the leader of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, told reporters that Yoon\u2019s speech was \u201cgreatly disappointing\u201d and that the only way forward is his immediate resignation or impeachment. His party called Yoon\u2019s martial law \u201cunconstitutional, illegal rebellion or coup.\u201d",
      "The passage of Yoon\u2019s impeachment motion appeared more likely Friday when the chair of Yoon\u2019s party called for his removal on Friday, but the party remained formally opposed to impeachment.",
      "On Saturday, tens of thousands of people densely packed several blocks of roads leading up to the National Assembly, waving banners, shouting slogans and dancing and singing along to K-pop songs with lyrics changed to call for Yoon\u2019s ouster. Protesters also gathered in front of PPP\u2019s headquarters near the Assembly, angrily shouting for its lawmakers to vote to impeach Yoon.",
      "A smaller crowd of Yoon\u2019s supporters, which still seemed to be in the thousands, rallied in separate streets in Seoul, decrying the impeachment attempt they saw as unconstitutional.",
      "Lawmakers on Saturday first voted on a bill appointing a special prosecutor to investigate stock price manipulation allegations surrounding Yoon\u2019s wife. Some lawmakers from Yoon\u2019s party were seen leaving the hall after that vote, triggering angry shouts from opposition lawmakers.",
      "On Friday, PPP chair Han Dong-hun, who criticized Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration, said he had received intelligence that during the brief period of martial law Yoon ordered the country\u2019s defense counterintelligence commander to arrest and detain unspecified key politicians based on accusations of \u201canti-state activities.\u201d",
      "Hong Jang-won, first deputy director of South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service, told lawmakers in a closed-door briefing Friday that Yoon had ordered him to help the defense counterintelligence unit to detain key politicians. The targeted politicians included Han, Lee and Woo, according to Kim Byung-kee, one of the lawmakers who attended the meeting.",
      "The Defense Ministry said Friday it suspended three military commanders including the head of the defense counterintelligence unit over their involvement in enforcing martial law.",
      "Vice Defense Minister Kim Seon Ho has told parliament that Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun ordered the deployment of troops to the National Assembly after Yoon imposed martial law. Opposition parties accused Kim of recommending to Yoon to enforce martial law.",
      "Kim resigned Thursday, and prosecutors imposed an overseas travel ban on him."

      "A closely-watched international climate case that could yield guidance for governments around the world wrapped its first week of arguments before the top court of the United Nations in The Hague Friday",
      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A closely-watched international climate case that could yield guidance for governments around the world wrapped its first week of arguments before the top court of the United Nations in The Hague Friday. The case, though not binding, is expected to spell out what countries are legally required to do to combat climate change and help vulnerable nations fight its devastating impact.",
      "The push for the International Court of Justice to hear this case comes \u2014 like much of the call to address climate change \u2014 from island nations who are losing territory and fear they could disappear under rising seas. The U.N. General Assembly asked the court last year for an opinion on \u201cthe obligations of States in respect of climate change.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe stakes could not be higher. The survival of my people and so many others is on the line,\u201d Arnold Kiel Loughman, attorney general of the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, told The Hague-based court.",
      "For years his country has spearheaded calls for reductions of the greenhouse gases that are causing sea ice to melt and oceans to expand, making the seas rise. Vanuatu led this push for international legal intervention as well.",
      "Fifteen judges from around the world must now answer two questions: What are countries obliged to do under international law to protect the climate and environment from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions? And what are the legal consequences for governments when their acts, or lack of action, have significantly harmed the climate and environment?",
      "With 99 participating countries, it is the largest case in the court\u2019s history.",
      "Countries including Vanuatu, Chile and the Philippines want countries like the United States, China and Russia to reduce their emissions and provide financial help to alleviate the devastating impact of climate change that they feel endangers their very existence.",
      "\u201cThis is a crisis of survival. It is also a crisis of equity. Fiji contributes 0.004 percent of global emissions but our people bear the brunt of climate impacts. In climate-vulnerable nations, marginalized groups \u23af women, children and the poor \u23af are disproportionately affected,\u201d Luke Daunivalu, Fiji\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, said.",
      "The South Pacific island nation spoke directly after the United States and Russia, both of whom are major petroleum-producing states and staunchly opposed to the court mandating emissions reductions.",
      "Instead, what the United States and other major greenhouse gas emitters want the court to do is defer to the landmark Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to keep global warming to a 1.5 degree C (2.7 F) limit.",
      "The world has already warmed 1.3 degrees C (2.3 F) since pre-industrial times because of the burning of fossil fuels. Between 1990 and 2020, sea levels rose by a global average of 10 centimeters (3.9 inches) and parts of the South Pacific have seen significantly more.",
      "\u201cStates designed this international legal framework to address the uniquely complex collective action problem posed by anthropogenic global warming, and it embodies the clearest, most specific and the most current expression of states\u2019 consent to be bound by international law in respect of climate change,\u201d Margaret Taylor said on behalf of the United States, referring to the Paris Agreement.",
      "The U.S. also pushed back on an idea proposed by several countries that developed countries have a great obligation to reduce emissions and pay reparations because they have been contributing to the problem for a much longer time. \u201cA state cannot have international responsibility for acts that take place prior to the date on which its international legal obligation came into existence,\u201d Taylor said.",
      "What small states like Vanuatu are hoping for does push the norms of international law. Historically, all countries are held to the same standard. Every country that is a party to the 1948 Genocide Convention, for example, has the exact same obligation to \u201cpunish and prevent\u201d genocide.",
      "\u201cWhat I have heard is a concerted effort by major polluters seeking to avoid their responsibilities,\u201d Joie Chowdhury, senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law, told The Associated Press. She said the conduct of major polluters responsible for the climate crisis and its catastrophic consequences is unlawful under multiple international laws.",
      "Alongside the hearings, environmental groups held a series of events to promote climate justice. On Sunday, ahead of the hearing, Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change \u2014 who first developed the idea of requesting an advisory opinion \u2014 together with World Youth for Climate Justice held an afternoon of speeches, music and discussions.",
      "Kjelld Kroon, a climate activist who is involved in a lawsuit against the Dutch state for failing to protect his Caribbean island homeland of Bonaire, watched several days of the proceedings and said he wasn\u2019t surprised that rich countries were opposed to more legal obligations. \u201cThis is how a lot of powerful countries in the Global North extract from the Global South,\u201d he told the AP.",
      "But Kroon said he found the presentations by many developing states powerful and said they gave him hope.",
      "Any decision by the court would be unable to directly force wealthy nations into action to help struggling countries. Yet it would be more than just a symbol since it could serve as the basis for other legal actions, including domestic lawsuits.",
      "\u201cIf I look at history, I am skeptical,\u201d Kroon said. \u201cBut if I look towards the future, I am a little bit positive.\u201d"

      "Eighty years ago, the December Uprising of 1944, known as the Dekemvrian\u00e1, turned Athens into a battlefield as British-backed forces clashed with communist-led resistance fighters in the waning days of World War II",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- Across the street from the Temple of Olympian Zeus, the ancient monument in central Athens, historian Menelaos Haralabidis pauses in front of a drab apartment building.",
      "The building's facade, freshly painted a mustard color, is riddled with bullet holes made by heavy machine gun fire. The marks have been stubbornly preserved for 80 years.",
      "In December of 1944, as the final stages of World War II unfolded, Athens, newly liberated from Nazi occupation, was again ravaged by fighting. Allies turned on each other as Europe\u2019s boundaries were already being redrawn by the war\u2019s ultimate winners.",
      "British troops and the new Greek government battled communist-led WW II resistance fighters in a bloody five-week confrontation that raged across the city.",
      "\u201cAthens was turned into a battlefield for 33 days, with major destruction, mostly in the surrounding districts, and thousands of victims,\u201d Haralabidis said. \u201cThere were regular operations from all parts of the military: land army, artillery, air force, even British ships bombarding parts of Athens.\"",
      "During the battle, Winston Churchill visited Athens at Christmas before British forces prevailed. The Dekemvrian\u00e1, as the December battle is known in Greece, extended a lasting legacy of violent political division and a reluctance to confront the past.",
      "Haralabidis, a 54-year-old historian and author, has organized tours of the urban battle sites and the little that remains to commemorate them: Pockmarked walls and chipped surfaces that still exist on a handful of buildings around the Greek capital.",
      "\u201cGreek society must reckon with its history. To heal its wounds, we need to discuss them openly, understand what happened, and come to terms with the past,\u201d he said.",
      "Kaisariani, a once impoverished hillside district of Athens, earned the wartime nickname of \u201cLittle Stalingrad\u201d for its concentration of resistance fighters, and witnessed some of the most ferocious fighting in December 1944.",
      "Giorgos Kontostavlos, the district\u2019s former mayor, grew up there on stories of the battles: Rebel fighters throwing up barricades with debris from artillery shelling, low-flying British bombers and intense exchanges of machine-gun and mortar fire, one blowing a hole in the roof of his grandfather\u2019s home.",
      "On a narrow side street in Kaisariani, a row of apartment blocks still display the damage from 1944 and fading slogans of defiance written by the rebels in red paint. Kontostavlos supports a local campaign to give protected status as a wartime monument.",
      "\u201cThe monument should live on, not as a symbol of war or death, but as a monument to peace,\u201d he said. \u201cOver 20% of the district\u2019s homes were destroyed. The neighborhood faced immense pressure, and the residents found themselves in a very dire situation \u2026 These were, essentially, the first battles of the Cold War.\u201d",
      "The December uprising was triggered by a failure to reach an agreement with resistance groups to disarm and about what a post-war government would look like. It cost an estimated 5,000 lives and eventually triggered the longer and bloodier Greek Civil War in 1946-49.",
      "A debate over the Athens battle\u2019s legacy remains fraught in part due to the involvement of armed groups of Nazi collaborators. Seeking to reinvent their roles and evade fatal retribution, they zealously fought communist-backed rebels and opposed reconciliation efforts.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s still no agreement, even among professional historians,\u201d Roderick Beaton, a professor of Greek history at King\u2019s College in London, told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cSome still hold to the narrative put about by the winning side afterward, that the communists had been intent on seizing power,\u201d he said. For others it \u201cshowed the Greek people reclaiming their own self-determination in the face of former collaborators with the Nazis and the British who had replaced them as an occupying power.\u201d",
      "For Beaton, author of the book \u201cGreece: Biography of a Modern Nation,\u201d the battle was less about Cold War tensions than the catastrophic effects of wartime occupation.",
      "\u201cSo far as I can see, the tragic events \u2026 in Athens were an accident waiting to happen. There was no plan for an armed uprising by the left, but neither was there a right-wing or British plan to crush the former resistance,\u201d he said.",
      "In Greece, there are no official monuments or museum exhibits dedicated to the December battle or the civil war \u2014 conflicts that were officially forgotten.",
      "Emergency measures from that time were only fully abolished in 1989.",
      "That year, a bronze statue was unveiled in central Athens square of three towering human-like figures standing at 8 meters (26 feet) tall, intertwined in a harmonious embrace.",
      "It\u2019s named, simply, the Statue of National Reconciliation.",

      "BANGKOK -- China has banned exports of key materials used to make a wide range of products, including smartphones, electric vehicles, radar systems and CT scanners, swiping back at Washington after it expanded export controls to include dozens of Chinese companies that make equipment used to produce advanced computer chips.",
      "Both sides say their controls are justified by national security concerns and both accuse the other of \u201cweaponizing\u201d trade. Analysts say the latest restrictions could have a wide impact on manufacturing in many industries and supply chains.",
      "\u201cCritical mineral security is now intrinsically linked to the escalating tech trade war,\u201d Gracelin Baskaran and Meredith Schwartz of the Center for Strategic International Studies, wrote in a report on Beijing's decision.",
      "The full impact will depend partly on whether U.S. industries can compensate for any loss of access to the strategically important materials, equipment and components.",
      "Here\u2019s why this could be a tipping point in trade conflict between the two biggest economies, coming at a time when antagonisms already were expected to heat up once President-elect Donald Trump takes office, given his vows to hike tariffs on imports of Chinese-made products.",
      "China has banned, in principle, exports to the United States of gallium, germanium and antimony \u2014 critical minerals needed to make advanced semiconductors, among many other types of equipment. Beijing also tightened controls on exports of graphite, which is used in EV and grid-storage batteries. China is the largest source for most of these materials and also dominates refining of those materials, which are used both for consumer goods and for military purposes.",
      "The limits announced Tuesday also include exports of super-hard materials, such as diamonds and other synthetic materials that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective coatings.",
      "Next on the list of potential bans, experts say: tungsten, magnesium and aluminum alloys.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced its measures after the U.S. government ordered a slew of new measures meant to prevent sales to China of certain types of advanced semiconductors and the tools and software needed to make them. Washington also expanded its \u201centity list\u201d of companies facing strict export controls to include 140 more companies, nearly all of them based in China or Chinese-owned.",
      "Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the revised rules were intended to impair China\u2019s ability to use advanced technologies that \u201cpose a risk to our national security.\u201d The updated regulations also limit exports to China of high-bandwidth memory chips that are needed to process massive amounts of data in advanced applications such as artificial intelligence.",
      "Export licenses will likely be denied for any U.S. company trying to do business with the 140 companies newly added to the \u201centity list,\u201d as well as the dozens of others already on the list. The aim, officials said, is to stop Chinese companies from leveraging U.S. technology to make their own semiconductors.",
      "The Biden administration has been expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls while encouraging an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of semiconductors in the U.S. and other Western countries.",
      "Washington also extended the restrictions on exports of advanced semiconductor technology to companies in other countries, though it excluded companies in key allies like Japan, South Korea and the Netherlands that are thought to have adequate export controls of their own.",
      "In a word: very. For the U.S., Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and other producers of advanced technology and components, access to materials with such properties as high conductivity is crucial: gallium and germanium increasingly are used in advanced semiconductors in place of silicon.",
      "The materials subject to Chinese export controls are among 50 the United States Geologic Survey has designated as \u201ccritical minerals\u201d \u2014 non-fuel minerals essential to U.S. economic or national security that have supply chains vulnerable to disruption.",
      "Gallium topped that list. It is needed to make the same high-bandwidth memory chips the U.S. wants to avoid allowing China to access for use in artificial intelligence and defense applications. It's used to make LEDs, lasers and magnets used in many products. Germanium is used for optical fiber and solar panels, among other uses.",
      "A USGS study recently estimated the likely total cost to the U.S. economy from disruptions to supplies of gallium and germanium alone at more than $3 billion. But the situation is complicated. China imposed licensing requirements on exports of both metals in July 2023. It has not exported either to the U.S. this year, according to Chinese customs data. Antimony exports also have plunged.",
      "China produces the lion's share of most critical minerals, but there are alternatives. Japan also imports nearly all of its gallium, for example, but it also extracts it by recycling scrap metal.",
      "Washington has been moving to tap sources other than China, forming a \"Minerals Security Partnership\" with the EU and 15 other countries. President Joe Biden's visit to Africa this week highlighted that effort. Potential supply disruptions also have spurred efforts to tap U.S. deposits of rare earths and other critical materials in southeastern Wyoming, Montana, Nevada, Minnesota and parts of the American Southwest.",

      "The fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare's CEO has opened the door for many people to vent their frustrations and anger over the insurance industry",
      "For years, patients in the U.S. health care system have grown frustrated with a bureaucracy they don\u2019t understand.",
      "Doctors are included in an insurer\u2019s network one year but not the next. Getting someone on the phone to help can be next to impossible. Coverage of care and prescriptions is often unceremoniously denied.",
      "This week\u2019s fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has unleashed a wave of public feeling \u2014 exasperation, anger, resentment, helplessness \u2014 from Americans sharing personal stories of interactions with insurance companies, often seen as faceless corporate giants.",
      "In particular, the words written on ammunition found at the shooting scene \u2014 \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose,\u201d echoing a phrase used to describe how insurers dodge claim payouts \u2014 amplified voices that have long been critical of the industry.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden, I am fired up again,\u201d said Tim Anderson, describing how his wife, Mary, had to deal with UnitedHealthcare coverage denials before she died from Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in 2022.",
      "Anderson said they couldn\u2019t get coverage for machines to help his wife breathe or talk \u2014 toward the end, she communicated by blinking when he showed her pictures. The family had to rely on donations from a local ALS group, he said.",
      "\u201cThe business model for insurance is don\u2019t pay,\u201d said Anderson, 67, of Centerville, Ohio.",
      "\u201cWhen Mary could still talk, she said to me to keep fighting this,\u201d he added. \u201cIt needs to be exposed.\u201d",
      "For Anderson and others, Thompson's death and the message left at the scene have created an opportunity to vent their frustrations. Conversations at dinner tables, office water coolers, social gatherings and on social media have pivoted to the topic, as police efforts to find the gunman keep the case in the news.",
      "Hans Maristela said he understands why the chatter is bubbling up. The 54-year-old caregiver in California was moved to comment on Facebook about UnitedHealthcare's reputation of denying coverage. As a Catholic, he said, he grieves Thompson's death and feels for his family, especially with the holidays around the corner.",

      "\u201cPeople are often struggling with this by themselves, and when you see someone else talk about it, that may prompt you to join the conversation,\u201d she said.",
      "Kyle studies how patients access care and said she's seen frustration with the system build for years. Costs are rising, and insurers are using more controls such as prior authorizations and doctor networks to manage them. Patients are often stuck in the middle of disputes between doctors and insurers.",
      "\u201cPatients are already spending a lot of money on health care, and then they\u2019re still facing problems with the service,\u201d she said.",
      "Insurers often note that most of the money they bring in goes back out the door to pay claims, and that they try to corral soaring costs and the overuse of some care.",
      "In Ohio, Anderson said his initial reaction to the CEO shooting was to question whether it was connected to a coverage denial, like the ones he'd experienced with his wife.",
      "\u201cI definitely do not condone killing people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I read it and said, 'I wonder if somebody had a spouse whose coverage was denied.\u2019\u201d",
      "It's something Will Flanary, a Portland-based ophthalmologist and comedian with a large social media following, saw online a lot in the shooting's immediate aftermath and found very telling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s zero sympathy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the lesson to take away from that is not, \u2018Let\u2019s shame people for celebrating a murder.\u2019 No, it\u2019s: \u2018Look at the amount of anger that people have toward this system that\u2019s taken advantage of people and do something to try to fix that.\u2019\u201d",
      "Flanary's content, published under the name Dr. Glaucomflecken, started out as niche eye doctor jokes and a way to cope with his own experiences with two cancer diagnoses and a sudden cardiac arrest. But it has evolved, featuring character skits that call attention to and satirize the decisions of large health insurers, including UnitedHealthcare.",
      "He said he's never seen conversations around health insurance policy take off the way they did this week \u2014 and he hopes these new voices can help bring about change.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always talking about how powerful social media can be with advocacy,\" he said, \"because it really is the only way to put a significant amount of pressure on these corporations who are doing bad things for patients.\u201d",

      "Democrats in Michigan are pressing to pass reproductive health care legislation before the party loses its majority with the new legislative session next year",
      "LANSING, Mich. -- Michigan Democrats are pushing this month to pass legislation they say will improve reproductive health care, in particular the safety of digital health data, ahead of Republicans taking over the state House in 2025.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is backing a bill designed to protect reproductive health data including data logged on menstrual cycle tracking apps. Similar legislation that has passed in other states is aimed at keeping the data from being used to target people seeking abortions.",
      "\u201cThis feels like a very urgent need for us to get this done while we have a window in Michigan with the Democratic majority for the next few weeks,\u201d said state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, sponsor of the digital privacy bill.",
      "The rush is a reaction to expectations that it will be harder to pass the reproductive health care policies Democrats favor after Republicans take control of the state House in January. Democrats kept control of the state Senate in the November election.",
      "Republicans have opposed the digital privacy bill over a section they say will stifle anti-abortion advertising.",
      "Other reproductive health bills to be considered during the December session that began Tuesday include a package on Black maternal health and an expansion of access to birth control.",
      "After the overturn of Roe v. Wade, some women in states with strict abortion bans began to worry that their health information could be used to track their reproductive status. Apps that track menstrual cycles became a major focus point.",
      "Abortion is constitutionally protected in Michigan. But McMorrow does not trust President-elect Donald Trump's campaign promise to veto any possible national abortion ban nor his campaign's efforts to distance itself from Project 2025, which proposed a rollback on abortion and contraception access.",
      "Period tracking apps allow women to take detailed day-by-day notes about their health, from how heavy their period flow is to additional symptoms such as cramping. They can log pregnancies and miscarriages.",
      "\u201cThese tools are really valuable,\u201d McMorrow said. \u201cI just want to make sure that the guardrails are there when indications from the incoming federal administration is they would potentially weaponize the data in a way that is very dangerous.\u201d",
      "Federal law bars medical providers from sharing health data without a patient\u2019s consent but doesn\u2019t prevent digital tech companies from tracking menstrual cycles or an individual\u2019s location and selling it to data brokers. Legislation for federal bans have never gained momentum, largely because of opposition from the tech industry.",
      "How the legislation works varies from state to state. Washington state has digital privacy law that broadly covers all health-related data while Virginia has a law that explicitly prohibits the issuance of search warrants, subpoenas or court orders for electronic or digital menstrual health data.",
      "Michigan\u2019s proposal would require businesses or organizations to use reproductive health data only for the services it provides, and consumers must be informed of how the data is being used. In order to sell that data, an entity would need explicit, signed consent from the consumer. Consumers would also have the option to opt out from their data being sold at any time.",
      "It would also regulate retailers, who often compile data to target consumers with advertisements, and the use of geofencing, which allows marketers to target consumers with ads based on their location.",
      "The bill would prohibit identifying who is receiving reproductive health care by using location information and targeting them with advertisements. This would apply to people visiting fertility or abortion clinics.",
      "The geofencing provision of the bill has drawn objection from anti-abortion advocates. Genevieve Marnon, legislative director for Right to Life of Michigan, said in committee testimony Tuesday that the bill would prevent women visiting an abortion clinic from being reached by anti-abortion ads.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t safeguarding women\u2019s reproductive health data,\" she said. \u201cIt is limiting the options presented to women.\u201d",
      "Republican Sen. John Damoose, who voted against the bill in committee, believes the geofencing provision encroaches on freedom of speech and religion by preventing anti-abortion advertising.",
      "The bill was voted out of committee Tuesday on party lines and advanced Thursday toward a final vote in the Senate chamber.",
      "Kimya Forouzan, principal state policy director at the Guttmacher Institute, expects the topic to be taken up by other state legislatures next year. Guttmacher, which supports abortion rights, tracks reproductive health trends.",
      "Over the past two years, Michigan Democrats have passed bills repealing a number of anti-abortion laws, including the state\u2019s 1931 ban, and adding surrogacy protections to state law. Lawmakers are considering a number of others related to reproductive health this month.",
      "A group of bills focused on improving maternal health for Black women would create a doula scholarship, among other measures. The Senate voted its package on the topic through to the House on Tuesday.",
      "Rep. Jaime Churches, a Democrat from the downriver area of Detroit who lost her seat in November, is trying to gain traction for two bills that would require insurance to cover fertility treatments, including in vitro fertilization and intrauterine insemination.",
      "Three bills seeking to expand access to birth control through insurance have passed the state House. McMorrow also introduced a series of bills aimed at providing long-lasting reversible contraception, such an implants or intrauterine devices, to patients who have given birth before they are discharged from a hospital.",
      "There is competition among Democrats for time during this short, lame duck session. Advocates for economic development, infrastructure and gun control measures are among the many looking to push through bills in the month that is left. Major contention over new paid sick leave and minimum wage requirements is likely to garner attention. Those discussions could reduce the amount of time available to debate reproductive health measures.",

      "A federal appeals court panel on Friday unanimously upheld a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok as soon as next month, handing a resounding defeat to the popular social media platform as it fights for its survival in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied TikTok's petition to overturn the law \u2014 which requires TikTok to break ties with its China-based parent company ByteDance or be banned by mid-January \u2014 and rebuffed the company's challenge of the statute, which it argued had ran afoul of the First Amendment.",
      "\u201cThe First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\u201d said the court's opinion, which was written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg. \u201cHere the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary\u2019s ability to gather data on people in the United States.\u201d",
      "TikTok and ByteDance \u2014 another plaintiff in the lawsuit \u2014 are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, though its unclear whether the court will take up the case.",
      "\u201cThe Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said in a statement.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the TikTok ban was conceived and pushed through based upon inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people,\u201d Hughes said. Unless stopped, he argued the statute \u201cwill silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in the US and around the world on January 19th, 2025.\u201d",
      "Though the case is squarely in the court system, it's also possible the two companies might be thrown some sort of a lifeline by President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the presidential campaign that he is now against such action.",
      "\u201cHe wants to save TikTok,\u201d Rep. Michael Waltz, Trump's pick for national security adviser, said Friday during an interview on Fox Business.",
      "The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April, was the culmination of a yearslong saga in Washington over the short-form video-sharing app, which the government sees as a national security threat due to its connections to China.",
      "The U.S. has said it\u2019s concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that\u2019s difficult to detect. The European Union on Friday expressed similar concerns as it investigates intelligence that suggests Russia possibly abused the platform to influence the elections in Romania.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Friday.",
      "TikTok, which sued the government over the law in May, has long denied it could be used by Beijing to spy on or manipulate Americans. Its attorneys have accurately pointed out that the U.S. hasn\u2019t provided evidence to show that the company handed over user data to the Chinese government, or manipulated content for Beijing\u2019s benefit in the U.S. They have also argued the law is predicated on future risks, which the Department of Justice has emphasized pointing in part to unspecified action it claims the two companies have taken in the past due to demands from the Chinese government.",
      "Friday\u2019s ruling came after the appeals court panel, composed of two Republicans and one Democrat appointed judges, heard oral arguments in September.",
      "In the hearing, which lasted more than two hours, the panel appeared to grapple with how TikTok\u2019s foreign ownership affects its rights under the Constitution and how far the government could go to curtail potential influence from abroad on a foreign-owned platform. On Friday, all three denied TikTok\u2019s petition.",
      "In the court's ruling, Ginsburg, a Republican appointee, rejected TikTok's main legal arguments against the law, including that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder, or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. He also said the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to \"suppress content or require a certain mix of content\u201d on TikTok.",
      "\u201cContent on the platform could in principle remain unchanged after divestiture, and people in the United States would remain free to read and share as much PRC propaganda (or any other content) as they desire on TikTok or any other platform of their choosing,\u201d Ginsburg wrote, using the abbreviation for the People\u2019s Republic of China.",
      "Judge Sri Srinivasan, the chief judge on the court, issued a concurring opinion.",
      "TikTok\u2019s lawsuit was consolidated with a second legal challenge brought by several content creators \u2014 for which the company is covering legal costs \u2014 as well as a third one filed on behalf of conservative creators who work with a nonprofit called BASED Politics Inc. Other organizations, including the Knight First Amendment Institute, had also filed amicus briefs supporting TikTok.",
      "\u201cThis is a deeply misguided ruling that reads important First Amendment precedents too narrowly and gives the government sweeping power to restrict Americans\u2019 access to information, ideas, and media from abroad,\u201d said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the organization. \u201cWe hope that the appeals court\u2019s ruling won\u2019t be the last word.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, lawmakers who had pushed for the legislation celebrated the court's ruling.",
      "\"I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,\u201d said Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China.",
      "Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who co-authored the law, said \u201cit's time for ByteDance to accept\u201d the law.",
      "To assuage concerns about the company\u2019s owners, TikTok says it has invested more than $2 billion to bolster protections around U.S. user data.",
      "The company has also argued the government\u2019s broader concerns could have been resolved in a draft agreement it provided the Biden administration more than two years ago during talks between the two sides. It has blamed the government for walking away from further negotiations on the agreement, which the Justice Department argues is insufficient.",
      "Attorneys for the two companies have claimed it\u2019s impossible to divest the platform commercially and technologically. They also say any sale of TikTok without the coveted algorithm \u2014 the platform\u2019s secret sauce that Chinese authorities would likely block under any divesture plan \u2014 would turn the U.S. version of TikTok into an island disconnected from other global content.",
      "Still, some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in purchasing the platform. Both men said earlier this year that they were launching a consortium to purchase TikTok\u2019s U.S. business.",
      "This week, a spokesperson for McCourt\u2019s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said unnamed participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital."

      "Stellantis is recalling more than 300,000 Ram Heavy Duty pickup trucks because a faulty part could cause certain braking and tracking systems to fail.",
      "The Netherlands-based automaker said the hydraulic control unit on the trucks is prone to failure, which can cause the anti-lock brake, electronic stability control and traction control systems to not work properly. Stellantis said regular braking systems are not affected by the defective part and that it's unaware of any related injuries.",
      "The trucks in question are all model years 2017-18 and include the Ram 2500, 3500, 4500 and 5500. The recall includes a total of 317,630 trucks, including a small number of them in Canada, Mexico and elsewhere.",
      "Stellantis said it will advise customers who may be affected as to when they may obtain service, which will be free of charge.",
      "Customers with additional questions or concerns may call 1-800-853-1403.",
      "Last month, Stellantis announced a recall of about 207,000 Jeep and Dodge SUVs in the U.S. to fix a computer problem that can disable the anti-lock brakes and electronic stability control safety features. In September, Stellantis recalled nearly 1.5 million Ram pickup trucks worldwide to fix a software problem that can disable the electronic stability control system.",
      "Last week Stellantis announced that CEO Carlos Tavares was stepping down after nearly four years in the top spot of the carmaker.",
      "In addition to the recalls, Stellantis has been struggling with falling sales that have led to layoffs and contributed to ballooning inventory on dealer lots. Last quarter, Stellantis reported that net revenues plunged 27% from the same period a year ago.",
      "Stellantis, the world\u2019s fourth-largest automaker, was created by the 2021 merger of PSA Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.",

      "The European Union has reached a blockbuster free trade agreement with Brazil, Argentina and the three other South American nations in the Mercosur trade alliance",
      "MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay -- The European Union reached a blockbuster free trade agreement Friday with Brazil, Argentina and the three other South American nations in the Mercosur trade alliance, capping a quarter-century of on-off negotiations even as France vowed to derail the contentious accord.",
      "Provided it is ratified, the accord would create one of the world's largest free trade zones, covering a market of 780 million people that represents nearly a quarter of global gross domestic product.",
      "The accord's proponents in Brussels say it would save businesses some $4.26 billion in duties each year, slashing red tape and removing tariffs on products like Italian wine, Argentine steak, Brazilian oranges and German Volkswagens.",
      "Its critics in France, the Netherlands and other countries with big dairy and beef industries say the pact would subject local farmers to unfair competition and cause environmental damage.",
      "From Uruguay, the host of the Mercosur summit, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hailed the deal as a \u201ctruly historic milestone\" at a time when global protectionism is on the rise.",
      "\u201cI know that strong winds are blowing in the opposite direction, toward isolation and fragmentation, but this agreement is our clear response,\u201d von der Leyen said, an apparent reference to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's vows to protect American workers and goods.",
      "Under pressure from his country's powerful and vocal farming lobby, French President Emmanuel Macron said Friday the deal remained \u201cunacceptable\u201d as it stands and stressed that governments have not yet seen \u201cthe final outcome\u201d of negotiations.",
      "\u201cThe agreement has neither been signed nor ratified. This is not the end of the story,\u201d Macron's office said, adding that France demands additional safeguards for farmers and commitments to sustainable development and health controls.",
      "For France to block the deal, it would need the support of three or more other EU member states representing at least 35% of the bloc's population.",
      "The French government, which has been rallying countries to oppose the pact, named Austria, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland as other wary states that share French concerns about the deal.",
      "To take effect, the pact must also be endorsed by the European Parliament.",
      "In remarks aimed at her \u201cfellow Europeans,\u201d and perhaps in particular French skeptics, von der Leyen promised the accord would boost 60,000 businesses through lower tariffs, streamlined customs procedures and preferential access to raw materials otherwise supplied by China.",
      "\u201cThis will create huge business opportunities,\u201d von der Leyen said.",
      "She then turned to address European farmers who fear that an influx of cheap food imports will jeopardize their livelihoods. South American countries do not have to adhere to the same standards for animal treatment and pesticide use.",
      "\u201cWe have heard you, listened to your concerns, and we are acting on them,\u201d von der Leyen said.",
      "Outrage over environmental rules, rising costs and unregulated imports has unleashed massive farmers\u2019 protests across the continent over the past year.",

      "Libertarian President Javier Milei of Argentina described the accord as aligning with his free market principles. Argentines are excited about selling more beef and agricultural products in the EU.",
      "The deal is the product of 25 years of painstaking negotiations, dating back to a Mercosur summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1999. Talks collapsed over differences in economic priorities, regulatory standards and agricultural policies. The rise of protectionist tendencies also repeatedly upended hopes.",
      "Momentum picked up in 2016, as former President Trump imposed harsh tariffs on Europe. At the same time, market-friendly governments came to power in South America's biggest economies, Brazil and Argentina, which had been closed for years.",
      "In June 2019, negotiators announced a deal that included provisions for tariff reductions and commitments to environmental standards.",
      "But it was never implemented. In Brazil, the region's economic powerhouse, right-wing former President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, presided over record levels of deforestation in the Amazon, prompting EU governments to demand tougher sustainability criteria. In Argentina, a new left-wing protectionist government opposed the deal.",
      "But things picked up as the region's politics shifted again in 2023. Brazil's President Lula rode to power on pledges to rein in illegal logging, soothing concerns that the pact could accelerate deforestation. Argentina's Milei is working to open the nation's notoriously closed and crisis-stricken economy.",
      "But if past EU trade agreements are any indication, ratification could take years.",
      "\"We celebrate it, but it's still far from reality,\u201d Milei said of the accord.",

      "Chipotle is raising its U.S. prices to offset inflation and to compensate for a promise to increase portion sizes.",
      "Chipotle\u2019s chief corporate affairs officer, Laurie Schalow, confirmed Friday that the Mexican restaurant chain was implementing a 2% price increase nationally. Schalow said it's the first time the California-based company has raised its prices in more than a year.",
      "Chipotle revealed the price increase after an analyst report released earlier this week by investment bank Truist Securities noted a 2% price increase at approximately 20% of the chain\u2019s 3,500 U.S. stores.",
      "Truist, which raised its price target for Chipotle\u2019s shares, also reported that customer traffic at the chain's restaurants accelerated in November.",
      "Chipotle said in October that its food, beverage and packaging costs all increased in the third quarter. It cited avocados as an example.",
      "Avocado shipments from Mexico to the U.S. were briefly suspended in June after two U.S. Department of Agriculture employees were assaulted and temporarily held by assailants in the Mexican state of Michoacan.",
      "Chipotle also cited the cost of ensuring it was providing \u201cconsistent and generous portions\u201d to its customers. Former Chairman and CEO Brian Niccol said in July that Chipotle was retraining workers at approximately 10% of Chipotle's stores after customers complained on social media that they were getting smaller portions.",
      "Niccol left Chipotle in September to become the chairman and CEO of Starbucks, which has said it won't raise prices through September 2025.",
      "Restaurant price inflation has aggravated U.S. consumers. The price of food eaten away from home rose 30% between October 2019 and October 2024, according to government figures. The price of food eaten at home rose 27% in that same period.",
      "Earlier this year, McDonald's said it was seeing more customers eat at home instead of getting fast food because of price increases. The company responded with a $5 meal deal and other discounts."

      "Deciding whether Juan Soto tops Shohei Ohtani for baseball\u2019s largest contract could be in the eye of the beholder because of all the deferred money in Ohtani\u2019s deal",
      "NEW YORK -- Deciding whether Juan Soto tops Shohei Ohtani for baseball\u2019s largest contract could be in the eye of the beholder because of all the deferred money in Ohtani's deal.",
      "Ohtani agreed last December to a $700 million, 10-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers, easily exceeding the previous high set when Mike Trout and the Los Angeles Angels struck a $426.5 million, 12-year agreement through 2030.",
      "Ohtani\u2019s deal includes $680 million in deferred money payable from 2034-43. There are several interpretations for how to value that deal in current dollars:",
      "1. For baseball's luxury tax, the average annual value is pegged at $46.08 million using a 4.33% discount rate.2. The players' association uses a 5% rate, which puts the value at $43.75 million per season.3. For MLB's regular payroll, a 10% rate results in a $28.21 million per year rate.",
      "1. For baseball's luxury tax, the average annual value is pegged at $46.08 million using a 4.33% discount rate.",
      "2. The players' association uses a 5% rate, which puts the value at $43.75 million per season.",
      "3. For MLB's regular payroll, a 10% rate results in a $28.21 million per year rate.",
      "Soto could get a contract of 10-to-15 years for $600 million or more.",
      "His agent, Scott Boras, is not a big fan of deferred money and thinks teams might not insist on delaying the cash.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s much less of an issue than it was before,\u201d Boras said. \u201cDeferral as a mechanism for me, is it: Will it impede my ability to get the greatest asset I can acquire? And the answer to that is I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to want to do anything that impedes their primary pursuit and goal.\u201d",
      "The interest figure used for discounting to determine luxury tax value is set in the collective bargaining agreement as the federal mid-term rate defined in section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code for the October preceding the initial contract year.",
      "That rate dropped to 3.7% this offseason, which meant if Ohtani\u2019s deal had been agreed to this month, its annual luxury tax value would have been about $49.3 million. That would have resulted in an additional $3.5 million annual tax bill for the Dodgers, who will exceed the top threshold and would pay additional tax at a 110% rate on each dollar.",
      "MLB\u2019s regular payrolls, which use the same rate as the one for calculating the qualifying offer price based on the 125 largest contracts, use the prime rate set by J.P. Morgan Chase on the preceding Nov. 1 plus 1%, rounded to the nearest full percentage point. That figure dropped to 9% for this offseason.",
      "Deferred compensation must be funded by the second July 1 after the season in which it was earned, discounted to a present-day value at a 5% rate.",
      "Los Angeles owes deferred payments just over $1 billion due from 2028-46 to Ohtani, Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman, Will Smith, Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez, Blake Snell and Tommy Edman.",
      "\u201cIt's just trying to kick dollars down the road,\u201d St. Louis Cardinals president of baseball operations John Mozeliak said at the general managers meetings last month.",
      "Ohtani's payments are two-thirds of the total owed.",
      "\u201cIt was a unique situation for where a club was, a unique situation for a player who has very significant earning potential outside of strictly his compensation from a club,\" New York Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns said. \u201cThose other ones are much more representative of what you see in sort of standard contracts around the industry. Each organization, each ownership group is going to have a slightly different perspective on this, on how they\u2019re calculating the returns off of that deferred compensation.\u201d",
      "Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said his team's leadership from Guggenheim Baseball Management has the expertise to fund deferred compensation wisely.",
      "\"A lot of our ownership group are from financial background and can have that money going to work right now,\" he said.",
      "MLB proposed during collective bargaining on June 21, 2021, to put an end to the practice.",
      "\u201cFor contracts entered into after the effective date of the Basic Agreement, deferred compensation of any kind will not be permitted,\u201d the proposal read, according to a copy obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "That idea was rejected by the union and not included in the five-year agreement that expires in December 2026.",
      "New York Yankees general manager Brian Cashman thinks his team's large resources encourage players to seek their money as soon as possible.",
      "\u201cWe're open to deferrals,\" he said. \"A lot of times players are less open to doing deferrals for us than they are for maybe other markets, but if we can do stuff that benefits us, of course we will.\u201d",

      "The Federal Maritime Commission, an independent body charged with monitoring and evaluating conditions that may affect shipping and U.S. international trade, said it had opened the probe after receiving information that Spain had refused to allow at least three cargo vessels into its ports.",
      "\u201cThe commission is concerned that this apparent policy of denying entry to certain vessels will create conditions unfavorable to shipping in the foreign trade,\u201d it said Thursday in a notice published in the Federal Register.",
      "If the investigation determines that Spain has interfered with such commerce, the commission could levy millions of dollars in fines, up to $2.3 million per voyage, it said.",
      "The notice said the commission had been informed on Nov. 19 that Spain was denying port entry to ships, including those enrolled in the U.S.-run Maritime Security Program, which is supposed to afford vessels and their owners protection against \u201crestrictive and discriminatory\u201d licensing because their services are often used by the U.S. military.",
      "Two of the three incidents noted by the commission involved vessels run by the Danish shipping giant Maersk in November. The other occurred in May.",
      "Spanish authorities did not immediately comment on the November incidents. But in May, Spanish Transport Minister Oscar Puente said the foreign ministry had denied a request to dock by the Danish-flagged ship Marianne Danica, saying it \u201cwas carrying weapons to Israel.\u201d",
      "A day later, on May 17, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares told Spain\u2019s state broadcaster RTVE that this was the first ship carrying arms to Israel that had been denied entry.",
      "\u201cWe are not going to contribute to any more arms reaching the Middle East,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Middle East needs peace. That is why that this first denial of authorization will start a policy for any boat carrying arms to Israel that wants to dock at a Spanish port.\u201d",
      "The refusal to allow the Marianne Danica to dock at the Mediterranean port of Cartegena came just days before Spain, along with Ireland and Norway, recognized a Palestinian state on May 28.",

      "Regulators also have ordered a series of corrective actions and improvements to the facilities that process gas for transmission by pipeline.",

      "The S&P 500 climbed 0.2%, just enough top the all-time high set on Wednesday, as it closed a third straight winning week in what looks to be one of its best years  since the 2000 dot-com bust. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 123.19 points, or 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.8% to set its own record.",
      "The quiet trading came after the latest jobs report came in mixed enough to strengthen traders\u2019 expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again  at its next meeting in two weeks. The report showed U.S. employers hired more workers than expected last month, but it also said the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%.",

      "The Fed has been easing its main interest rate  from a two-decade high since September to offer more help for the slowing job market, after bringing inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Lower interest rates can ease the brakes off the economy, but they can also offer more fuel for inflation.",
      "Expectations for a series of cuts from the Fed have been a major reason the S&P 500 has set an all-time high 57 times  so far this year. And the Fed is part of a global surge: 62 central banks have lowered rates in the past three months, the most since 2020, according to Michael Hartnett and other strategists at Bank of America.",
      "Still, the jobs report may have included some notes of caution for Fed officials underneath the surface.",
      "Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, pointed to average wages for workers last month, which were a touch stronger than economists expected. While that\u2019s good news for workers who would always like to make more, it could keep upward pressure on inflation.",

      "NEW YORK -- The gunman who killed the CEO of the largest U.S. health insurer likely left New York City on a bus soon after the brazen ambush that has shaken corporate America, police officials said. But he left something behind: a backpack that was discovered in Central Park.",
      "Nearly four days after the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, police still did not know the gunman\u2019s name or whereabouts or have a motive for the killing. Investigators were looking at whether the shooter may have been a disgruntled employee or client of the insurer, Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told reporters.",
      "The FBI announced Friday night it was offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction.",
      "Video of the gunman fleeing Wednesday\u2019s shooting showed him riding a bicycle into Central Park and later taking a taxi to a bus terminal that offers commuter service to New Jersey and Greyhound routes to Philadelphia, Boston and Washington, D.C, according to Kenny.",
      "Police have video of the man entering the bus station but no video of him exiting, leading them to believe he left the city, Kenny said.",
      "Investigators on Friday found a backpack in the park that had been worn by the gunman during the shooting, police said, following a massive sweep to find it in a vast area with lakes and ponds, meadows, playgrounds and woods.",
      "Police didn\u2019t immediately reveal what, if anything, it contained but said it would be analyzed for clues.",
      "The gunman made sure to conceal his identity with a mask during almost all of his time in the city, including during the attack and while he ate, yet left a trail of evidence in view of the nation\u2019s biggest city and its network of security cameras.",
      "The gunman arrived in New York City on Nov. 24 and shot Thompson 10 days later outside his company\u2019s annual investor conference at a hotel just blocks from Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center.",
      "The gunman got off a bus that originated in Atlanta and made several stops along the way, Kenny said. Police have not determined where he got on the bus. Investigators have a list of passengers, but none of them would have had to provide an ID when they climbed aboard, Kenny said.",
      "Investigators believe the suspect used a fake identification card and paid cash, Kenny said, when he checked in at the hostel, which has a caf\u00e9 along with shared and private rooms and is blocks from Columbia University.",
      "Investigators have tested a discarded water bottle and protein bar wrapper in a hunt for his DNA. They also were trying to obtain additional information from a cellphone found along the gunman\u2019s escape route.",
      "Photos of the suspected shooter that were taken in the lobby of a hostel on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side appear to from the only time he removed his mask, Kenny said. The images, showing a man smiling in the lobby of the HI New York City hostel. They are among a collection of photos and video circulated since the shooting \u2014 including footage of the attack, as well as images of the suspected gunman at a Starbucks beforehand.",
      "\u201cFrom every indication we have from witnesses, from the Starbucks, from the hostel, he kept his mask on at all times except for the one instance where we have him photographed with the mask off,\u201d Kenny said.",
      "His roommates at the hostel also said he didn\u2019t speak to them. Nothing of investigative value was found in a search of the suspected shooter\u2019s hotel room.",
      "Asked how close he felt police were to making an arrest, Kenny said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t \u2018Blue Bloods.\u2019 We\u2019re not going to solve this in 60 minutes. We\u2019re painstakingly going through every bit of evidence that we can come across. Eventually, when an apprehension is made, we will have to present all of these facts to a judge and jury, so we\u2019re taking our time, doing it right and making sure we\u2019re going to get justice for this victim and closure for his family.\u201d",
      "Security video of the shooting shows the killer approaching Thompson from behind, firing several shots with a gun equipped with a silencer, barely pausing to clear a jam while the executive fell to the sidewalk.",
      "Police were looking into the possibility that the weapon was a veterinary pistol, which is a weapon commonly used on farms and ranches if an animal has to be euthanized quietly, Kenny said \u2014 though he stressed that hadn\u2019t been confirmed.",
      "The words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were scrawled on the ammunition, one word on each of three bullets, Kenny said. A law enforcement official previously told The Associated Press the words were \u201cdeny,\u201d \u201cdefend\u201d and \u201cdepose.\u201d The messages mirror the phrase \u201cdelay, deny, defend,\u201d which is commonly used by lawyers and critics about insurers that delay payments, deny claims and defend their actions.",

      "TWIN FALLS, Idaho -- The federal government on Friday approved a scaled-down wind farm in Idaho over local opposition, including from groups concerned about its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.",
      "The Bureau of Land Management signed off on a final plan for the Lava Ridge Wind Project northeast of Twin Falls that decreases the number of wind turbines to 241 from 400 and imposes a maximum height of 660 feet (201 meters). The agency said the area \u201cdisturbed\u201d by the project has been reduced by half from the initial proposal, with 992 acres (401 hectares) disturbed within a 38,535-acre (15,594-hectare) area.",
      "The agency said the project could power up to 500,000 homes and that its approval \u201creflects a careful balance of clean energy development with the protection of natural, cultural, and socioeconomic resources on this historically significant landscape.\u201d",
      "Some groups have expressed concern over the high desert site's potential impacts on the Minidoka National Historic Site, where thousands of Japanese Americans were imprisoned during World War II.",
      "Friends of Minidoka, a group that works to preserve the site and educate about its history, said it was reviewing the decision but that it remained disappointed by a project it views as harming the area's \u201csacredness.\u201d",
      "\u201cMinidoka National Historic Site holds deep significance to both the nation as a whole and to the Japanese American community about the lessons of a gross violation of constitutional rights on a group of American citizens,\u201d Robyn Achilles, the group's executive director, said in an email.",
      "Under the final version of the project, the closest turbine to the historic site would be 9 miles (14 kilometers) away.",
      "Two months after the Japan\u2019s Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066. Roughly 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry were taken from their homes and incarcerated in camps as a potential threat against the U.S. Many were elderly, disabled, children or infants.",
      "Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador has also opposed the wind project. In a Friday press release, he denounced the federal government for moving ahead with it \u201cregardless of the damage to Idaho farms, ranches, rural communities, agricultural aviation, water supplies, wildlife, and historical sites.\u201d",
      "The Bureau of Land Management said it spent hundreds of hours speaking with Japanese American community members, as well as Native American leaders, ranchers and other local agencies. According to the agency, the final project reduced potential impacts to sage grouse, wildlife migration routes, a nearby airport, public land ranchers and other areas of cultural importance.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Interior Department has approved 43 renewable energy projects on public lands, the Bureau of Land Management said. The administration's goal is to permit on public lands 25 gigawatts of renewable energy \u2014 enough to power roughly 12 million homes \u2014 by 2025, including from wind and solar projects."

      "The Anaheim Ducks have acquired New York Rangers captain Jacob Trouba in a trade for defenseman Urho Vaakanainen and a future fourth-round pick",
      "ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Jacob Trouba is finally out of New York after months of public trade rumors and private threats from the Rangers, who were determined to get rid of their captain and his massive contract.",
      "Trouba was not pleased with the way he was run out of town, but he says he's quite happy to land with the Anaheim Ducks.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a rite of passage to get fired from MSG,\u201d Trouba said Friday after the Ducks acquired the veteran defenseman in exchange for defenseman Urho Vaakanainen and a conditional fourth-round pick in 2025.",
      "The trade ends the 30-year-old Trouba\u2019s five-year tenure with the Rangers. He has been a fixture in trade rumors for months, and he acknowledged that the uncertainty affected his play this fall.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t like that it was made public necessarily, but I guess that\u2019s New York and how it happens,\" Trouba said. \"Made it kind of hard to play, but I\u2019m excited to move forward. In my opinion, things could have been handled better. Not blaming anybody or anything, but it was just kind of an unfortunate end to my time in New York.\u201d",
      "Rangers general manager Chris Drury hasn't tried to hide his desire for a roster reboot since the summer, and Trouba is in the sixth season of a seven-year, $56 million contract. The physical blueliner's hefty deal has been an impediment to the movement New York wanted so desperately, and Trouba also had a robust no-trade clause.",
      "In a conference call set up by the Ducks to welcome their new defenseman, Trouba essentially confirmed the long-rumored details of his New York saga, including his decision to nix a trade \u2014 reportedly to Detroit \u2014 last summer. He did it to support his wife, Kelly, who is completing her three-year medical residency at a New York hospital.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I was put in a position this summer to make a decision between my career and my family, and I chose my family,\u201d Trouba said. \u201cI would choose my family 100 times over again.\u201d",
      "Trouba also confirmed that the Rangers told him this week to accept a trade or be scratched. He also indicated he was told he eventually would be placed on waivers, removing his ability to control where he landed next.",
      "\"Yesterday morning was, \u2018Accept this trade or we\u2019re scratching you,\u2019\u201d Trouba said. \u201cGot to the place where I felt comfortable with Anaheim, and that was the place I wanted to go.\u201d",
      "Trouba said his wife is also excited about moving to Southern California, calling it \u201ca great opportunity for her long-term as well.\u201d Trouba will join the last-place Ducks in Montreal on Monday for the opener of a four-game trip.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a team that\u2019s kind of right on the cusp of taking the next step and being really great, I think,\u201d he added. \u201cI can come in there and make an impact in a positive way. It\u2019s just a city I was very excited about coming into.\u201d",
      "Trouba joined the Rangers in a trade with Winnipeg in 2019, and he became New York's captain before the 2022-23 season.",
      "Trouba has been considered one of the NHL's best checking defensemen at the height of his talents. He has six assists in 23 games this year while struggling to produce offensively at the level of his best seasons, including a career-best 50 points with the Jets in 2018-19.",
      "\u201cI can tell you \u2014 and I said this to him \u2014 I thought while he was here and during our time here he was a really good player and a really good teammate. A good person,\" New York coach Peter Laviolette said after Friday night's 4-2 victory over Pittsburgh. \u201cI thought he worked hard and tried to set a good example for the New York Rangers.\u201d",
      "The Ducks can accommodate the final 1 1/2 years of Trouba's deal because they have one of the NHL's lowest payrolls and ample salary cap space after general manager Pat Verbeek failed to land any top free agents last summer.",
      "Trouba will immediately become a key contributor on the blue line for the Ducks, who are in last place in the Pacific Division. He also will play alongside Anaheim forwards Ryan Strome and Frank Vatrano, his teammates with the Rangers during the club's run to the Eastern Conference finals in 2022.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s got some underrated offensive skills that probably hasn\u2019t shown in the last year or so,\u201d Verbeek said. \u201cOverall it gives our team a lot more rigid, physical play to the rest of our group, and for me, I\u2019m trying to make this team better. That is part of how I want us to play. I want us to be really tough to play against, and he certainly adds that element to our group.\u201d",
      "The Ducks' group of defensemen includes captain Radko Gudas, veteran Cam Fowler, free agent signee Brian Dumoulin and promising youngsters Olen Zellweger, Pavel Mintyukov and Jackson LaCombe.",
      "Rebuilding Anaheim still isn't a good team on offense or defense after six consecutive non-playoff seasons, but it has shown some statistical improvement defensively this season, allowing just 2.96 goals per game after giving up 3.57 last season.",
      "Vaakanainen hasn't played since Nov. 13 while dealing with an upper-body injury. The veteran played 68 games and scored one goal for the Ducks last season, but he has been injured frequently during his career with Boston and Anaheim.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Once general manager Ohemaa Nyanin and her Golden State Valkyries staff had decided who to pick in the WNBA expansion draft, the first challenge became reaching each player with the news before she heard it anywhere else.",
      "That meant considering practice times, game schedules, time zones and potential sleep times. It all seemed worthwhile Friday night when the roster began taking shape.",
      "The way Nyanin looks at it, they are all part of history, about to join something being built from the ground up.",
      "\u201cI just want these players to be happy,\u201d Nyanin said. \u201cI want them to understand the opportunity that they have to come and be historians. Once you get to put on that jersey and you get to sit in front of a packed Chase Center, your whole experience is going to change.\u201d",
      "The Valkyries selected center Iliana Rupert from Atlanta, guards Veronica Burton of Connecticut and Carla Leite of Dallas and forward Maria Conde from Chicago with their initial picks on Friday, the first players for the new Bay Area franchise that's set to begin play next season.",
      "Golden State rounded out its 11-woman roster with Indiana center Temi Fagbenle; Las Vegas guard Kate Martin; forwards Steph Talbot of Los Angeles, Cecilia Zandalasini of Minnesota, Kayla Thornton of New York and Monique Billings of Phoenix; and Washington guard Julie Vanloo. The Valkyries did not choose a player from Seattle.",
      "Thornton is riding high after helping the Liberty to a WNBA title. Martin, a second-round draft pick this year who played with Caitlin Clark at Iowa, could get more playing time and enjoy a big jump in productivity after she averaged 11.5 minutes and 2.6 points as a rookie with the Aces.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty cool opportunity. I feel really grateful to be a part of it. It\u2019s a part of history, a new WNBA team,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t had an expansion draft in a really long time. It\u2019s something super cool to be a part of, and I feel really grateful that they chose me. It\u2019s just going to be a lot of fun. Obviously they\u2019re going to be aggressive, and we\u2019re going to have more people added. That makes it really fun, seeing the roster come together and what it\u2019s going to be, how training camp is going to look.\u201d",
      "Nyanin described the process of starting a new team as \u201ccomplex.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think these athletes are a really good step forward in our journey,\u201d said Nyanin, who also had conversations about trades. \u201cI was so excited about the blank canvas, and then behind closed doors it was blank. Nobody's name just appeared or anything so there was a lot of work that myself and my team put into it. The complexities around it is what I want to continue to highlight because these are 11 humans, right? They all thought one thing and they woke up today or are still sleeping and they're a part of the Golden State Valkyries.\u201d",
      "The team plans to be active when free agency starts in February.",
      "Golden State did extensive scouting work and had discussions on each player to determine how she might fit in a new system.",
      "\u201cIt's a long process but it's also a great process for us,\u201d coach Natalie Nakase said. \u201cWe kind of did this cycle, where we collaborate, we discuss and then we go watch film, then do it again ... and that went over and over again for about two months. And finally we decided, we picked the best players that fit our culture. So we're excited and can't wait to get going.\u201d",
      "This marked the WNBA's first expansion draft in 16 years since the Atlanta Dream joined the league in 2008.",
      "Golden State was free to acquire the contract or negotiating rights to one player from each of the other 12 WNBA teams. The Valkyries can also choose one player from the league who's eligible to become an unrestricted free agent.",
      "The Valkyries will play at Chase Center, the 5-year-old home of the Golden State Warriors, and practice across the bay in the organization's Oakland training facility.",
      "Warriors star Draymond Green sported a Valkyries jersey with No. 25 on the back \u2014 for the inaugural campaign of 2025 \u2014 while sitting out injured during Thursday's win over the Houston Rockets.",

And to see what he did in a championship game for his team also speaks volumes.\u201d",

      "Jeanty, who spurned several offseason NIL offers from Power 4 schools a year ago, chose to return to Boise State to do something special.",
      "He soaked it all in Friday.",
      "\u201cAs soon as I woke up, that was all that was on my mind,\u201d Jeanty said of his time at Boise State. \u201cI was just so grateful for the program, the coaches and the community and everybody that believes in me. I took it all in the whole game. It was just an amazing experience. I wouldn\u2019t want to go out any other way.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The NBA is returning to China next season",
      "The NBA is returning to China next season, striking a deal to play preseason games there more than five years after the league was effectively banned over Commissioner Adam Silver not punishing Daryl Morey for tweeting support of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong.",
      "The Brooklyn Nets and the Phoenix Suns will play in China\u2019s gambling hub of Macao on Oct. 10, 2025, and again two days later, the NBA announced on Friday. A person with knowledge of the matter told The Associated Press that there are plans for two more preseason games in China in 2026.",
      "The Nets and Suns will play at Macao\u2019s Venetian Arena, which is owned by the Las Vegas Sands Corp. \u2014 which is a casino operator there as well. Sands president and chief operating officer Patrick Dumont became governor of the Dallas Mavericks late last year after his family acquired the team.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re incredibly excited to be partnering with Sands to bring NBA games back to Macao beginning next year,\" NBA deputy commissioner Mark Tatum said in Macao, adding that the agreement is \"a significant milestone in the continued global growth of basketball.\u201d",
      "The Nets are owned by Joe Tsai, the chairman of Chinese tech giant Alibaba.",
      "To essentially kick off the return of NBA games to China, there will be a celebrity game in Macao on Saturday. Basketball Hall of Famers Tony Parker, Ray Allen and Tracy McGrady, along with former NBA standouts Stephon Marbury, DeMarcus Cousins and Cuttino Mobley are the headline attractions. All took part in Friday's event to announce the Suns-Nets games.",
      "Friday's announcement caps a long series of moves toward some sort of return to normalcy between China and the league. The NBA, on some level, has been welcomed back for a while: Miami's Jimmy Butler, who has an endorsement deal with Chinese apparel company Li-Ning, has toured the country and drawn large crowds in each of the last two offseasons, while Golden State's Stephen Curry and Sacramento's De\u2019Aaron Fox drew enormous crowds when they visited in September.",
      "Then in October, Silver said he thought the league would \u201cbring games back to China at some point.\u201d",
      "\u201cNBA basketball is a global sport that attracts people of different ages, backgrounds and cultures. It creates exciting experiences that connect people while playing a positive role in communities,\u201d Dumont said. \u201cSands is honored to bring The NBA China Games to Macao so that the most elite level of basketball can be experienced directly by the fans who are so passionate about it.\u201d",
      "The geopolitical rift between China and the league started in October 2019 when Morey, then the general manager of the Houston Rockets and now GM of the Philadelphia 76ers, tweeted support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. The tweet was deleted quickly, but the fallout lasted years and Beijing was clearly displeased by Silver supporting Morey\u2019s right to speak out on the issue.",
      "\u201cIf that\u2019s the consequences of us adhering to our values, we still feel it\u2019s critically important we adhere to those values,\u201d Silver said at the time.",
      "The timing of the tweet was particularly awkward, given that the Nets and Los Angeles Lakers were in China at the time for two games. The games were played \u2014 largely in silence with fans in attendance, many taping over the NBA logos on the jerseys they wore \u2014 and even without customary pregame and postgame news conferences.",
      "The NBA was criticized by both Republican and Democratic lawmakers in the U.S. for playing and for not saying more about China\u2019s human rights record.",
      "In large part because Silver did not sanction Morey to China\u2019s liking, no NBA games were shown on CCTV, China\u2019s state broadcaster, for one year after that tweet. The end of the 2020 NBA Finals was shown on CCTV, which began showing games in earnest again in 2022. NBA games were available to Chinese fans on the streaming service Tencent, another of the league\u2019s broadcast partners.",
      "The league said the rift cost up to $400 million in lost revenue in the year that followed, and that figure surely continued rising. But there were steps toward a reconciliation along the way; NBA legend and Yao Ming went to the U.S. for the memorial service for commissioner emeritus David Stern in January 2020, a move viewed at the time as a mutual sign that the league and China wanted to mend fences. That was followed by China publicly thanking the NBA in February 2020 \u2014 when what became the COVID-19 pandemic was in its earliest days \u2014 for sending more than $1 million in medical supplies to assist coronavirus relief efforts there.",
      "The league has played a preseason game in Macao once before, with Orlando beating Cleveland there in 2007. The Magic, on that same trip, also played a Chinese all-star team in Macao. And in 2008, USA Basketball played exhibitions in Macao before the Beijing Olympics.",
      "\u201cThe game of basketball around here, the fans respect the game so much,\u201d then-Cavaliers star LeBron James said after playing in Macao in 2007. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see that.\u201d",
      "Macao \u2014 a former Portuguese colony that was returned to Chinese rule in 1999 \u2014 is the only place in China where casino gambling is legal. Beijing has called for the city to diversify its gambling-reliant economy, with hopes that it can grow tourism and be a bridge for trade between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.",

      "What a way to say hello.",
      "Charles Leclerc and his younger brother Arthur drove side-by-side in matching Ferraris at the end of the first practice session Friday for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.",
      "\u201cJust saying hello to my brother,\" Arthur told the team over the radio after Charles gave him a wave on their slowdown lap at the Yas Marina Circuit.",
      "Brothers have raced in F1 before \u2014 Michael and Ralf Schumacher both won races \u2014 but F1 said the Leclerc brothers from Monaco were the first to be teammates in an official session as part of a championship race weekend.",
      "The 24-year-old Arthur Leclerc, who previously drove in Formula 2, was borrowing Carlos Sainz Jr.'s Ferrari because of a rule that teams must give younger and less experienced drivers practice time at least twice per season.",
      "Charles Leclerc said his family was flying in to Abu Dhabi to watch the brothers.",
      "\u201cIt will be a very special moment,\u201d he said in a team statement Thursday. \u201cBecause to a certain extent it means that all the sacrifices my family made will have served a purpose.\u201d",
      "At one stage, the family reportedly had to pause Arthur's career when he was a teenager because of the financial demands of supporting Charles in his rise toward F1.",
      "Charles was fastest in first practice but his session began with a major setback as Ferrari had to replace the battery pack on his car. That led to an expected 10-place grid penalty for Sunday's race and a heavy blow to the team's hopes of beating McLaren to the constructors' title.",
      "Arthur spent the first part of the session driving with his car fitted with an \u201caero rake\", a frame with sensors that allow teams to measure air flows. By the end, he was 18th fastest of the 20 drivers in the session, 1.858 seconds off his brother's time.",
      "As the last round of the year, Abu Dhabi is a popular choice to try out a younger driver, since teams are typically more familiar with how to set up the car for different conditions regardless of feedback from the drivers.",

      "LONDON -- The European Union said Friday it sent TikTok an urgent request for more information about Romanian intelligence files suggesting that Moscow coordinated influencers on its platform to promote an election candidate who became the surprise front-runner in the nation's presidential election.",
      "The 27-nation bloc\u2019s executive branch is using its sweeping digital rulebook to scrutinize the video-sharing app's role in the vote. which saw the far-right populist Calin Georgescu coming from out of nowhere to take top spot. But the election was thrown into turmoil Friday after the country\u2019s top court annulled results from the first round of voting.",
      "Declassified files released by Romanian authorities earlier this week suggest that a pro-Russia campaign used the messaging app Telegram to recruit thousands of TikTok users to promote Georgescu.",
      "It is unclear from the intelligence release whether Georgescu was aware of the alleged campaign or assisted in it.",
      "European Commission officials said they asked the TikTok to comment on the files and to provide information on actions that it\u2019s taking in response. It\u2019s the second time the commission has asked the TikTok for information since the election\u2019s first round of voting on Nov. 24, and comes a day after it ordered the Chinese-owned platform to retain all election-related files and evidence.",
      "TikTok declined to comment.",
      "\u201cWe are concerned about mounting indications of coordinated foreign online influence operation targeting ongoing Romanian elections, especially on TikTok,\u201d Henna Virkkunen, the commission\u2019s executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, security and democracy, said in a post on X.",
      "TikTok has 24 hours to respond to the EU request, officials told a press briefing in Brussels",
      "Virkunnen said also called on TikTok to \u201curgently redress\u201d its policies on content moderation and amplification policies and comply with the bloc's Digital Services Act, a wide-ranging set of rules designed to clean up social media platforms.",
      "She had urged TikTok to step up resources \u201cto counter information operations\u201d ahead of a final vote planned for Sunday, when Georgescu was due to face pro-EU reformist Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party. But now that the Romanian Constitutional Court has issued its unprecedented decision to cancel the initial results, the first round of voting will have to be held again.",
      "Georgescu\u2019s unexpected rise in the polls plunged the European Union and NATO country into turmoil and spurred the authorities to release the files.",
      "Romania's intelligence services alleged that one TikTok user paid $381,000 to influencers on the platform to promote content about Georgescu. They said they obtained information that \u201crevealed an aggressive promotion campaign\u201d to increase and accelerate the candidate\u2019s popularity.",
      "Some of the thousands of social media accounts used in the campaign were allegedly created years ago but were only activated in the weeks leading up to the first round vote, the files indicated.",

    "story": [
      "A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat",
      "A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat. Researchers found at higher temperatures and humidity, the heat kills far more young people under 35 than those older than 50.",
      "For decades, health and weather experts have warned that the elderly and the youngest children were most vulnerable in heat waves. But this study looking at all deaths in Mexico from 1998 to 2019 shows that when the combination of humidity and temperature reach uncomfortable levels, such as the mid to upper 80s Fahrenheit (around 30 degrees Celsius) and 50% relative humidity, there were nearly 32 temperature-related deaths of people 35 years old for every temperature-related death of someone 50 and older.",
      "The study in Friday's journal Science Advances shows an especially surprising spike of heat-related deaths in an age group thought to be young and robust: People between 18 and 35. That age group alone had nine times as many temperature-related deaths as those older than 50.",
      "Study authors and outside experts are scrambling to figure out why. Demographics alone don't explain why more young adult Mexicans are dying in high heat than their elders. Two theories: Outdoor workers who can't escape the heat, and young people who don't know their limits.",
      "The trend is likely to widen as the world warms from human-caused climate change, according to computer simulations run by the study team.",
      "\u201cWe found that younger people are especially vulnerable to humid heat,\u201d study co-author Jeffrey Shrader, a climate economist at Columbia University, said. \u201cAs the climate warms, we're really going to be shifting the burden of temperature-related mortality towards younger individuals and away from older individuals who tend to be more vulnerable to cold temperatures.\u201d",
      "Data from cold weather shows more than 300 deaths of Mexican residents 50 and older for every young person dying from cold temperatures, according to the study.",
      "\u201cPeople of all ages are increasingly at risk from the rising temperatures, and this study shows that those that we might have considered relatively safe from heat-related adverse health outcomes might not be so much so,\u201d said Marina Romanello, executive director of the Lancet Countdown that monitors health effects of climate change. She was not part of the study team.",
      "\u201cHeat is a much more dangerous silent killer than most people acknowledge it to be, and that heat is increasingly putting our health and survival at risk,\" Romanello said in an email.",
      "Study authors decided to examine weather-related deaths in Mexico because that country not only has detailed mortality data, but it has a variety of different climates making it an ideal place to study in depth, Shrader said.",
      "Researchers also want to figure out whether this is just a situation in Mexico or other warmer sections of the globe have similar spikes in young adult deaths in high heat and humidity.",
      "Initially the team just wanted to look at deaths and what scientists call wet-bulb globe temperatures, but when they looked at age differences, they were surprised and looked in more detail, Shrader said. Wet-bulb temperature, which is intended to mirror how the body cools itself, is derived using a complicated measurement system that factors in humidity and solar radiation. A wet-bulb globe temperature of 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) is thought to be the limit for human survivability. Most places don\u2019t reach that level.",
      "Researchers determined temperature-related mortality by complex statistical analysis that compares numerous factors in the number of deaths and removes everything they can except temperature fluctuations, said study co-author Andrew Wilson, a Columbia climate economics researcher.",
      "Researchers also calculated the ideal temperature for when there are the fewest excess deaths at each age group. Younger adults' sweet temperature spot is about nine degrees Fahrenheit (five degrees Celsius) cooler than it is for older people, Shrader and Wilson said.",
      "Some outside health and climate experts were initially puzzled at the higher youth mortality seen in the study. Co-author Patrick Kinney, a professor of urban health and sustainability at Boston University, said it was likely the study included a higher proportion of outdoor workers exposed to heat than prior studies did.",
      "Study co-author Tereza Cavazos, a climate scientist at the Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education in Mexico, said she remembers her father's generations taking siestas in the high heat of the day and that was healthy. That doesn't happen so much now, she said.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of population that is vulnerable in the future. Not even in the future, right now,\u201d Cavazos said. She mentioned three Mexican heat waves this year that hit in the middle of the country and kept the deadly heat going overnight so people had little relief. Usually cool nights allow a body to recover.",
      "Younger people often have a sense of invulnerability to weather extremes and do things that increase their risk, such as play sports in high heat, Cavazos said.",
      "\u201cHigh humidity makes it a lot harder for the body to cool itself through sweating \u2013 which is how our body primarily stays cool,\" said Dr. Renee Salas, an emergency medicine physician and climate change expert at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. She was not part of the study team. \"So someone young and healthy working outside in heat and high humidity can reach a point where the body can no longer cool itself safely \u2013 causing a deadly form of heat injury called heat stroke.\u201d",

      "BANGKOK -- China has banned exports of key materials used to make a wide range of products, including smartphones, electric vehicles, radar systems and CT scanners, swiping back at Washington after it expanded export controls to include dozens of Chinese companies that make equipment used to produce advanced computer chips.",
      "Both sides say their controls are justified by national security concerns and both accuse the other of \u201cweaponizing\u201d trade. Analysts say the latest restrictions could have a wide impact on manufacturing in many industries and supply chains.",
      "\u201cCritical mineral security is now intrinsically linked to the escalating tech trade war,\u201d Gracelin Baskaran and Meredith Schwartz of the Center for Strategic International Studies, wrote in a report on Beijing's decision.",
      "The full impact will depend partly on whether U.S. industries can compensate for any loss of access to the strategically important materials, equipment and components.",
      "Here\u2019s why this could be a tipping point in trade conflict between the two biggest economies, coming at a time when antagonisms already were expected to heat up once President-elect Donald Trump takes office, given his vows to hike tariffs on imports of Chinese-made products.",
      "China has banned, in principle, exports to the United States of gallium, germanium and antimony \u2014 critical minerals needed to make advanced semiconductors, among many other types of equipment. Beijing also tightened controls on exports of graphite, which is used in EV and grid-storage batteries. China is the largest source for most of these materials and also dominates refining of those materials, which are used both for consumer goods and for military purposes.",
      "The limits announced Tuesday also include exports of super-hard materials, such as diamonds and other synthetic materials that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective coatings.",
      "Next on the list of potential bans, experts say: tungsten, magnesium and aluminum alloys.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced its measures after the U.S. government ordered a slew of new measures meant to prevent sales to China of certain types of advanced semiconductors and the tools and software needed to make them. Washington also expanded its \u201centity list\u201d of companies facing strict export controls to include 140 more companies, nearly all of them based in China or Chinese-owned.",
      "Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the revised rules were intended to impair China\u2019s ability to use advanced technologies that \u201cpose a risk to our national security.\u201d The updated regulations also limit exports to China of high-bandwidth memory chips that are needed to process massive amounts of data in advanced applications such as artificial intelligence.",
      "Export licenses will likely be denied for any U.S. company trying to do business with the 140 companies newly added to the \u201centity list,\u201d as well as the dozens of others already on the list. The aim, officials said, is to stop Chinese companies from leveraging U.S. technology to make their own semiconductors.",
      "The Biden administration has been expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls while encouraging an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of semiconductors in the U.S. and other Western countries.",
      "Washington also extended the restrictions on exports of advanced semiconductor technology to companies in other countries, though it excluded companies in key allies like Japan, South Korea and the Netherlands that are thought to have adequate export controls of their own.",
      "In a word: very. For the U.S., Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and other producers of advanced technology and components, access to materials with such properties as high conductivity is crucial: gallium and germanium increasingly are used in advanced semiconductors in place of silicon.",
      "The materials subject to Chinese export controls are among 50 the United States Geologic Survey has designated as \u201ccritical minerals\u201d \u2014 non-fuel minerals essential to U.S. economic or national security that have supply chains vulnerable to disruption.",
      "Gallium topped that list. It is needed to make the same high-bandwidth memory chips the U.S. wants to avoid allowing China to access for use in artificial intelligence and defense applications. It's used to make LEDs, lasers and magnets used in many products. Germanium is used for optical fiber and solar panels, among other uses.",
      "A USGS study recently estimated the likely total cost to the U.S. economy from disruptions to supplies of gallium and germanium alone at more than $3 billion. But the situation is complicated. China imposed licensing requirements on exports of both metals in July 2023. It has not exported either to the U.S. this year, according to Chinese customs data. Antimony exports also have plunged.",
      "China produces the lion's share of most critical minerals, but there are alternatives. Japan also imports nearly all of its gallium, for example, but it also extracts it by recycling scrap metal.",
      "Washington has been moving to tap sources other than China, forming a \"Minerals Security Partnership\" with the EU and 15 other countries. President Joe Biden's visit to Africa this week highlighted that effort. Potential supply disruptions also have spurred efforts to tap U.S. deposits of rare earths and other critical materials in southeastern Wyoming, Montana, Nevada, Minnesota and parts of the American Southwest.",
      "Germanium has been extracted from zinc mined in Alaska and Tennessee and the U.S. government has a stockpile. The Department of Defense has a recycling program that can extract scrap germanium from night vision lenses and tank turret windows.",
      "But China's dominance as a supplier gives it an overwhelming cost advantage, and U.S. resource companies face strong pressures over the potential environmental impact of mines and refineries.",
      "Since then-President Trump launched a trade war against Beijing that has ramped up over time, China has adopted a relatively constrained and cautious approach in responding to the U.S. limits on access to advanced technology.",
      "Much depends on the future course of overall relations. It is unclear if Trump will follow through on his vows to push tariffs sharply higher once he takes office or if such declarations are the opening gambits in future trade negotiations.",
      "China hit back with its own tariff hikes, but excluded many items crucial for its own economy. It sanctioned certain companies, especially defense contractors doing business with Taiwan, but refrained from outright bans on exports of vital materials to the U.S.",
      "This time may be different.",
      "Just after China's Commerce Ministry announced its export ban, various Chinese industry associations including automakers and the China Semiconductor Association issued statements denouncing Washington's moves to curb access to strategically sensitive technologies and declaring that U.S. computer chips are unreliable.",
      "Beijing's announcement also extends its ban on exporting Chinese-produced gallium and other critical minerals to the U.S. to apply to all countries, entities and individuals, saying violators will \u201cbe held accountable according to law.\u201d",

    "summary": "Iran is poised to &ldquo;quite dramatically&rdquo; increase its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium",
    "story": [
      "Iran is poised to \u201cquite dramatically\u201d increase its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium",
      "MANAMA, Bahrain -- Iran is poised to \u201cquite dramatically\u201d increase its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium as it has started cascades of advanced centrifuges, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency warned Friday.",
      "The comments from Rafael Mariano Grossi came just hours after Iran said it conducted a successful space launch with its heaviest payload ever, the latest for its program that the West alleges improves Tehran\u2019s ballistic missile program.",
      "The launch of the Simorgh rocket comes as Iran\u2019s nuclear program now enriches uranium at 60%, a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels of 90%. While Iran maintains its program is peaceful, officials in the Islamic Republic increasingly threaten to potentially seek the bomb and an intercontinental ballistic missile that would allow Tehran to use the weapon against distant foes like the United States.",
      "The moves are likely to further raise tensions gripping the wider Middle East over Israel\u2019s continued war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip and as an uneasy ceasefire holds in Lebanon. However, Iran may as well be preparing the ground for possible talks with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump, who in his first term unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers.",
      "The U.S. intelligence community in a report released Thursday said that while \u201cIran is not building a nuclear weapon\u201d it has \u201cundertaken activities that better position it to produce one, if it so chooses.\u201d",
      "The Iranian debate over seeking the bomb \u201crisks emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran\u2019s decision-making apparatus and shifting the thinking of current and future Iranian elites about the utility of nuclear weapons,\u201d the report added.",
      "Grossi, speaking to journalists in Bahrain, on the sidelines of the International Institute of Strategic Studies\u2019 Manama Dialogue, said his inspectors planned to see just how many centrifuges Iran would be spinning after Tehran informed his agency of its plans.",
      "\u201cI think it is very concerning,\u201d Grossi said. \u201cThey were preparing and they have all of these facilities sort of in abeyance and now they are activating that. So we are going to see.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cIf they really make them turn \u2014 all of them \u2014 it's going to be a huge jump.\u201d",
      "An IAEA statement issued shortly after Grossi's remarks said Iran had begun feeding two cascades of advanced IR-6 centrifuges with uranium previously enriched up to 20% at its underground Fordo facility. That site is located under a mountain, protecting it from airstrikes.",
      "Cascades are a group of centrifuges that spin uranium gas together to more quickly enrich the uranium. The IR-6 centrifuges enrich uranium faster than Iran\u2019s baseline IR-1 centrifuges, which have been the workhorse of the country\u2019s atomic program. Adding 20% uranium, as opposed to 5% uranium previously planned, further speeds up that process.",
      "\u201cThe facility\u2019s updated design information showed that the effect of this change would be to significantly increase the rate of production,\u201d the IAEA statement said. Iran separately will start feeding natural uranium into eight other IR-6 cascades at Fordo as well to produce 5%-enriched uranium, it added.",
      "The IAEA warned in late November that Iran was preparing to begin enriching uranium with thousands of advanced centrifuges. That came as a response to the Board of Governors at the IAEA condemning Iran for failing to cooperate fully with the agency.",
      "Iran did not acknowledge the preparations. The Iranian mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Meanwhile, the launch Friday took place at Iran\u2019s Imam Khomeini Spaceport in rural Semnan province, some 220 kilometers (135 miles) east of Tehran. That\u2019s the site of Iran\u2019s civilian space program, which has suffered a series of failed Simorgh launches in the past.",
      "The Simorgh carried what Iran described as an \u201corbital propulsion system,\u201d as well as two research systems to a 400-kilometer (250-mile) orbit above the Earth. A system that could change the orbit of a spacecraft would allow Iran to geo-synchronize the orbits of its satellites, a capability Tehran has long sought.",
      "It also carried the Fakhr-1 satellite for Iran\u2019s military, the first time Iran\u2019s civilian program is known to have carried a military payload.",
      "Iran also put the payload of the Simorgh at 300 kilograms (660 pounds), heavier than all its previous successful launches within the country. State television carried footage of a correspondent discussing the payload just as the Simorgh lifted off into the sky, as people called out: \u201cGod is the greatest!\u201d",
      "The U.S. military referred questions about the launch to the country\u2019s Space Command, which did not respond. Space experts said tracking data appeared to show the launch successfully put objects in orbit.",
      "The United States has previously said Iran\u2019s satellite launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution and called on Tehran to undertake no activity involving ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. U.N. sanctions related to Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program expired in October 2023.",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s work on space-launch vehicles \u2014 including its Simorgh \u2014 probably would shorten the timeline to produce an intercontinental ballistic missile, if it decided to develop one, because the systems use similar technologies,\u201d a U.S. intelligence community report released in July said.",
      "Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons and says its space program, like its nuclear activities, is for purely civilian purposes. However, U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003.",
      "Under Iran\u2019s relatively moderate former President Hassan Rouhani, the Islamic Republic slowed its space program for fear of raising tensions with the West. The late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who came to power in 2021, pushed the program forward. Raisi died in a helicopter crash in May.",
      "Iran\u2019s reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, who has been signaling he wants to negotiate with the West over sanctions, has yet to offer a strategy when it comes to Iran\u2019s ambitions in space. The Simorgh launch represented the first for his administration from the country\u2019s civil space program. Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard conducted a successful launch of its parallel program in September.",

      "In an era when online anger and social tensions are increasingly directed at the businesses consumers count on, Meta last year spent $24.4 million on guards, alarms and other measures to keep Zuckerberg and the company\u2019s former chief operating officer safe.",
      "Some high-profile CEOs surround themselves with security. But the fatal shooting this week of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson while he walked alone on a New York City sidewalk has put a spotlight on the widely varied approaches companies take in protecting their leaders against threats.",
      "Thompson had no personal security and appeared unaware of the shooter lurking before he was gunned down.",
      "And today\u2019s political, economic and technological climate is only going to make the job of evaluating threats against executives and taking action to protect them even more difficult, experts say.",
      "\u201cWe are better today at collecting signals. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re any better at making sense of the signals we collect,\u201d says Fred Burton of Ontic, a provider of threat management software for companies.",
      "After Thompson's shooting, Burton said, \u201cI\u2019ve been on the phone all day with some organizations asking for consultation, saying, \u2019Am I doing enough?\u201d",
      "Since the killing, some health insurers have taken steps to safeguard their executives and rank-and-file workers.",
      "Medica, a Minnesota-based nonprofit health care firm, said Friday it is temporarily closing its six offices for security reasons and will have its employees work from home.",
      "\u201cAlthough we have received no specific threats related to our campuses, our office buildings will be temporarily closed out of an abundance of caution,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "A Medica spokesman said the company had also removed biographical information about its executives from its website as a precaution.",
      "UnitedHealth Group, parent of the insurer Thompson led, removed photos of its top executives from its website hours after the shooting, later removing their names and biographies.",
      "But well before the attack, some of the biggest U.S. companies, particularly those in the tech sector, were spending heavily on personal and residential security for their top executives.",
      "Meta, whose businesses include Facebook and Instagram, reported the highest spending on personal security for top executives last year, filings culled by research firm Equilar show.",
      "Zuckerberg \u201cis synonymous with Meta and, as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,\u201d the Menlo Park, California, company explained earlier this year in an annual shareholder disclosure.",
      "At Apple, the world\u2019s largest tech company by stock valuation, CEO Tim Cook was tormented by a stalker  who sent him sexually provocative emails and even showed up outside his Silicon Valley home at one point before the company\u2019s security team successfully took legal action against her in 2022.",
      "Cook is regularly accompanied by security personnel when he appears in public. Still, the company\u2019s $820,000 allotted last year to protect top executives is a fraction of what other tech giants spent for CEO security.",
      "Just over a quarter of the companies in the Fortune 500 reported spending money to protect their CEOs and other top executives. Of those that did, the median payment for personal security doubled over the last three years to about $98,000.",
      "In many companies, investor meetings like the one UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Thompson was walking to when he was shot are viewed as very risky because details on the location and who will be speaking are highly publicized.",
      "\u201cIt gives people an opportunity to arrive well in advance and take a look at the room, take a look at how people would probably come and go out of a location,\u201d said Dave Komendat, president of DSKomendat Risk Management Services, which is based in the greater Seattle area.",
      "Some firms respond by beefing up security. For example, tech companies routinely require everyone attending a major event, such as Apple\u2019s annual unveiling of the next iPhone or a shareholder meeting, to go through airport-style security checkpoints before entering.",
      "Others forgo in-person meetings with shareholders. Government health insurance provider Centene Corp. joined that group Thursday, citing the UnitedHealthcare executive's death in announcing that its upcoming Investor Day will be held online, rather than in-person as originally planned.",
      "\u201cBut there are also company cultures that really frown on that and want their leaders to be accessible to people, accessible to shareholders, employees,\u201d Komendat said.",
      "Depending on the company, such an approach may make sense. Many top executives are little known to the public, operating in industries and locations that make them far less prone to public exposure and to threats.",
      "\u201cDetermining the need for and appropriate level of an executive-level protection program is specific to each organization,\u201d says David Johnston, vice president of asset protection and retail operations at the National Retail Federation. \u201cThese safeguards should also include the constant monitoring of potential threats and the ability to adapt to maintain the appropriate level of security and safety.\u201d",
      "Some organizations have a protective intelligence group that uses digital tools such as machine learning or artificial intelligence to comb through online comments to detect threats not only on social media platforms such as X but also on the dark web, says Komendat. They look for what\u2019s being said about the company, its employees and its leadership to uncover risks.",
      "\u201cThere are always threats directed towards senior leaders at companies. Many of them are not credible,\u201d Komendat said. \u201cThe question always is trying to determine what is a real threat versus what is someone just venting with no intent to take any additional action.\u201d",
      "Burton, a former special agent with the U.S. Diplomatic Security Service, points out that despite the current climate, there is little in the way of organized groups that target companies.",
      "Today, one of the primary worries are loners whose rantings online are fed by others who are like-minded. It\u2019s up to corporate security analysts to zero in on such dialogue and decide whether or not it represents a real threat.",
      "And CEOs aren\u2019t the only targets of disgruntled customers. In the U.S., there were 525 workplace fatalities due to assault in 2022, according to the National Safety Council. Industries including healthcare, education and service providers are more prone to violence than others, and taxi drivers are more than 20 times more likely to be murdered on the job than other workers, the group said.",
      "But the ambush of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Thompson this week is bound to get some CEOs second-guessing.",
      "\u201cWhat invariably happen at moments like this in time is you will get additional ears listening\u201d to security professionals seeking money to beef up executive protection, Burton says.",
      "\u201cBecause I can guarantee you there\u2019s not a CEO in America who\u2019s not aware of this incident.\u201d",

      "TikTok's future in the U.S. appeared uncertain on Friday after a federal appeals court rejected a legal challenge to a law that requires the social media platform to cut ties with its China-based parent company or be banned by mid-January.",
      "A panel of three judges on The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled unanimously that the law withstood constitutional scrutiny, rebuffing arguments from the two companies that the statute violated their rights and the rights of TikTok users in the U.S.",
      "The government has said it wants ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, to divest its stakes. But if it doesn't and the platform goes away, it would have a seismic impact on the lives of content creators who rely on the platform for income as well as users who use it for entertainment and connection.",
      "Here are some details on the ruling and what could happen next:",
      "In their lawsuit, TikTok and ByteDance, which is also a plaintiff in the case, had challenged the law on various fronts, arguing in part that the statute ran afoul of the First Amendment and was an unconstitutional bill of attainder that unfairly targeted the two companies.",
      "But the court sided with attorneys for the Justice Department who said that the government was attempting to address national security concerns and the way in which it chose to do so did not violate the constitution.",
      "The Justice Department has argued in court that TikTok poses a national security risk due to its connections to China. Officials say that Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread, or suppress, information. However, the U.S. hasn't publicly provided examples of that happening.",
      "The appeals court ruling, written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg, said the law was \u201ccarefully crafted to deal only with control by a foreign adversary.\" The judges also rejected the claim that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Furthermore, Ginsburg wrote the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to \u201csuppress content or require a certain mix of content\u201d on TikTok.",
      "TikTok and ByteDance are expected to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, but it's unclear whether the court will take up the case.",
      "TikTok indicated in a statement on Friday the two companies are preparing to take their case to high court, saying the Supreme Court has \u201can established historical record of protecting Americans\u2019 right to free speech.\"",
      "\"We expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\u201d a company spokesperson said.",
      "Alan Morrison, a professor at The George Washington University Law School, said he expects the Supreme Court to take up the case because of the novelty of the issues raised in the lawsuit. If that happens, attorneys for the two companies still have to convince the court to grant them an emergency stay that will prevent the government from enforcing the Jan. 19 divestiture deadline stipulated in the law, Morrison said.",
      "Such a move could drag out the process until the Justices make a ruling.",
      "Tiffany Cianci, a TikTok content creator who has supported the platform, said she was not shocked about the outcome of the court's ruling on Friday because lower courts typically defer to the executive branch on these types of cases. She believes the company will have a stronger case at the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cI believe that the next stages are more likely to produce a victory for TikTokers and for TikTok as a whole,\u201d Cianci said.",
      "Another wild card is President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the recent presidential campaign that he is now against such action.",
      "The Trump transition team has not offered details on how Trump plans to carry out his pledge to \u201csave TikTok.\" But spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement last month that he plans to \u201cdeliver\u201d on his campaign promises.",
      "After Trump takes office on Jan. 20th, it would fall on his Justice Department to enforce the law and punish any potential violators. Penalties would apply to any app stores that would violate a prohibition on TikTok and to internet hosting services which would be barred from supporting it.",
      "Some have speculated that Trump could ask his Justice Department to abstain from enforcing the law. But tech companies like Apple and Google, which offer TikTok's app on their app stores, would then have to trust that the administration would not come after them for any violations.",
      "Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said enforcement discretion \u2014 or executive orders \u2014 can not override existing law, leaving Trump with \u201climited room for unilateral action.\"",
      "There are other things Trump could potentially do. It's possible he could invoke provisions of the law that allow the president to determine whether a sale or a similar transaction frees TikTok from \u201cforeign adversary\u201d control. Another option is to urge Congress to repeal the law. But that too would require support from congressional Republicans who have overwhelmingly supported the prospect of getting TikTok out of the hands of a Chinese company.",
      "In a statement issued Friday, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, said he was \u201coptimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok\u201d and allow its continued use in the United States.",
      "ByteDance has said it won't sell TikTok. And even if it wanted to, a sale of the proprietary algorithm that powers TikTok is likely to get blocked under Chinese export controls that the country issued in 2020.",
      "That means if TikTok is sold without the algorithm, its likely that the buyer would only purchase a shell of the platform that doesn't contain the technology that made the app a cultural powerhouse.",
      "Still, some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in buying it.",
      "This week, a spokesperson for McCourt\u2019s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital. The spokesperson did not disclose the identity of the participants."

      "A federal appeals court panel on Friday unanimously upheld a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok as soon as next month, handing a resounding defeat to the popular social media platform as it fights for its survival in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied TikTok's petition to overturn the law \u2014 which requires TikTok to break ties with its China-based parent company ByteDance or be banned by mid-January \u2014 and rebuffed the company's challenge of the statute, which it argued had ran afoul of the First Amendment.",
      "\u201cThe First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\u201d said the court's opinion, which was written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg. \u201cHere the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary\u2019s ability to gather data on people in the United States.\u201d",
      "TikTok and ByteDance \u2014 another plaintiff in the lawsuit \u2014 are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, though its unclear whether the court will take up the case.",
      "\u201cThe Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said in a statement.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the TikTok ban was conceived and pushed through based upon inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people,\u201d Hughes said. Unless stopped, he argued the statute \u201cwill silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in the US and around the world on January 19th, 2025.\u201d",
      "Though the case is squarely in the court system, it's also possible the two companies might be thrown some sort of a lifeline by President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the presidential campaign that he is now against such action.",
      "\u201cHe wants to save TikTok,\u201d Rep. Michael Waltz, Trump's pick for national security adviser, said Friday during an interview on Fox Business.",
      "The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April, was the culmination of a yearslong saga in Washington over the short-form video-sharing app, which the government sees as a national security threat due to its connections to China.",
      "The U.S. has said it\u2019s concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that\u2019s difficult to detect. The European Union on Friday expressed similar concerns as it investigates intelligence that suggests Russia possibly abused the platform to influence the elections in Romania.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Friday.",
      "TikTok, which sued the government over the law in May, has long denied it could be used by Beijing to spy on or manipulate Americans. Its attorneys have accurately pointed out that the U.S. hasn\u2019t provided evidence to show that the company handed over user data to the Chinese government, or manipulated content for Beijing\u2019s benefit in the U.S. They have also argued the law is predicated on future risks, which the Department of Justice has emphasized pointing in part to unspecified action it claims the two companies have taken in the past due to demands from the Chinese government.",
      "Friday\u2019s ruling came after the appeals court panel, composed of two Republicans and one Democrat appointed judges, heard oral arguments in September.",
      "In the hearing, which lasted more than two hours, the panel appeared to grapple with how TikTok\u2019s foreign ownership affects its rights under the Constitution and how far the government could go to curtail potential influence from abroad on a foreign-owned platform. On Friday, all three denied TikTok\u2019s petition.",
      "In the court's ruling, Ginsburg, a Republican appointee, rejected TikTok's main legal arguments against the law, including that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder, or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. He also said the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to \"suppress content or require a certain mix of content\u201d on TikTok.",
      "\u201cContent on the platform could in principle remain unchanged after divestiture, and people in the United States would remain free to read and share as much PRC propaganda (or any other content) as they desire on TikTok or any other platform of their choosing,\u201d Ginsburg wrote, using the abbreviation for the People\u2019s Republic of China.",
      "Judge Sri Srinivasan, the chief judge on the court, issued a concurring opinion.",
      "TikTok\u2019s lawsuit was consolidated with a second legal challenge brought by several content creators \u2014 for which the company is covering legal costs \u2014 as well as a third one filed on behalf of conservative creators who work with a nonprofit called BASED Politics Inc. Other organizations, including the Knight First Amendment Institute, had also filed amicus briefs supporting TikTok.",
      "\u201cThis is a deeply misguided ruling that reads important First Amendment precedents too narrowly and gives the government sweeping power to restrict Americans\u2019 access to information, ideas, and media from abroad,\u201d said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the organization. \u201cWe hope that the appeals court\u2019s ruling won\u2019t be the last word.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, lawmakers who had pushed for the legislation celebrated the court's ruling.",
      "\"I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,\u201d said Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China.",
      "Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who co-authored the law, said \u201cit's time for ByteDance to accept\u201d the law.",
      "To assuage concerns about the company\u2019s owners, TikTok says it has invested more than $2 billion to bolster protections around U.S. user data.",
      "The company has also argued the government\u2019s broader concerns could have been resolved in a draft agreement it provided the Biden administration more than two years ago during talks between the two sides. It has blamed the government for walking away from further negotiations on the agreement, which the Justice Department argues is insufficient.",
      "Attorneys for the two companies have claimed it\u2019s impossible to divest the platform commercially and technologically. They also say any sale of TikTok without the coveted algorithm \u2014 the platform\u2019s secret sauce that Chinese authorities would likely block under any divesture plan \u2014 would turn the U.S. version of TikTok into an island disconnected from other global content.",
      "Still, some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in purchasing the platform. Both men said earlier this year that they were launching a consortium to purchase TikTok\u2019s U.S. business.",
      "This week, a spokesperson for McCourt\u2019s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said unnamed participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital."

      "Democrats in Michigan are pressing to pass reproductive health care legislation before the party loses its majority with the new legislative session next year",
      "LANSING, Mich. -- Michigan Democrats are pushing this month to pass legislation they say will improve reproductive health care, in particular the safety of digital health data, ahead of Republicans taking over the state House in 2025.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is backing a bill designed to protect reproductive health data including data logged on menstrual cycle tracking apps. Similar legislation that has passed in other states is aimed at keeping the data from being used to target people seeking abortions.",
      "\u201cThis feels like a very urgent need for us to get this done while we have a window in Michigan with the Democratic majority for the next few weeks,\u201d said state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, sponsor of the digital privacy bill.",
      "The rush is a reaction to expectations that it will be harder to pass the reproductive health care policies Democrats favor after Republicans take control of the state House in January. Democrats kept control of the state Senate in the November election.",
      "Republicans have opposed the digital privacy bill over a section they say will stifle anti-abortion advertising.",
      "Other reproductive health bills to be considered during the December session that began Tuesday include a package on Black maternal health and an expansion of access to birth control.",
      "After the overturn of Roe v. Wade, some women in states with strict abortion bans began to worry that their health information could be used to track their reproductive status. Apps that track menstrual cycles became a major focus point.",
      "Abortion is constitutionally protected in Michigan. But McMorrow does not trust President-elect Donald Trump's campaign promise to veto any possible national abortion ban nor his campaign's efforts to distance itself from Project 2025, which proposed a rollback on abortion and contraception access.",
      "Period tracking apps allow women to take detailed day-by-day notes about their health, from how heavy their period flow is to additional symptoms such as cramping. They can log pregnancies and miscarriages.",
      "\u201cThese tools are really valuable,\u201d McMorrow said. \u201cI just want to make sure that the guardrails are there when indications from the incoming federal administration is they would potentially weaponize the data in a way that is very dangerous.\u201d",
      "Federal law bars medical providers from sharing health data without a patient\u2019s consent but doesn\u2019t prevent digital tech companies from tracking menstrual cycles or an individual\u2019s location and selling it to data brokers. Legislation for federal bans have never gained momentum, largely because of opposition from the tech industry.",
      "How the legislation works varies from state to state. Washington state has digital privacy law that broadly covers all health-related data while Virginia has a law that explicitly prohibits the issuance of search warrants, subpoenas or court orders for electronic or digital menstrual health data.",
      "Michigan\u2019s proposal would require businesses or organizations to use reproductive health data only for the services it provides, and consumers must be informed of how the data is being used. In order to sell that data, an entity would need explicit, signed consent from the consumer. Consumers would also have the option to opt out from their data being sold at any time.",
      "It would also regulate retailers, who often compile data to target consumers with advertisements, and the use of geofencing, which allows marketers to target consumers with ads based on their location.",
      "The bill would prohibit identifying who is receiving reproductive health care by using location information and targeting them with advertisements. This would apply to people visiting fertility or abortion clinics.",
      "The geofencing provision of the bill has drawn objection from anti-abortion advocates. Genevieve Marnon, legislative director for Right to Life of Michigan, said in committee testimony Tuesday that the bill would prevent women visiting an abortion clinic from being reached by anti-abortion ads.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t safeguarding women\u2019s reproductive health data,\" she said. \u201cIt is limiting the options presented to women.\u201d",
      "Republican Sen. John Damoose, who voted against the bill in committee, believes the geofencing provision encroaches on freedom of speech and religion by preventing anti-abortion advertising.",
      "The bill was voted out of committee Tuesday on party lines and advanced Thursday toward a final vote in the Senate chamber.",
      "Kimya Forouzan, principal state policy director at the Guttmacher Institute, expects the topic to be taken up by other state legislatures next year. Guttmacher, which supports abortion rights, tracks reproductive health trends.",
      "Over the past two years, Michigan Democrats have passed bills repealing a number of anti-abortion laws, including the state\u2019s 1931 ban, and adding surrogacy protections to state law. Lawmakers are considering a number of others related to reproductive health this month.",
      "A group of bills focused on improving maternal health for Black women would create a doula scholarship, among other measures. The Senate voted its package on the topic through to the House on Tuesday.",
      "Rep. Jaime Churches, a Democrat from the downriver area of Detroit who lost her seat in November, is trying to gain traction for two bills that would require insurance to cover fertility treatments, including in vitro fertilization and intrauterine insemination.",
      "Three bills seeking to expand access to birth control through insurance have passed the state House. McMorrow also introduced a series of bills aimed at providing long-lasting reversible contraception, such an implants or intrauterine devices, to patients who have given birth before they are discharged from a hospital.",
      "There is competition among Democrats for time during this short, lame duck session. Advocates for economic development, infrastructure and gun control measures are among the many looking to push through bills in the month that is left. Major contention over new paid sick leave and minimum wage requirements is likely to garner attention. Those discussions could reduce the amount of time available to debate reproductive health measures.",

      "\u201cHe believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The commission oversees U.S. securities markets and investments and is currently led by Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government\u2019s crackdown on the crypto industry. Gensler, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, announced last month that he would be stepping down from his post on the day that Trump is inaugurated \u2014 Jan. 20, 2025.",
      "Trump, once a crypto skeptic, had pledged to make the U.S. \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. Money has poured into crypto assets since he won. The value of bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, passed $100,000 Wednesday. And shares in crypto platform Coinbase have surged more than 70% since the election.",
      "Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of Coinbase, congratulated Atkins in a post on X.",
      "\u201cWe appreciate his commitment to balance in regulating U.S. securities markets and look forward to his fresh leadership at (the SEC),\u201d Grewal wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s sorely needed and cannot come a day too soon.\u201d",
      "Congressman Brad Sherman, a California Democrat and a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, said he worries Atkins would not sufficiently regulate cryptocurrencies as SEC chair.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019d probably take the position that no cryptocurrency is a security, and hence no exchange that deals with crypto is a securities exchange,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cThe opportunity to defraud investors would be there in a very significant way.\u201d",
      "Atkins began his career as a lawyer and has a long history working in the financial markets sector, both in government and private practice. In the 1990s, he worked on the staffs of two former SEC chairmen, Richard C. Breeden and Arthur Levitt.",
      "His work as an SEC commissioner started in 2002, a time when the fallout from corporate scandals at Enron and WorldCom had turned up the heat on Wall Street and its government regulators.",
      "Atkins was widely considered the most conservative member of the SEC during his tenure at the agency and known to have a strong free-market bent. As a commissioner, he called for greater transparency in and analysis of the costs and benefits of new SEC rules.",
      "He also emphasized investor education and increased enforcement efforts against those who steal from investors over the internet, manipulate markets, engage in Ponzi schemes and other types of fraud.",
      "At the same time, Atkins objected to stiff penalties imposed on companies accused of fraudulent conduct, contending that they did not deter crime. He caused a stir in the summer of 2006 when he said the practice of granting stock options to executives before the disclosure of news that was certain to increase the share price did not constitute insider trading.",
      "U.S. Rep. Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said Atkins has the experience needed to \u201crestore faith in the SEC.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m confident his leadership will lead to clarity for the digital asset ecosystem and ensure U.S. capital markets remain the envy of the world,\u201d McHenry posted on X.",
      "Atkins already has some experience working for Trump. During Trump's first term, Atkins was a member of the President\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum, an advisory group of more than a dozen CEOs and business leaders who offered input on how to create jobs and speed economic growth.",
      "In 2017, Atkins joined the Token Alliance, a cryptocurrency advocacy organization.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump\u2019s victory in the hopes that he would push through legislative and regulatory changes that they\u2019ve long lobbied for.",
      "Trump himself has launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies."

      "Bitcoin has topped the $100,000 mark, extending a rally in the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency sparked by the election of Donald Trump",
      "NEW YORK -- Bitcoin topped $100,000 for the first time this week as a massive rally in the world's most popular cryptocurrency, largely accelerated by the election of Donald Trump, rolls on.",
      "The cryptocurrency officially to rose six figures Wednesday night, just hours after the president-elect said he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to be the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Bitcoin has soared since Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5. The asset climbed from $69,374 on Election Day, hitting as high as $103,713 Wednesday, according to CoinDesk. And the latest all-time high arrives just two years after bitcoin dropped below $17,000 following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.",
      "Bitcoin fell back below the $100,000 by Thursday afternoon, sitting above $99,000 by 4 p.m. ET. Even amid a massive rally that has more than doubled the value of bitcoin this year, some experts continue to warn of investment risks around the asset, which has quite a volatile history.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now. But chances are you\u2019ve heard about it more and more over the last few years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it\u2019s typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like ethereum, XRP, tether and dogecoin have also gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \u201cdigital alternative\u201d to traditional money, but most daily financial transactions are still conducted using fiat currencies such as the dollar. Also, bitcoin can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.",
      "Trump, who was once a crypto skeptic, has pledged to make the U.S. \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "On Thursday morning, hours after bitcoin surpassed the $100,000 mark, Trump congratulated \u201cBITCOINERS\u201d on his social media platform Truth Social. He also appeared to take credit for the recent rally, writing, \u201cYOU\u2019RE WELCOME!!!\u201d",
      "Top crypto players welcomed Trump\u2019s election victory last month, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they\u2019ve long lobbied for \u2014 which, generally speaking, aim for an increased sense of legitimacy without too much red tape. And the industry has made sizeable investments along the way. Back in August, Public Citizen, a left-leaning consumer rights advocacy nonprofit, reported finding that crypto-sector corporations spent more than $119 million in 2024 to back pro-crypto candidates across federal elections.",
      "Trump made his latest pro-crypto move when he announced his plans Wednesday to nominate Atkins to chair the SEC. Atkins was an SEC commissioner during the presidency of George W. Bush. In the years since leaving the agency, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation. He joined the Token Alliance, a cryptocurrency advocacy organization, in 2017.",
      "Under current chair Gary Gensler, who will step down when Trump takes office, the SEC has cracked down on the crypto industry \u2014 penalizing a number of companies for violating securities laws. Gensler has also faced ample criticism from industry players in the process.",
      "One crypto-friendly move the SEC did make under Gensler was the approval in January of spot bitcoin ETFs, or exchange trade funds, which allow investors to have a stake in bitcoin without directly buying it. The spot ETFs were the dominant driver of bitcoin's price before Trump's win \u2014 but, like much of the crypto\u2019s recent momentum, saw record inflows postelection.",
      "Bitcoin surpassing the coveted $100,000 mark has left much of the crypto world buzzing.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing isn\u2019t just a rally \u2014 it\u2019s a fundamental transformation of bitcoin\u2019s place in the financial system,\u201d Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder of crypto custodian Anchorage Digital, said in a statement \u2014 while pointing to the growth of who's entering the market, particularly with rising institutional adoption.",
      "Still, others note that the new heights of bitcoin's price don't necessarily mean the asset is going mainstream. The $100,000 level is \u201cmerely a psychological factor and ultimately just a number,\u201d Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at British investment company AJ Bell, wrote in a Thursday commentary.",
      "That being said, bitcoin could keep climbing to more and more all-time highs, particularly if Trump makes good on his promises for more crypto-friendly regulation once in office. If Trump actually makes a bitcoin reserve, for example, supply changes could also propel the price forward.",
      "\u201cIt is hard to overstate the magnitude of the change in Washington\u2019s attitude towards crypto post-election,\u201d Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, said via email Thursday, reiterating that prices could keep rising if trends persist. \u201cThere is a lot more demand than there is supply, and that\u2019s usually a pretty good recipe for success.\u201d",
      "Still, as with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is never promised. Worldwide regulatory uncertainties and environmental concerns around bitcoin \u201cmining\" \u2014 the creation of new bitcoin, which consumes a lot of energy \u2014 are among factors that analysts like Coatsworth note could hamper future growth. And, as still a relatively young asset with a history of volatility, longer-term adoption has yet to be seen through.",
      "Today\u2019s excitement around bitcoin may make many who aren\u2019t already in the space want to get in on the action. For those in a position to invest, Hougan says it's not too late \u2014 noting that bitcoin is still early in its development and most institutional investors \u201cstill have zero exposure.\u201d",
      "At the same time, Hougan and others maintain that it's important to tread cautiously and not bite off more than you can chew. Experts continue to stress caution around getting carried away with crypto \u201cFOMO,\u201d or the fear of missing out, especially for small-pocketed investors.",
      "\u201cA lot of people have got rich from the cryptocurrency soaring in value this year, but this high-risk asset isn\u2019t suitable for everyone,\u201d Coatsworth noted Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s volatile, unpredictable and is driven by speculation, none of which makes for a sleep-at-night investment.\u201d",
      "In short, history shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you\u2019ve made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.",
      "Coatsworth points to recent research from the Bank for International Settlements, a Switzerland-based global organization of central banks, which found that about three-quarters of retail buyers on crypto exchange apps likely lost money on their bitcoin investments between 2015 and 2022.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, during high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. And the late-2022 collapse of FTX significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall, with bitcoin falling below $17,000.",
      "Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs, and again, now the post-election frenzy. But lighter regulation from the coming Trump administration could also mean less guardrails.",

      "Waymo is gearing up to bring its robotaxi service to Miami which will accelerate an expansion that's been happening while its hobbled rivals remain in its rearview mirror.",
      "As part of the road map unfurled Thursday, Waymo plans to begin testing its driverless Jaguars in Miami next year, giving the robotaxis time to learn their way around Florida's biggest city before they start charging for rides in 2026. The move comes less than a month after Waymo opened up its robotaxi service to anyone looking for a ride in an 80-square-mile (129-square-kilometer) expanse in Los Angeles, extending its reach beyond its two major markets in Phoenix and San Francisco.",
      "Waymo also has plans to launch fleets in Atlanta and Austin next year as part of a partnership with the ride-hailing leader Uber.",
      "The growth spurred Waymo to team up with fleet management service Moove to oversee maintenance of its robotaxis in Phoenix, where it now operates about 200 vehicles. Moove also will help manage the company's robotaxis in Miami.",
      "The steady expansion into new markets is starting to fulfill what once seemed like a fantastical dream when Google began a secret self-driving car project dubbed \"Chauffeur\u201d in 2009 that ultimately spun off as Waymo in 2016.",
      "Although Waymo is still piling up substantial losses under its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., the service now provides more than 150,000 weekly trips without any history of catastrophic traffic accidents. That track record has increased confidence that Waymo will be able to continue to steer its robotaxis into more markets and eventually produce a steady stream of profits \u2014 an expectation that helped it recently raise $5.6 billion from Alphabet and a list of other major investors.",
      "Meanwhile, robotaxi rival Cruise is still trying to recover from a grisly accident last year that culminated in one of its driverless cars in San Francisco dragging a jaywalking pedestrian who had been struck by a different car driven by a human. California regulators suspended Cruise's license in the aftermath and its once-ambitious expansion plans have been scaled back by its corporate parent, automaker General Motors.",
      "Having periodically promised a fleet of Tesla robotaxis for nearly a decade, Tesla CEO Elon Musk renewed the pledge again in October when he predicted the electric carmaker's \"Cybercabs\" will be on U.S. roads in 2026."

      "The global phenomenon that is Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour is coming to an end after the popstar performed more than 150 shows across five continents over nearly two years",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- After more than 150 shows across five continents over nearly two years, the global phenomenon that is Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour is coming to an end.",
      "There is no simple way to encapsulate the effects of Swift\u2019s decision to put on a 3 \u00bd-hour concert, showcasing 44 songs representing 10 different \u201ceras\u201d of her career \u2014 a feat she kicked off in March 2023 and will end Sunday in Vancouver, Canada. The tour shattered sales and attendance records and created such an economic boom that even the Federal Reserve took note.",
      "But for many who attended the concerts, and the millions more who eagerly watched fan-broadcasted livestreams on their screens, the tour also became a beacon of joy \u2014 a chance not only to appreciate Swift's expansive music career, but also celebrate the yearslong journey fans have taken with her.",
      "\u201cRight now we have this special designated time to be together, talk about the show and hang out,\u201d said Tess Bohne, a stay-at-home mom of three turned content creator dedicated to livestreaming Swift\u2019s concerts \u2014 by attending herself or coordinating with others to highlight their streams. \u201cFor some, it\u2019s their therapy.\u201d",
      "Bohne, who has earned the title among the Swiftie community as the \u201clivestream queen,\u201d says she often interacts with fans hosting parties to watch an Eras concert live at home with their closest friends. People have also made lasting friendships as they geek out together watching the show from afar.",
      "Swift has long been known for leaving Easter eggs for her fans to pinpoint and decipher, a quirk that quickly took on a life of its own during the tour as eagle-eyed devotees began analyzing the possible meaning of her outfits, surprise songs and subtle lyric swaps. The buzz has been so large that multiple mobile apps were launched so fans could guess and track all the various changes. There\u2019s even a game that gives out prizes for correctly predicting various particulars of a show, including what color guitar Swift uses while playing \u201cLover.\u201d",
      "\u201cImagine your favorite sports team,\u201d Bohne said. \u201cThey\u2019re still a team, but they\u2019re not going to play any games for the foreseeable future. That\u2019s going to leave a hole for some folks.\u201d",
      "Swift herself appeared to struggle that the end was near while performing at her 100th Eras show in June at Liverpool.",
      "\u201cThis is the very first time I\u2019ve ever acknowledged to myself and admitted that this tour is gonna end in December,\u201d she said, stressing that \u201cthis tour has really become my entire life.\u201d Late last month, in Toronto, she briefly broke down at the thought of the tour's impending end.",
      "Swift kicked off the Eras tour in Glendale, Arizona, the first of many sold-out stadiums as the tour progressed first in the U.S. and later into South America, Asia, the United Kingdom and Canada.",
      "By the end of 2023, it had become the first tour to ever gross over $1 billion and saw hundreds of millions of dollars spent on merchandise. She is likely to bring in over $2 billion by the time the tour wraps on Dec. 8, according to concert trade publication Pollstar.",
      "Throughout the tour, Swift was named Time Magazine\u2019s Person of the Year. Apple Music named her its artist of the year and Spotify revealed she was 2023\u2019s most streamed artist globally. She dropped a box office-topping concert film and helped send NFL viewership skyrocketing when she began dating Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Toward the end of the tour, she released a coffee table book.",
      "And if that wasn\u2019t enough, she released re-recordings of her Nashville-era 2010 record, \u201cSpeak Now \u201d and 2014's record \u201c1989,\u201d as well as released her 11th studio album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s perfect in these times to have somebody like Taylor to kind of give us distraction, give us inspiration, give us hope,\u201d said Ralph Jaccodine, an assistant professor at Berklee College of Music and a former concert promoter who has worked with Bruce Springsteen and others. \u201cAnd this is a woman that owning it, she\u2019s come a long way. And now she can talk about artist rights and women\u2019s rights and equality. And really, just her work ethic is relentless.\"",
      "Even the word \u201cera\u201d has become ubiquitous, with fans and casual observers using the term to explain both frivolous and transformative phases \u2014 are you in your \u201cvillain era\u201d or a \u201chealing era\u201d?",
      "\u201cI think this tour really solidified her position as a legend,\u201d said Kayla Wong, an influencer who runs the popular Swift-focused Instagram account @headfirstfearless. \u201cWhether or not you like her music, whether or not you think she\u2019s talented, the numbers really speak for themselves. The tour broke so many records and was such a global phenomenon for so long that I think she\u2019s achieved a level where it\u2019s undeniable as to how everlasting her impact is.\u201d",
      "Yet the tour did experience its own dark moments. In Brazil last year, one concertgoer \u2014 23-year-old Ana Clara Benevides \u2014 passed out and later died of heat exhaustion. In July, British police charged a 17-year-old with murder over a stabbing attack during a Taylor Swift-themed summer holiday dance and yoga class that left three little girls dead. News outlets reported that Swift met with some of the survivors backstage in London.",
      "And in August, all three of Swift's concerts in Vienna were called off after officials announced arrests over an apparent plot to launch an attack on an event in the city. Tens of thousands of Swifties from around the world had traveled to Vienna for the shows.",
      "\u201cHaving our Vienna shows cancelled was devastating,\u201d Swift later wrote in a statement. \u201cThe reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many people had planned on coming to those shows.\u201d",
      "Through the hardships and celebrations, Swift's connections to her fans has only ballooned and deepened throughout the tour. After the Vienna cancellations, many fans flocked to the streets to sing Swift's songs and placed friendship bracelets \u2014 which also became an iconic feature of the shows \u2014 on a nearby tree.",
      "Over the past two years, the fandom has welcomed new audiences \u2014 both old and new.",
      "\u201cI feel like years ago, we were kind of all the same age and fans for the same reason,\u201d Wong said of Swifties. \u201cNow the fandom has people from all kinds of backgrounds, all ages, all different reasons for following her in the first place.\u201d"

      "NASA's two stuck astronauts have hit the six-month mark in space",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Known across the globe as the stuck astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams hit the six-month mark in space Thursday with two more to go.",
      "The pair rocketed into orbit on June 5, the first to ride Boeing\u2019s new Starliner crew capsule on what was supposed to be a weeklong test flight. They arrived at the International Space Station the next day, only after overcoming a cascade of thruster failures and helium leaks. NASA deemed the capsule too risky for a return flight, so it will be February before their long and trying mission comes to a close.",
      "While NASA managers bristle at calling them stuck or stranded, the two retired Navy captains shrug off the description of their plight. They insist they\u2019re fine and accepting of their fate. Wilmore views it as a detour of sorts: \u201cWe\u2019re just on a different path.\u201d",
      "\u201cI like everything about being up here,\u201d Williams told students Wednesday from an elementary school named for her in Needham, Massachusetts, her hometown. \"Just living in space is super fun.\u201d",
      "Both astronauts have lived up there before so they quickly became full-fledged members of the crew, helping with science experiments and chores like fixing a broken toilet, vacuuming the air vents and watering the plants. Williams took over as station commander in September.",
      "\u201cMindset does go a long way,\u201d Wilmore said in response to a question from Nashville first-graders in October. He\u2019s from Mount Juliet, Tennessee. \u201cI don\u2019t look at these situations in life as being downers.\u201d",
      "Boeing flew its Starliner capsule home empty in September, and NASA moved Wilmore and Williams to a SpaceX flight not due back until late February. Two other astronauts were bumped to make room and to keep to a six-month schedule for crew rotations.",
      "Like other station crews, Wilmore and Williams trained for spacewalks and any unexpected situations that might arise.",
      "\u201cWhen the crews go up, they know they could be there for up to a year,\u201d said NASA Associate Administrator Jim Free.",
      "NASA astronaut Frank Rubio found that out the hard way when the Russian Space Agency had to rush up a replacement capsule for him and two cosmonauts in 2023, pushing their six-month mission to just past a year.",
      "Boeing said this week that input from Wilmore and Williams has been \u201cinvaluable\" in the ongoing inquiry of what went wrong. The company said in a statement that it is preparing for Starliner's next flight but declined comment on when it might launch again.",
      "NASA also has high praise for the pair.",
      "\u201cWhether it was luck or whether it was selection, they were great folks to have for this mission,\u201d NASA's chief health and medical officer, Dr. JD Polk, said during an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "On top of everything else, Williams, 59, has had to deal with \u201crumors,\u201d as she calls them, of serious weight loss. She insists her weight is the same as it was on launch day, which Polk confirms.",
      "During Wednesday's student chat, Williams said she didn't have much of an appetite when she first arrived in space. But now she's \u201csuper hungry\u201d and eating three meals a day plus snacks, while logging the required two hours of daily exercise.",
      "Williams, a distance runner, uses the space station treadmill to support races in her home state. She competed in Cape Cod\u2019s 7-mile Falmouth Road Race in August. She ran the 2007 Boston Marathon up there as well.",
      "She has a New England Patriots shirt with her for game days, as well as a Red Sox spring training shirt.",
      "\u201cHopefully I\u2019ll be home before that happens -- but you never know,\u201d she said in November. Husband Michael Williams, a retired federal marshal and former Navy aviator, is caring for their dogs back home in Houston.",
      "As for Wilmore, 61, he's missing his younger daughter's senior year in high school and his older daughter's theater productions in college.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t deny that being unexpectedly separated, especially during the holidays when the entire family gets together, brings increased yearnings to share the time and events together,\u201d his wife, Deanna Wilmore, told the AP in a text this week. Her husband \u201chas it worse than us\u201d since he's confined to the space station and can only connect via video for short periods.",
      "\u201cWe are certainly looking forward to February!!\u201d she wrote.",

      "The nationwide vaccine campaign, implemented by the government in partnership with the global vaccine alliance Gavi, the World Health Organization and the United Nations children\u2019s agency, will target 20,000 frontline workers across the country, officials said.",

That\u2019s because he\u2019s getting a new neighbor: Plaza 500, a 466,000-square-foot data center and an adjacent electrical substation to be built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds and a community center.",

      "The sprawling, windowless warehouses that hold rows of high-speed servers powering almost everything the world does on phones and computers are increasingly becoming fixtures of the American landscape, popping up in towns, cities and suburbs across the United States.",
      "Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and local governments are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies. But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas, abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents are pushing back against the world\u2019s most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.",
      "Tyler Ray, a vocal critic of data centers and leader in the fight against the Virginia project, said the incentives offered are not enough to counteract the consequences of building a facility so close to homes.",
      "\u201cAll that we are asking for is, as the county is trying to bring in this data center income, that they are doing it in a way that doesn\u2019t run residents away from their homes,\u201d he said.",
      "In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling hills of the area\u2019s westernmost counties. Cyclists who ride the popular Washington & Old Dominion trail are at times flanked by data centers, and the thousands of commuters who head into the nation\u2019s capital each day can see them in the distance from the Metro.",
      "Plaza 500, one of the latest proposals in the area, is encroaching on neighborhoods like never before, said Newman, who heads a homeowners association in the community.",
      "The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials promised a significant property tax boost and, in addition to permanent positions in the data center itself, hundreds of temporary construction and electrical jobs to build the facility.",
      "Tyler Ray and his husband moved to the Bren Pointe community in 2022, hoping to balance proximity to Washington with a desire for green space.",
      "But shortly after the couple moved in, Starwood Capital began scoping out a commercial property near their new home as a possible location for the Plaza 500 project.",
      "When Ray and his neighbors learned of the proposal, they held protests, attended regular county meetings and drew media attention to their concerns to try and stop the development. But their efforts were largely unsuccessful: the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project would be grandfathered in under the old rules.",
      "Ray worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by 2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help power the data centers\u2019 hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere.",
      "A spokesman for the firm declined to respond to questions for this story.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how a general resident, even someone who has been engaging intently on an issue,\u201d Ray said, \u201chas any chance to go up against the data center industry.\u201d",
      "For local governments, attracting data centers to their municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in 2024 that Virginia\u2019s existing data centers brought in $1 billion in tax revenue, more than the $750 million in tax breaks given to the tech companies that own them in 2023.",
      "For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of direct jobs \u2014 often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently that its two data centers in Loudoun County, which has about 440,000 residents, created only around 150 direct jobs. But data center advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction, technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730 indirect jobs.",
      "Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax County should reap the benefits.",
      "\u201cI have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the big picture,\u201d Smith said. \u201cData centers are not going away.\u201d",
      "On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the 4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia river.",
      "Last year, AWS, which is owned by Amazon, paid roughly $34 million in property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a $66 million tax break. The company also paid out $10 million total in two, one-time payments to a community development fund and spent another $1.7 million in charitable donations in the community in 2023.",
      "That money has been instrumental in updating infrastructure and bolstering services for the roughly 12,000-person county, going toward a new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer, police body cameras, and $5,000 grants for homebuyers among other things.",
      "Still, some residents are skeptical of the scale of tax break deals. Suspicions started years ago, when three formerly elected officials allegedly helped approve data center deals while owning a stake in a company that contracted with AWS to provide fiber optic cables for the data centers. In June, they each paid $2,000 to settle an ethics complaint against them.",
      "Those officials are no longer in office. But some remain wary of the relationships between the company and local officials, and raised eyebrows at one of the latest data center deals which gives AWS an estimated $1 billion in tax breaks spread over the 15 years to build five new data centers.",
      "Former county commissioner Jim Doherty described a meeting with AWS officials soon after he was elected to office at an upscale restaurant in Boardman, where large windows opened onto the Columbia River.",
      "The AWS representatives asked what Doherty wanted to accomplish as a commissioner. \u201cThey said, \u2018Tell us what your dreams are. Tell us what you need. Tell us what we can do for you,\u2019\u201d Doherty recalled. Other former officials have described similar interactions. Doherty said AWS didn\u2019t ask for anything in return, but the exchange left him uneasy.",
      "\u201cWe engage with stakeholders in every community where we operate around the world, and part of that outreach is to better understand a community\u2019s goals,\u201d said Kevin Miller, AWS' Vice President of global data centers. \u201cThis helps AWS be a catalyst for communities to achieve those goals, and reflects our ongoing commitment to being good neighbors.\u201d",
      "Doherty and another former county commissioner Melissa Lindsay said they pushed unsuccessfully in 2022 for AWS to pay more in taxes in new data center negotiations. They also lobbied to hire outside counsel to negotiate on their behalf, feeling outgunned by the phalanx of AWS-suited lawyers.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to blow it up. We didn\u2019t want to run them off,\" said Lindsay. \u201cBut there were better deals to be made.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Bitcoin burst on the scene after trust had withered in the financial system and Washington\u2019s ability to protect people from it",
      "NEW YORK -- Born from the ashes of the 2008 global financial crisis, bitcoin arrived after trust had withered in the financial system and in Washington's ability to protect those who must participate in it. Now, it's Washington's very embrace of bitcoin that's helping to send its price to records and lining the pockets of its believers.",
      "Bitcoin briefly surged above $103,000 after President-elect Donald Trump said he intends to nominate Paul Atkins, a former regulator who's seen as friendly to crypto, as the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He would replace Gary Gensler, who critics say has been overly aggressive in his oversight of crypto.",
      "It's the latest leg in an astonishing run for bitcoin, whose swings in price are already notoriously extreme.",
      "Bitcoin has more than doubled this year, with a particularly big jump coming after Election Day, when its price was sitting below $70,000. During his campaign, Trump called for making the United States \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet.\"",
      "The crypto industry, meanwhile, did its part to bring politicians friendly to digital currencies into Washington. Crypto corporations poured over $119 million into influencing federal elections in 2024, primarily into a political action committee dedicated to electing pro-crypto candidates and defeating crypto skeptics, according to a recent review by Public Citizen.",
      "It's a large amount. Crypto companies accounted for 44% of all the corporate money contributed during this year\u2019s elections, according to the consumer advocacy organization.",
      "Such a tight embrace marks an interesting twist from bitcoin's early days, when someone or a group of someones under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto created a kind of electronic cash that wouldn't be beholden to any government or financial institution.",
      "In the white paper announcing bitcoin, Namakoto said the traditional way of doing business on the internet \u201cworks well enough for most transactions.\u201d But, Nakamoto said, it \u201cstill suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model,\u201d where a third party like a bank needs to process payments.",
      "Instead, Nakamoto suggested harnessing computing power around the world as a way to create a digital currency that can\u2019t be double-spent. \u201cWhat is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.\u201d That is what became the bitcoin network.",
      "Since then, bitcoin has moved from the financial fringes toward the mainstream, in jagged fits and starts. While it hasn't taken off as a way to pay for groceries, it found popularity as a kind of \u201cdigital gold,\u201d or a way to store value in something that's not subject to the direct influence of a federal government or a central bank.",
      "In its early days, it had a reputation for use by drug dealers, scammers, crypto enthusiasts, libertarians and others who were looking to move money without oversight by the government. Now, it's also found its way into more investor portfolios. Earlier this year, the SEC approved exchange-traded funds that track the spot price of bitcoin. Such ETFs give investors a relatively easy way to buy bitcoin directly in their existing trading accounts.",
      "Through its life, bitcoin has soared through a series of manic bull runs as well as \u201ccrypto winters\u201d that brought extreme declines. It went from just over $5,000 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to nearly $69,000 by late 2021, before crashing below $17,000 following hikes to interest rates by the Federal Reserve and the 2022 collapse of crypto exchange FTX.",
      "With bitcoin in its latest bull run, the man who's about to roll into the White House seemed to take at least some credit.",
      "\u201cCONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!!\u201d Trump said in a post on his Truth Social network. \u201c$100,000!!! YOU\u2019RE WELCOME!!!\u201d"

      "Neuberger divulged the scope of the hack a day after the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued guidance intended to help root out the hackers and prevent similar cyberespionage in the future. White House officials cautioned that the number of telecommunication firms and countries impacted could still grow.",
      "The U.S. believes that the hackers were able to gain access to communications of senior U.S. government officials and prominent political figures through the hack, Neuberger said.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t believe any classified communications has been compromised,\u201d Neuberger added during a call with reporters.",
      "She noted that because the hack appeared to be targeting a relatively small group of individuals, only a small number of Americans' phone calls and texts have been compromised. Neuberger added that impacted companies are all responding, but none \u201chave fully removed the Chinese actors from these networks.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo there is a risk of ongoing compromises to communications until U.S. companies address the cybersecurity gaps the Chinese are likely to maintain their access,\u201d Neuberger said.",
      "She said that President Joe Biden has been briefed on the findings and that the White House \u201chas made it a priority for the federal government to do everything it can to get to the bottom this.\u201d",
      "The Chinese embassy in Washington on Tuesday rejected the accusations that it was responsible for the hack after the U.S. federal authorities issued new guidance.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. needs to stop its own cyberattacks against other countries and refrain from using cyber security to smear and slander China,\u201d embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said.",
      "The embassy did not immediately respond to messages on Wednesday.",
      "White House officials believe that the hacking was regionally targeted and the focus was on very senior government officials.",
      "Federal authorities confirmed in October that hackers linked to China targeted the phones of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, along with people associated with Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "The number of countries impacted by the hack is currently believed to be in the \u201clow, couple dozen,\u201d according to a senior administration official.",
      "The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said they believed the hacks started at least a year or two ago.",
      "The suggestions for telecom companies released Tuesday are largely technical in nature, urging encryption, centralization and consistent monitoring to deter cyber intrusions.",
      "If implemented, the security precautions could help disrupt the operation, which has been dubbed Salt Typhoon, and make it harder for China or any other nation to mount a similar attack in the future, experts say.",
      "Neuberger pointed to efforts that have been made to beef up cybersecurity in the rail, aviation, energy and other sectors following the May 2021 ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline.",
      "\u201cSo, to prevent ongoing Salt typhoon type intrusions by China, we believe we need to apply a similar minimum cybersecurity practice,\u201d Neuberger said.",
      "The cyberattack by a gang of criminal hackers on the critical U.S. pipeline, which delivers about 45% of the fuel used along the Eastern Seaboard, sent ripple effects across the economy, highlighting cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the nation\u2019s aging energy infrastructure. Colonial confirmed it paid $4.4 million to the gang of hackers who broke into its computer systems as it scrambled to get the nation's fuel pipeline back online.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 15:46:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Smartmatic does not need to give Fox News any information about U.S. federal charges against the voting machine company&rsquo;s co-founder over alleged bribery in the Philippines",
    "story": [
      "Smartmatic does not need to give Fox News any information about U.S. federal charges against the voting machine company\u2019s co-founder over alleged bribery in the Philippines",
      "NEW YORK -- Smartmatic won't be required to give Fox News a trove of information about U.S. federal charges against the voting machine company's co-founder over alleged bribery in the Philippines, a judge ruled Thursday.",
      "Fox News and parent Fox Corp. sought the information to help fight Smartmatic's $2.7 billion defamation suit over broadcasts about the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Smartmatic says its business was gutted when Fox aired false claims that the election-tech company helped rig the voting.",
      "Fox says it was simply reporting on newsworthy allegations made by then-President Donald Trump and his allies.",
      "At the same hearing, Judge David B. Cohen also turned down Smartmatic's request to question two Fox Corp. board members. The company has already questioned others.",
      "The Aug. 8 indictment of Smartmatic co-founder Roger Pi\u00f1ate and two other executives concerns a geographically distant matter: Smartmatic's efforts to get work in the Philippines between 2015 and 2018.",
      "But Fox maintains the criminal case is pertinent to Smartmatic's business prospects, and therefore to the election-tech company's claims about what it lost and stands to lose because of Fox's 2020 coverage.",
      "\u201cAs of Aug 8, governments will have to take into account the risks of doing business with a company (where some executives have been) accused of serious corruption by the U.S. Department of Justice,\" Fox lawyer Brad Masters told a New York court Thursday.",
      "He asked the court to order Smartmatic to provide any documents that it has given to the DOJ for the bribery investigation; any customer inquiries about the criminal charges; and any staff communications about the matter and its impact on the company.",
      "The indictment accuses Pi\u00f1ate and two other Smartmatic executives of scheming to pay over $1 million in bribes to a Filipino election official to deploy the company's machines and pay promptly for them. Federal prosecutors say the payments were made through sham loan agreements and via a slush fund created by overcharging for the machines.",
      "Pi\u00f1ate, who has served as Smartmatic\u2019s president, and at least one of the other executives have pleaded not guilty to conspiring to violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and to money laundering. It\u2019s unclear from court records whether the third executive has entered a plea or has an attorney who can comment on the charges.",
      "Boca Raton, Florida-based Smartmatic itself isn\u2019t charged in the criminal case. The company put the executives on leave and sought to reassure voters that elections are \u201cconducted with the utmost integrity and transparency.\u201d",
      "Smartmatic's lawyers contend the indictment is irrelevant to the defamation suit, which is about election-fraud claims that Trump's attorneys made on Fox News programs.",
      "The indictment is \u201cmerely an allegation,\u201d Smartmatic attorney Caitlin Kovacs argued Thursday. She suggested Fox wanted to \u201cplay prosecutor to the jury\u201d and \u201caccuse Smartmatic of a crime that they didn\u2019t commit.\u201d",
      "Cohen denied two similar requests from Fox while the federal investigation was ongoing. He said Thursday that the indictment didn't change his mind.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a mere accusation. It raises no presumption of guilt,\u201d he said.",
      "Smartmatic is suing over shows in which Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell portrayed the company as part of a broad conspiracy to steal the 2020 vote from Trump, a Republican and the winner of this year's election.",
      "Federal and state election officials, exhaustive reviews in battleground states and Trump\u2019s own then-attorney general found no widespread fraud that could have changed the outcome of the 2020 election. Nor did they uncover any credible evidence that the vote was tainted. Dozens of judges, including some whom Trump appointed, rejected his fraud claims.",
      "Fox News ultimately aired an interview with an election technology expert who refuted the allegations against Smartmatic.",
      "As is normal in the run-up to a civil trial, various players connected to both parties have been questioned under oath by the other side's lawyers. These out-of-court sessions are called depositions.",
      "Smartmatic wanted Thursday to get depositions ordered for Fox Corp. board members Chase Carey and Roland Hernandez. The two attended meetings where critical decisions were made, Smartmatic argues.",
      "Fox lawyer Devin Anderson said there's no indication that Carey and Hernandez \u201chave any relevant information\u201d to add. Smartmatic already has questioned other board members, including Executive Chair and CEO Lachlan Murdoch and former House Speaker Paul Ryan, as well as Fox founder Rupert Murdoch, the attorney said.",
      "Depositions generally aren't made public at this stage of a case.",
      "Smartmatic lawyer Erik Connolly said after court that the company was pursuing other information to show \u201cthat Fox Corp. controlled the disinformation spread by Fox News.\u201d",
      "A message seeking comment was sent to Fox. The news network is countersuing Smartmatic, claiming the defamation case violates a New York law against baseless suits aimed at squelching reporting or criticism on public issues.",
      "Smartmatic recently settled defamation suits against One America News Network and Newsmax. Fox News settled for $787 million last year with another voting-technology company, Dominion Voting Systems."

      "The manhunt for the suspect involved in gunning down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel on Wednesday has now entered its fourth day as authorities learn more about his movements before the attack.",
      "Police have learned that the suspect took a taxi to the Port Authority bus facility at 178th Street and boarded a bus out of New York City following the shooting, according to police.",
      "The bus the suspect is believed to have boarded out of the city made six or seven stops, and investigators have followed leads in multiple states, the sources said.",
      "The killer entered New York City by bus on Nov. 24, when a surveillance camera at Port Authority Bus Terminal caught his arrival at 9 p.m., law enforcement sources told ABC News.",
      "The inbound bus originated in Atlanta, but it was not immediately clear where the suspect boarded. Sources told ABC News he was spotted on board in Washington, D.C.",
      "The 10-day period he was in New York City before the shooting is the focus of investigative efforts.",
      "The FBI is now assisting in a nationwide manhunt for the suspect, according to law enforcement sources, and the unidentified man remains at large in the wake of Wednesday's attack, which was described by police as \"brazen, targeted\" and \"premeditated.\"",
      "Police still do not have a name of the suspect, the sources said.",
      "Meanwhile, citing the recent killing of Thompson, Centene, a major health insurer, said it would be moving its planned in-person investor day in New York City next week to virtual, according to a statement from the company on Friday.",
      "\"All of us at Centene are deeply saddened by Brian Thompson's death and want to express our support for all of those affected. Health insurance is a big industry and a small community; many members of the CenTeam crossed paths with Brian during their careers,\" said Centene Chief Executive Officer, Sarah M. London. \u201c\"He was a person with a deep sense of empathy and clear passion for improving access to care. Our hearts are with his family and his colleagues during this difficult time.\"",
      "Police officers were able to recover what is suspected to be the backpack carried by the suspected shooter, a source familiar with the case told ABC News on Friday.",
      "The bag was discovered Friday evening in Central Park, where the NYPD deployed an army of officers and drones to conduct a grid search, the source said.",
      "The suspect is seen in footage wearing a backpack prior to the shooting but does not appear to have it on in another video of him on a bike 15 minutes after the shooting.",
      "The masked gunman shot Thompson at point-blank range at 6:44 a.m. Wednesday outside the New York Hilton Midtown, where Thompson was heading for his company's investors conference.",
      "\"The shooter then walks toward the victim and continues to shoot,\" NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said. \"It appears that the gun malfunctions, as he clears the jam and begins to fire again.\"",
      "Written on the shell casings were the words \u201cdeny,\u201d \u201cdefend\u201d and \u201cdepose,\u201d according to police sources.",
      "The words on the bullets echo the title of the 2010 book \"Delay, Deny, Defend: Why Insurance Companies Don't Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It.\" Police are aware of the similarity, and are investigating whether one possible motive is anger at the insurance industry, sources said.",
      "Investigators believe they were able to score DNA samples from several pieces of evidence discovered at or near the crime scene, law enforcement sources told ABC News. The samples are currently at the NYC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner to be run through databases for a possible match -- a process that could take several days, the sources said.",
      "Police were also able to extract a fingerprint off a water bottle the suspect bought at a Starbucks, but the print is smudged so it's not clear how helpful it will be, sources said.",

    "summary": "The jury was 'unable to come to a unanimous vote' on Daniel Penny's manslaughter charge over the subway chokehold death of Jordan Neely.",
    "story": [
      "Penny pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and negligent homicide charges.",
      "A judge has dismissed the second-degree manslaughter charge against Daniel Penny in the death of Jordan Neely at the request of prosecutors after jurors said they were deadlocked.",
      "Judge Maxwell Wiley encouraged the jury to continue deliberating on Monday the lesser charge of whether Penny committed criminally negligent homicide when he placed Neely, a homeless man, in a chokehold on the New York City subway last year.",
      "The dismissed second-degree manslaughter charge carried a maximum 15-year sentence, while the lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide has a four-year maximum sentence. Neither crime has a minimum sentence.",
      "Defense attorney Thomas Kenniff opposed the prosecution's motion to dismiss the more severe charge, arguing the move could lead to a \"coercive or a compromised verdict\" by \"elbowing\" jurors to convict on criminally negligent homicide.",
      "\"What that means is you are now free to consider count two. Whether not that makes any difference or not, I have no idea,\" Wiley said before sending the jury home for the weekend.",
      "Penny, a 25-year-old former Marine, put Neely, a 30-year-old homeless man, in a six-minute-long chokehold after Neely boarded a subway car acting erratically, according to police. Witnesses described Neely yelling and moving erratically, with Penny's attorneys calling Neely \"insanely threatening\" when Penny put Neely in a chokehold.",
      "The city's medical examiner concluded Penny's chokehold killed Neely.",
      "He was initially charged with both manslaughter and negligent homicide charges. He pleaded not guilty to both.",
      "Since getting the case on Tuesday, the jury has been deliberating for over 23 hours. On Friday, the jury sent two notes repeating that they could not come to a unanimous conclusion on the second-degree manslaughter count.",
      "Wiley gave the jury an Allen charge, which refers to the jury instructions given to a hung jury that encourages them to continue deliberating despite the deadlock. He is giving the lawyers time to consider the next steps.",
      "\"Jury deliberations are not intended to be easy,\" Judge Wiley told the jury, instructing them that a future jury would be in no better position to reach a verdict than they would.",
      "Penny's lawyer, Kenniff, unsuccessfully asked for mistrial twice, arguing that the Allen Charge would be \"coercive.\"",
      "\"It would be a crazy result to have a hung jury just because they can't move on to the second count?\" prosecutor Dafna Yoran said. She also told Wiley that a new trial would \"ultimately [be] the case if they hang the case.\"",
      "The jury on Friday also sent back a note requesting more information about the term \"reasonable person\" in their instructions.",
      "\"Ultimately, what a reasonable person is up to you to decide,\" Wiley told the jury in response to their note, referring them to a two-part test in jury instruction.",
      "To convict Penny of manslaughter, the jury needed to be convinced Penny acted recklessly and grossly deviated from how a reasonable person would behave knowing the risk his conduct posed.",
      "\"Would a reasonable person have had the same honestly held belief as the defendant given the circumstances and what the defendant knew at that time?\" Wiley asked, referring to the second part of the test.",
      "Before the jury entered the courtroom on Friday, Wiley noted how the \"reasonableness\" standard was established in People v. Goetz \u2013 another high-profile New York trial after Bernhard Goetz shot four teenagers on a New York subway in 1984 after they allegedly tried to rob him. A New York jury convicted Goetz for one count of carrying an unlicensed firearm but acquitted on the more severe charges, and the trial sparked a nationwide debate about race and crime that has echoed forty years later in Penny's case."

      "The bombing of Pearl Harbor 83 years ago launched the United States into World War II",
      "PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii -- Bob Fernandez thought he'd go dancing and see the world when he joined the U.S. Navy as a 17-year-old high school student in August 1941.",
      "Four months later he found himself shaking from explosions and passing ammunition to artillery crews so his ship's guns could return fire on Japanese planes bombing Pearl Harbor, a Navy base in Hawaii.",
      "\u201cWhen those things go off like that, we didn\u2019t know what\u2019s what,\u201d said Fernandez, who is now 100. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even know we were in a war.\u201d",
      "Two survivors of the bombing \u2014 each 100 or older \u2014 are planning to return to Pearl Harbor on Saturday to observe the 83rd anniversary of the attack that thrust the U.S. into World War II. They will join active-duty troops, veterans and members of the public for a remembrance ceremony hosted by the Navy and the National Park Service.",
      "Fernandez was initially planning to join them but had to cancel because of health issues.",
      "The bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank during the battle. The remains of more than 900 Arizona crew members are still entombed on the submerged vessel.",
      "A moment of silence will be held at 7:54 a.m., the same time the attack began eight decades ago. Aircraft in missing man formation are due to fly overhead to break the silence.",
      "Dozens of survivors once joined the annual remembrance but attendance has declined as survivors have aged. Today there are only 16 still living, according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. Military historian J. Michael Wenger has estimated there were some 87,000 military personnel on Oahu on the day of the attack.",
      "Many laud Pearl Harbor survivors as heroes, but Fernandez doesn't view himself that way.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a hero. I\u2019m just nothing but an ammunition passer,\u201d he told The Associated Press in a phone interview from California, where he now lives with his nephew in Lodi.",
      "Fernandez was working as a mess cook on his ship, the USS Curtiss, the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, and planned to go dancing that night at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel in Waikiki.",
      "He brought sailors coffee and food as he waited tables during breakfast. Then they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a plane with the red ball insignia painted on Japanese aircraft fly by.",
      "Fernandez rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing 5-inch (12.7-centimeter), 38-caliber shells so they could begin passing them to the ship's guns.",
      "He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire up above.",
      "\u201cI felt kind of scared because I didn\u2019t know what the hell was going on,\u201d Fernandez said.",
      "The ship's guns hit a Japanese plane that crashed into one of its cranes. Shortly after, its guns hit a dive bomber which then slammed into the ship and exploded below deck, setting the hangar and main decks on fire, according to the Navy History and Heritage Command.",
      "Fernandez's ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its sailors were injured.",
      "\u201cWe lost a lot of good people, you know. They didn\u2019t do nothing,\" Fernandez said. \"But we never know what\u2019s going to happen in a war.\u201d",
      "After the attack, Fernandez had to sweep up debris. That night, he stood guard with a rifle to make sure no one tried to come aboard. When it came time to rest, he fell asleep next to where the ship\u2019s dead were lying. He only realized that when a fellow sailor woke him up and told him.",
      "After the war, Fernandez worked as a forklift driver at a cannery in San Leandro, California. His wife of 65 years, Mary Fernandez, died in 2014. His oldest son is now 82 and lives in Arizona. Two other sons and a stepdaughter have died.",
      "He has traveled to Hawaii three times to participate in the Pearl Harbor remembrance. This year would have been his fourth trip.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump has been the ultimate GOP mover and shaker since 2015. Now, Vice President-elect JD Vance has some early opportunities to make his own mark.",
    "story": [
      "He's \"going to be a future force to be reckoned with,\" one Republican said.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has been the ultimate GOP mover and shaker since 2015, using his sway to impact the party far beyond just his own political career. Now, Vice President-elect JD Vance has some early opportunities to make his own mark.",
      "Vance, still Ohio's junior senator, has shepherded some of Trump's Cabinet picks around and can use his ties to his colleagues to promote others. He is also in touch with Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine as he mulls who to tap to replace Vance in the Senate until 2026, when that person would then have to run in a special election to serve the rest of the seat's term.",
      "It's unlikely that Vance -- or anyone -- can emulate Trump's unique ability to affect change in the party. But Vance is the country's second-highest ranking Republican and considered Trump's heir apparent, making the upcoming opportunities chances to glimpse the power the 40-year-old holds across the GOP to promote the incoming administration's goals but also his own stock beyond his formal role.",
      "\"It's pretty clear that he is in a pole position after Trump to help lead the party. So, he's going to, I think, take these opportunities to show the party that he's a loyal soldier to Donald Trump, but he's also going to be a future force to be reckoned with,\" said former Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who remains in touch with Trump's team.",
      "Vance is not a sherpa for every single Cabinet pick, but he did escort former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz, Trump's failed attorney general pick, and Pete Hegseth, tapped to lead the Pentagon, around Capitol Hill. He's also making calls to Senate colleagues about some of Trump's Cabinet choices, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
      "He's also in what one source described as semi-regular contact with DeWine as the two-term governor mulls who to appoint to the Senate seat that Vance is vacating. The decision is ultimately DeWine's, and there currently doesn't appear to be a favorite for the role, but sources said they would be surprised if the person was someone who rubbed Vance and Trump the wrong way.",
      "\"Ohio is his domain, so I think you can expect that his voice in the upcoming Senate race will be important,\" one source close to Vance said. \"There is a want to land on somebody that everybody involved will be happy with, DeWine, Trump and JD.\"",
      "To be certain, Vance can only move the needle so far with Cabinet confirmations and Senate appointments, decisions that are up to a Senate looking for chances to assert its independence and a governor who has clashed with Trump but remained electorally viable. There will also be tougher battles to come as the next administration works to muscle through its policy priorities, and Trump will still run the show as a dominant political figure who virtually blocks out the sun.",
      "But the dual conversations over appointments could offer early indications of how much Republicans listen when Vance speaks, even as someone's No. 2.",
      "\"He talks to [senators] a lot,\" said one source in Vance's orbit. \"They're his colleagues still for another four weeks. So, yeah, he works the phones. He was on Capitol Hill this week. I think he wants to see folks get in there so the administration can hit the ground running on day one.",
      "\"He's a surrogate for when the President has to be in multiple places at the same time. He's influential, but I don\u2019t know that he's more persuasive than the president as such. He\u2019s augmenting,\" the person added.",
      "Already, Vance has seen some of his allies elevated in the incoming administration.",
      "James Braid, who was Vance's deputy chief of staff in the Senate, will be the White House's formal liaison to Congress. Daniel Driscoll, another Vance ally, was tapped to be secretary of the Army. Trump picked hedge fund manager and Vance friend Scott Bessent as his treasury secretary after he donated millions to the presidential ticket.",
      "And Vance has already proven his sway by helping now-Ohio Republican Sen.-elect Bernie Moreno win Trump's endorsement in the Ohio Senate primary this year and then get him over the finish line against Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown who had defied political gravity for several cycles.",
      "There have been setbacks, too -- Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration after sexual misconduct allegations dogged his nomination, and Hegseth is facing headwinds over allegations of sexual assault and heavy drinking that he's denied. However, it's unclear how much outside help could improve their chances given the gravity of the allegations.",
      "\"This is a chance to see how many of Vice President-Elect Vance's confidants end up in the Cabinet, and whether they are Cabinet secretaries, or the other place to take a very serious look is the undersecretaries,\" said Steve Stivers, a former congressman who leads the Ohio Chamber of Commerce. \"It's not just the Cabinet secretaries, but the undersecretaries that matter here, because those will be people filling their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 being ready to move up.\"",
      "Still, there's no guarantee that Vance will be able to be as big of a mover and shaker as normally possible for vice presidents in Trump's White House.",
      "The president-elect is famously wary of others enjoying too bright of a spotlight, and there could be other high-profile Republicans who are also anticipated to be power players after Trump leaves office, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump's pick to lead the State Department, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is rumored to be in the mix for Pentagon chief if Hegseth's nomination falls through.",
      "\"Obviously, he has a great opportunity here. But I think for folks to say it's a fait accompli that JD Vance is somehow ahead of the rest of the field today, I just don't think that's accurate,\" said one former senior Trump administration official.",
      "\"What is he going to do that's outside of the Trump shadow, that is actually him, that is not him acting as a liaison for Donald Trump? And of those things, what does he do that pisses off Donald Trump? Because it's a guy that doesn't really like people operating outside of his shadow.\"",
      "But at the end of the day, Vance will have a more elevated platform than any other Republican in the country except for one, and Trump enters office as a lame duck because of constitutional term limits, possibly leaving Vance well-positioned for a potential vacuum in a party dominated by Trump for nearly a decade.",
      "\"Trump picked him for a specific reason, and that reason is to carry the mantle. Now, he's 40 years old. That dude could be around for a while. Trump was looking ahead,\" said Ohio GOP strategist Mike Hartley. \"I think he's going to give him every opportunity to succeed.\"",

    "summary": "Senior staffers from the Trump and Harris campaigns met at Harvard University's Campaign Managers Conference on Friday to discuss the unprecedented 2024 campaign summer.",
    "story": [
      "Much of the debate focused on the 107 days Harris was the Democratic nominee.",
      "Senior staffers from the Trump and Harris campaigns met at Harvard University's Campaign Managers Conference on Friday to discuss the summer of 2024, which gave way to an unprecedented political season that included a disastrous debate performance for President Joe Biden, a subsequent new Democratic nominee in Vice President Kamala Harris, and two assassination attempts on former President Donald Trump.",
      "Much of the debate focused on the 107 days with Harris as the new Democratic nominee and how the campaigns had to tweak their strategies on a highly truncated timeline. The following are highlights from the sprawling, wide-ranging conversation.",
      "Sparks flew toward the end of their discussion when a member of the Trump campaign said the former president \"outworked\" Harris.",
      "\"Why didn't you trust your candidate more?\" questioned Taylor Budowich, deputy campaign manager for the Trump campaign. \"Why didn't you put her out more? You said \u2026 you couldn't ever compete with the amount of attention Donald Trump got. You never gave her a shot.\"",
      "The Harris campaign pushed back at Budowich, saying that its strategy was successful and not that the Trump campaign outworked them.",
      "\"Your strategy was a good strategy, but you have no idea how hard the people on the other side worked,\" said Quentin Fulks, principal deputy campaign manager for the Harris campaign. \"I have no idea how hard you all work.\"",
      "Budowich interjected, saying he was referring to Harris and not the entire campaign, but Fulks asserted that Harris worked hard.",
      "\"I didn't say she didn't work hard. I said she got outworked,\" Budowich clarified.",
      "Fulks defended the vice president, explaining that it was not a fair comparison because the Harris campaign had a different strategy, which he said wasn't successful. He reiterated that it was nothing related to her work ethic.",
      "Asked by ABC News' Brittany Shepherd about the fallout from President Joe Biden seeming to call Trump supporters garbage on a call hosted by the nonprofit Voto Latino during the final weeks of the campaign, Fulks said Democrats need to do a better job at not creating self-inflicted wounds -- pointing to some in his own party very quickly criticizing Biden after the White House, and Biden himself, attempted to clarify the statement, in comparison to what he sees to be Republicans' very long leash for Donald Trump.",
      "\"Our people, once again, continue to shoot ourselves in the foot,\" Fulks said.",
      "\"The discipline on the Right is better than the discipline on the Left,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd that is not about morals, values, any of that. It's literally about discipline and seeing the big picture of how you win and what you can swallow in order to get to a win.\"",
      "Jen O'Malley Dillon, Harris campaign chairwoman, didn't stray with the repeated messaging on Biden's debate performance, reiterating he had a \"bad night\" and pointing to Obama as a precedent of incumbents having uneven debates, and argued the campaign saw a real path for Biden to win the election despite it all.",
      "\"So, we very much felt like we throughout had a path to 270. We felt like we had the right candidate, the person we believed in, and the person was leading our country quite well,\" O'Malley Dillon said. \"We still believe that.\"",
      "Without pointing to a particular moment, Fulks conceded that early in the debate, campaign staff could tell Biden wasn't performing.",
      "Trump's team was far more pointed, saying it was evident Biden \"was not going to survive\" the election cycle \"about a minute\" into the debate, according to Chris LaCivita, Trump's co-campaign manager.",
      "\"I think that for us, and this was with all due respect to the president, we felt like there were challenges that were on full display at the debate,\" said James Blair, the Trump campaign's political director. \"There's also been days where those challenges seem less apparent. That night was not one of them.\"",
      "Referring to Biden's debate performance and what followed, O'Malley Dillon said, \"There has probably not been a more difficult period for a campaign team to navigate.\"",
      "Blair quickly interjected, noting that two assassination attempts and navigating the indictments were also challenging to navigate, and O'Malley Dillon later acknowledged the difficulty of the Trump team's summer and mentioned she reached out to Susie Wiles, Trump campaign manager, in the aftermath.",
      "When asked about the large number of Democrats calling for Biden to drop out of the race following his disastrous debate performance, Fulks referred to it as a \"slow bleed.\"",
      "Fulks later agreed with a point LaCivita made earlier in the day: Visuals matter when running for office, and the Biden campaign wanted to put Biden out in public, doing a series of events to counter his debate performance.",
      "\"I think Chris is right,\" Fulks said. \"Something visual happened in front of people's eyes. The only way to combat that is to give them something visual. And the only visual play you have at that point is putting Joe Biden in front of as many people as possible, which is what we tried to do. And so, when he caught COVID, it's almost like a dagger.\"",
      "The Trump campaign said it was preparing for what ended up becoming inevitable, adding that it began tracking and opposition research and polling alternative running mates as early as May on Harris but also ranged in other possible candidates, such as Michelle Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.",
      "Clearly a pivotal political moment as much as it was a harrowing personal moment for both campaigns, the first assassination attempt on Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, \"severely limited where we could campaign because, after the first attempt, they basically told us, lock down, no more outdoor events,\" said Tony Fabrizio, chief pollster for the Trump campaign. \"And if we want to do an outdoor event, it needed, like, double the lead time.\"",
      "The Harris campaign, for its part, pulled its negative advertising in the days after the assassination attempt.",
      "\"We also were mindful about the way that we were campaigning. \"There's no place for political violence in democracy. And we wanted to make sure that our campaign was reflecting that in this moment,\" added Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Harris campaign manager.",
      "The Harris campaign, pressed multiple times on whether it was made aware of Biden's decision to drop out of the 2024 race prior to him making the announcement public or if there were any conversations beforehand about the possibility of Biden dropping out, asserted it found out shortly before he made his announcement and that there were no conversations beforehand.",
      "Asked if there was any chance of another Democrat becoming the nominee besides Harris, Fulks said there's always a possibility but noted that Biden wanted to throw his support behind Harris. He added that a Democratic primary this late in the cycle would have been messy.",
      "\"From my perspective, Vice President Harris was the only commonsense choice to be made. But I think that President Biden made that -- she's his vice president and she was loyal to him, and he decided to support her,\" Fulks said.",

    "story": [
      "Senior staffers from several campaigns offered their reflections of 2024.",
      "Sheila Nix, Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 chief of staff, said Thursday evening that Harris ran a \u201cpretty flawless campaign\u201d during a summit of campaign managers, reporters and Harvard University staff.",
      "\u201cI think the vice president was the best position of all the possible people on our side. She had been sitting vice president for 3 1/2 years and was also part of the campaign and was ready to jump in,\u201d Nix said during a dinner reception for the Campaign Manager Conference at the Charles Hotel in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cWe obviously had a lot of things to do right away,\u201d Nix continued. \u201cWe had to get the delegates so that she could be the nominee. We had to flip the convention to her instead of President Biden. We had to merge teams and we had a 107-day campaign in front of us and we had to move quickly.",
      "\u201cI would posit she ran a pretty flawless campaign, and she did all the steps that [were] required to be successful,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I think -- obviously, we did not win, but I do think we hit all the marks.\u201d",
      "Senior staffers from several other campaigns, such as those of Asa Hutchinson, Dean Phillips, Jill Stein, Nikki Haley, Chris Christie and President-elect Donald Trump, also offered brief reflections during the dinner. The collective broadly addressed two main themes: reasoning to jump into the race and what may have been a strategic misstep.",
      "Several of the campaigns mused on whether they made the right decision on holding back from going on offense against Trump during the primaries -- leaving Christie's campaign and, to a lesser extent, Hutchinson\u2019s on an island of their own.",
      "\u201cAnybody here who ever wants to challenge the race at any level for any office, you don't ever beat an incumbent without attacking the incumbent,\u201d said Mike DuHaime, senior adviser to Christie. \u201cYou have to say the incumbent has not been doing a good job or I would be better than the incumbent. You can't say that the incumbent is really, really, really, really, really great, but I'm also really, really, really, really great.\u201d",
      "The Christie campaign became frustrated when it realized the other primary candidates weren\u2019t following Christie\u2019s lead, DuHaime added.",
      "\u201cIt becomes frustrating, obviously. And you start to talk privately about what were, what are other people's actual motivations,\u201d DuHaime said.",
      "While Christie took on Trump directly, aggressively and consistently, the same could not be said for Hutchinson.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, it got to the point where in order for him just to continue to fight, to have his voice and his name and his face seen, he had to go on the offensive,\u201d said Rob Burgess, campaign manager for Hutchinson. \u201cClearly, he didn't do it as aggressively as Gov. Christie, but he did it in his own Arkansas way.\u201d",
      "Even though Haley became the last candidate standing against Trump during the primary, the former South Carolina governor did not start going after Trump as aggressively as other competitors until she became the sole alternative.",
      "Along with Haley, other candidates such as South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, North Dakota Sen. Doug Burgum and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also avoided heavily attacking Trump out of fear that it would turn off those who still liked the former president and supported his agenda but had doubts he could win.",
      "\u201cI think, like a lot of people in here, we determined that 40% of the electorate was always going to be for President Trump, 40% were Trump curious and then 20% of the possibly primary were not going to be for President Trump,\u201d said Mike Zolnierowicz, campaign manager for Burgum.",
      "Nix, Harris\u2019 campaign manager, also attributed Trump\u2019s decision not to participate in any debate following the ABC News presidential debate on Sept. 10 as detrimental to the Harris campaign\u2019s strategy of presenting the choice between Trump and Harris clearly to voters several times.",
      "\u201cI think that was hard for us to then get the attention that we would have liked to,\u201d Nix said.",
      "During the dinner, one common theme discussed among several of the campaign managers was the decision to have either a one-state strategy or a multistate strategy.",
      "Betsy Ankney, Haley\u2019s campaign manager, stressed that a Republican candidate couldn\u2019t be successful if he or she only zeroed in on one state.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that we saw earlier was that, you know, Iowa [and] New Hampshire were eight days apart,\u201d Ankney said. \u201cEvery other candidate other than Donald Trump and Nikki Haley had a one-state strategy. Chris Christie was playing in New Hampshire. DeSantis, Iowa. There was no way that you could be successful in this campaign without having a strong showing in the world stage and being able to go to distance.\u201d",
      "Ankeny added that campaigns mismanaging their influxes of cash -- their \u201cembarrassment of riches\u201d -- was another major misstep of the election.",
      "\u201cI think that a potential theme of this entire election cycle is an embarrassment of riches,\u201d she said. \u201cYou saw that with the DeSantis campaign in the primary. You saw that with the Harris campaign in general. A lot of times, when candidates have more money than they know what to do with, they make bad decisions, and we were mean and lean and scrappy.\u201d",
      "Campaign managers for Scott, Christie and Hutchinson discussed focusing and investing in one of the early primary states rather than all of them due to limited resources, lack of money and what many saw campaigns as their best chance to be successful.",
      "Although the campaign manager for DeSantis was not in attendance, his presidential campaign also focused heavily on one state: Iowa.",
      "Hutchinson\u2019s campaign manager, Burgess, was blunt during Thursday night\u2019s conversation that he and the former Arkansas governor disagreed on whether to focus on one state or multiple states, leading Burgess to leave the campaign.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to run a five-state campaign, and I didn't know how I was going to pay for it,\u201d Burgess said. \u201cI wasn't comfortable with him taking a mortgage out of his house, and I didn't want to be responsible for the campaign having debt.\u201d"

      "The House voted 206-198 to refer Democratic Rep. Sean Casten\u2019s resolution -- which sought to make the Gaetz report public -- back to the Ethics Committee, which voted two weeks ago against releasing the report.",
      "Casten\u2018s privileged resolution\u00a0attempted to force the Ethics Committee to release its report.\u00a0Casten introduced an updated version of his resolution on Tuesday which included several examples of the committee releasing reports on former members of Congress. Republicans had used Gaetz's resignation from the House as grounds for fighting its release.",
      "Another from Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen\u00a0that sought to make the report public and preserve all documents related to the investigation was also referred to the Ethics Committee on a 204-198 vote.",
      "After the vote, Casten said in a statement that Republicans \"took the easy way out.",
      "\"They could have ensured a vote on whether or not former Members should be held accountable when they face serious and credible allegations of sexual misconduct, including having sex with minors. Instead, the House voted to sweep these allegations under the rug and set an unfortunate precedent that, if you are ever facing scrutiny, resigning from Congress can make your problems go away,\" he said.",
      "The committee met on the report for two hours Thursday afternoon before the vote, but members wouldn't disclose what was discussed. A statement from the committee after the meeting said it is \"continuing to discuss the matter.\"",
      "It would taken only a handful of Republicans to cross party lines and vote with Democrats to defeat the measure to send the resolutions to the committee or to force it to release the report. Rep. Tom McClintock was the only Republican to vote with Democrats on the Casten resolution.",
      "The Ethics Committee was investigating allegations that Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct, illicit drug use, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe, improper gratuity, or impermissible gift.",
      "The floor vote came after the bipartisan Ethics Committee met Thursday afternoon to discuss the report.\u00a0During its last meeting in November, Republican committee members blocked the report's release.",
      "Johnson has consistently said the Gaetz ethics report should not be released to the public, citing a longstanding tradition of dropping investigations after a member leaves Congress.\u00a0Gaetz resigned abruptly last month after President-elect Donald Trump announced him as his selection for attorney general. He later withdrew from consideration after it became clear he was facing an uphill climb from both Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, which would vote whether to confirm his nomination.",
      "Democrats pushed for the report's release after Trump's announcement, saying it was relevant to the Senate's consideration of him for attorney general. Even though Gaetz withdrew, Democrats decided to continue their effort.",
      "Gaetz was reelected to the 119th Congress before Trump picked him for AG, but he announced after his withdrawal that he would not serve another term. He pledged that he remains \"fully committed\" to assisting the president-elect.",

    "summary": "Mehmet Oz, the celebrity doctor picked by President Donald Trump to oversee Medicare and Medicaid programs, will stop promoting health and wellness products if confirmed.",
    "story": [
      "A spokesperson says Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also plans to follow all ethics rules.",
      "Mehmet Oz, the celebrity doctor picked by President-elect Donald Trump to oversee the country's Medicare and Medicaid programs, has agreed to stop promoting health and wellness products if confirmed by the Senate, according to a spokesperson for the Trump transition.",
      "Likewise, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2013 who recently raised eyebrows by appearing on his wife's social media account apparently showering naked in the background while she promoted her beauty line \u2013 also has agreed to disclose his finances and undergo a federal ethics review if confirmed as health secretary, said spokesperson Katie Miller.",
      "\"Both Mr. Kennedy and Dr. Oz plan to divest where appropriate and fully cooperate with the Office of Government of Ethics,\" Miller told ABC News.",
      "Whether Trump's nominees planned to follow traditional ethics rules that have governed Washington policymakers for decades had been an open question.",
      "Trump has picked several billionaires to lead his Cabinet, while Kennedy and Oz promoted wellness companies in new online posts even after being named as part of the incoming administration.",
      "Experts say it's still possible for any nominee to try to test the bounds of ethics rules.",
      "While many requirements are spelled out in law, Trump's Justice Department would be in charge of enforcing those rules. Trump also would ultimately be in charge of the federal ethics office after inauguration and would be responsible for pursuing or authorizing any disciplinary or corrective action among his cabinet members.",
      "Still, the transition's promise to follow ethics rules is an important first step, aid Delaney Marsco, ethics director for the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center.",
      "\"It is one of the most basic commitments to not commit a criminal conflict of interest violation\" when taking a government job, Marsco said.",
      "\"The price of having all this power is that you have to use it to serve the public. And part of that deal is that you can't have financial conflicts of interest that would cloud your judgment,\" she added.",
      "Ethics laws require office holders to either divest investments that pose a conflict of interest or recuse themselves from making decisions related to those investments.",
      "Separate federal regulations impose standards of conduct that generally prohibit government officials from promoting products online that could be seen as a kind of federal endorsement.",
      "Five days after Oz was named as the incoming head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \u2013 a federal agency that oversees federal health insure for 160 million Americans and regulates private insurers \u2013 he turned to social media to promote iHerb, an online retailer that sells vitamins and supplements.",
      "\"Thanksgiving is a perfect excuse for practicing gratitude -- which also happens to be a proven way to reduce stress. You can also reduce stress with adaptogens like ashwagandha from a trusted source like iHerb. Happy Thanksgiving!\" Oz wrote on X, with a similar video message posted on his personal Instagram account.",
      "Last month, Kennedy posted a similar post promoting an online fitness game called BoxBollen shortly after Trump named him to be health and human services secretary.",
      "\"The ideal stocking stuffer! \" Kennedy said in a video playing the game and wearing the game's headband.",
      "Kennedy quickly deleted his post.",
      "Miller said Kennedy has canceled his promotional contract already, while Oz plans to end his relationship with iHerb to avoid any potential conflict of interest.",
      "Oz also does not have any ongoing contractual agreements with weight-loss drugs, which he has promoted in the past on his syndicated television show.",
      "Separately, Oz's regular posts promoting iHerb prompted calls this week by the liberal consumer watchdog group Public Citizen for an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. FTC rules requires online influencers to make clear in their posts if they are being paid to promote products.",
      "The FTC declined to comment on whether it would consider such a request. There are no records of past actions against Oz by the FTC.",
      "Less clear is how federal ethics rules might apply to the business owned by Kennedy's wife, Cheryl Hines, which sells home and body products.",
      "Marsco of the Campaign Legal Center said spouses typically aren't required to step away from their jobs or businesses because their partner was hired by the U.S. government. However, government officials are required to recuse themselves from making decisions that could impact their spouse's employment and would still have to divest financial holdings that conflict with their work.",
      "Those details would have to be worked out with the ethics office and enforced by the president, she said. Under the law, the couple could divest their financial interest in the company to Hines' adult daughter while he remains in office.",
      "Marsco said these requirements won't kick in until after Trump takes office and they are officially nominated.",
      "\"Assuming they follow through with what they've said, which is that they're going to fully cooperate and divest and follow all the conflict of interest laws and rules, then that is what is frankly expected of people in their position,\" she said."

    "story": [
      "Justin Sun's investment could deliver a Trump company an eight-figure payday.",
      "A sudden infusion of $30 million into Donald Trump's nascent cryptocurrency venture from a Chinese billionaire sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly defrauding investors could potentially deliver an eight-figure payday to a company associated with the president-elect.",
      "The investment has sparked new concerns about Trump's ability to potentially profit from foreign investors, and his positions on cryptocurrency following a presidential campaign in which he vowed to make the United States \"the crypto capital of the planet.\"",
      "Justin Sun -- a cryptocurrency billionaire famous in part for his purchase of a $6 million banana art piece last month -- announced his $30 million investment in the Trump-backed World Liberty Financial last week, making him the company's largest investor.",
      "The influx of cash also triggered a provision that allows an entity affiliated with Trump to receive 75% of the company's net revenue, based on the terms outlined in a recent company filing.",
      "DT Marks DEFI LLC, a company affiliated with Trump, stands to profit more than $15 million following Sun's investment, renewing concerns about the potential influence on Trump's cryptocurrency positions and the future of the SEC lawsuit against Sun and his companies for allegedly violating securities laws. Sun and his companies have denied wrongdoing.",
      "\"It's hard to have more influence when you're talking about money in politics than someone who just directly gave you eight figures,\" said Jordan Libowitz, a vice president at the progressive watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.",
      "The investment comes as Trump recently announced a series of pro-crypto nominees for his administration, including veteran regulator and cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Silicon Valley venture capitalist David Sachs to be White House AI and crypto czar.",
      "Trump has denied all allegations that he has profited from the presidency.",
      "\"President Trump removed himself from his multi-billion-dollar real estate empire to run for office and forewent his government salary,\" Trump-Vance transition spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to ABC News. \"Unlike most politicians, President Trump didn't get into politics for profit -- he's fighting because he loves the people of this country and wants to make America great again.\"",
      "World Liberty Financial and Justin Sun did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Despite once calling cryptocurrency a \"scam,\" Trump threw his support in September behind World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance platform that could eventually be a marketplace for borrowing and lending various cryptocurrencies.",
      "\"We have to be No. 1,\" Trump said at the announcement, regarding the United States' position in the crypto market. \"I think AI is really important, but I think crypto is one of those things we have to do,\"",
      "World Liberty Financial makes money, at this time, through the sale of tokens, which gives investors a say in the company's governance; however, the tokens don't offer a share of the company's revenue and can't be resold.",
      "Trump is not an officer or employee of the company, but DT Marks DEFI LLC receives a bulk of World Liberty Financial's revenue if the venture is a success, leading some ethics experts to raise concerns that the company could be a vehicle for directing funds to Trump.",
      "\"To call it an ethical problem is to understate how fundamentally corrupt it is,\" said Robert Weissman, the co-president of consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. \"They've set up a way for people to funnel money to Donald Trump, and now it's happening.\"",
      "Two months after its launch, the company failed to make much traction in the cryptocurrency space after it faced criticism about its ambiguous business plan beyond its association with Trump. According to James Butterfill, the head of research at asset management company CoinShares, the company's early marketing materials offered little more than \"buzzwords.\"",
      "The weak launch also suggested its founders and the Trumps would make little to no money from the venture. Because World Liberty Financial had made less than $30 million in revenue prior to Sun's investment, all of the money raised by the company would be held in a reserve to cover operating expenses while the Trumps would make nothing, according to terms in the company's so-called \"gold paper.\"",
      "Enter Justin Sun, the eclectic cryptocurrency billionaire who -- prior to spending millions on a banana duct-taped to a wall -- attracted headlines for spending more than half a million dollars on an NTF of a pet rock, and $4.5 million for a lunch with Warren Buffet.",
      "His $30 million investment through Tron -- the popular cryptocurrency he founded in 2017 -- made him the largest investor in the project and fueled resurgence of interest in the once-struggling platform.",
      "\"The U.S. is becoming the blockchain hub, and Bitcoin owes it to @realDonaldTrump!\" Sun wrote on X announcing his investment.",
      "Last year the SEC sued Sun and his companies with securities fraud for allegedly manipulating the value of a cryptocurrency and paying celebrities including Lindsey Lohan, Ne-Yo, and Jake Paul to promote the assets without disclosing they had been paid. Sun and his companies have denied wrongdoing, and the celebrities have settled the case without admitting or denying the allegations.",
      "Tron and other cryptocurrencies have also faced criticism for allegedly enabling criminals to make financial transactions undetected, with a report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime calling Tron \"a preferred choice for crypto money launderers in East and Southeast.\" Tron's leadership called the report's allegation \"inaccurate\" and said it \"supports the UN's stance against malicious actors in the blockchain space.\"",
      "After his $30 million investment, World Liberty Financial named Sun an adviser, saying that his \"insights and experience will be instrumental\" to the company's growth.",
      "Weissman told ABC News he was concerned about the arrangement.",
      "\"It's exactly the sort of figure that you'd want to run away from if you were starting a business, and instead they're embracing it,\" Weissman said of World Liberty Financial and Sun.",
      "The investment could prove to be lucrative for Sun, given Trump's association with the project and the number of cryptocurrencies that have rallied following the election. On Thursday, shares of the leading cryptocurrency bitcoin surpassed $100,000 for the first time.",
      "\"With a lot of crypto, having good PR or a good kind of voice helps a lot to get something noticed, and there's no better time for World Liberty Financial,\" Butterfill said. \"The lines between the private endeavor that this is and the public connections that Trump has are quite blurred, and the kind of people running World Liberty Financial will probably play on that a little bit.\"",
      "Trump's name and likeness are seen throughout World Liberty Financial's website and marketing materials, and Trump himself is listed as the company's \"chief crypto advocate,\" though the firm discloses that neither Trump nor his family members are officers of the company. According to the company, World Liberty Financial is \"inspired\" by Trump and hopes to introduce the platform \"to a broader audience that may have previously been unfamiliar or hesitant to engage with decentralized assets and cryptocurrency.\"",
      "\"They're trying to take advantage of President-elect Trump's popularity and the fact that he just won an election, and see if they can get this business up and running and off the ground,\" said Scott Amey, general counsel at the watchdog Project on Government Oversight.",
      "Though Sun and Trump have never met, several ethics experts ABC News spoke with also raised concerns that the investment -- and Trump's possible profit from it -- could influence Trump's policy toward cryptocurrencies, including whether the Securities and Exchange Commission continues to pursue the aggressive litigation brought under the Biden administration.",
      "\"If you face charges from the SEC, it's a pretty good investment to put money in the future president's hands in order to influence who might end up making those decisions at the SEC,\" said Libowitz.",
      "Steve Witkoff, Trump's longtime friend who, along with his sons, is a co-founder of World Liberty Financial, told ABC's \"Good Morning America\" in September that Trump's foray into crypto would not pose a conflict because he would likely place his assets into a trust -- as Trump did during his first administration when he placed his assets into a revocable trust controlled by his sons and a business associate.",
      "But that arrangement would not fully remedy the concerns about conflicts stemming from Trump's crypto venture, according to multiple experts. Trump is still able to broadly understand the state of his assets, he can still profit from them, and he has the authority to regain control of the assets -- all of which limit the trust's effectiveness in preventing conflicts, several experts said.",
      "\"Absent divesting and stepping away from these investments totally, he still stands to profit from them,\" said Amey.",

I'm just putting a lot of tariffs on because you're allowing criminals to pour into our country and we can't allow that anymore.' And it stopped. It stopped. It was so fast,\" Trump said.",
      "Railing against what he called an \"invasion\" of the U.S., Trump praised his  pick for border czar Tom Homan, calling him \"central casting.\"",

    "story": [
      "A U.S. Senate subcommittee has held a hearing to question the growing use of airline fees to charge passengers for things like early boarding and better seats",
      "Members of a U.S. Senate subcommittee took aim at airline executives Wednesday for using an expanding menu of fees to charge customers for early boarding, better seats and other comforts that used to be part of the ticket price.",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said he thinks the federal government should review and perhaps fine the airlines for their use of what he called junk fees.",
      "Blumenthal, the chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said seat fees were pure profit for the airlines because they don't have to create new seats or incur other expenses by allowing customers to pick where to sit.",
      "Some senators expressed frustration during Wednesday's hearing when airline executives could not explain how they set the amount of various fees. They said the vagaries of airline pricing make it hard for consumers to budget for trips.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all captives on your airplanes at a certain point. You just say, \u2018You want to pick seat? We\u2019re just going to charge you some random amount more,\u2019\u201d Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., said. \u201cIt would be good if you guys could be transparent about what you do and why.\u201d",
      "The fees don't seem to be discouraging anybody. Americans are flying more than ever.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration reported screening nearly 3.1 million travelers at airports around the country on Sunday, a new single-day record. The 15 busiest days in TSA history have all occurred this year, with traffic at airport checkpoints up 5% over 2023.",
      "Airline executives bristle at the term \u201cjunk fees,\u201d and argue they are merely giving consumers what they want: choices.",
      "\u201cOur customers who prioritize affordability have the option to choose a lower-fare product and, in doing so, opt out of paying for additional services that they do not want,\u201d Andrew Nocella, the chief commercial officer of United Airlines, said in testimony prepared for the panel's hearing. \u201cBut we also have customers who seek more services, and they retain the ability to choose the services they value, for an incremental fee, like a seat with extra legroom or checked bags.\u201d",
      "Airlines have been adding fees on desirable seats to take advantage of increasing demand.",
      "The airline executives took offense at the charge that they are gouging travelers.",
      "\u201cIt has never been more affordable to fly,\" said Steve Johnson, chief strategy officer for American Airlines.",
      "Transportation Department figures indicate that airfares have fallen by about one-third since 2000 when taking inflation into account. However, those figures do not include fees.",
      "Senators said fees should be described clearly during the ticket-buying process. The executives said their airlines do that.",
      "Some subcommittee members also criticized airlines for the way they enforce fees.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., sparred with executives of Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines, which paid employees $26 million in bonuses for spotting customers whose carry-on bags were too big to fit under a seat. The passengers were forced to pay a fee \u2014 up to $77 on Spirit and $99 on Frontier \u2014 to use an overhead bin.",
      "\u201cIf people want to know why it\u2019s such a terrible experience to fly, this is news for them today,\u201d Hawley told the airlines executives Wednesday. \u201cYour airlines are paying millions of dollars to your employees to harass people who have already paid!\u201d",
      "Frontier Chief Commercial Officer Robert Schroeter and his counterpart at Spirit, Matthew Klein, said ensuring that people follow the rules was a matter of fairness to all passengers.",
      "When Hawley asked why bag fees may vary from one customer to another, Schroeter said Frontier must cover its costs.",
      "\u201cOverall, our job is to generate the most revenue we can so we can keep profitable as an airline,\u201d he said.",
      "U.S. airlines raised more than $7 billion from fees on checked bags last year, with American Airlines and United Airlines leading the pack. They scooped up another $1 billion in ticket-change and cancellation fees, although that was about one-third of what they raised before the coronavirus pandemic, when the biggest airlines dropped change fees.",
      "Exact figures on other types of fees are hard to determine, but the Senate panel reported last week that United, American, Delta Air Lines, Frontier and Spirit collected a combined total of more than $12 billion in seat fees between 2018 and 2023. That included charges for things such as more legroom or an aisle seat near the front of the plane.",
      "Airline fees have been a frequent target of criticism by the Biden administration, all the way up to President Joe Biden.",
      "A Transportation Department rule that took effect in October requires airlines to make automatic cash refunds for tickets and fees when flights are canceled.",
      "The airline industry is suing to block another regulation requiring more prominent disclosure of baggage and cancellation fees. An appeals court has blocked that rule, and its fate is uncertain under President-elect Donald Trump. Blumenthal asked the five executives to drop the lawsuit. None agreed to do so.",
      "The airline industry and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg have continued to fight over fees and other regulations, even after the November election."

      "President Joe Biden has presided over his final Christmas tree lighting at the White House",
      "WASHINGTON -- As he presided over his final Christmas tree lighting at the White House, President Joe Biden on Thursday said his wish for the nation now, and always, was that \u201cwe continue to seek the light of liberty and love, kindness and compassion, dignity and decency.\u201d",
      "Biden spoke briefly to the crowd who were decked out in heavy winter layers as frigid winds and chilly temperatures hit the nation's capital. Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, were also in attendance. The tree has been set up on the Ellipse outside the White House South Lawn, and it's visible on the streets.",
      "The 30-foot red spruce tree came from Mount Rogers National Recreation Area in Grayson County, Virginia. It was transferred to the White House on Nov. 15.",
      "It\u2019s the final holiday stretch for Biden. His wife, Jill, has decked out the White House with whimsical decorations to evoke the \u201cpeace and light\u201d of the season. She missed the lighting this year because she was in Doha, Qatar, where she was discussing her initiative on women\u2019s health.",
      "So Biden did the honors himself, counting down from five before the tree light up a cheery bright green from the tip-top to the bottom of the trunk. He wished the crowd a Merry Christmas before stepping down to take his seat for musical performances.",
      "Biden said the theme reflects the \u201cpeace we feel as we pause and reflect our on blessings and the light we see as we gather with loved ones and cherish our time together.\u201d",
      "The tree lighting ceremony is an annual tradition. On Thursday, Trombone Shorty and Trisha Yearwood were among the performers.",
      "The White House Christmas display includes a towering tree surrounded by an amusement park-style carousel, brass-colored bells and sleigh bells lining a hallway, and a ceiling design that mimics snowfall.",
      "That tree came from a farm in Newland, North Carolina, where Hurricane Helene struck earlier this year. The Cartner\u2019s Christmas Tree Farm, which had stood for decades, lost thousands of trees to a mudslide.",

    "summary": "The judge overseeing the trial of a man accused of using a deadly chokehold on an unruly subway passenger has dismissed the top charge in the case at the request of prosecutors, allowing the jury to consider a lesser count after the panel indicated it ...",
    "story": [
      "The judge overseeing the trial of a man accused of using a deadly chokehold on an unruly subway passenger has dismissed the top charge in the case at the request of prosecutors, allowing the jury to consider a lesser count after the panel indicated it ...",
      "NEW YORK -- The judge overseeing the trial of a man accused of using a deadly chokehold on an unruly New York subway passenger dismissed the top charge in the case on Friday at prosecutors' request, allowing jurors to consider a lesser count after they deadlocked on whether Daniel Penny was guilty of manslaughter.",
      "Judge Maxwell Wiley's decision will let jurors deliberate a charge of criminally negligent homicide, which carries a lighter punishment.",
      "\u201cWhether that makes any difference or not, I have no idea. But I\u2019m going to direct you to focus your deliberations on count two,\u201d he said, before directing them to \u201cgo home and think about something else.\u201d",
      "The judge\u2019s decision came hours after Manhattan jurors sent him a note saying they couldn't agree on a manslaughter verdict. Jurors previously were instructed that they needed to reach a verdict on the top charge before they could consider the lesser count.",
      "Jurors have been deliberating since Tuesday on whether to convict Penny in the death of Jordan Neely. Penny, a former U.S. Marine, placed Neely in a chokehold for about six minutes on a New York City subway in May 2023 after Neely got on the car yelling and asking people for money.",
      "Manslaughter requires proving a defendant recklessly caused another person\u2019s death, and carries up to 15 years. Criminally negligent homicide involves engaging in serious \u201cblameworthy conduct\u201d while not perceiving such a risk and carries punishments ranging from probation to up to four years in prison.",
      "Penny\u2019s lawyers objected to the dismissal, saying it would encourage district attorneys to pursue more serious charges before grand juries, knowing they can seek dismissal of them at trial. Defense lawyer Thomas Kenniff called it a \u201csignificant policy concern.\u201d",
      "Shortly before taking a lunch break Friday, the jury also requested clarification on how they determine whether a person reasonably believes physical force to be necessary.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d like to better understand the term \u2018reasonable person,\u2019\u201d their note read in part.",
      "Wiley told the jury it was for them to decide what a reasonable person would do in the situation \u2014 whether a person would have reasonably believed Neely was about to use physical force against Penny or someone else.",
      "The jury made several other requests to the judge since entering deliberations.",
      "They asked to review the police and bystander video at the center of the trial. They requested a readout of a city medical examiner\u2019s testimony. They also asked the judge to re-read the criminal definitions of recklessness and negligence in open court and be provided with written copies of the statutes.",
      "Neely, 30, was a sometime subway performer with a tragic life story: His mother was killed and stuffed in a suitcase when he was a teenager. His adult life spiraled into homelessness, psychiatric hospitalizations, drug abuse and criminal convictions, including for assaulting people at subway stations.",
      "Penny, 26, went on to study architecture. He is white. Neely was Black.",
      "Penny\u2019s lawyers have said he was protecting himself and other subway passengers from a volatile, mentally ill man who was making alarming remarks and gestures. Prosecutors said Penny reacted far too forcefully to someone he perceived as a peril, not a person.",
      "During the monthlong trial, the anonymous jury heard from witnesses, police, pathologists, a Marine Corps instructor who trained Penny in chokehold techniques, as well as Penny\u2019s relatives, friends and fellow Marines. Penny chose not to testify.",
      "The case became a flashpoint in the nation\u2019s debate over racial injustice and crime, as well as the city\u2019s ongoing struggle to deal with homelessness and mental health crises in a transit system used by millions of New Yorkers every day.",
      "There were sometimes dueling demonstrations outside the courthouse, and high-profile Republican politicians portrayed Penny as a hero while prominent Democrats went to Neely\u2019s funeral.",

    "story": [
      "A 7_0 magnitude earthquake struck in what's known as California's \u201cearthquake country.\u201d",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Valerie Starkey was driving through Northern California to visit relatives when she suddenly felt shaking and feared her car had broken down, only to realize later that it was an earthquake so powerful that it triggered a tsunami warning for hundreds of miles of the U.S. West Coast.",
      "The epicenter of Thursday's 7.0 magnitude shaker occurred in what\u2019s known as California\u2019s \u201cearthquake country\u201d because it\u2019s where three tectonic plates meet. The temblor was the most powerful to rattle the state since a 7.1-magnitude quake hit Ridgecrest in 2019.",
      "Its intensity shocked Starkey and many of the 5.3 million other people along nearly 500 miles (805 kilometers) of the California and Oregon coasts who were under the tsunami warning for about an hour. It was lifted after no major waves arrived.",
      "\u201cI thought my axles had fallen apart,\u201d said Starkey, a Del Norte County supervisor representing Crescent City, a town of fewer than 6,000 near the Oregon border. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was feeling ... \u2018My axles are broken now.\u2019 I did not realize it was an earthquake.\u201d",
      "The quake struck at 10:44 a.m. west of Ferndale, a small city in coastal Humboldt County, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) from the Oregon border, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The shaking knocked items off grocery store shelves and sent children scrambling under desks at schools.",
      "It was felt as far south as San Francisco, some 270 miles (435 kilometers) away, where residents described a rolling motion for several seconds. It was followed by multiple smaller aftershocks. There were no immediate reports of major damage or injuries from the quake.",
      "The tsunami warning issued shortly after the quake struck spanned from the edge of California\u2019s Monterey Bay north into Oregon.",
      "\u201cIt was a strong quake. Our building shook. We\u2019re fine, but I have a mess to clean up right now,\u201d said Julie Kreitzer, owner of Golden Gait Mercantile, a store packed with food, wares and souvenirs that is a main attraction in Ferndale.",
      "\"I have to go. I have to try and salvage something for the holidays because it\u2019s going to be a tough year,\u201d Kreitzer said before hanging up.",
      "The region \u2014 known for its redwood forests, scenic mountains and the three-county Emerald Triangle\u2019s legendary marijuana crop \u2014 was struck by a magnitude 6.4 quake in 2022 that left thousands of people without power and water. The northwest corner of California is the most seismically active part of the state because it\u2019s where three tectonic plates meet, seismologist Lucy Jones said on the social media platform BlueSky.",
      "Shortly after the quake, phones in Northern California buzzed with the tsunami warning from the National Weather Service that said: \u201cA series of powerful waves and strong currents may impact coasts near you. You are in danger. Get away from coastal waters. Move to high ground or inland now. Keep away from the coast until local officials say it is safe to return.\u201d",
      "Numerous cities urged people to evacuate to higher ground as a precaution.",
      "In Santa Cruz, authorities cleared the main beach, taping off entrances with police tape. Aerial footage showed cars bumper-to-bumper heading to higher ground on California highways 1 and 92 in the Half Moon Bay area south of San Francisco.",
      "Cindy Vosburg, the executive director for the Crescent City-Del Norte County Chamber of Commerce, said she heard alarms sound just before shaking began, and the city's cultural center downtown started to creak.",
      "\u201cJust as it would start to subside, the building would roll again,\" Vosburg said.",
      "White House spokesperson Jeremy Edwards said President Joe Biden was briefed on the earthquake and that FEMA officials are in touch with their state and local counterparts in California and Oregon.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom signed off on a state of emergency declaration to quickly move state resources to impacted areas along the coast. State officials were concerned about damage in the northern part of the state, Newsom said.",
      "Crews in Eureka, the biggest city in the region, were assessing if there was any damage. Eureka Mayor Kim Bergel, who works at a middle school, said lights were swaying and everyone got under desks.",
      "\u201cThe kids were so great and terrified. It seemed to go back and forth for quite a long time,\u201d she said. Some children asked, \u201cCan I call my mom?\"",
      "The students were later sent home.",
      "Humboldt County Sheriff William Honsal said residents experienced cracks in their homes\u2019 foundations, as well as broken glass and windows, but nothing severe.",
      "Honsal said he was in his office in the 75-year-old courthouse in downtown Eureka when he felt the quake.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re used to it. It is known as \u2018earthquake country\u2019 up here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a sharp jolt. It was a slow roller, but significant.\u201d",
      "The San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District, known as BART, stopped traffic in all directions through the underwater tunnel between San Francisco and Oakland, and the San Francisco Zoo\u2019s visitors were evacuated.",
      "This quake was a strike-slip type of temblor that shifts more horizontally and is less prone to cause tsunamis, unlike the more vertical types, said National Weather Service tsunami program manager Corina Allen in Washington state.",

      "TikTok\u2019s future in the U.S. appeared uncertain on Friday after a federal appeals court rejected a legal challenge the company brought against a law that requires it to cut ties with its China-based parent company or be banned by mid-January",
      "TikTok's future in the U.S. appeared uncertain on Friday after a federal appeals court rejected a legal challenge to a law that requires the social media platform to cut ties with its China-based parent company or be banned by mid-January.",
      "A panel of three judges on The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled unanimously that the law withstood constitutional scrutiny, rebuffing arguments from the two companies that the statute violated their rights and the rights of TikTok users in the U.S.",
      "The government has said it wants ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, to divest its stakes. But if it doesn't and the platform goes away, it would have a seismic impact on the lives of content creators who rely on the platform for income as well as users who use it for entertainment and connection.",
      "Here are some details on the ruling and what could happen next:",
      "In their lawsuit, TikTok and ByteDance, which is also a plaintiff in the case, had challenged the law on various fronts, arguing in part that the statute ran afoul of the First Amendment and was an unconstitutional bill of attainder that unfairly targeted the two companies.",
      "But the court sided with attorneys for the Justice Department who said that the government was attempting to address national security concerns and the way in which it chose to do so did not violate the constitution.",
      "The Justice Department has argued in court that TikTok poses a national security risk due to its connections to China. Officials say that Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread, or suppress, information. However, the U.S. hasn't publicly provided examples of that happening.",
      "The appeals court ruling, written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg, said the law was \u201ccarefully crafted to deal only with control by a foreign adversary.\" The judges also rejected the claim that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Furthermore, Ginsburg wrote the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to \u201csuppress content or require a certain mix of content\u201d on TikTok.",
      "TikTok and ByteDance are expected to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, but it's unclear whether the court will take up the case.",
      "TikTok indicated in a statement on Friday the two companies are preparing to take their case to high court, saying the Supreme Court has \u201can established historical record of protecting Americans\u2019 right to free speech.\"",
      "\"We expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\u201d a company spokesperson said.",
      "Alan Morrison, a professor at The George Washington University Law School, said he expects the Supreme Court to take up the case because of the novelty of the issues raised in the lawsuit. If that happens, attorneys for the two companies still have to convince the court to grant them an emergency stay that will prevent the government from enforcing the Jan. 19 divestiture deadline stipulated in the law, Morrison said.",
      "Such a move could drag out the process until the Justices make a ruling.",
      "Tiffany Cianci, a TikTok content creator who has supported the platform, said she was not shocked about the outcome of the court's ruling on Friday because lower courts typically defer to the executive branch on these types of cases. She believes the company will have a stronger case at the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cI believe that the next stages are more likely to produce a victory for TikTokers and for TikTok as a whole,\u201d Cianci said.",
      "Another wild card is President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the recent presidential campaign that he is now against such action.",
      "The Trump transition team has not offered details on how Trump plans to carry out his pledge to \u201csave TikTok.\" But spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement last month that he plans to \u201cdeliver\u201d on his campaign promises.",
      "After Trump takes office on Jan. 20th, it would fall on his Justice Department to enforce the law and punish any potential violators. Penalties would apply to any app stores that would violate a prohibition on TikTok and to internet hosting services which would be barred from supporting it.",
      "Some have speculated that Trump could ask his Justice Department to abstain from enforcing the law. But tech companies like Apple and Google, which offer TikTok's app on their app stores, would then have to trust that the administration would not come after them for any violations.",
      "Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said enforcement discretion \u2014 or executive orders \u2014 can not override existing law, leaving Trump with \u201climited room for unilateral action.\"",
      "There are other things Trump could potentially do. It's possible he could invoke provisions of the law that allow the president to determine whether a sale or a similar transaction frees TikTok from \u201cforeign adversary\u201d control. Another option is to urge Congress to repeal the law. But that too would require support from congressional Republicans who have overwhelmingly supported the prospect of getting TikTok out of the hands of a Chinese company.",
      "In a statement issued Friday, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, said he was \u201coptimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok\u201d and allow its continued use in the United States.",
      "ByteDance has said it won't sell TikTok. And even if it wanted to, a sale of the proprietary algorithm that powers TikTok is likely to get blocked under Chinese export controls that the country issued in 2020.",
      "That means if TikTok is sold without the algorithm, its likely that the buyer would only purchase a shell of the platform that doesn't contain the technology that made the app a cultural powerhouse.",
      "Still, some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in buying it.",
      "This week, a spokesperson for McCourt\u2019s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital. The spokesperson did not disclose the identity of the participants."

      "The man on trial in the killing of University of Mississippi student Jimmie \u201cJay\u201d Lee gave conflicting information to police about how well he and Lee knew each other",
      "The man on trial in the killing of University of Mississippi student Jimmie \u201cJay\u201d Lee gave conflicting information to police about how well he and Lee knew each other, according to testimony Friday by an officer who helped lead the investigation.",
      "Lee disappeared July 8, 2022, in Oxford, Mississippi, and police interviewed Sheldon \u201cTimothy\u201d Herrington Jr. two weeks later. Two officers talked to Herrington at his Oxford apartment and then took him to a police building and did another interview after advising him of his rights, said Shane Fortner, one of the officers involved.",
      "In the first interview, Herrington said he knew Lee but \"did not have any kind of sexual relationship with him,\u201d said Fortner, who was the Oxford Police Department's lieutenant in charge of criminal investigations in July 2022 and is now the city's emergency management director.",
      "During the second interview, Herrington said he and Lee had a \u201cdeeper relationship\u201d and that they had a sexual encounter just hours before Lee disappeared, Fortner said. Fortner said that statement made him think Herrington had lied during the first interview.",
      "Lee, 20, of Jackson, Mississippi, was a gay man well known in the LGBTQ+ community at Ole Miss and in Oxford, where the university is located and Herrington\u2019s trial is being held. Herrington, now 24, of Grenada, Mississippi, is charged with capital murder.",
      "Lee\u2019s body has never been found, but a judge has declared him dead. Herrington maintains his own innocence.",
      "Before police interviewed Herrington, investigators had already found security camera video footage showing a man they believe was him jogging out of the parking lot where Lee's car was found, Fortner said. Police also had read sexually explicit Snapchat messages exchanged between accounts belonging to Lee and Herrington.",
      "According to police body camera footage shown in court Friday in Oxford, Herrington talked to two officers without having an attorney present.",
      "Fortner said the officers asked Herrington what he thought had happened to Lee, and Herrington said Lee could have gone to have casual sex with somebody and then been kidnapped.",
      "\u201cI think what happened is, Tim described what he did to Jay Lee,\u201d Fortner said.",
      "Herrington \u201cwas not openly in the LGBTQ community,\u201d but evidence will show he had a relationship with Lee and is responsible for the death, assistant district attorney Gwen Agho said during opening arguments Tuesday.",
      "Herrington\u2019s attorney, Kevin Horan, told jurors that prosecutors have \u201czero\u201d proof Lee was killed.",
      "The same day Lee disappeared, his car was towed from the Molly Barr Trails apartment complex in Oxford, where neither he nor Herrington lived.",
      "Herrington said in his first police interview that he had not been to that complex for months because it was common for vehicles there to be towed away, Fortner said. Investigators had already seen security camera footage that showed a man they believe was Herrington jogging out of the Molly Barr Trails parking lot a few minutes after Lee\u2019s car arrived.",
      "Both Herrington and Lee had graduated from the University of Mississippi. Lee was pursuing a master\u2019s degree. He was known for his creative expression through fashion and makeup and often performed in drag shows in Oxford, according to a support group called Justice for Jay Lee.",
      "Prosecutors have announced they do not intend to pursue the death penalty, meaning Herrington could get a life sentence if convicted. Mississippi law defines capital murder as a killing committed along with another felony \u2014 in this case, kidnapping."

      "New Mexico environmental regulators have issued a $47.8 million fine on allegations of excess air pollution at a natural gas processing facility in a prolific oil production region",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- New Mexico environmental regulators on Friday issued a $47.8 million fine on allegations of excess air pollution at a natural gas processing facility in a prolific oil production region near the Texas state line.",
      "The state Environment Department issued the sanctions including a cease and desist order against Houston-based Targa Resources at its processing plant near Jal, New Mexico, alleging permit violations and excess emissions of gases known to cause respiratory issues or contribute to climate change including ozone-producing pollutants.",
      "Representatives for Targa could not immediately be reached for comment. Regulators say Targa has 30 days to respond and comply or request a hearing with the agency secretary.",
      "Regulators also have ordered a series of corrective actions and improvements to the facilities that process gas for transmission by pipeline.",
      "The sanctions are based on allegations of two permit violations, late reporting of emissions and an incomplete requirement for a root cause analysis of excess pollution.",

      "Military leaders are rattled by a list of \u201cwoke\u201d senior officers that a conservative group is urging Pete Hegseth to dismiss for promoting diversity in the ranks if he is confirmed to lead the Pentagon",
      "WASHINGTON -- Military leaders are rattled by a list of \u201cwoke\u201d senior officers that a conservative group urged Pete Hegseth to dismiss for promoting diversity in the ranks if he is confirmed to lead the Pentagon.",
      "The list compiled by the American Accountability Foundation includes 20 general officers or senior admirals and a disproportionate number of female officers. It has had a chilling effect on the Pentagon\u2019s often frank discussions as leaders try to figure out how to address the potential firings and diversity issues under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Those on the list in many cases seem to be targeted for public comments they made either in interviews or at events on diversity, and in some cases for retweeting posts that promote diversity.",
      "Tom Jones, a former aide to Republican senators who leads the foundation, said Friday that those on the list are \u201cpretty egregious\u201d advocates for diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, policies, which he called problematic.",
      "\u201cThe nominee has been pretty clear that that has no place in the military,\u201d Jones said of Hegseth.",
      "Hegseth has embraced Trump\u2019s effort to end programs that promote diversity in the ranks and fire those who reflect those values. Other Trump picks, like Kash Patel for FBI director, have suggested targeting those in government who are not aligned with Trump.",
      "But Hegseth has been fighting to save his nomination as he faces allegations of excessive drinking and sexual assault and over his views questioning the role of women in combat. He spent the week on Capitol Hill trying to win the support of Republican senators, who must confirm him to lead the Pentagon, doing a radio interview and penning an opinion column.",
      "Some service members have complained in the past about the Pentagon's DEI programs, saying they add to an already heavy workload. The Pentagon still has a long way to go in having a general officer corps or specialty occupations such as pilots that have a racial and gender makeup reflective of the country.",
      "A defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the list said senior leaders are hoping that once Trump is sworn in, they will be able to discuss the issue further. They are prepared to provide additional context to the incoming administration, the official told The Associated Press, which is not publishing the names to protect service members\u2019 privacy.",
      "Former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Friday that the list would have \u201cconsiderable, wide and deep consequences.\u201d He said when military members see people singled out, they will start focusing on their own survival rather than the mission or their job.",
      "\u201cYou will drive people out,\u201d Hagel said. \u201cIt affects morale as widely and deeply as anything \u2014 it creates a negative dynamic that will trickle through an organization.\"",
      "The list, which was first reported by The New York Post, includes nine Air Force general officers, seven Navy admirals of different ranks and four Army general officers. Eight of those 20 are women even though only 17% of the military is female. None are Marines.",
      "One female Navy officer was named because she gave a speech at a 2015 Women\u2019s Equality Day event, where she noted that 80% of Congress is male, which affects what bills move forward. The officer also was targeted because she said \u201cdiversity is our strength.\u201d",
      "The phrase is a widely distributed talking point that officers across the Pentagon have used for years to talk about the importance of having a military that reflects different educational, geographic, economic, gender and racial backgrounds in the country.",
      "An Air Force colonel, who is white, was called out for an opinion piece he wrote following the death of George Floyd, saying, \u201cDear white colonel, we must address our blind spots about race.\u201d",
      "A female Air Force officer was targeted because of \u201cmultiple woke posts\u201d on her X feed, including a tweet about LGBTQ rights, one about \u201cwhiteness\u201d and another about honoring the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on a stamp.",
      "Another female Air Force officer was on the list because she \u201cserved as a panelist for a diversity, equity and inclusion\u201d discussion in 2021.",
      "The list names an Army officer who traveled to 14 historically Black colleges to expand the military\u2019s intelligence recruitment efforts, and an Air Force officer partly because he co-chairs the Asian-Pacific Islander subgroup of the service\u2019s diversity task force.",
      "Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the Trump transition team, said in a statement that \u201cNo policy should be deemed official unless it comes directly from President Trump.\u201d",
      "But in an interview Wednesday for Megyn Kelly\u2019s SiriusXM satellite radio show, Hegseth said Trump told him he wanted a \u201cwarfighter\u201d who would clean out the \u201cwoke crap.\u201d",
      "Hegseth got a boost Friday from Trump, who posted on his social media site that Hegseth \u201cwill be a fantastic, high energy, Secretary of Defense.\u201d The president-elect added that \u201cPete is a WINNER, and there is nothing that can be done to change that!!!\u201d",
      "Jones told the AP in June that his American Accountability Foundation was investigating scores of federal employees suspected of being hostile to Trump's policies. The work aligns with the Heritage Foundation\u2019s far-reaching Project 2025 blueprint for a conservative administration.",
      "A letter Jones sent to Hegseth containing the list, dated Tuesday, says \u201cpurging the woke from the military is imperative.\u201d The letter points to tensions with Iran, Russia and China and says \u201cwe cannot afford to have a military distracted and demoralized by leftist ideology. Our nation\u2019s security is at stake.\u201d",
      "Conservatives view the federal workforce as overstepping its role to become a power center that can drive or thwart a president\u2019s agenda. During the first Trump administration, government officials came under attack from the White House and congressional Republicans, as Trump's own Cabinet often raised objections to some of his more singular or even unlawful proposals.",

    "story": [
      "The Associated Press and two other news organizations are suing Idaho\u2019s top prison official for increased access to lethal injection executions, saying the state is unconstitutionally hiding the actual administration of the deadly drugs from public view",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- The Associated Press and two other news organizations are suing Idaho's top prison official for increased access to lethal injection executions, saying the state is unconstitutionally hiding the actual administration of the deadly drugs from public view.",
      "The AP, The Idaho Statesman and East Idaho News filed the lawsuit against Idaho Department of Correction Director Josh Tewalt in Boise's U.S. District Court on Friday.",
      "The news organizations contend the public has a First Amendment right to witness the entire execution process, including when execution team members push the lethal injection medications into the IV lines connected to a condemned person. Idaho's prison officials have kept that part of the execution concealed behind screens or walls in each of the three executions completed in the last half-century.",
      "\u201cAt its core, this case involves the press\u2019s ability to fulfill its \u2018significant role in the proper functioning of capital punishment\u2019 by providing independent public scrutiny of the State of Idaho\u2019s execution process,\u201d attorney Wendy Olson wrote in court documents. She noted the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has repeatedly found that the public has the right to view executions from start to finish \u2014 including in a similar lawsuit brought by AP and other news organizations against Idaho officials in 2012. In that case, the appellate court ordered prison officials to allow media witnesses to watch as the IVs are inserted.",
      "\u201cThe Ninth Circuit has not minced words,\u201d Olson said, quoting from another 9th Circuit ruling from 2002: \u201cAn informed decision by the public is critical in determining whether execution by lethal injection comports with \u2018the evolving standards of decency which mark the progress of a maturing society.'\u201d",
      "Idaho Department of Correction spokeswoman Sanda Kuzeta-Cerimagic said the department had not yet been formally served with the lawsuit. But she wrote in an email that \u201cour execution practices have been repeatedly upheld, including meeting or exceeding the requirements under the First Amendment to provide an opportunity to observe the processes integral to an execution.\u201d",
      "\u201cIDOC is committed to transparency in the execution process and will continue to provide one of the most transparent execution processes in the country,\u201d Kuzeta-Cerimagic wrote.",
      "Tewalt and other prison officials have told lawmakers in the past that anything threatening the confidentiality of execution team members or the source of the state's execution drugs could put Idaho's ability to carry out capital punishment at risk, in part because it would be difficult to find qualified volunteers willing to put someone to death.",
      "The news organizations point out in the lawsuit, however, that media witnesses can already see other execution team members, though their identities are concealed by medical masks, head coverings and other devices. The same solution could be used for the execution team members tasked administering the lethal drugs, the news organizations said.",
      "Idaho has only attempted four lethal injection executions since the U.S. Supreme Court lifted a moratorium on executions in the 1970s. When Keith Eugene Wells was executed in 1994, IV lines ran from his arm to a screen, behind which execution team members used a device to deliver a cocktail of lethal drugs. In the 2011 execution of Paul Ezra Rhoades and the 2012 execution of Richard Albert Leavitt, the IV lines ran through an opening in the wall of the execution chamber, into another area that was hidden from view.",
      "The same setup was used in February, when the state attempted to execute Thomas Eugene Creech. But that execution was called off after the execution team members were unable to successfully establish an IV line despite trying eight different locations in Creech's arms and legs.",
      "In October, the state announced it would begin using central venous lines \u2014 threading a catheter through a large, deep vein until it reaches the condemned person's heart \u2014 for lethal injections if attempts to insert standard IV lines fail. Prison officials also remodeled the execution chamber to add a special \u201cexecution preparation\u201d room for the central line procedure, and installed closed-circuit cameras so that media witnesses can watch.",
      "The news organizations want a federal judge to order the state to allow media witnesses the same closed-circuit camera access to the \u201cMedical Team Room,\u201d where the lethal drug preparation and administration occurs.",
      "\u201cThere is no logical reason why the events that will take place in the Medical Team Room should fall outside the scope of the well settled First Amendment right to view an execution in its entirety,\u201d Olson wrote.",
      "\"Simply put, there is nothing more \u2018intertwined\u2019 with the execution process than the preparation and administration of the very drugs that will effectuate Idaho's most severe punishment,\" she said."

      "Crews were called to the Camp Small yard, where large trees and logs are stacked about 30 feet (about nine meters) high, after 5 p.m. Thursday, Baltimore City Fire Chief James Wallace said at a briefing.",
      "\u201cWhen they got here, they discovered a rapidly evolving fire that was in a large pile of trees and logs in a large area,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cThis stage is just that, lots of trees, logs, stumps and things like that.\u201d",
      "About 100 to 125 firefighters were battling the fire. Wallace said it was a challenge because the flames were fueled by high winds. He said firefighters planned to use heavy equipment to cut a ring around the fire once they had more control.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very, very difficult for us to get out ahead of it,\u201d Wallace said.",
      "Firefighters gained the upper hand Thursday night, and on Friday morning the fire was contained.",

      "New York City Mayor Eric Adams appears open to switching parties to become a Republican",
      "NEW YORK -- New York City Mayor Eric Adams appears open to switching parties to become a Republican, as he declined to rule out a future change in political allegiances during a pair of interviews Friday that came as he has increasing warmed to President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "The comments from Adams, the top Democrat in one of the country's most liberal cities, riled critics who have grown concerned over the mayor's increasing willingness to throw his support behind Trump and his hardline immigration policies.",
      "Adams, who faces federal corruption charges, was a registered Republican in the 1990s and early 2000s but has spent his political career as a Democrat.",
      "In a Friday morning interview with the local cable news station NY1, Adams was asked if he would consider a return to the GOP. The Democrat appeared to leave open the possibility of a switch.",
      "\u201cThe party that\u2019s the most important for me is the American party,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a part of the American party. I love this country. This is the home of the free, the land of the brave.\u201d",
      "In another interview about a half-hour later on PIX11, Adams said he would run for reelection as a Democrat but still appeared to leave some wiggle room for his future.",
      "\u201cSo no matter what party I\u2019m on or vote on, I\u2019m going to push for the American values,\" he said. \"And I think America has told us, stop the squabbling, leaders, and start leading us out of the crisis that we\u2019re facing.\u201d",
      "Adams won office on a centrist platform and has spent significant time as mayor quarreling with the progressive wing of his party. But his rhetoric has taken a noticeable rightward turn in the weeks since Trump's election victory, particularly on immigration, with Adams boosting the president-elect's platform and appearing enthusiastic about the incoming administration.",
      "Rather than restricting cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as he once promised, Adams recently expressed a willingness to roll back the city\u2019s so-called sanctuary policies, and he plans to meet with Trump\u2019s top border official over concerns about what the mayor said was the \u201crising illegal alien crime rate in New York City.\u201d",
      "He has also praised those in Trump\u2019s orbit, including Elon Musk, who has claimed falsely that Democrats are illegally \u201cimporting\u201d migrants to garner votes.",
      "\u201cThis is a racehorse that wanted to run its right pace and we\u2019ve been holding back that racehorse out of fear of being canceled,\u201d Adams said of the country Tuesday. \u201cAnd now you have a bunch of people who are not afraid of being canceled.\u201d",
      "The shift comes as Adams is trying to fight off an indictment on federal corruption charges while governing the city and gearing up to run for a second term. Adams has pleaded not guilty in his criminal case, in which he has been accused of accepting free or discounted overseas trips and illegal campaign contributions from people looking to gain his influence, including people connected to Turkey or the Turkish government.",
      "Adams\u2019 critics have seized on his recent comments about the Trump administration as a move toward self-preservation, accusing the mayor of cozying up to the next president in an effort to secure a pardon in his corruption case.",
      "\u201cEric Adams continues to sound more like he is auditioning for a job in right-wing media than running for reelection in a Democratic primary,\u201d said Zohran Mamdani, a state assembly member who is challenging against Adams in the mayoral primary. \u201cEric Adams is in City Hall because Democratic voters sent him there. To serve his own narrow self-interests, he is clearly prepared to betray them.\u201d",
      "Zellnor Myrie, a state senator who is also challenging Adams in the primary, said \u201cat a time when the Republican Party has never been more out of line with New York values, we need a mayor who isn\u2019t scared to call himself a Democrat.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead of playing footsie with the next president, we need a mayor with the courage to stand up for our city,\u201d Myrie wrote on X.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump is offering a public show of support for Pete Hegseth, his embattled choice to lead the Pentagon",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump on Friday offered a public show of support for Pete Hegseth, his embattled choice to lead the Defense Department, whose confirmation by the Senate is in doubt as he faces questions over allegations of excessive drinking, sexual assault and his views on women in combat.",
      "Hegseth, a former Fox News Host, Army National Guard major and combat veteran, spent much of the week on Capitol Hill trying to salvage his Cabinet nomination and privately reassure Republican senators that he is fit to lead Trump\u2019s Pentagon.",
      "\u201cPete Hegseth is doing very well,\u201d Trump posted on his social media site. \u201cHe will be a fantastic, high energy, Secretary of Defense.\" The president added, \"Pete is a WINNER, and there is nothing that can be done to change that!!!\u201d",
      "Trump told NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in an interview recorded Friday that he believes Hegseth will be confirmed and that he still has confidence in him.",
      "\u201cPete is doing well now,\u201d the president-elect said in an excerpt of the interview set to air Sunday. \u201cI mean, people were a little bit concerned. He's a young guy with a tremendous track record.\u201d",
      "He said senators have called him to tell him that Hegseth is fantastic. Trump also cast doubt on reports of alcohol misuse by Hegseth, saying he has spoken to people who know him well and has been assured Hegseth doesn't have a drinking problem.",
      "The pitched nomination battle over Hegseth is emerging not only as a debate about the best person to lead the Pentagon, but also at a key moment for a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement that appears to be relishing a public fight over its hard-line push for a more masculine military and an end to the \u201cwoke-ism\" of diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.",
      "Trump\u2019s allies are forcefully rallying around the embattled Hegseth \u2014 the Heritage Foundation\u2019s political arm is promising to spend $1 million to shore up his nomination \u2014 as he vows to stay in the fight, as long as the president-elect wants him to.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not abandoning this nomination,\u201d Vice-President-elect JD Vance said as he toured post-hurricane North Carolina.",
      "\u201cPete Hegseth is going to get his hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, not a sham hearing before the American media,\" Vance said. He said he had spoken with GOP senators and he believes Hegseth will be confirmed. \"We are completely behind him.\u201d",
      "The effort has become a test of Trump\u2019s clout and of how far loyalty for the president-elect goes with Republican senators who have concerns about his nominees. Two of Trump's other choices have stepped aside as they faced intense scrutiny: former congressman Matt Gaetz, his first choice for attorney general, and Chad Chronister, a Florida sheriff who was Trump\u2019s first choice to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration.",
      "The president's son Donald Trump Jr. also made a show of support for Hegseth on Friday, part of a full-court MAGA press.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re a GOP Senator who voted for Lloyd Austin, but criticize @PeteHegseth, then maybe you\u2019re in the wrong political party!\u201d he wrote on X. referring to President Joe Biden's defense secretary.",
      "Thanking the president-elect for the support, Hegseth posted on social media, \u201cLike you, we will never back down.\u201d",
      "Hegseth has promised not to drink on the job and told lawmakers he never engaged in sexual misconduct, even as his professional views on female troops have also come under intensifying scrutiny. He said as recently as last month that women \u201cstraight up\u201d should not serve in combat.",
      "He picked up one important endorsement from Republican Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama, whose support was seen as a potentially powerful counterweight to the cooler reception Hegseth had received from Sen. Joni Ernst, herself a former Army National Guard lieutenant colonel.",
      "\u201cHuge. Thanks to Katie for her leadership,\u201d Vance posted on social media.",
      "Ernst, who is also a sexual assault survivor, stopped short of an endorsement after her meeting with Hegseth this week. On Friday, Ernst posted on X that she and Hegseth would continue having \u201cconstructive conversations\u201d as the process moves forward. She said she would meet with him again next week.",
      "\u201cAt a minimum, we agree that he deserves the opportunity to lay out his vision for our warfighters at a fair hearing,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Trump put out the statement Friday in response to coverage saying he had lost faith in Hegseth, according to a person familiar with his thinking who was not authorized to discuss it publicly.",
      "The president-elect and his team have been pleased to see Hegseth putting up a fight and his performance this week reiterates why he was chosen, the person said. They believe he can still be confirmed.",
      "If Hegseth goes down, Trump's team believes the defeat would empower others to spread what they cast as \u201cvicious lies\u201d against every candidate Trump chooses.",
      "Still, Trump's transition team has been looking at potential replacements if Hegseth's nomination cannot move forward, including former presidential rival Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
      "DeSantis plans to attend the Army-Navy football game with Trump on Dec. 14, according to a person familiar with the Florida governor\u2019s plans who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss them before a public announcement.",
      "And DeSantis and Trump had spoken about the defense secretary post when they saw each other Tuesday at a memorial service for sheriff deputies in West Palm Beach, Florida, according to people familiar with the matter who said Trump was interested in DeSantis for the post, and the governor was receptive.",
      "At the same time, DeSantis also is poised to select a replacement for the expected Senate vacancy to be created by Marco Rubio becoming secretary of state, and Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law Lara Trump is seen as the preferred choice by those in Trump\u2019s orbit.",
      "Despite a weeklong push of private Capitol Hill meetings, Hegseth is facing resistance from senators as reports have emerged about his past, including the revelation that he made a settlement payment after being accused of a sexual assault that he denies.",
      "The New Yorker cited what it described as a whistleblower report and other documents about his time leading a veterans advocacy group, Concerned Veterans for America, that alleged multiple incidents of alcohol intoxication at work events, inappropriate behavior around female staffers and financial mismanagement.",
      "The New York Times obtained an email from his mother Penelope from 2018, in which she confronted him about mistreating women after he impregnated his current wife while he was married to his second wife. She went on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d this week to defend her son.",
      "Trump ally Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said senators are judging \u201cPete for who he is today.\u201d",
      "In many ways the increasingly pitched battle resembles the political and culture wars that exploded over Trump\u2019s pick of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court during his first term at the White House.",
      "Kavanaugh had also faced allegations of sexual assault that he strenuously denied, but Republicans rallied to his side and turned a tide of opposition into a more sympathetic view of the Supreme Court nominee as the victim of a liberal-led smear campaign. He eventually won confirmation.",
      "While Hegseth was still fighting for votes in the Senate, he did appear to make incremental progress with some Republicans who had expressed concerns about the reports of his drinking, in particular.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to make any decision regarding Pete Hegseth\u2019s nomination based on anonymous sources,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.",
      "North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer said of the allegations against Hegseth, \u201cI have no reason to doubt him any more than believe somebody else.\u201d",
      "Still, Cramer indicated he could still change his mind. A background check \u201cwill be informative.\u201d",
      "Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said after meeting with Hegseth that he wanted to see how he does in a hearing but \u201che went a long way\u201d toward getting his support.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 20:18:35 -0500",
    "summary": "A rare and brief tsunami warning tested city and county responses in Northern California after a 7.0 magnitude earthquake shook part of the state",
    "story": [
      "A rare and brief tsunami warning tested city and county responses in Northern California after a 7.0 magnitude earthquake shook part of the state",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Northern California was under a rare and brief tsunami warning alert Thursday that tested local emergency notification systems after a 7.0 magnitude earthquake shook part of the state.",
      "The National Weather Service canceled its alert after roughly an hour and before the tsunami was expected to arrive. In that hour, some cities and counties ordered evacuations while others relied on social media and text messages to inform people of the warning. Some people headed for higher ground, while others drove to the beach to get a better view.",
      "People took to social media to figure out why a warning was issued and then canceled so quickly, and how the NWS determines when to send alerts. Here are answers to more questions.",
      "The word for tsunami comes from the Japanese characters for harbor and wave. It's a series of extremely long waves set in motion when energy from an earthquake causes the ocean floor to suddenly rise or fall, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Since 1800, California's shores have been struck by more than 150 tsunamis, most of them minor, according to the California Geological Survey.",
      "Phones buzzed Thursday when the National Weather Service issued its warning just minutes after the quake struck west of Ferndale, a small city in coastal Humboldt County.",
      "It read in part: \u201cYou are in danger. Get away from coastal waters. Move to high ground or inland now.\u201d",
      "The National Weather Service Bay Area posted on the social platform X early Friday that the region doesn't get tsunami alerts often and \u201cthere are lot of questions, frustration, and even some anger\u201d about Thursday's event.",
      "A warning alert is the most serious of four tsunami alerts, including a watch alert for a possible tsunami and an advisory alert telling people to stay out of the water and away from the shore. The last time California received a warning alert was 2011 when an earthquake in Japan caused about $100 million in damages along the California coast.",
      "Basically, a distant, offshore earthquake or other trigger event gives scientists more time to analyze data and confirm that a large tsunami was generated before sounding a warning.",
      "But Thursday\u2019s earthquake was local and close to the coast, forcing a hasty high-level alert in order to give people the maximum time to prepare as tsunami waves can travel very fast, up to 500 mph (800 kph) in the deep ocean, the NWS wrote.",
      "\u201cBy the time we actually observe it, it may be too late, because it's right there in our back doors,\u201d said Dalton Behringer, a meteorologist with NWS Bay Area, on Friday.",
      "Scientists used the time Thursday to monitor buoys and get more information on the earthquake itself, he said. They canceled the alert after seeing little sea-level change and determining the quake was a strike-slip type of temblor that shifts more horizontally and is less prone to cause tsunamis, he said.",
      "\u201cThese things happen so infrequently for us, I think it just caught a lot of people off-guard,\u201d he said.",
      "Authorities in Eureka, the biggest city in Humboldt County, sent texts and went door-to-door to order businesses in high-risk areas to evacuate, said City Manager Miles Slattery.",
      "He said only a small portion of the city was at risk, and Thursday's test run showed evacuees need to work on leaving by foot, rather than by car.",
      "In the San Francisco Bay Area, the commuter light-rail system known as BART stopped traffic in all directions through the underwater tunnel between San Francisco and Oakland for nearly an hour, and the San Francisco Zoo\u2019s visitors were evacuated.",
      "Responses varied as fire and police in Berkeley evacuated certain areas of the city while in San Francisco, officials sent alerts and messages on social media telling residents to stay away from water, beaches, harbors, marina docks, and piers. \u201cMove at least one block inland,\u201d said the San Francisco Department of Emergency Management.",
      "Emergency personnel in vehicles with public address systems also went to make sure no one was on beaches and other low-lying areas. But some critics said San Francisco should have sounded its loud emergency sirens, which have been off-line since 2019 for repairs.",
      "In San Mateo County, just south of San Francisco, officials considered but decided against sounding its tsunami warning sirens after receiving more comprehensive information from the NWS that any tsunami would affect coastlines north of the Golden Gate Bridge, said Michelle Durand, a spokesperson for the county.",
      "Fire and police cleared the beaches while emergency personnel gathered to monitor the situation, she said, which \u201cprioritized both public safety and the prevention of unnecessary panic.\u201d"

      "Police officials say the gunman who killed the CEO of the largest U.S. health insurer likely left New York City on a bus soon after fleeing the scene on a bicycle and hopping in a cab",
      "NEW YORK -- The gunman who killed the CEO of the largest U.S. health insurer likely left New York City on a bus soon after the brazen ambush that has shaken corporate America, police officials said Friday. But he left something behind: a backpack that was discovered in Central Park.",
      "Three days after the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, police still did not know the gunman's name or whereabouts or have a motive for the killing, Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told reporters. Investigators were looking at whether the shooter may have been a disgruntled employee or client of the insurer, he said.",
      "The FBI announced Friday night it was offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction.",
      "Video of the gunman fleeing Wednesday's shooting showed him riding a bicycle into Central Park and later taking a taxi to a bus terminal that offers commuter service to New Jersey and Greyhound routes to Philadelphia, Boston and Washington, D.C, according to Kenny.",
      "Police have video of the man entering the bus station but no video of him exiting, leading them to believe he left the city, Kenny said.",
      "Investigators on Friday found a backpack in the park that had been worn by the gunman during the shooting, police said, following a massive sweep to find it in a vast area with lakes and ponds, meadows, playgrounds and woods.",
      "Police didn\u2019t immediately reveal what, if anything, it contained but said it would be analyzed for clues.",
      "The gunman made sure to conceal his identity with a mask during almost all of his time in the city, including during the attack and while he ate, yet left a trail of evidence in view of the nation\u2019s biggest city and its network of security cameras.",
      "The gunman arrived in New York City on Nov. 24 and shot Thompson 10 days later outside his company\u2019s annual investor conference at a hotel just blocks from Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center.",
      "The gunman got off a bus that originated in Atlanta and made several stops along the way, Kenny said. Police have not determined where he got on the bus. Investigators have a list of passengers, but none of them would have had to provide an ID when they climbed aboard, Kenny said.",
      "Investigators believe the suspect used a fake identification card and paid cash, Kenny said, when he checked in at the hostel, which has a caf\u00e9 along with shared and private rooms and is blocks from Columbia University.",
      "Investigators have tested a discarded water bottle and protein bar wrapper in a hunt for his DNA. They also were trying to obtain additional information from a cellphone found along the gunman's escape route.",
      "Photos of the suspected shooter that were taken in the lobby of a hostel on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side appear to from the only time he removed his mask, Kenny said. The images, showing a man smiling in the lobby of the HI New York City hostel. They are among a collection of photos and video circulated since the shooting \u2014 including footage of the attack, as well as images of the suspected gunman at a Starbucks beforehand.",
      "\"From every indication we have from witnesses, from the Starbucks, from the hostel, he kept his mask on at all times except for the one instance where we have him photographed with the mask off,\u201d Kenny said.",
      "His roommates at the hostel also said he didn't speak to them. Nothing of investigative value was found in a search of the suspected shooter's hotel room.",
      "Asked how close he felt police were to making an arrest, Kenny said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t \u2018Blue Bloods.\u2019 We\u2019re not going to solve this in 60 minutes. We\u2019re painstakingly going through every bit of evidence that we can come across. Eventually, when an apprehension is made, we will have to present all of these facts to a judge and jury, so we\u2019re taking our time, doing it right and making sure we\u2019re going to get justice for this victim and closure for his family.\u201d",
      "Security video of the shooting shows the killer approaching Thompson from behind, firing several shots with a gun equipped with a silencer, barely pausing to clear a jam while the executive fell to the sidewalk.",
      "Police were looking into the possibility that the weapon was a veterinary pistol, which is a weapon commonly used on farms and ranches if an animal has to be euthanized quietly, Kenny said \u2014 though he stressed that hadn't been confirmed.",
      "The words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were scrawled on the ammunition, one word on each of three bullets, Kenny said. A law enforcement official previously told The Associated Press the words were \u201cdeny,\u201d \u201cdefend\u201d and \u201cdepose.\" The messages mirror the phrase \u201cdelay, deny, defend,\u201d which is commonly used by lawyers and critics about insurers that delay payments, deny claims and defend their actions.",

      "A group titled RBG PAC, formed in mid-October, received a single contribution of $20.5 million from an entity entitled \u201cElon Musk Revocable Trust\u201d a week later, according to federal campaign finance reports filed this week.

      "In the closing weeks before the Nov. 5 election, the RBG PAC group ran a TV ad noting Trump\u2019s statements that he would not, as president, sign a national abortion ban, with a narrator saying he \u201cdoes support reasonable exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.\u201d",

      "Another woman said: \u201cIt does make the vibe better, because the less people [are] on their phone, engaging more with the DJ and stuff, that\u2019s the better environment to have.\"",

      "So are Britain's clubs at a turning point? Is now the time to get phones off the dancefloor and people's minds back on the music?",
      "Sacha Lord, night time economy adviser for Greater Manchester, thinks so. \"These phones are killing the dancefloor, they\u2019re killing the atmosphere,\u201d he says.",

      "\"Everyone's got their hands in the air, there's joy, there's happiness.",
      "\"Now there's these videos being posted of people standing still with their phone in the air. It's so sad,\" she says.",
      "But Dr Lee Hadlington, senior lecturer in cyberpsychology at Nottingham Trent University, says for those clubbers, \"part of their enjoyment is to document their night in terms of photos and memories\".",
      "At Amber's, phones are not banned outright but clubbers will be required to put a sticker over the camera lens to prevent photos being taken. A content team will be on hand to take and post photos online instead.",
      "People violating the rule will be \"politely asked to stop\", says Abbott. \"If you are seen doing it again, you will be asked to leave the venue.\"",
      "The rule comes at a tricky time for Britain's nightclub scene, which has struggled to recover from the numerous Covid lockdowns.",
      "Between June 2020 and June this year, the number of clubs has fallen from 1,266 to 786, according to figures from the Night Time Industries Association and research firm NeilsenIQ.",
      "Abbott concedes Amber's no phones rules is a risk but says the club has been \"blown away\" by the response.",

      "Cyberpsychologist Dr Hadlington says for these clubbers, it could be about a fear of missing out on social media action.",
      "\"The paradox is they\u2019re spending more time posting about it than they're enjoying the good time,\" he says.",
      "It might be a relatively new concept in the UK, but in Berlin, 90% of venues have a no phones on the dancefloor code, according to Lutz Leichsenring, former spokesperson for Clubcommission Berlin and co-founder of VibeLab.",
      "He says that with more tourists coming to the German capital to enjoy the scene, \"I think people really appreciated that this policy was a part of clubbing\".",
      "And, on a personal note, he says that for him, \"it is very, very weird when I\u2019m in a club where people around me take pictures and film the whole time\".",
      "Amber's is adopting the same policy that London nightclub fabric has had in place since reopening in 2021 after Covid. The venue has actually been camera-free since it opened its doors in 1999 but as technology changed and smartphones became more ubiquitous it has tweaked its policy.",
      "\"When people come in at the point of search, we put a sticker on the camera lens and just really sort of invite people not to use it, that's all it is,\" says fabric's co-founder Cameron Leslie.",
      "He says for the most part clubbers abide by the rule. \"It\u2019s not an aggressive enforcement,\" he says. \"We have posters up in the club and then beyond that if people do use it and our team do see them we invite them not to.\"",
      "Smokin Jo reckons there are steps DJs can take themselves.",
      "\u201cMaybe DJs need to have a clause in their contract saying \u2018I\u2019ll do the gig but you need to have some sort of policy\u2019 because we\u2019re losing the identity of the scene and the roots of it.\"",
      "Fellow DJ Graeme Park thinks there is no easy answer to smartphones in nightclubs but says: \u201cIt is a really, really good thing that people are talking about it.",

      "Liberal Democrat MP Tom Gordon has written to the energy secretary calling for \"decisive action\", while the Department for Energy Security has said it is consulting with lenders.",
      "Estimates suggest as many as 250,000 homes in the UK have this type of insulation, with some of it installed under the previous government's official scheme.",
      "The Green Homes Grant scheme, which ran in England, saw installations completely subsidised for those on certain benefits.",

      "Lenders reject homes with spray foam insulation",

      "Closed cell spray foam is rigid once set. It is a better thermal insulator and was previously sold to stabilise failing roofs. But if it has been used inappropriately or installed poorly, it might put stress on timbers, restrict air circulation and put them at risk of decaying.",
      "Open cell spray foam remains soft once set and is only used for insulation. It is more breathable but is often installed where a highly-resistant underlay like bitumen felt is already present, stopping vapour from escaping.",

      "But he said mortgage lenders struggle to assess spray foam, leading to \"caution and refusals on higher-risk applications\", for example, where it has been applied directly onto roof tiles.",
      "Properly-installed open cell foam on a sound roof has not been conclusively linked to roof decay, he added, emphasising that it is important for homeowners with this type of insulation not to panic.",
      "'Conned'",

      "She said this \"spooked\" her buyers and they pulled out before she had the chance to supply the additional documents.",

      "\"I feel like I've been conned by the government,\" she said, adding that she did not believe spray foam insulation should be available for sale until there is a better understanding of the product.",
      "'Un-mortgageable'",
      "While the Green Homes Grant scheme closed in 2021, spray foam insulation is still available under the Great British Insulation Scheme as the government seeks to improve the energy efficiency of homes and drives towards its 2030 \"net zero\" target.",
      "Rico Wojtulewicz, head of policy at the National Federation of Builders, said he had been trying to raise awareness of potential issues with spray foam insulation for years.",
      "\"Government may view spray foam as an easy solution but an un-mortgageable, unhealthy or damaged home is a worse outcome than requiring greater retrofitting thought or more expensive heating,\" he said.",

      "Mr Gordon said he was moved to act after he and many of his party's MPs had been contacted by constituents facing unexpected costs, the letter said.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 18:52:29 GMT",
    "summary": "Scrapping the two-child cap and changes to tax thresholds are among plans for the next financial year.",
    "story": [
      "A vow to scrap the two-child benefit cap and changes to basic and intermediate tax thresholds are among the plans for the Scottish government for the next financial year.",
      "The announcements were made by Finance Secretary Shona Robison as she revealed her tax and spending plans for 2025/26.",
      "Other talking points included an extra \u00a32bn for the NHS and a \u00a3768m investment in affordable homes.",
      "Here are five key takeaways from this year's Scottish Budget.",
      "1. Two-child benefits cap",
      "The biggest announcement in the budget actually isn\u2019t part of the tax or spending plans for next year.",
      "It was Shona Robison\u2019s \u201crabbit out of the hat\u201d moment of announcing that the Scottish government would move to scrap - or offset, or mitigate - the two-child benefits cap.",
      "That\u2019s a UK-wide policy, imposed by the Department of Work and Pensions on welfare payments such as universal credit and child tax credits - so it will take some time, and will need some help from the UK government.",
      "It\u2019s not yet clear what the mechanism will be, how it will work, or how much it will cost.",
      "The Scottish Fiscal Commission says it was only sent the proposal last week, and that it hasn\u2019t had time to cost it; they call it a \u201cfiscal risk\u201d.",
      "But be in no doubt that this is a big challenge to Labour.",
      "It comes days after an announcement on the winter fuel payment also designed to outflank Anas Sarwar\u2019s party and embarrass the UK administration.",
      "If all goes to plan then the SNP government will start sending out payments to families of the 15,000 children affected in April 2026. One month before the next Holyrood election.",
      "Labour says it's willing to listen to ideas, but points out that there is not a penny in the coming year\u2019s budget to support it.",
      "They will surely need to come up with a more substantial response before that election comes much closer.",
      "2. Taxes",
      "There were no big changes to the devolved income tax system in this budget.",
      "There was some tinkering with thresholds, which will have a political impact if not a big financial one.",
      "Robison is increasing the thresholds for the basic and intermediate rates - two of the lower rungs in Scotland\u2019s six-band ladder of taxes.",
      "Because Chancellor Rachel Reeves has frozen those thresholds in the rest of the UK, it means Scots earning less than \u00a330,300 will pay less tax than if they lived in England or Wales.",
      "The difference is less than \u00a330 a year, but it allows Robison to say that 51% of Scottish taxpayers pay less.",
      "One bill that will almost certainly be going up is council tax. But with last year\u2019s one-off freeze on local rates coming to an end, it will be down to your local representatives to decide.",
      "Rather than wielding a stick by imposing any sort of cap, Robison instead sought to guilt local authorities into holding down increases, saying that \u201cwith record funding there is no reason for big increases in council tax next year\u201d.",
      "She says there\u2019s an extra \u00a31bn for local government - but it remains to be seen how much of that councillors will be free to allocate, and how much will fall into ring-fenced areas.",
      "Every year the government says it has increased funding for councils, then councils hit back that it\u2019s not enough, and there\u2019s a row over exactly how much money is enough money.",
      "We will no doubt go around in circles on that until budgets at a local and national level are finalised next year.",
      "3. Spending priorities",
      "The budget totalled more than \u00a363bn, and previously ubiquitous talk of tough decisions and austerity was notably absent. There was a positive tone - like Robison suddenly had some cash to splash on the government\u2019s favourite policies.",
      "John Swinney has made the eradication of child poverty as his top priority, and as ever there is cash in the budget for the flagship Scottish Child Payment.",
      "The cash to mitigate the two-child cap doesn\u2019t feature in this budget - only some money to set up that system, whatever it turns out to look like.",
      "In total, spending on social security is up by \u00a3800m - highlighting a key feature of devolved government, in the SNP\u2019s appetite for big state interventions and welfare safety nets.",
      "You can include in that last week\u2019s announcement about winter fuel payments, which are being partially reinstated from next year.",
      "This week Mr Swinney has also (unsurprisingly) earmarked the NHS as a core priority, and as expected it has a record funding settlement - \u00a321bn, or a third of the total budget.",
      "That includes almost \u00a3200m to cut waiting times and cash for local hospital projects in Edinburgh, Fort William and Airdrie.",
      "There were also billions of pounds for net zero and climate policies - including money from the ScotWind fund, a pot of cash raised by auctioning off plots of the seabed for offshore wind, which Robison had previously feared she might need to use for day-to-day funding.",
      "And there is \u00a3768m for affordable housing, which chiefly goes to reverse a cut made under Humza Yousaf\u2019s administration last year, but does ultimately leave spending higher and will apparently create 8,000 new homes in the coming year.",
      "4. Growing the economy",
      "A big focus of governments across the UK has been economic growth. Rachel Reeves has put it at the core of everything she is doing as chancellor, as Robison said a thriving economy was \u201can essential requirement\u201d.",
      "The finance secretary had been challenged to match the chancellor\u2019s support for firms in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors - a 40% relief on business rates.",
      "Scotland has a slightly different system of \u201cnon-domestic rates\u201d, but ultimately Robison said there would be a similar 40% relief for the vast majority of hospitality premises.",
      "Retail and leisure were notably absent (although there is some support for music venues), and we will see how far this shakes out in terms of who does and doesn\u2019t qualify for funding.",
      "The Scottish Hospitality Group has said it is a \u201csignificantly more restricted\u201d offer than that down south, calling it a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d.",
      "A motif of Ms Robison\u2019s speech was name-checking her cabinet colleagues as she spoke to each of their portfolio areas.",
      "That felt particularly notable in the case of Kate Forbes - an influential figure as the woman John Swinney brought into government in part to mend fences with business.",
      "She has highlighted more money for town centre regeneration as well as a tripling of investment in the offshore wind supply chain, which it is said will leverage ten times that figure in private investment.",
      "This approach of public cash opening the door to huge flows of private funds is a favourite tactic of Ms Reeves - and indeed is the core purpose of GB Energy.",
      "That UK energy firm is set to have some company when it sets up in Aberdeen, with Ms Robison pledging to establish a hub or offshore wind in the North East.",
      "5. Politics",
      "The SNP does not have a majority in the Scottish Parliament, and thus needs the help of other parties to pass a budget.",
      "John Swinney has talked about wanting to reach out to opponents and run a collaborative administration.",
      "But there is no chance of a deal with the Conservatives, who want a billion pounds of tax cuts, or Labour, who really just want an election.",
      "That leaves the Greens and the Lib Dems as the most likely dance partners.",
      "Robison quite deliberately nodded to the key asks of both parties. There was funding for ferries, mental health and dentistry for the Lib Dems. The Greens demanded \u00a34.7bn for green policies - and she pledged \u00a34.9bn.",
      "The Greens welcomed some of the measures, but said \u201csignificant further changes\u201d were needed. They are particularly suspicious of the sums on offer for councils.",
      "The Lib Dems welcomed even more of Robison\u2019s announcements, with leader Alex Cole-Hamilton reeling off a whole series of measures where he said it was right the government had listened to him.",
      "The draft budget is really the starting point for talks, which won\u2019t come to a head until the first votes at Holyrood in February.",
      "But the fevered talk of snap elections which followed the collapse of the Bute House Agreement has faded. A deal with someone still feels the most likely outcome.",

    "story": [
      "Luxury car maker Jaguar has unveiled its new electric concept car and, like a recent controversial teaser video, it has divided opinion.",
      "Some on social media said the new Type 00 car was \"exciting\" and \"absolutely stunning\", while others called it \"rubbish\" and told Jaguar's designers to \"go back to the drawing board\".",
      "However, the carmaker has suggested the reaction is exactly what it wanted, as it tries to reset its brand to revive sluggish sales.",
      "\"Jaguar needs to be bold and disruptive in order to cut through and get our message across,\" boss Rawdon Glover told the BBC.",
      "He said his goal was to restore Jaguar's image as a luxury brand, while no longer trying to compete by pumping out large numbers of cars.",
      "Jaguar has long been the weakest link within the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) group, which also makes Range Rovers and Land Rover Defenders.",
      "Since 2018, sales have plunged from 180,000 to just 67,000 last year.",
      "Last month, JLR stopped selling new Jaguars in the UK altogether, ahead of its relaunch as an electric-only brand in 2026",
      "The firm also announced a new logo, alongside a so-called \"social media tease\", which featured models dressed in bright colours but no actual vehicles.",
      "Many criticised the advert as \"woke\", with Elon Musk - boss of Jaguar competitor Tesla - asking \"Do you sell cars?\"",
      "Others criticised the change to Jaguar's iconic growling cat badge, which has been altered and no longer appears on the front of the car.",
      "Mr Glover has defended the effort, saying the debate helped to draw \"more eyeballs\" to the firm for this week's unveiling of the new concept car.",
      "\"In that context... the strategy was successful,\" he said.",
      "\"We absolutely don't want to ostracize any of our customer base ... But, as I say, [the] most important thing for us is we need to attract a new audience to Jaguar's brand to make sure that we are safeguarding the next 90 years of Jaguar's future.\"",
      "'Trust and reserve judgement' on rebrand, says Jaguar",
      "JLR halts UK Jaguar sales before electric relaunch",
      "JLR announced the transition to electric vehicles in 2021, keeping all of its three British plants open as part of the strategy.",
      "It said the decision to stop selling new Jaguar cars in the UK last month was a deliberate move to \"create some breathing space\" before unveiling its new look.",
      "The Type 00 model unveiled at a Miami art fair is a concept car and so will not go into production for sale to the public.",
      "Instead, the vehicle, which features an ultra-long bonnet and big wheels, gives a pointer to the direction of the brand's new models.",
      "Mr Glover said Jaguar had \"ripped up the rulebook\" with the new design, which is also intended to evoke Jaguars past when the brand was in its heyday.",
      "The rebrand comes with a higher price point, with Jaguar aiming for the luxury market.",
      "\"Nobody needs a vehicle at \u00a3120,000. You have to want one,\" he said.",
      "\"Overall, this has got that sense of real occasion. And that's that's what we think is perhaps missing in that luxury EV space,\" he added.",
      "But many on social media were nonplussed by the preview.",
      "James May, broadcaster and former presenter of Top Gear, said he was \"slightly disappointed\" by the design and its price.",
      "\"I wanted something more futuristic,\" he told the BBC. \"I mean, Jaguar have been saying they will copy nothing, but there's quite a bit of other concept cars in that new Jag.\"",
      "May said Jaguar cars had traditionally been \"very reasonably priced compared with, for example, Aston Martin\".",
      "\"So I'd like to see something more like half the price that they're toting at the moment.\"",
      "'Too big'",
      "Beatrix Keim, director at the Center of Automotive Research, said that Jaguar's concept car was \"too big, too unreal\".",
      "\"This is not the way to go,\" she said, given that there are already big cars in the market and \"electric cars cannot only be for the rich\".",
      "\"Of course, Jaguar is a luxury brand,\" she added. \"But I don't think that this is the direction which Jaguar at current point of time needs, because it's losing out on volume as well. And this is not a volume car.\u201d",

    "summary": "Sweden has a reputation for strong gender equality, but some young women are giving up their jobs.",
    "story": [
      "Sweden has a global reputation for championing gender equality, so why are young women embracing a social media trend that celebrates quitting work?",
      "Vilma Larsson, 25, previously had jobs in a grocery store, a care home and a factory. But she quit work a year ago to become a stay-at-home-girlfriend, and says she\u2019s never been happier.",
      "\u201cMy life is softer. I am not struggling. I am not very stressed.\u201d",
      "Her boyfriend works remotely in finance, and while he spends his days on his laptop, she\u2019s at the gym, out for coffee, or cooking. The couple grew up in small towns in central Sweden, but now travel a lot, and are spending the winter in Cyprus.",
      "\u201cEvery month he gives me a salary from his money that he made. But if I need more, I'll ask him. Or if I need less, I don't - I just save the rest,\u201d explains Ms Larsson.",
      "She shares her lifestyle on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok, where she\u2019s amassed 11,000 followers. Some of her posts have had almost 400,000 likes, although she says she\u2019s not making an income from her content.",
      "She uses the hashtags \u201chemmaflickv\u00e4n\u201d and \u201chemmafru\u201d (Swedish for stay-at-home girlfriend and housewife) and describes herself as a \u201csoft girl\u201d \u2013 an identity that embraces a softer, more feminine way of living rather than focussing on a career.",
      "The soft girl lifestyle has been a microtrend on social media in different parts of the world since the late 2010s. But in Sweden \u2013 with five decades of policies designed to promote dual income households behind it \u2013 the concept\u2019s recent popularity has sparked both surprise and division.",
      "Ungdomsbarometern \u2013  Sweden\u2019s largest annual survey of young people \u2013 first put the national spotlight on Swedes embracing the soft girl trend a year ago, after it became a popular choice when 15 to 24-year-olds were asked to predict trends for 2024.",
      "Another study released by Ungdomsbaromatern this August suggested it was even becoming an aspiration among younger schoolgirls, with 14% of seven to 14-year-olds identifying as soft girls.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about leaning away from this \u2018girl boss\u2019 ideal that we've seen for a lot of years, where there are very, very high demands for success in every aspect of life,\u201d explains Johanna G\u00f6ransson, a researcher for Ungdomsbarometern.",
      "There is no official data on the number of young \u201csoft girls\u201d quitting work altogether and living off their partners like Ms Larsson, and Ms G\u00f6ransson says it is likely to be a small proportion.",
      "But it\u2019s nevertheless become a major talking point in Sweden, from opinion pieces in broadsheet newspapers, to panel discussions at Almedalen \u2013 a huge annual cross-party political event \u2013 and on Swedish public service television.",
      "Gudrun Schyman \u2013 the co-founder and former leader of Sweden\u2019s feminist party Feministiskt initiativ - says she\u2019s taken part in recent debates on the issue. She believes women living off their partners wealth is \u201cvery dangerous\u201d, and \u201ca step backwards\u201d for gender equality.",
      "Ms Schyman argues that young Swedes have been influenced by the country\u2019s right-wing coalition government, which collaborates with the nationalist Sweden Democrats party, as well as the \u201cbroader development\u201d of populism in Europe and the United States.",
      "She also thinks there\u2019s a lack of awareness about life in Sweden before it embraced policies designed to promote gender equality, such as heavily subsidised childcare and shared parental leave. \u201cYoung women today don't carry the history of how women had to fight for their rights - the right to work, the right to have a salary, and the right to economic independence.\u201d",
      "At the other end of the political spectrum, the Sweden Democrats party has been positive towards the soft girls trend.",
      "\u201cI think that people should get to decide over their own life,\u201d says Denice Westerberg, national spokesperson for the party\u2019s youth wing. \u201cAnd if you have that economic possibility to do that [live off a partner] then good for you.",
      "\u201cWe still live in a country with all the opportunities to have a career. We still have all the rights, but we have the right to choose to live more traditionally.\u201d",
      "Aside from ideological debates, discussions have focussed on the social and cultural factors that could be influencing young women to quit work - or at least aspire to a softer lifestyle.",
      "Sweden has a reputation for work life balance - most employees get six-weeks holiday a year, and less than 1% work more than 50 hours a week.",
      "Still, Ungdomsbaromatern\u2019s research suggests rising stress levels amongst young people, and Ms G\u00f6ransson believes soft girls trend may be an extension of recent global work trends such as \u201cquiet quitting\u201d, which encourages employees not to overextend themselves.",
      "Meanwhile, the Generation Z age group (the cohort born between 1997 and 2012) are making, and being influenced by, social media content that celebrates leisure time rather than career goals.",
      "Business Daily: Sweden\u2019s #softgirls trend",
      "\u201cWork doesn't really feature that much if you look at lifestyle content on social media today, it's much more about exercise and wellness,\u201d explains Ms G\u00f6ransson. \u201cAnd if that's the picture young people have of what a normal life looks like, then, of course, maybe you're not so excited about spending eight hours in an office a day.\u201d",
      "But perhaps the biggest talking point is whether the trend is a response to the limitations of Sweden\u2019s pioneering gender equality policies.",
      "Alongside Slovenia, Sweden has the highest proportion of working mothers in Europe, yet government statistics suggest women in heterosexual couples still do a larger share of housework and childcare than men.",
      "They also take 70% of state-funded parental leave, and are more likely to go on sick leave for stress. Meanwhile, although the income gap between men and women remains lower than the EU average of 12.7%, it has stalled at around 10%  since 2019.",
      "Ms Larsson \u2013 who wants to have children in the future \u2013 says her decision to become a stay-at-home girlfriend is partly due to watching older women struggle to juggle a career and homelife.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of women feel burned out from their work,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I just think of my mother and her mother, my grandma, and my sister, everyone. They're always so stressed.\u201d",
      "At Sweden\u2019s state-funded Gender Equality Agency, Peter Wickstr\u00f6m, head of the department for policy analysis and monitoring, also believes the soft girl trend can be viewed as a \u201crational reaction\u201d to the perceived \u201cdemands\u201d experienced by young women.",
      "Shoka \u00c5hrman, an economist at one of Sweden\u2019s largest pension funds, SPP, says she does not believe enough Swedish girlfriends or wives will quit work for it to have an impact on the country\u2019s economy.",
      "However, she is working to raise awareness amongst Swedish women that leaving the labour force (as well as going part time) could impact their personal finances, from savings and pensions, to salary levels if they return to work.",
      "Ms \u00c5hrman hopes the current soft girl debates will serve as a wake-up call to both politicians and businesses alike that there is still work to be done to address ongoing structural inequalities in Sweden.",
      "\u201cI think the source of it, which is mental health issues, burnouts and all that, is what's more worrying, because that affects not only the few younger girls today that want to stay home as soft girls,\u201d she says.",

      "Many premium products claim to accurately track exercise routines, body temperature, heart rate, menstrual cycle and sleep patterns, among others.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting has talked about a proposal to give wearables to millions of NHS patients in England, enabling them to track symptoms such as reactions to cancer treatments, from home.",
      "But many doctors \u2013 and tech experts \u2013 remain cautious about using health data captured by wearables.",
      "I\u2019m currently trying out a smart ring from the firm Ultrahuman \u2013 and it seemed to know that I was getting sick before I did.",
      "It alerted me one weekend that my temperature was slightly elevated, and my sleep had been restless. It warned me that this could be a sign I was coming down with something.",
      "I tutted something about the symptoms of perimenopause and ignored it - but two days later I was laid up in bed with gastric flu.",
      "I didn\u2019t need medical assistance, but if I had \u2013 would the data from my wearable have helped healthcare professionals with my treatment? Many wearable brands actively encourage this.",
      "The Oura smart ring, for example, offers a service where patients can download their data in the form of a report to share with their doctor.",
      "Dr Jake Deutsch, a US-based clinician who also advises Oura, says wearable data enables him to \u201cassess overall health more precisely\u201d \u2013 but not all doctors agree that it\u2019s genuinely useful all of the time.",
      "Dr Helen Salisbury is a GP at a busy practice in Oxford. She says not many patients come in brandishing their wearables, but she\u2019s noticed it has increased, and it concerns her.",
      "\u201cI think for the number of times when it\u2019s useful there\u2019s probably more times that it\u2019s not terribly useful, and I worry that we are building a society of hypochondria and over-monitoring of our bodies,\u201d she says.",
      "Dr Salisbury says there can be a large number of reasons why we might temporarily get abnormal data such as an increased heart rate, whether it\u2019s a blip in our bodies or a device malfunction - and many of them do not require further investigation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we will be encouraging people to monitor everything all the time, and see their doctor every time the machine thinks they\u2019re ill, rather than when they think they\u2019re ill.\u201d",
      "And she makes a further point about the psychological use of this data as a kind of insurance policy against shock health diagnoses. A nasty cancerous tumour for example, is not necessarily going to be flagged by a watch or an app, she says.",
      "What wearables do is encourage good habits - but the best message you can take from them is the same advice doctors have been giving us for years. Dr Salisbury adds: \u201cThe thing you can actually do is walk more, don\u2019t drink too much alcohol, try and maintain a healthy weight. That never changes.\u201d",
      "The Apple Watch is reported to be the world\u2019s best-selling smart watch, although sales have slowed lately.",
      "Apple didn't comment, but the tech giant uses true stories of people whose lives have been saved because of the heart tracking function of the device in its marketing, and anecdotally I have heard plenty of those too. What I haven\u2019t heard however, is how many cases of false positives there are.",
      "In many cases when patients present their data to healthcare professionals, clinicians prefer to try to recreate it using their own equipment, rather than simply trust what the wearable has captured.",
      "There are several reasons for this, says Dr Yang Wei, associate professor in wearable technologies at Nottingham Trent University  \u2013 and they\u2019re all very practical.",
      "\u201cWhen you go to hospital, and you measure your ECG [electrocardiogram, a test that checks the activity of your heart], you don\u2019t worry about power consumption because the machine is plugged into the wall,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cOn your watch, you\u2019re not going to measure your ECG continuously because you drain your battery straight away.\u201d",
      "In addition, movement \u2013 both of the wearable itself on a wrist, for example, and general movement of the person wearing it - can \u201ccreate noise\u201d in the data it collects, he adds, making it less reliable.",
      "Dr Wei points to the ring on my finger.",
      "\u201cThe gold standard to measure the heart rate is from the wrist or direct from the heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you measure from the finger, you\u2019re sacrificing accuracy.\"",
      "It is the role of software to fill in such data gaps, he says - but there\u2019s no international standard for wearables here - for either the sensors and software that power wearable devices, or for the data itself, and even what format it is gathered in.",
      "The more consistently a device is worn, the more accurate its data is likely to be. But here\u2019s a cautionary tale.",
      "Ben Wood was out for the day when his wife received a series of alarming notifications from his Apple Watch, telling her he had been in a car crash. It advised her to text him rather than call because he may need to keep the line clear for the emergency services.",
      "The alerts were genuine, and sent to her as his emergency contact \u2013 but in this case unnecessary. Ben was out at a race track driving some fast cars. He admitted that he \u201cwasn\u2019t very gifted\u201d at it \u2013 but said he felt safe at all times.",
      "\u201cThe boundaries between incident and alert need to be managed carefully,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see how device-makers, emergency services, first responders and individuals think about this technology in the future.\u201d",
      "Pritesh Mistry, digital technologies fellow at the Kings Fund, agrees that there are significant challenges around folding current patient-generated data into our healthcare systems, and adds that the discussion has already been going on for several years in the UK without any clear resolution.",
      "He says there\u2019s \u201ca good case to be made\u201d for the use of wearables in the UK government\u2019s current drive to push care out of hospitals and into community settings.",
      "\u201cBut without that underpinning foundation of technology enablement in terms of the infrastructure, and supporting the workforce to have the skills, knowledge, capacity and confidence, I think it\u2019s going to be a challenge,\u201d he adds.",

    "title": "Lauren Mayberry of Chvrches: I was always trying to make everyone happy",
    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 00:37:07 GMT",
    "summary": "The Chvrches singer on going solo, and the loneliness of being the only woman in a touring band.",
    "story": [
      "Lauren Mayberry is a peacemaker.",
      "Since 2011, she's been frontwoman of the Glaswegian band Chvrches, topping festival bills and the album charts with a trademark barrage of distorted synths and razor-sharp melodies.",
      "Mayberry was the baby of the band - just 23 when she joined, and years younger than her bandmates, Iain Cook and Martin Doherty.",
      "But their chemistry was instant. Chvrches' debut single, The Mother We Share, was written and recorded in 48 hours, using the only three synths they owned - but it became a word of mouth hit, earning them airplay on BBC Radio 1 and support slots with Passion Pit and Depeche Mode.",
      "In the press, they carefully presented themselves as a band, with each member receiving equal billing. But Mayberry says she worried about being the junior partner.",
      "\"I was always conscious that I was younger than the other guys, and they had a lot more experience,\" she says.",
      "\"They\u2019d been to music school, and I hadn't. So I always felt like I was on the back foot, in terms of where I sat in the hierarchy.\"",
      "That feeling was amplified during a 2019 tour of Australia.",
      "The itinerary gave the band a four-day break in Melbourne, and Mayberry was looking forward to spending the downtime with her bandmates and the crew - until she discovered they'd made separate plans and she was stranded in her hotel room.",
      "\"I remember being very upset and hurt by that because I was always worrying about everyone else and taking care of everybody, and it was a humbling moment,\" she says.",
      "\"In the end, I hired a little car and drove to an Australian spa town and had a wee cry listening to Taylor Swift\u2019s Cruel Summer.\"",
      "Looking back, she thinks that being the only woman in the touring party left her carrying the \"emotional labour\" of keeping the show on the road.",
      "\"I feel like I twisted myself into a pretzel sometimes to make everyone happy.",
      "\"Then I\u2019d look back and think, \u2018And were you happy?'",
      "\"Not really, but I was keeping the peace.\"",
      "She considered leaving the band after that Australian incident. Then Covid struck, and Chvrches ended up making a fourth album, 2021's Screen Violence, remotely.",
      "She finally took the plunge a year later, but not before signing a new record deal with her bandmates, assuring the future of the project.",
      "\"I was conscious it would give people a sense of security, that I\u2019d made a commitment,\" she says.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s how it actually works, but that was my hope.\"",
      "She\u2019s keen to stress there\u2019s no bad blood: Doherty and Cook have given her their full support. Still, it\u2019s natural for someone leaving a band to define themselves in opposition to that music - otherwise what\u2019s the point?",
      "As Mayberry succinctly puts it: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make a crap knock-off Chvrches record.\u201d",
      "In recording sessions, she'd flinch when anyone pulled out a vintage synth. Instead, she pursued a more organic, lyrics-first approach.",
      "But after a decade in a trio, the instinct to compromise was hard-wired.",
      "\u201cI'm very used to arguing my point, then trying to see other people's point of view,\" she says.",
      "\"So it was a real learning curve to be like, \u2018No, this is my opinion, and if I don't think it's right, then it's not right, and that's the end of the conversation'.\u201d",
      "Crying wolf",
      "The result is Vicious Creature, an album that showcases new depths to Mayberry\u2018s voice, which fluctuates between vulnerability and venom, while paying homage to her pop heroines.",
      "She channels the spirit of All Saints on the album opener Something In The Air; and borrows the choppy, sampled strings of Annie Lennox's Walking On Broken Glass to power the single Crocodile Tears.",
      "The latter is a furious riposte to an emotionally manipulative man, where Mayberry snarls: \u201cWhat a man will say just to get his way / Always crying wolf, so I\u2019m sad to say / I don\u2019t really wanna hear it from you, babe\".",
      "The singer says she's role-playing in that song, inspired by the dark, subversive femininity of Velma Kelly in the musical Chicago, or Cabaret's Sally Bowles.",
      "It's one of several songs that survived the first incarnation of the album - tentatively titled Fiction - that would be \"dark, theatrical and character driven\".",
      "Slowly, over time, more personal songs started to creep into the mix.",
      "The syncopated pulse of Change Shapes is a condemnation of music industry sexism (\"I'm a doll inside a box, with a ball and a chain\"). Sorry, Etc tells a similar story over a chaotic hybrid of garage rock and drum & bass.",
      "\"There were definitely a few songs where it was at best expressing frustrations and at worst [feeling] kind of hurt,\" about her life in music, Mayberry says.",
      "The album's most intimate moment is a muted piano ballad called Oh, Mother.",
      "Over three verses, Mayberry documents the shifting relationship with her mother - from the unquestioning love of childhood to adolescent disgust and, finally, the realisation that their time together is limited.",
      "\"It kills me to know you won't be around,\" she sings gently. \"Oh mother, what will I do without you?\"",
      "The last song written for the record, the words poured out after Mayberry's friend and co-writer Dan McDougall sketched out the chords in the studio.",
      "Discussing the lyrics, which were inspired by a family illness, the singer becomes a little emotional.",
      "\"When you're living in the shadow of things like that, it's on your mind all the time,\" she says.",
      "\"I think about it all the time. When I go away on tour, I always think, \u2018Oh, is this the tour where I'm gone and I miss it\u2019.",
      "\"So that last afternoon in the studio was quite a weepy one... But then we went to Nando's. So it's all about balance.\"",
      "Oh, Mother is the sort of song she could never have written in Chvrches, Mayberry says.",
      "\"It's not a place that we would go emotionally or sonically,\" she says.",
      "\"I think the best songs happen when the lyrics and the meaning and the sonics interlink but [with Chvrches] I was writing things in my notebooks and thinking, \u2018This is never going to fit with what the band have built\u2019.\"",
      "Change is never easy, though. While some reviews have called the album a \"masterclass in pop alchemy\", others have said Mayberry \"still sounds like someone finding their feet\".",
      "Fans of Chvrches' industrial sound have expressed disappointment too, but the singer has learned to distance herself from criticism.",
      "\"When people are like, \u2018Screw you\u2019, I rationalise it like this: You\u2019re mad at me, but you're mad at me because life is hard, and our music made your life a bit easier for a minute. And now you're like, \u2018Please don't take that away.\u2019",
      "\"When I was 24, that was overwhelming, but it made sense once I could compartmentalise it.",
      "\"You are the representative of something that means so much to this person - so when you do something else, it threatens the idea of that existing.\"",
      "The flipside of that equation comes in concert. When Mayberry plays a song like Asking For A Friend, with its reassuring mantra, \"you still matter\", she often sees \"someone in the audience having a wee dance-cry\".",
      "\"And when people cry, I cry. Everyone's like, 'Are you ok?' but I'm just caught up in the moment.",
      "\"But I hope that\u2019s why I\u2019m good at my job, because I have some kind of empathy.",
      "\"It\u2019s inconvenient for my life, but hopefully good for the crowd.\""

      "But the most emotional moment comes as he talks about his four children, Christian, Barry, Stacy and Carrie Beth.",
      "Van Dyke gazes lovingly at a photo of Stacy being read a bedtime story, and reveals: \"I've had dreams where I'm depressed or lonely or hurt, and she comes to comfort me. She actually comes to comfort me.\"",
      "His family - including dozens of grandchildren - arrive later in the video, dancing and singing with the actor, who tells Martin he is particularly taken with one line of All My Love: \"Until I die / Let me hold you if you cry.\"",
      "The video ends with Martin improvising a song for the star, who watches in astonishment as the music comes to life.",

      "All My Love is the latest single from Coldplay's 10th studio album, Moon Music, which went to number one in October.",
      "The group have taken a quirky approach to promoting the record, hosting a segment on the shopping channel QVC, and filming an impromptu video for the song We Pray in the middle of Dublin's Grafton Street, shortly before they played a show at the city's Croke Park Stadium.",
      "An earlier video for All My Love also saw Chris Martin walking the streets of Las Vegas in disguise, singing karaoke and handing out balloons to strangers... a scene which Van Dyke briefly recreates in the latest clip.",
      "In an interview on the US chat show Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Martin revealed that he and Van Dyke are neighbours in California, and that they had been friends for years.",
      "\"This really may be the most fun thing I've ever done,\" he said of the video.",
      "\"It makes me so grateful. It's a big deal for me.\"",
      "The video premiered on the band's YouTube channel. A shorter edit will be released on 13 December, to mark Van Dyke\u2019s 99th birthday."

      "Presenter Gregg Wallace is a national figure, who has been in people\u2019s living rooms several times a week for 20 years.",
      "His programmes, most prominently MasterChef, are made by independent production companies.",
      "But his name and face are associated with the BBC, and, as allegations continue to emerge, the corporation is under fire.",
      "It\u2019s the last thing it needs, so soon after other high profile scandals including the disgraced BBC News presenter Huw Edwards.",
      "The BBC has questions to answer about the allegations over what it knew about Wallace\u2019s behaviour on and off set, and - if it was alerted to these types of allegations - what it did about them.",
      "BBC News has been made aware of two occasions when complaints were made. One, by the radio host Aasmah Mir, related to Celebrity MasterChef in 2017.",
      "She says she complained to the production company behind the show and later spoke to the BBC\u2019s Kate Phillips who was then controller for entertainment commissioning. I understand Phillips was later assured that the issue had been addressed.",
      "Another complaint, just a year afterwards, concerned Impossible Celebrities, made by a different production company.",
      "In a letter from 2018 seen by BBC News, Phillips wrote that she had spoken to Wallace for 90 minutes to make clear what the BBC expected of him. She also confirmed in the letter that many aspects of his behaviour were unacceptable and unprofessional.",
      "Six years on, the emerging allegations about Wallace\u2019s conduct raise questions about whether executives - at the production company Banijay and the BBC - reacted appropriately.",
      "But BBC News has not been told whether the BBC executives involved in Wallace\u2019s shows were made aware of any complaints about him after 2018 and the conversation between him and Phillips. If they weren\u2019t, there is some plausible deniability that they thought the issues raised had been sorted.",
      "Then again, that defence may only go so far. There are wider questions about how much a TV executive should probe, if they are aware that rumours have begun to swirl.",
      "Popbitch, the weekly celebrity newsletter that makes its way into the inboxes of most media executives, had run stories involving allegations about Wallace\u2019s language and behaviour in the past, for example. When does the odd gossipy claim about talent misbehaviour become an issue bosses should take a look at?",
      "Should more questions have been asked by the BBC after 2018?",
      "Some have made the point that these types of scandals involving high profile TV presenters only seem to emerge when the media shines a light on them.",
      "It\u2019s only then, it is argued, that executives take action and launch an investigation. The claim is that before journalists get involved, the executives are more concerned with protecting the star, the show and their bottom line.",
      "In light of Huw Edwards, the BBC launched a workplace review into preventing abuses of power. At the time, the BBC chair Samir Shah said there \"continues to be a sense that powerful people 'get away with it'.\"",
      "But for me, how the Wallace claims may have been handled isn\u2019t entirely comparable to the Edwards scandal.",
      "Huw Edwards was employed directly by the BBC, Wallace is contracted by production companies that make his shows and sell them to the BBC.",
      "To put this in context, 326 independent companies made programmes for the BBC in the year 2023/4, accounting for 55% of the BBC\u2019s TV hours.",
      "I have picked up some frustration on the corporate side of the BBC that the corporation is taking criticism for a programme that it doesn't make.",

      "Her artworks are bold and impressionistic, and - in her own words - \u201cvery large\u201d. This, she explains, is partly because she was inspired by an aunt who painted murals on the walls of her house - and partly because she can\u2019t see well enough to paint small.",
      "She says she doesn\u2019t envisage what the final creation will look like as she paints. \u201cI'm just in it so deeply,\u201d she says. \u201cIt's so immersive. It's just wonderful.\u201d",

      "\"You have to be open if you're a public figure and if you're telling people to vote for you, you have to tell them who you are and what you're about,\" he says. \"And, of course, I thought it would be fun.\"",
      "In his 14 years as an MP, the former minister came to be viewed as one of the most controversial politicians of recent times thanks to some of his hardline views. These include total opposition to abortion (even in cases of incest and rape) and a belief that there should be no climate change legislation.",
      "In the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 72 people, Sir Jacob said it would have been \"common sense\"  for residents to flee the building, ignoring fire brigade advice. A survivors group described the comments as \"extremely painful and insulting\". Sir Jacob later said he \"profoundly apologised\".",

      "Now Sir Jacob, who is also a GB News presenter, hopes the reality show gives him another platform to, in his words, \"get the Conservative message out there\".",
      "It is not known how much he is being paid by Discovery+ for the documentary, but as his wife is the heiress to a reported \u00a345 million fortune, money doesn't seem to be a motive.",
      "So, what other motivation could there be for the former banker to take part in the show? Is it part of a plan to re-enter politics in the next election after he lost his seat in July?",
      "You get the sense he misses the goings-on of Westminster - he confesses that he still sticks to his MP timetable of returning to his former constituency every Thursday afternoon to Sunday.",
      "But he says he hasn't thought that far ahead. He jokes taking part in his family reality show is \"better than going into the jungle\" and that he has no plans to follow in the footsteps of Nigel Farage and Matt Hancock, who appeared on ITV's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!",

      "The lifestyle the Rees-Moggs lead is certainly kooky to the ordinary person - in the show, the family have black-tie dinners every Saturday, attend a birthday party at Boris Johnson's house, and there's Sunday Mass in a private chapel on the family's Somerset estate.",

      "\"I got to the stage where I went 'if this continues, I'm going to end up morbidly obese in my late 30s',\" she said.",

      "\"It's changed my life... It's completely changed my attitude to food,\" she said, adding that she also had felt motivated to go to the gym and take up weightlifting.",
      "Because Mounjaro works as an appetite suppressant, she said she struggled to eat more than 1,000 calories initially but the effects had \"decreased\" and her appetite had increased again.",
      "Ms Harvey has spent about \u00a3170 a month on the drug, but said she had saved the same amount in buying less food and drink and planned to stop taking it.",
      "She would not be eligible for the drug under the NICE guidelines, which stipulate that Mounjaro will be offered to people with a BMI of more than 35 and at least one obesity-related health problem.",
      "But she believes rollout should be gradual to ensure support is in place alongside the drug, which carries the risk of users putting the weight back on once they stop taking it.",
      "\"It's not a quick fix,\" she said. \"Having that maintenance plan for afterwards for supporting people to keep that weight off afterwards is really vital.\"",

      "\"The fight's gone out of me because I've tried for so long,\" she said, but added that she was \"worried\" that her health issues will worsen.",
      "While she would like to try Mounjaro, she would like to be supervised by medics as part of the NHS programme due to her pre-existing health issues.",
      "\"I would be quite happy to pay for it but be supervised, but you can't do that. It's either one or the other,\" she said.",
      "She was deeply disappointed that with a BMI of 30, she will not qualify for the drug under the NICE guidelines.",
      "And, even if she did fall into the catchment criteria, Ms Graham was concerned about the potential wait to access Mounjaro.",

      "Paul said it would be great if the NHS could provide it - but that a 12-year wait for some is \"too long\".",

      "I didn\u2019t need medical assistance, but if I had \u2013 would the data from my wearable have helped healthcare professionals with my treatment? Many wearable brands actively encourage this.",
      "The Oura smart ring, for example, offers a service where patients can download their data in the form of a report to share with their doctor.",
      "Dr Jake Deutsch, a US-based clinician who also advises Oura, says wearable data enables him to \u201cassess overall health more precisely\u201d \u2013 but not all doctors agree that it\u2019s genuinely useful all of the time.",
      "Dr Helen Salisbury is a GP at a busy practice in Oxford. She says not many patients come in brandishing their wearables, but she\u2019s noticed it has increased, and it concerns her.",
      "\u201cI think for the number of times when it\u2019s useful there\u2019s probably more times that it\u2019s not terribly useful, and I worry that we are building a society of hypochondria and over-monitoring of our bodies,\u201d she says.",
      "Dr Salisbury says there can be a large number of reasons why we might temporarily get abnormal data such as an increased heart rate, whether it\u2019s a blip in our bodies or a device malfunction - and many of them do not require further investigation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we will be encouraging people to monitor everything all the time, and see their doctor every time the machine thinks they\u2019re ill, rather than when they think they\u2019re ill.\u201d",
      "And she makes a further point about the psychological use of this data as a kind of insurance policy against shock health diagnoses. A nasty cancerous tumour for example, is not necessarily going to be flagged by a watch or an app, she says.",
      "What wearables do is encourage good habits - but the best message you can take from them is the same advice doctors have been giving us for years. Dr Salisbury adds: \u201cThe thing you can actually do is walk more, don\u2019t drink too much alcohol, try and maintain a healthy weight. That never changes.\u201d",
      "The Apple Watch is reported to be the world\u2019s best-selling smart watch, although sales have slowed lately.",

What I haven\u2019t heard however, is how many cases of false positives there are.",
      "In many cases when patients present their data to healthcare professionals, clinicians prefer to try to recreate it using their own equipment, rather than simply trust what the wearable has captured.",
      "There are several reasons for this, says Dr Yang Wei, associate professor in wearable technologies at Nottingham Trent University  \u2013 and they\u2019re all very practical.",
      "\u201cWhen you go to hospital, and you measure your ECG [electrocardiogram, a test that checks the activity of your heart], you don\u2019t worry about power consumption because the machine is plugged into the wall,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cOn your watch, you\u2019re not going to measure your ECG continuously because you drain your battery straight away.\u201d",
      "In addition, movement \u2013 both of the wearable itself on a wrist, for example, and general movement of the person wearing it - can \u201ccreate noise\u201d in the data it collects, he adds, making it less reliable.",
      "Dr Wei points to the ring on my finger.",
      "\u201cThe gold standard to measure the heart rate is from the wrist or direct from the heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you measure from the finger, you\u2019re sacrificing accuracy.\"",
      "It is the role of software to fill in such data gaps, he says - but there\u2019s no international standard for wearables here - for either the sensors and software that power wearable devices, or for the data itself, and even what format it is gathered in.",
      "The more consistently a device is worn, the more accurate its data is likely to be. But here\u2019s a cautionary tale.",
      "Ben Wood was out for the day when his wife received a series of alarming notifications from his Apple Watch, telling her he had been in a car crash. It advised her to text him rather than call because he may need to keep the line clear for the emergency services.",
      "The alerts were genuine, and sent to her as his emergency contact \u2013 but in this case unnecessary. Ben was out at a race track driving some fast cars. He admitted that he \u201cwasn\u2019t very gifted\u201d at it \u2013 but said he felt safe at all times.",
      "\u201cThe boundaries between incident and alert need to be managed carefully,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see how device-makers, emergency services, first responders and individuals think about this technology in the future.\u201d",

      "Sir Keir Starmer has insisted many civil servants want change, after he was accused of using \"Trumpian language\" in his criticism of Whitehall.",
      "In a speech setting out his priorities for government on Thursday, the prime minister said \"too many people in Whitehall are comfortable in the tepid bath of managed decline\".",
      "Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, said the PM's comments were \"astonishing\" and \"really damaging\".",
      "He told BBC Newsnight civil servants \"feel a sense of betrayal\".",

      "\"And yet here we are five months in with that Trumpian language that is getting used.\"",
      "Asked if it was wise to pick a fight with the civil service, Sir Keir told reporters: \"I've worked with civil servants when I was the chief prosecutor and obviously [I'm] working with them again now and I know that they bring a strong sense of public service to everything that they do.",
      "\"But at the same time I also know that we've got to press through reform, we've got to deliver government in a better way.\"",
      "He added: \"I think lots of civil servants will say good, great, give us the leadership, we want that change too.\"",
      "Some senior government sources have told the BBC that Labour has been disappointed by the quality of the civil service since taking office in July.",
      "But Mr Penman said that to achieve the government's aims and reform public services \"you need to bring [civil servants] with you\".",
      "\"Cabinet ministers are going to have to deliver on the ground and they're going to have to work with civil servants and they're going to have to repair the damage that's been done by the prime minister's words,\" he added.",
      "Mr Penman acknowledged Whitehall could be slow to get things done, and civil servants were also \"frustrated\" about this.",
      "However, he said productivity had declined for many reasons, including a high turnover of ministers.",
      "Mr Penman has written to the prime minister to express his concerns, urging him to \"work to immediately rebuild trust\" with civil servants.",
      "Other unions representing civil servants also criticised Sir Keir's comments.",
      "PCS general secretary Fran Heathcote said: \"One of the reasons trust in politics is so low is because of politicians' refusal to be accountable for anything. It's always someone else's fault.",
      "\"To blame civil servants, who every day work above and beyond to keep the country running, for failing to deliver reform is inaccurate and, worse, cowardly.\"",
      "Steve Thomas, deputy general secretary of Prospect, said: \"Blaming the civil service for failures in policy delivery is an easy thing to do and is wide of the mark.",
      "\"Reform may well be necessary, indeed civil service unions have been saying for years that we stand ready to work with the government on how best to do that.\"",
      "Six takeaways from Keir Starmer's 'plan for change'",
      "Will Keir Starmer be able to meet his new pledges?",
      "In his speech, Sir Keir set out six targets the government is aiming to meet before the next election, covering the economy, housebuilding, the NHS, policing, pre-school education and green energy.",
      "As well as being designed to offer more clarity about the direction of his government, the speech had a secondary aim of galvanising the civil service.",

      "A vow to scrap the two-child benefit cap and changes to basic and intermediate tax thresholds are among the plans for the Scottish government for the next financial year.",
      "The announcements were made by Finance Secretary Shona Robison as she revealed her tax and spending plans for 2025/26.",
      "Other talking points included an extra \u00a32bn for the NHS and a \u00a3768m investment in affordable homes.",
      "Here are five key takeaways from this year's Scottish Budget.",
      "1. Two-child benefits cap",
      "The biggest announcement in the budget actually isn\u2019t part of the tax or spending plans for next year.",
      "It was Shona Robison\u2019s \u201crabbit out of the hat\u201d moment of announcing that the Scottish government would move to scrap - or offset, or mitigate - the two-child benefits cap.",
      "That\u2019s a UK-wide policy, imposed by the Department of Work and Pensions on welfare payments such as universal credit and child tax credits - so it will take some time, and will need some help from the UK government.",
      "It\u2019s not yet clear what the mechanism will be, how it will work, or how much it will cost.",
      "The Scottish Fiscal Commission says it was only sent the proposal last week, and that it hasn\u2019t had time to cost it; they call it a \u201cfiscal risk\u201d.",
      "But be in no doubt that this is a big challenge to Labour.",
      "It comes days after an announcement on the winter fuel payment also designed to outflank Anas Sarwar\u2019s party and embarrass the UK administration.",
      "If all goes to plan then the SNP government will start sending out payments to families of the 15,000 children affected in April 2026. One month before the next Holyrood election.",
      "Labour says it's willing to listen to ideas, but points out that there is not a penny in the coming year\u2019s budget to support it.",
      "They will surely need to come up with a more substantial response before that election comes much closer.",
      "2. Taxes",
      "There were no big changes to the devolved income tax system in this budget.",
      "There was some tinkering with thresholds, which will have a political impact if not a big financial one.",
      "Robison is increasing the thresholds for the basic and intermediate rates - two of the lower rungs in Scotland\u2019s six-band ladder of taxes.",
      "Because Chancellor Rachel Reeves has frozen those thresholds in the rest of the UK, it means Scots earning less than \u00a330,300 will pay less tax than if they lived in England or Wales.",
      "The difference is less than \u00a330 a year, but it allows Robison to say that 51% of Scottish taxpayers pay less.",
      "One bill that will almost certainly be going up is council tax. But with last year\u2019s one-off freeze on local rates coming to an end, it will be down to your local representatives to decide.",
      "Rather than wielding a stick by imposing any sort of cap, Robison instead sought to guilt local authorities into holding down increases, saying that \u201cwith record funding there is no reason for big increases in council tax next year\u201d.",
      "She says there\u2019s an extra \u00a31bn for local government - but it remains to be seen how much of that councillors will be free to allocate, and how much will fall into ring-fenced areas.",
      "Every year the government says it has increased funding for councils, then councils hit back that it\u2019s not enough, and there\u2019s a row over exactly how much money is enough money.",
      "We will no doubt go around in circles on that until budgets at a local and national level are finalised next year.",
      "3. Spending priorities",
      "The budget totalled more than \u00a363bn, and previously ubiquitous talk of tough decisions and austerity was notably absent. There was a positive tone - like Robison suddenly had some cash to splash on the government\u2019s favourite policies.",
      "John Swinney has made the eradication of child poverty as his top priority, and as ever there is cash in the budget for the flagship Scottish Child Payment.",
      "The cash to mitigate the two-child cap doesn\u2019t feature in this budget - only some money to set up that system, whatever it turns out to look like.",
      "In total, spending on social security is up by \u00a3800m - highlighting a key feature of devolved government, in the SNP\u2019s appetite for big state interventions and welfare safety nets.",
      "You can include in that last week\u2019s announcement about winter fuel payments, which are being partially reinstated from next year.",
      "This week Mr Swinney has also (unsurprisingly) earmarked the NHS as a core priority, and as expected it has a record funding settlement - \u00a321bn, or a third of the total budget.",
      "That includes almost \u00a3200m to cut waiting times and cash for local hospital projects in Edinburgh, Fort William and Airdrie.",
      "There were also billions of pounds for net zero and climate policies - including money from the ScotWind fund, a pot of cash raised by auctioning off plots of the seabed for offshore wind, which Robison had previously feared she might need to use for day-to-day funding.",
      "And there is \u00a3768m for affordable housing, which chiefly goes to reverse a cut made under Humza Yousaf\u2019s administration last year, but does ultimately leave spending higher and will apparently create 8,000 new homes in the coming year.",
      "4. Growing the economy",
      "A big focus of governments across the UK has been economic growth. Rachel Reeves has put it at the core of everything she is doing as chancellor, as Robison said a thriving economy was \u201can essential requirement\u201d.",
      "The finance secretary had been challenged to match the chancellor\u2019s support for firms in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors - a 40% relief on business rates.",
      "Scotland has a slightly different system of \u201cnon-domestic rates\u201d, but ultimately Robison said there would be a similar 40% relief for the vast majority of hospitality premises.",
      "Retail and leisure were notably absent (although there is some support for music venues), and we will see how far this shakes out in terms of who does and doesn\u2019t qualify for funding.",
      "The Scottish Hospitality Group has said it is a \u201csignificantly more restricted\u201d offer than that down south, calling it a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d.",
      "A motif of Ms Robison\u2019s speech was name-checking her cabinet colleagues as she spoke to each of their portfolio areas.",
      "That felt particularly notable in the case of Kate Forbes - an influential figure as the woman John Swinney brought into government in part to mend fences with business.",
      "She has highlighted more money for town centre regeneration as well as a tripling of investment in the offshore wind supply chain, which it is said will leverage ten times that figure in private investment.",
      "This approach of public cash opening the door to huge flows of private funds is a favourite tactic of Ms Reeves - and indeed is the core purpose of GB Energy.",
      "That UK energy firm is set to have some company when it sets up in Aberdeen, with Ms Robison pledging to establish a hub or offshore wind in the North East.",
      "5. Politics",
      "The SNP does not have a majority in the Scottish Parliament, and thus needs the help of other parties to pass a budget.",
      "John Swinney has talked about wanting to reach out to opponents and run a collaborative administration.",
      "But there is no chance of a deal with the Conservatives, who want a billion pounds of tax cuts, or Labour, who really just want an election.",
      "That leaves the Greens and the Lib Dems as the most likely dance partners.",
      "Robison quite deliberately nodded to the key asks of both parties. There was funding for ferries, mental health and dentistry for the Lib Dems. The Greens demanded \u00a34.7bn for green policies - and she pledged \u00a34.9bn.",
      "The Greens welcomed some of the measures, but said \u201csignificant further changes\u201d were needed. They are particularly suspicious of the sums on offer for councils.",
      "The Lib Dems welcomed even more of Robison\u2019s announcements, with leader Alex Cole-Hamilton reeling off a whole series of measures where he said it was right the government had listened to him.",
      "The draft budget is really the starting point for talks, which won\u2019t come to a head until the first votes at Holyrood in February.",
      "But the fevered talk of snap elections which followed the collapse of the Bute House Agreement has faded. A deal with someone still feels the most likely outcome.",

      "During Prime Minister's Questions, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch asked why the prime minister had appointed a \"convicted fraudster\" as his transport secretary.",
      "Sir Keir said Haigh had been right to resign \"when new information came to light\".",
      "But, when asked by Badenoch for details about the new information, he replied: \"I'm not going to disclose private information.\"",
      "He added that Haigh's swift resignation was a \"marked contrast\" to the behaviour of the previous Conservative government and accused Badenoch of being \"obsessed with the Westminster issues\".",

      "\"The country needs conviction politicians not politicians with convictions,\" she said.",

      "Fixed penalty notices are not classed as criminal convictions, provided the fine is paid on time.",
      "Later, responding to Badenoch's questions, a Labour source said: \u201cIf the Conservatives want to have a row about the extent of their criminality in office, that's fine by us.",
      "\u201cThe fact is that her two predecessors were found guilty of breaking the law, partying in Downing Street while telling everyone else to follow the rules, something which the leader of the opposition described just a few weeks ago as \u2018overblown\u2019. Maybe she'll want to retract that statement.\u201d",
      "Last week, Haigh became the first minister to resign since the Labour government took office in July.",
      "On Thursday evening, Sky News and The Times revealed details of her past conviction.",
      "Haigh subsequently issued a statement giving further details of the incident, which took place in 2013 when she was working for insurance company Aviva.",
      "She said she had reported a mugging to the police and that a work mobile phone was one of the items that had been stolen.",
      "She later said she found the handset in a drawer at home.",
      "Turning on the phone \"triggered police attention\", she said, and the matter was taken to magistrates' court for making a false report to police.",
      "Haigh said: \"Under the advice of my solicitor I pleaded guilty \u2013 despite the fact this was a genuine mistake from which I did not make any gain.\"",
      "She received a conditional discharge six months before becoming an MP in the 2015 general election.",
      "Early on Friday, the morning after the details of the conviction emerged, Haigh sent a resignation letter to the prime minister, saying she did not want to become a distraction.",
      "The BBC has been told by Whitehall sources that she had told Sir Keir about her conviction when he picked her to be in his shadow cabinet in 2020.",
      "She did not tell the government's propriety and ethics team about it when she became a member of the cabinet after Labour won July's general election.",
      "She believed it was sufficient to have disclosed her spent conviction to Sir Keir when Labour was in opposition, the BBC has been told.",
      "On Friday, a Downing Street spokesperson refused to say what Sir Keir knew about the conviction, only that he accepted her resignation after \"further information\" emerged.",
      "The spokesperson was questioned for 25 minutes on the issue but refused to give more details.",
      "A regular briefing with journalists after Wednesday\u2019s Prime Minister Questions was no different, with a Labour spokesperson present simply saying they would not get into \u201cprivate discussions with former cabinet ministers\u201d.",
      "However the BBC understands that some in Downing Street were unhappy Haigh had not run her explanation past them before releasing it to the media on Thursday and felt she should have told senior civil servants about the conviction on becoming a minister.",
      "On Wednesday, Badenoch's spokesperson said: \u201cIt's not good enough to say this is a private matter.\u201d",
      "\"Did he know about the criminal conviction and put her in the Cabinet anyway? Or did he not and that is why he fired her on Friday?",

    "summary": "The Local Government Association says a freeze on central funding has cost councils nearly \u00a3740m since 2019.",
    "story": [
      "Councils in England facing soaring homelessness costs are urging the government to foot more of the bill, the BBC can reveal.",
      "Local authorities which house people in temporary accommodation generally pay the up-front costs and claim the cash back from central government.",
      "But the cross-party Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils across England, says a 2011 decision to freeze the amount they can claim back has cost them almost \u00a3740m in the last five years.",

      "\u201cYou've seen the dramatic increase in the cost of rents since 2011,\" Adam Hug, the LGA\u2019s housing spokesperson, told the BBC.",
      "\"So it's getting increasingly expensive in a constrained market to find places that are suitable for people to live at costs that councils can afford.\"",
      "That lack of available accommodation options has meant many councils have had to use more expensive options, such as hotels and bed and breakfasts, to house those in need.",
      "Official government data released last week showed a record 123,100 households were in temporary accommodation at the end of June, a 16% rise on last year.",
      "Matt Downie, chief executive of homelessness charity Crisis, told the BBC: \u201cAs more and more people are pushed into homelessness due to rising living costs and sky-high rents, they have nowhere else to go but to their local council, who too often have nowhere to put them but into expensive temporary accommodation that is often unfit for their needs.\u201d",
      "If someone meets the conditions for receiving temporary accommodation, it is often up to their local council to find them somewhere to stay.",
      "The council is then usually reimbursed by the Department for Work and Pensions, using the individual\u2019s benefits.",
      "Historically, the amount a council could claim back was capped at 90% of Local Housing Allowance, which is used to work out how much in benefits people are entitled to.",
      "But the coalition government froze that cap based on 2011 rates and no government has since unfrozen it.",
      "\u201c[Then-Chancellor] George Osborne and his gang decided to pass the buck to local authorities, and try and bear down on the benefits bill at the cost of many other things,\u201d said Hug, who is also the Labour leader of Westminster City Council.",

      "Labour\u2019s general election manifesto promised \u201ca new cross-government strategy, working with mayors and councils across the country, to put Britain back on track to ending homelessness\u201d.",
      "While the chancellor did commit an extra \u00a3230m to combat homelessness in the Budget, no such strategy has yet been launched.",

      "No, they are not talking about Cummings\u2019s views on Brexit or Elon Musk. They are talking about \u2018Whitehall\u2019 - the shorthand by which the political class refers to the tangle of institutions and civil servants whose job it is to implement the government\u2019s agenda.",
      "In Whitehall, Cummings has long argued, \u201cfailure is normal\u201d while \u201cconfident public school bluffers\u201d - rather than people with real policy expertise - reign supreme.",
      "Generations of politicians have made similar critiques but rarely with such freewheeling intensity.",

      "Certainly even among those civil servants who are alive to Whitehall\u2019s systemic flaws there is a view that the prime minister himself needs to be much more active in driving the machine if he wants to achieve results.",
      "\u201cStarmer appears to confuse process with outcomes,\u201d one said.",
      "\u201cYou can set up a child poverty taskforce, OK. But what do you want to do about the two-child benefit cap? You still have to make political choices and officials can\u2019t do that for you.\u201d",

      "Those around Starmer acknowledge that the mission boards are not yet quite at full strength. They will soon become more public-facing entities, holding meetings outside of London and doing more to bring in expertise from outside government.",
      "Stocktaking",
      "But the principal way in which the prime minister will seek to drive his agenda is via \u201cstock takes\u201d. These are meetings where Sir Keir brings those responsible for each mission into Downing Street to hold them accountable for what the data is showing in their area and asking them how they propose to improve. It\u2019s an idea which was pioneered by Sir Tony Blair on the advice of Michael Barber, his delivery adviser, who recently returned to government.",
      "The frequency of these stocktakes will soon increase, a senior government source said, adding: \u201cIf we are saying that this is the mission of the government and this is how people should judge its success and failure then it is clearly something you need the PM driving through.\u201d",
      "In the next few weeks Pat McFadden, the cabinet minister helping the prime minister to coordinate policy across Whitehall, will give a speech with more detail on the government\u2019s plans for civil service reform.",
      "Both he and Sir Keir are said to be seized of the need to bring more outside expertise into government and to make better use of data and artificial intelligence.",
      "The government\u2019s stated aims here are bold. Announcing the appointment of Sir Chris Wormald this week as the new cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, Sir Keir charged him with \u201cnothing less than the complete re-wiring of the British state\u201d.",
      "There was no shortage of people in Whitehall questioning whether the longest-serving head of a government department  - Sir Chris has run the health department for eight years and education for four before that  - is the right person to transform Whitehall. Sir Chris's supporters say that within the current system he is one of those most open to reform.",
      "The appointment was received with open contempt by Cummings, who sarcastically described it as a \u201ctruly beautiful, artistic\u201d decision which should serve as a \u201cwake up call\u201d that \u201cthe Westminster system is totally determined to resist any change\u201d.",
      "And on that, at the very least, the success of this government depends on Dominic Cummings being wrong."

      "The 95% clean power figure follows advice from the National Energy Systems Operator (NESO), which recently said a clean power system is one where demand is met by \u201cmainly renewables, with gas-fired generation used rarely to ensure security of supply\u201d.",

      "\u201cMany officials came to me in panic when they realised the cabinet secretary and permanent secretary of the health department in charge of pandemic planning truly believed that the faster everyone got Covid, the better,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cHe is now in charge of the entire system. Plan accordingly!\u201d",
      "Cummings also accused Sir Chris of being \u201cembedded deeply\u201d in the infected blood scandal and repeatedly telling ministers \u201cuntruths about the documents\u201d.",
      "In 2018 Sir Chris did write letters of apology after it emerged two former health ministers were incorrectly told all documents linked to infected blood had been placed in the National Archives, when campaigners later established that was not the case.",
      "Three years later, in 2021, Sir Chris then recused himself from any decisions related to the scandal.",
      "It later emerged that his father Peter, who was himself a Department of Health official from 1978 to 1981, was involved in meetings and decisions related to Britain\u2019s Blood Products Laboratory and had provided written evidence to the infected blood inquiry.",
      "Sir Chris was born in London in 1968 and went to Rutlish School in Merton, the same school former Prime Minister Sir John Major had gone to over 20 years earlier.",
      "He studied at St John's College, Oxford and on graduating almost immediately joined the civil service, starting out as a fast stream trainee in the Department for Education.",
      "Over the next 20 years he rose through the ranks, serving across Whitehall including at the Department for Communities and Local Government and in the office of the then-Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.",
      "Now at the pinnacle of his career, it had been widely-known that Sir Chris was on the final shortlist to be the prime minister's new cabinet secretary, alongside Antonia Romeo, who leads the Ministry of Justice, and Tamara Finkelstein, the top civil servant at the environment department.",
      "Nevertheless his appointment came as a bit of a surprise in Westminster, where there was a feeling that Sir Chris's time had been and gone.",
      "While some civil servants privately share Cummings' assessment of their new boss, those in the health department may welcome the fact that the top job has been given to someone who understands the NHS.",
      "Getting down NHS waiting lists is one of the prime minister's priorities and he may have had this in mind when picking Sir Chris.",
      "Another factor in the selection could be Sir Chris's relatively low media profile.",
      "Bruised by the brief tenure of his well-known chief of staff Sue Gray, the prime minister will hope that Sir Chris largely continues to go under the radar of the wider public's consciousness."

      "US space agency Nasa has announced a further delay to its plans to send astronauts back to the Moon.",
      "The agency's chief, Bill Nelson, said the second mission in the Artemis programme was now due for launch in April 2026.",
      "The plan had been to send astronauts around the Moon but not land in September 2025. The date had already slipped once before, from November of this year.",
      "That will mean that a Moon landing will not take place until at least 2027, a year later than originally planned.",
      "The delay is needed to fix an issue with the capsule's heat shield, which returned from the previous test flight excessively charred and eroded, with cracks and some fragments broken off.",
      "Mr Nelson told a news conference that \"the safety of our astronauts is our North Star\".",
      "\"We do not fly until we are ready. We need to do the next test flight, and we need to do it right. And that's how the Artemis programme proceeds.\"",
      "Mr Nelson said that engineers had got to the root of the problem and believed that it could be fixed by changing the trajectory of the capsule's re-entry \u2013 but it would take time to carry out a thorough assessment.",
      "Nasa is in a race with the Chinese space agency, which has its own plans to send astronauts to the Moon. Mr Nelson said he was confident that the Artemis programme would reach the lunar surface first, but he called on Nasa's commercial and international partners to \"double down to meet and improve this schedule\".",
      "\"We plan to launch Artemis 3 in mid-2027. That will be well ahead of the Chinese government's announced intention that they have already publicly stated is 2030.\"",

      "This is in stark contrast to Elon Musk's private sector firm, SpaceX, which is surging ahead in its efforts to build its own, eventually much cheaper and reusable Starship rocket.",
      "The nomination of Jared Isaacman by President-elect Donald Trump to take over from Mr Nelson as Nasa's head has added to growing concerns that big changes are in store for Nasa's Moon programme.",

      "\"SLS is an old-school rocket. It is not reusable like Starship, hence very expensive, and it has taken a long time to get it operational. And slow and expensive is a precarious position to be in when the incoming president, we expect, is looking to save costs.",
      "\"Isaacman is going to bring a new pair of eyes over how Nasa operates. And it's hard to predict what this combination of Isaacman, Musk and Trump might mean for Nasa as we know it.\""

      "For about two months each year, fisherman Faustino Mauloko da Cunha transforms his home along the South Pacific coast into a whale monitoring station.",
      "From the morning, villagers and student volunteers gather at the house in Subaun,  a village in the north of Timor-Leste. Armed with binoculars and telephoto cameras, they watch the cobalt waters for one of its great treasures - pygmy blue whales.",
      "When there is a sighting, it\u2019s all systems go.",
      "Faustino's son, Zacarias, dispatches a drone. Then the team\u2019s leader, Australian marine ecologist Karen Edyvane, guides him to take the best photographs. When the drone returns, the team reviews the pictures, taking notes on a white board.",
      "It's a small and thrifty operation in Timor-Leste, which is part of an archipelago that lies between South East Asia and the South Pacific. But it has generated a wealth of information about pygmy blue whales - one of the largest animals on earth, whose vast habitats and elusive nature make them challenging to study.",
      "These citizen science researchers, all of them locals, have spotted nearly 3,000 pygmy blue whales over the past 10 years - Prof Edyvane considers that a \u201ctruly extraordinary\u201d number.",
      "Timor-Leste has one of the world\u2019s highest concentrations of marine mammals.",
      "During the migration season - October and November - hundreds of pygmy blue whales pass through the country\u2019s waters as they make the epic journey spanning thousands of kilometres from the Banda Sea, which lies to the north of Timor-Leste, to southern Australia.",
      "But the area has been under-researched, says Prof Edyvane, who started the citizen science monitoring programme in 2014.",
      "During the last two whale seasons, she has based herself in Subaun, about 50km (31 miles) from the capital Dili, working with fishermen, students and dive tour operators to document the cetaceans.",
      "They have documented \"some of the lesser known, intimate reproductive behaviours of blue whales, some for the very first time,\" says Prof Edyvane, a researcher at Charles Darwin University and Australian National University.",
      "In 2022, for instance, tourists with a local tour operator invovlved in the programme captured underwater footage of a mother nursing her calf, offering a glimpse into the species\u2019 reproductive behaviours, which have remained largely unknown.",
      "\"It\u2019s very, very exciting,\u201d she adds.",
      "The programme started as a Facebook group, inviting local tour operators, fishermen and residents to share sightings of cetaceans.",
      "Prof Edyvane trained them on surveying methods and taught them how to use telephoto cameras and drones so that they could conduct aerial and boat surveys.",
      "\u201cWhen locals see the whales swimming by, they will post pictures on Facebook and WhatsApp. Updates come on a real-time basis and when someone shares something, everyone gets very excited,\u201d Prof Edyvane says.",
      "In 2016, the team worked with a dive tour operator to launch the first whale-watching tour.",
      "It was only last year that they set up a \u201cresearch station\u201d outside the da Cunha\u2019s village home - photos show a simple hut overlooking the bay. Outside are two tables, plastic chairs and white boards mounted on the hut's walls.",
      "During this year's whale season, undergraduates from the National University of East Timor and University Oriental Timor-Leste gathered at the research station to help with the sightings.",
      "Even such a basic structure has made the task easier.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re able to monitor all day and all night,\" Prof Edyvane says. \"We\u2019ve also been able to get the most incredible footage. The whales come in so close sometimes we can actually hear their blows.\"",
      "Citizen researchers like these have become powerful eyes and ears on the ground for marine scientists, says wildlife scientist Vanessa Pirotta.",
      "\u201cThe combination of people having access to tools like drones and social media means we have insights into things that are happening while we may be behind the desk writing grants to fund our work,\u201d she said.",
      "The increase in research activity in Subaun has also led to a rise in tourism.",
      "The demand for whale-watching tours has increased, diving instructor Cassio Schumacher tells the BBC, adding that these tours are \u201cbooked up years in advance\u201d.",
      "Local non-profits have warned of the risks of unregulated whale tourism and the government has said it intends to use Prof Edyvane's research  to \u201cfully protect and conserve\" the marine life that pass through Timor-Leste\u2019s waters.",
      "Prof Edyvane believes that with regulation, whale tourism has the potential to create jobs and grow Timor-Leste\u2019s economy.",
      "The country is one of the poorest in the world, where average annual incomes in cities hover around $1,500, according to the International Monetary Fund. In Subaun, most villagers work as subsistence fishermen and farmers, earning just about $600 to $900 a year.",
      "The da Cunha family has now started preparing meals from local produce and the day\u2019s catch for the students and tourists - an additional source of income.",
      "\u201cWe enjoyed having the guests around and will love to do it again,\" Faustino, 51, tells the BBC on a WhatsApp video call.  \"We will make it a better experience [next season].\"",

      "The news means that grey wolves will be moved from Annex II (strictly protected) to Annex III (protected) of the Bern Convention.",
      "This will remove many of the safeguards that have allowed the animals to flourish in Europe and means that from the beginning of March next year, each EU country will be able to set an annual quota of wolves to kill.",
      "The Commission argued that the number of wolves in the EU has almost doubled, from 11,000 in 2012 to over 20,000 today, and that they were causing too much damage to livestock.",
      "The Worldwide Fund for Nature  (WWF) has called the decision \"extremely disappointing\".",
      "\"Wolf populations have barely recovered after going extinct in most parts of Europe, and weakening their protection could jeopardise this fragile recovery,\" said the WWF in a statement.",
      "The organisation also accused the Commission of prioritising political decisions over science, saying the decision was influenced by \"personal reasons after Commission President Von der Leyen\u2019s pony was killed by a wolf in 2022\".",
      "Wildlife campaigners have argued that improved protection methods, including trained sheep dogs, would be a better solution than removing safeguards. They say that wolves keep down numbers of deer and wild boar, which damage trees and crops. Wolves also prevent the spread of diseases by eating sick animals.",
      "In the town of Baile Tusnad, in a valley near J\u00f3zsef\u2019s village, wildlife experts met recently to discuss large carnivores. Most, though not all, oppose the hunting of wolves and bears.",

      "Another argument against shooting wolves is that they hunt in packs of five to eight, usually a pair and their offspring. If the older wolves are shot, the pack fragments, making it harder for them to catch deer and wild boar.",
      "\u201cIndividual wolves are more likely to attack sheep and other domesticated animals,\u201d Mr Haring explains.",
      "Campaigners also pointed to a 2023 EU report, which states that only around 50,000 of Europe\u2019s 68 million sheep and goats are killed by wolves each year \u2013 0.065% of the total number \u2013 adding that the overall impact of wolves on EU livestock is \u201cvery small\u201d.",
      "Moreover, it says there have been no fatal wolf attacks on humans for 40 years.",
      "\u201cIf we expect countries like India or Indonesia to protect their tigers,\u201d says Laurent Schley, head of the Wildlife department in the Luxembourg government, \u201cand Africans to protect lions and elephants, then we as relatively rich Europeans should be willing to tolerate some wolves.\u201d Luxembourg is one of the few western European countries where no wolves have been sighted yet, Mr Schley believes it\u2019s only a matter of time.",
      "\u201cWe have very high densities of deer and wild boar, so the conditions for the wolf are there.",

      "\"I'm not going to do what they want and take my content to their platforms where it's not as successful where it's more likely to be censored, where I am more likely to have less control over my audience,\" she said.",
      "Nonetheless, other platforms are positioning themselves for a post-TikTok social media landscape.",
      "Meta, which owns Facebook as well as Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads, has sought to build rivals to TikTok's short form videos within its own apps, and made changes that users have likened to TikTok amid questions over the app's US future.",
      "Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at eMarketer, said there would be \"major upheaval\" if a TikTok appeal were to fail at the Supreme Court and a ban was enforced.",
      "She said this would be \"benefitting Meta, YouTube and Snap, while hurting content creators and small businesses that rely on the app to make a living.\"",
      "But TikTok won't be easily recreated, said Cory Johnson, Chief Market Strategist at Epistrophy Capital Research. Johnson said deep learning models power TikTok's recommendation engine.",
      "\"Enabling such complex AI and big data processing at TikTok's immense scale requires a colossal and expensive technical infrastructure,\" Johnson said.",
      "He said TikTok's hyper-targeting and China's data laws pose significant risks, and pointed to Elon Musk's alterations to algorithms at his social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, as a cautionary tale.",
      "In the run-up to the U.S. election, Musk's political posts received more views than all U.S. political campaign ads on X's disclosure dataset, Johnson said.",
      "\"We have very real and very recent experience in America with a social media network tweaking its algorithms to favor certain voices,\" he added."

    "story": [
      "Haliey Welch, known mostly as the star of the viral \"Hawk Tuah\" meme, is facing criticism after her newly launched cryptocurrency nosedived in value.",
      "Her \"Hawk\" digital coin hit a $490m market cap  shortly after it launched on Wednesday, before suddenly losing more than 95% of its value within hours.",
      "This has led some, including YouTube cryptocurrency investigator Coffeezilla, to accuse Ms Welch of scamming investors with a \"pump and dump\" - where the people behind a coin hype up its price before launch, then sell it for profit.",
      "She has denied allegations that her team sold any of the tokens they owned.",
      "The BBC has approached Ms Welch's representatives for comment.",
      "\"Team hasn't sold one token,\" she wrote in a copy and pasted post on X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday.",
      "She added that no \"KOL\" (key opinion leaders) were gifted a free token.",
      "Ms Welch had previously distributed free Hawk tokens to some fans ahead of the launch across social media.",
      "Hawk launched on the Solana blockchain at around 22:00 GMT on Wednesday, and its market capitalisation soared to highs of $490m shortly after.",
      "However it fell sharply from this high to around $60m just 20 minutes later.",
      "Fans and investors have accused Ms Welch and her team of \"misleading\" and \"betraying\" them and suggested the launch had been a \"rug pull\" - where promoters of a cryptocurrency draw in buyers, only to stop trading activity and make off with money raised from sales.",
      "A community note on Ms Welch's X post contests her explanation, saying her team had been selling their Hawk coins since launch.",
      "Scam allegations",
      "Coffeezilla, real name Stephen Findeisen, also claimed that Hawk gave \"insiders\" an advantage.",
      "\"Unfortunately with situations like this, they're not targeting crypto bros, they're mostly targeting actual fans who have never been involved in the crypto space before,\" he said in a video viewed more than 1.4 million times.",
      "He accused Ms Welch's team of \"profiting from a rug pull\".",
      "\"These people were unwilling to take any accountability\" of the \"Hawk Tuah scam\", he claimed, after sharing a clip of him speaking to some of the people behind the cryptocurrency.",
      "Ms Welch's post on X claimed that her team attempted to prevent so-called \"snipers\", who buy and sell cryptocurrencies quickly at moments when they are likely to make the most money from a gap in buy and sell price - sometimes using automated trading tools - by imposing higher fees on one exchange.",
      "The team behind the cryptocurrency, OverHere, has dismissed other claims about the launch in an X post.",
      "It stressed that \"Haliey's Team has sold absolutely no tokens whatsoever\".",
      "Meme coins such as this have been booming in popularity due to their jokey, cheap appeal for investors.",
      "They are often viewed as being less risky than more high profile crypto assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but carry the same dangers - with often no protection for those who lose money on them.",
      "Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, told the BBC on Thursday that while more young people are investing in meme coins, many of them are losing money.",
      "Several celebrities or influencers who have ventured into the crypto market have faced similar backlashes.",
      "In 2021, Kim Kardashian was fined $1.26m by US regulators after she failed to disclose that she had been paid to post an advert for a cryptocurrency scheme called EthereumMax.",
      "More recently, YouTuber Logan Paul was accused of misleading fans by promoting crypto coins or investments without divulging his own financial interest in them.",
      "Who is 'Hawk Tuah Girl' Haliey Welch?",
      "Known online as the \"Hawk Tuah girl\", Ms Welch went viral after speaking the onomatopoeia \"hawk tuah\" - imitating the sound of someone spitting - during an interview in June.",
      "It made the 22-year-old, from Belfast, Tennessee, an overnight internet sensation.",
      "She amassed hundreds of thousands of followers across various social platforms and launched her own merchandise and a podcast called \"Talk Tuah\".",

      "Rolling Stone has likened her funny, small-town personality to a \"Gen Z Dolly Parton\".",
      "Ms Welch told outlet TMZ ahead of Hawk's launch on Wednesday that she launched it to tackle \"a bunch of imposters\" pretending to be her and selling their own coins.",

      "1. The mysterious creator of Bitcoin",
      "Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto.",
      "They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email.",
      "Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers.",
      "But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out.",
      "In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be a false lead caused by some mistranslated information.",
      "Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi.",
      "Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him.",
      "2. Making history... with pizza",
      "Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza.",
      "On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas.",
      "A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day.",
      "A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online.",
      "Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin.",
      "The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars!",
      "3. Becoming legal tender",
      "In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender.",
      "Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar.",
      "Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country.",
      "While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped.",
      "He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country.",
      "As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years.",
      "The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country.",
      "It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value.",
      "A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value.",
      "4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust",
      "In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions.",
      "These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part.",
      "Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves.",
      "At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment.",
      "But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts.",
      "Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth.",
      "Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact.",
      "5. Bitcoins in the rubbish dump",
      "Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (\u00a378m) - and then  accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details.",
      "That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him",
      "The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline.",
      "Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling.\"",
      "6. Crypto King fraudster",
      "No-one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community.",
      "FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days.",
      "Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research.",
      "Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: \"I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.\"",
      "After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years.",
      "7. Investment bank boom",
      "Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies.",
      "In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any.",
      "Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs.",
      "It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined.",
      "Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold."

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 19:37:41 GMT",
    "summary": "The carmaker's new look is praised as \"exciting\" but others say it should \"go back to the drawing board\".",
    "story": [
      "Luxury car maker Jaguar has unveiled its new electric concept car and, like a recent controversial teaser video, it has divided opinion.",
      "Some on social media said the new Type 00 car was \"exciting\" and \"absolutely stunning\", while others called it \"rubbish\" and told Jaguar's designers to \"go back to the drawing board\".",
      "However, the carmaker has suggested the reaction is exactly what it wanted, as it tries to reset its brand to revive sluggish sales.",
      "\"Jaguar needs to be bold and disruptive in order to cut through and get our message across,\" boss Rawdon Glover told the BBC.",
      "He said his goal was to restore Jaguar's image as a luxury brand, while no longer trying to compete by pumping out large numbers of cars.",
      "Jaguar has long been the weakest link within the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) group, which also makes Range Rovers and Land Rover Defenders.",
      "Since 2018, sales have plunged from 180,000 to just 67,000 last year.",
      "Last month, JLR stopped selling new Jaguars in the UK altogether, ahead of its relaunch as an electric-only brand in 2026",
      "The firm also announced a new logo, alongside a so-called \"social media tease\", which featured models dressed in bright colours but no actual vehicles.",
      "Many criticised the advert as \"woke\", with Elon Musk - boss of Jaguar competitor Tesla - asking \"Do you sell cars?\"",
      "Others criticised the change to Jaguar's iconic growling cat badge, which has been altered and no longer appears on the front of the car.",
      "Mr Glover has defended the effort, saying the debate helped to draw \"more eyeballs\" to the firm for this week's unveiling of the new concept car.",
      "\"In that context... the strategy was successful,\" he said.",
      "\"We absolutely don't want to ostracize any of our customer base ... But, as I say, [the] most important thing for us is we need to attract a new audience to Jaguar's brand to make sure that we are safeguarding the next 90 years of Jaguar's future.\"",
      "'Trust and reserve judgement' on rebrand, says Jaguar",
      "JLR halts UK Jaguar sales before electric relaunch",
      "JLR announced the transition to electric vehicles in 2021, keeping all of its three British plants open as part of the strategy.",
      "It said the decision to stop selling new Jaguar cars in the UK last month was a deliberate move to \"create some breathing space\" before unveiling its new look.",
      "The Type 00 model unveiled at a Miami art fair is a concept car and so will not go into production for sale to the public.",
      "Instead, the vehicle, which features an ultra-long bonnet and big wheels, gives a pointer to the direction of the brand's new models.",
      "Mr Glover said Jaguar had \"ripped up the rulebook\" with the new design, which is also intended to evoke Jaguars past when the brand was in its heyday.",
      "The rebrand comes with a higher price point, with Jaguar aiming for the luxury market.",
      "\"Nobody needs a vehicle at \u00a3120,000. You have to want one,\" he said.",
      "\"Overall, this has got that sense of real occasion. And that's that's what we think is perhaps missing in that luxury EV space,\" he added.",
      "But many on social media were nonplussed by the preview.",
      "James May, broadcaster and former presenter of Top Gear, said he was \"slightly disappointed\" by the design and its price.",
      "\"I wanted something more futuristic,\" he told the BBC. \"I mean, Jaguar have been saying they will copy nothing, but there's quite a bit of other concept cars in that new Jag.\"",
      "May said Jaguar cars had traditionally been \"very reasonably priced compared with, for example, Aston Martin\".",
      "\"So I'd like to see something more like half the price that they're toting at the moment.\"",
      "'Too big'",
      "Beatrix Keim, director at the Center of Automotive Research, said that Jaguar's concept car was \"too big, too unreal\".",
      "\"This is not the way to go,\" she said, given that there are already big cars in the market and \"electric cars cannot only be for the rich\".",
      "\"Of course, Jaguar is a luxury brand,\" she added. \"But I don't think that this is the direction which Jaguar at current point of time needs, because it's losing out on volume as well. And this is not a volume car.\u201d",
      "Amanda Stretton, a racing driver and motoring journalist, also said she thought Jaguar was going in the \"wrong direction\" on price.",
      "\"The market for cars in excess of \u00a3100,000 is not enormous. So Jaguar\u2019s trying to break into a market that's already tightly fought,\" she said, adding that the size of the new car appeared to be \"absolute nonsense\".",
      "\"It needs to be shrunk by about 50% to be practical.\"",

    "story": [
      "Wearable tech \u2013 currently dominated by smart watches - is a multi-billion dollar industry with a sharp focus on health tracking.",
      "Many premium products claim to accurately track exercise routines, body temperature, heart rate, menstrual cycle and sleep patterns, among others.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting has talked about a proposal to give wearables to millions of NHS patients in England, enabling them to track symptoms such as reactions to cancer treatments, from home.",
      "But many doctors \u2013 and tech experts \u2013 remain cautious about using health data captured by wearables.",
      "I\u2019m currently trying out a smart ring from the firm Ultrahuman \u2013 and it seemed to know that I was getting sick before I did.",
      "It alerted me one weekend that my temperature was slightly elevated, and my sleep had been restless. It warned me that this could be a sign I was coming down with something.",
      "I tutted something about the symptoms of perimenopause and ignored it - but two days later I was laid up in bed with gastric flu.",
      "I didn\u2019t need medical assistance, but if I had \u2013 would the data from my wearable have helped healthcare professionals with my treatment? Many wearable brands actively encourage this.",
      "The Oura smart ring, for example, offers a service where patients can download their data in the form of a report to share with their doctor.",
      "Dr Jake Deutsch, a US-based clinician who also advises Oura, says wearable data enables him to \u201cassess overall health more precisely\u201d \u2013 but not all doctors agree that it\u2019s genuinely useful all of the time.",
      "Dr Helen Salisbury is a GP at a busy practice in Oxford. She says not many patients come in brandishing their wearables, but she\u2019s noticed it has increased, and it concerns her.",
      "\u201cI think for the number of times when it\u2019s useful there\u2019s probably more times that it\u2019s not terribly useful, and I worry that we are building a society of hypochondria and over-monitoring of our bodies,\u201d she says.",
      "Dr Salisbury says there can be a large number of reasons why we might temporarily get abnormal data such as an increased heart rate, whether it\u2019s a blip in our bodies or a device malfunction - and many of them do not require further investigation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we will be encouraging people to monitor everything all the time, and see their doctor every time the machine thinks they\u2019re ill, rather than when they think they\u2019re ill.\u201d",
      "And she makes a further point about the psychological use of this data as a kind of insurance policy against shock health diagnoses. A nasty cancerous tumour for example, is not necessarily going to be flagged by a watch or an app, she says.",
      "What wearables do is encourage good habits - but the best message you can take from them is the same advice doctors have been giving us for years. Dr Salisbury adds: \u201cThe thing you can actually do is walk more, don\u2019t drink too much alcohol, try and maintain a healthy weight. That never changes.\u201d",
      "The Apple Watch is reported to be the world\u2019s best-selling smart watch, although sales have slowed lately.",
      "Apple didn't comment, but the tech giant uses true stories of people whose lives have been saved because of the heart tracking function of the device in its marketing, and anecdotally I have heard plenty of those too. What I haven\u2019t heard however, is how many cases of false positives there are.",
      "In many cases when patients present their data to healthcare professionals, clinicians prefer to try to recreate it using their own equipment, rather than simply trust what the wearable has captured.",
      "There are several reasons for this, says Dr Yang Wei, associate professor in wearable technologies at Nottingham Trent University  \u2013 and they\u2019re all very practical.",
      "\u201cWhen you go to hospital, and you measure your ECG [electrocardiogram, a test that checks the activity of your heart], you don\u2019t worry about power consumption because the machine is plugged into the wall,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cOn your watch, you\u2019re not going to measure your ECG continuously because you drain your battery straight away.\u201d",
      "In addition, movement \u2013 both of the wearable itself on a wrist, for example, and general movement of the person wearing it - can \u201ccreate noise\u201d in the data it collects, he adds, making it less reliable.",
      "Dr Wei points to the ring on my finger.",
      "\u201cThe gold standard to measure the heart rate is from the wrist or direct from the heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you measure from the finger, you\u2019re sacrificing accuracy.\"",
      "It is the role of software to fill in such data gaps, he says - but there\u2019s no international standard for wearables here - for either the sensors and software that power wearable devices, or for the data itself, and even what format it is gathered in.",
      "The more consistently a device is worn, the more accurate its data is likely to be. But here\u2019s a cautionary tale.",
      "Ben Wood was out for the day when his wife received a series of alarming notifications from his Apple Watch, telling her he had been in a car crash. It advised her to text him rather than call because he may need to keep the line clear for the emergency services.",
      "The alerts were genuine, and sent to her as his emergency contact \u2013 but in this case unnecessary. Ben was out at a race track driving some fast cars. He admitted that he \u201cwasn\u2019t very gifted\u201d at it \u2013 but said he felt safe at all times.",
      "\u201cThe boundaries between incident and alert need to be managed carefully,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see how device-makers, emergency services, first responders and individuals think about this technology in the future.\u201d",
      "Pritesh Mistry, digital technologies fellow at the Kings Fund, agrees that there are significant challenges around folding current patient-generated data into our healthcare systems, and adds that the discussion has already been going on for several years in the UK without any clear resolution.",
      "He says there\u2019s \u201ca good case to be made\u201d for the use of wearables in the UK government\u2019s current drive to push care out of hospitals and into community settings.",
      "\u201cBut without that underpinning foundation of technology enablement in terms of the infrastructure, and supporting the workforce to have the skills, knowledge, capacity and confidence, I think it\u2019s going to be a challenge,\u201d he adds.",

      "\"I find it hard to trawl the internet; I don\u2019t want the faff. This saves you a lot of time. It\u2019s better for suggestions than just asking Google.\"",
      "As a result, she\u2019ll be wrapping a slackline for him this Christmas.",

      "\u201cThis is how it used to be with retailers. You used to go into a store and ask them for advice if you are looking for something, like a birthday present for a niece. Online never had that aspect and this gives them a chance to do that.\u201d",
      "She says gen AI platforms have the potential to really shake-up how we search for products.",
      "\u201cIf this becomes the norm, then it brings about big changes in how consumers are routed through to the sites of retailers, and poses questions for the likes of advertising and sponsored link costs via search engines,\u201d says Ms Ellett.",

      "\u201cIt was vague with its suggestions, and came back with generic results like a tote bag and diary, and posters with inspirational quotes which my sister would think I had lost the plot if I gave her that. It didn\u2019t offer specific products.\u201d",
      "Strangely, however, it was very specific when it came to generating ideas for her partner, who she added to ChatGPT that he was male, 47, and likes technology.",

      "Overall, Ms Arrowsmith says she thinks AI would be a useful tool for someone who didn\u2019t know where to start.",

      "It was April 1960. Students had launched protests calling for the resignation of the dictatorial president Syngman Rhee. Mr Koh was working in a government building when he looked out of the window and saw protesters clashing with police.",
      "\"There were demonstrations from various universities, and they all gathered in front\u2026 that's when shots were fired,\" the 87-year-old said. Days later, martial law was declared.",
      "South Korea is widely considered a peaceful beacon of democracy in Asia, but that wasn't always the case. This is a country that saw 16 bouts of martial law during its first four decades ruled largely by dictators.",
      "It is why democracy is now deeply treasured by South Koreans as a hard-won right. It is also why President Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration of martial law this week \u2013 the first to happen in 45 years and during democratic rule - was particularly triggering and prompted such a visceral response.",
      "Almost immediately, lawmakers jumped out of bed and rushed to the national assembly, clambering over fences to reverse martial law.",
      "Hundreds of ordinary citizens gathered to hold back troops who had been ordered to throw out MPs.",
      "Some soldiers, apparently unwilling to carry out their orders, reportedly dragged their feet in clearing the crowd and entering the building.",
      "When Yoon declared martial law on Tuesday night, he said it was necessary to get rid of \"pro-North anti-state\" forces. Initially, it caused confusion with some South Koreans who believed there was a genuine threat from the North.",
      "But as they continued watching Yoon's televised announcement, many grew sceptical. He gave no evidence of such forces at work, nor explained who they were. As Yoon had previously used similar language to describe the opposition that had been stymying his reforms, the public concluded he was actually trying to crush his political foes.",
      "Previous periods of martial law had also been justified by leaders as necessary to stabilise the country, and sometimes stamp out what they alleged were communist subversives planted by North Korea.",
      "They curtailed freedom of press and freedom of movement. Night curfews and arrests were common.",
      "Violent clashes sometimes took place, most indelibly in 1980, when then President Chun Doo-hwan extended martial law to deal with student protesters calling for democracy in the southern city of Gwangju. A brutal military crackdown was launched, and it has since been labelled a massacre \u2013 while the official death toll is 193, some experts believe hundreds more died.",
      "South Korea eventually transitioned to democracy in 1988, when the government held its first free and fair presidential election following mounting public pressure. But the preceding decades had permanently and profoundly shaped the nation's consciousness.",

      "Ms Kim was a young child when martial law was last in place and has little memory of it. Still, she shudders at the thought of it returning.",

      "The competing ideologies would lead to clashes and \"when the military intervened, the situation would stabilise\u2026 it was a process to restore order and properly establish free democracy.",
      "\"Given the circumstances, we couldn't help but view it positively,\" he said, adding that he felt each period of martial law left the country in a more \"favourable\" position. Martial law in South Korea \"fundamentally differed\" from other nations, where it \"wasn't about killing people or senseless violence\", he insisted.",

    "summary": "With French politics in turmoil, Macron hopes to benefit from the reopening of the cathedral.",
    "story": [
      "A gravely weakened President Emmanuel Macron hopes to win a new lease of political life from Saturday's ceremonial reopening of Notre Dame.",
      "Joined by US President-elect Donald Trump, Prince William and other international figures, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Macron will seek to present the renovated cathedral as a symbol of France's inner reserves of creative strength.",
      "In a speech marking the occasion, he will urge the world to see beyond the country's current political crisis and admire the determination, organisation and hard graft that have rescued one of France's most famous buildings in just five years.",
      "The long-awaited event comes just as France enters a period of deep uncertainty triggered by the fall of Prime Minister Michel Barnier's government on Wednesday. A replacement has yet to be named.",
      "Five-and-a-half years after the devastating fire, Macron had planned to make the cathedral's reopening the optimistic climax of 2024 \u2013 a year also marked by the Paris Olympic Games.",
      "But while he seeks to capitalise on the project's undoubted success, a contrast is unavoidable between the depressed state of the country as a whole, and the soaring achievement of fixing this magnificent Gothic cathedral.",
      "The ceremony marks the moment that the Catholic Church retakes possession of the cathedral, ahead of the first Mass to be celebrated on Sunday.",
      "Archbishop Laurent Ulrich will knock on the front portal using a staff made from one of the rescued roof-timbers. Answered by the choir, which will already be inside, he will enter the cathedral and bid the organ \"ring forth praises of God\".",
      "Macron had originally intended to make an address inside the cathedral, but was advised that this would contravene France's strict rules on secularity.",
      "As a compromise, he visited the cathedral eight days ago to thank hundreds of craftsmen and women \u2013 a televised tour which allowed the world a first glimpse of the stunningly rejuvenated interior.",
      "The evening's religious ceremony will be followed by a concert featuring Chinese pianist Lang Lang and Canadian singer Garou.",
      "Sunday's Mass \u2013 which the president will attend \u2013 will be conducted by Archbishop Ulrich in the presence of 170 French bishops and priests from 106 Paris parishes. The first Mass for the public is on Sunday evening, but booking was required \u2013 as it is for all the Masses planned for the week ahead.",
      "One dignitary who will not be attending is Pope Francis, though he has sent a message that will be read out on Saturday.",
      "The Pope's relations with France are cordial rather than friendly. He is reported to have been angered by French policies to cut immigration, and by Macron's decision to put the right to abortion in the constitution.",
      "In the French press, the Pope is said to be more interested in the younger and growing Christian communities of the southern hemisphere than the medieval Churches of Europe.",
      "The fire on 15 April 2019 destroyed the medieval roof-timbers, the spire and three sections of stone vaulting. An appeal for donors raised \u20ac850m ($897m; \u00a3704m), and 2,000 masons, carpenters, art-restorers, engineers and architects worked on the project.",
      "\"The moment I looked inside on the day after the fire, I knew that everything would be all right. The damage was nothing like as bad as I had feared,\" said cathedral chief architect Philippe Villeneuve, who disputes the widespread theory that Notre-Dame came close to total collapse.",
      "\"Apart from replacing the roof and spire, the main task was decontamination. Everything was covered in lead oxide powder. But that meant we could restore and clean \u2013 which explains why the cathedral looks so beautiful today.\"",
      "Before the fire, the cathedral was already deemed to be in a state of severe disrepair, and scaffolding was in place to renovate the spire and other external parts much damaged by corrosion.",
      "Some 12 million people per year were visiting the cathedral, a number which is now expected to rise. A new route around the building has been devised to cope with the 100 visitors a minute expected to come here at the height of the tourist season.",

    "summary": "Traders and shop-owners lost their livelihoods as a result of destruction from Israeli attacks.",
    "story": [
      "Wedged into the middle of a three storey-high pile of rubble and charred possessions in southern Beirut is a twisted and cracked metal sign. \u201cSpare parts. Jeep Cherokee,\u201d it says.",
      "It is the only indication that the ground floor of this destroyed building had been occupied by a busy car parts dealership \u2013 one of many such businesses destroyed by Israel\u2019s heavy bombing of Dahieh, the largely Hezbollah-controlled southern suburb  of the capital.",
      "\u201cWe were so confident we wouldn\u2019t be hit, because of the nature of the people here \u2013 ordinary, people, business owners,\u201d said Imad Abdelhak, staring up at the smashed building.",
      "Abdelhak\u2019s garage, next door, had survived the worst of the air strike, but he was waiting to find out if the whole structure would have to be torn down because of the impact.",
      "All over Lebanon, business owners are reeling after an intense conflict between Israel and Hezbollah saw Israeli bombs rain down on residential, commercial and industrial parts of the country, destroying shops, warehouses and stocks of goods.",
      "A US- and French-brokered ceasefire, which is largely holding, halted the war last week, but for many of the country\u2019s business owners and workers the pain is only beginning.",
      "\u201cI have lost $20,000 and my only source of income,\u201d said Ibrahim Mortada, another car parts dealer in Dahieh whose building was hit. \u201cI have no idea how we can survive,\u201d he said.",
      "Like Abdelhak, Mortada was waiting for engineers to assess the building, but it was clear to anyone standing underneath it that the structure was unsafe. The top seven floors had been destroyed by a direct strike. Huge slabs of concrete and loose rubble hung precariously over Mortada\u2019s head as he attempted to clear up what was left of his premises.",
      "\u201cMy business has been open here for 23 years,\u201d he said, dejectedly. \u201cWe are counting on God to help us now.\u201d",
      "The business owners of Dahieh and beyond are also counting on Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese political and militant group, which said it will begin this week to assess the damage to homes and businesses and dole out cash for people to pay rent, buy new furniture, and begin to rebuild.",
      "In the southern city of Nabatieh on Wednesday, where its Ottoman-era market and surrounding businesses were completely destroyed, people were still waiting for the Hezbollah assessors to arrive.",
      "\u201cNobody has contacted us \u2013 nobody from the government, nobody from any group,\u201d said Niran Ali, a 56-year-old woman whose shop, Zen Baby Fashion, had disappeared with virtually all of its stock.",
      "Scanning the rubble, Ali caught sight of a pink, soot-covered pair of girls\u2019 tracksuit bottoms, hanging from a steel girder jutting out of the heap. \u201cThese were mine,\u201d she said, running her finger across the blackened fabric. \u201cMaybe they are the only thing left of my business.\u201d",
      "Like others in Nabatieh, Ali had heard that Hezbollah was going to begin by assessing homes (the group has pledged $5,000 per household to help pay for rent, and $8,000 to replace furniture) and then move on to businesses, where the losses are much higher.",
      "Jalal Nasser, who owned a large complex containing a coffee shop, restaurant and library, returned to the city on the first day of the ceasefire to find the complex transformed into a charred husk by a massive air strike across the road. He estimated he had lost up to $250,000.",
      "He set up a small table and chair on the edge of the shell of the building, overlooking the main street, and smoked his shisha. \u201cTo give people hope\u201d, he said.",
      "As for where the money was going to come from to rebuild, \u201cthat is the big question,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cBut we are waiting for Hezbollah. I\u2019m sure they will give.\u201d",
      "The World Bank estimates this war has caused at least $8.5bn worth of damage to Lebanon\u2019s economy. It would be a huge sum for any similar nation, but for Lebanon it comes on the heels of a financial crisis in 2019 and the devastating port blast the following year.",
      "In the aftermath of the previous war with Israel, in 2006, money poured in from Iran and from gulf states to rebuild Lebanon. This time around, it is unclear if that tap will turn on.",
      "\u201cThere is nothing yet in terms of allocation for reconstruction,\u201d Nasser Yasin, the environment minister and head of the government\u2019s crisis cell told the BBC on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWe have some good indications, some pledges from friends of Lebanon,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we estimate we are going to need billions of dollars this time. The level of destruction is probably six to 10 times what it was in 2006.\u201d",
      "Israel has said it was acting solely against Hezbollah in its strikes on Nabatieh, and not against the Lebanese population. Yasin accused the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) of \"urbicide\" for its widespread destruction of the city.",
      "On a visit to Nabatieh on Wednesday afternoon, Imran Riza, the UN\u2019s deputy special co-ordinator for Lebanon, told the BBC the scale of what needed to be done was \u201cenormous\u201d.",
      "\u201cThe past two and a half months, particularly, have been massively destructive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a very long road back.\u201d",
      "The historic market in Nabatieh dates back about 500 years. It has repeatedly come under attack from Israel in the decades since 1978. Unlike previous attacks, this time the destruction was total.",
      "\u201cThis is the worst for Nabatieh, the worst war we have seen,\u201d said Yusuf Mouzzain, who owned a clothes shop in the market. In his shop, a few surviving clothes hung on a rail, coated in soot. He estimated he had suffered about $80,000 worth of damage.",
      "In 2006, Hezbollah gave a good sum to the affected business owners. This time, he had no idea what they would receive, or who from. \u201cBut we have lost everything, he said. \u201cSo someone has to give us something.\u201d",

      "Thompson was the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, the insurance unit of health services provider UnitedHealth Group. The company is the largest insurer in the US.",
      "Police are still on the hunt for the suspected killer, whose motivation is unknown, but authorities have revealed messages written on shell casings found at the scene.",

And 17% of respondents said their insurer denied coverage for care that was recommended by their doctor.",
      "Not only is the US health system complicated, it's expensive, and huge costs can often fall directly on individuals.",

    "summary": "The IAEA agency says Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme has \"spawned in every direction\" over the last decade.",
    "story": [
      "The head of the UN nuclear watchdog has told the BBC Iran's decision to begin producing significantly more highly enriched uranium was \"very worrisome\".",
      "Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said Iran was increasing its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60%, just below the level of purity needed for a nuclear weapon.",
      "This will be seen by many in the region as Tehran's response to its military and diplomatic setbacks in Syria, Lebanon and Gaza in recent months.",
      "Mr Grossi said it was \"no secret\" some politicians in Iran were calling for the development of a nuclear weapon - but after holding talks in Tehran in recent weeks, he said that \"doesn't seem to be the path of choice\" by the current leadership.",
      "Mr Grossi was speaking on the margins of the Manama Dialogue conference in Bahrain run by the London-based think tank, the International Institute for Strategic Studies.",
      "He warned Israel against attacking Iranian nuclear facilities, saying the consequences would be \"very, very serious indeed\" in terms of Tehran's retaliation and the potential spread of radiation.",
      "He also said it was \"extremely concerning\" that more countries were thinking of acquiring nuclear weapons and that the public conversation about their use had become \"normalised\".",
      "In a report to IAEA governors on Friday, Mr Grossi said his inspectors had confirmed Iran was feeding more partially enriched uranium into the cascades of two centrifuges at its Fordow nuclear plant south of Tehran.",
      "\"The facility's updated design information showed that the effect of this change would be to significantly increase the rate of production of UF6 (uranium) enriched up to 60%,\" the report said. It assessed the facility would produce 34kg (75lb) of 60% uranium per month compared previously with 4.7kg.",
      "The IAEA had demanded further \"safeguard measures\" at Fordow \"as a matter of urgency to enable the agency to provide timely and technically credible assurances that the facility is not being misused to produce uranium of an enrichment level higher than that declared by Iran, and that there is no diversion of declared nuclear material\".",
      "Iran denies having a military nuclear programme. But Mr Grossi told the BBC its nuclear energy facilities had increased over the last decade.",
      "\"They have a nuclear programme that has grown, has spawned in every possible direction.",
      "\"The Iran of 2015 has nothing to do with Iran of 2025. Iran is starting production of 60% [uranium] at a much higher level of production, which means they will have the amounts necessary - if they so choose - to have a nuclear device in a much faster way. So we see an escalation in this regard, which is very worrisome.\"",
      "On a visit to Tehran last month, Mr Grossi said he had been given an assurance by Iranian leaders that they would limit their production of 60% enriched uranium.",
      "Iran's decision to increase production comes after little progress was made in nuclear talks between European and Iranian officials last week.",
      "Mr Grossi said there were groups in Iran that were \"very vocal\" calling for the country to \"do its own thing\" on nuclear weapons.",
      "\"In my conversations with the government, that doesn't seem to be the path of choice, but they sometimes refer to this as something they might need to reconsider. I hope not. I have told them this would be a regrettable choice.\"",
      "Israel has not yet launched a full-scale attack on Iran's nuclear facilities - but its ministers have openly discussed the possibility.",
      "Asked about the consequences of any such Israeli attack, Mr Grossi said: \"I don't think this would go without an answer, militarily speaking, so I think we need to avoid this.",
      "\"One should not forget that a big part of the nuclear programme in Iran is underground and very well protected. So kinetic action against the programme would require a vast deployment of force.",
      "\"I just hope that we are not going to get there. I know the radiological consequences if you attack a nuclear facility.\"",
      "Mr Grossi also warned that the world's nuclear non-proliferation regime was under stress, as established nuclear powers \"seem to be relying more on nuclear weapons or modernising their arsenals\".",
      "As a result, other nations were talking more about acquiring nuclear weapons.",
      "\"There are countries saying: well, why not us? If we see that we have a world... with new conflicts, the big [countries] are saying that perhaps they might use the nuclear weapons they have, maybe we should think about our own security.\"",

We cannot allow people from another faith to come and live here. We will not allow them to enter and continue to protest as long as they don't go away,\" she added.",
      "Many of the residents also visited the district magistrate's office to lodge a complaint. Outside, they shouted slogans against Dr Bajaj and the Muslim couple.",
      "The protests have had their intended effect. On Friday, Dr Bajaj told the BBC that a resolution, mediated by the city's elected representative, had been reached and the new Muslim owners would re-sell the house to a Hindu family already living in the housing society.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 12:51:57 GMT",
    "summary": "Macron rejected calls to resign, a day after his prime minister was ousted in a no-confidence vote.",
    "story": [
      "French President Emmanuel Macron has said he will name a new prime minister \"in the coming days\", after Michel Barnier resigned following a no-confidence vote in parliament.",
      "In a 10-minute address to the nation on Thursday, he rejected opposition pressure to stand down, vowing to stay in his post \"fully, until the end of the mandate\" in 2027.",
      "Macron was holding talks on Friday with leaders of the Socialists, who said they were ready for a compromise in forming a \"fixed-term\" government, but not under a prime minister from a right-wing party.",
      "The Socialists joined colleagues on the left and far right in voting to remove Michel Barnier on Wednesday, only three months after he was appointed by Macron.",
      "The president thanked Barnier for his dedication during his brief term as prime minister, and accused MPs of collaborating in an \"anti-republican front\" to bring down the government.",
      "The vote was the first time a French government had been voted down by parliament in more than 60 years, a move Macron labelled \"unprecedented\".",
      "In France, it is the president who chooses the prime minister who then runs the government. But the prime minister must answer to parliament and Barnier lasted only three months before he was ousted in a no-confidence vote.",
      "Finding someone who will not be immediately rejected by parliament could be difficult for Macron, whose decision in June to call snap elections led to a deadlocked parliament.",
      "The National Assembly is now split into three big voting blocs - the left, centre and far right. If Macron's next choice of prime minister is to last, it is thought at least part of the left bloc will need to be persuaded to join the next government.",
      "The president held talks with several political leaders on Friday, having told the French people he would \"appoint in the coming days a prime minister who will form a government of general interest\".",
      "He first spoke to centrists in the \"Macron camp\", before meeting Socialist leaders, who are part of a broader left-wing bloc, the New Popular Front. He will also talk to the right-wing Republicans.",
      "Socialist leader Olivier Faure said ahead of the talks that he was open to discussion and \"compromises on every issue\" towards forming a government based on a \"fixed term contract\". But he made clear he had little desire to \"ensure the continuity of Macronism\".",
      "No new parliamentary elections can be held until July 2025, which might explain Faure's remarks on being open to a limited term for the next government.",
      "Faure said after the talks Macron had \"absolutely not\" asked the Socialists to split from the wider New Popular Front (NFP). However, the biggest member of the NFP, the far-left France Unbowed, said Faure had been given no mandate to speak on the Popular Front's behalf.",
      "Responding to Macron's speech on Thursday, Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Rally (RN), posted  social media: \"A little reminder to President Macron, who is supposed to be the guarantor of the Constitution: censure is not anti-republican, it is provided for in the Constitution of our Fifth Republic.\"",
      "The no-confidence vote that toppled Barnier's leadership had been tabled by both the New Popular Front (NFP) left-wing alliance, and Le Pen's RN.",
      "They united to censure the government after the former Brexit negotiator used special powers to force through his budget without a vote.",
      "A total of 331 MPs voted in support of the motion against Barnier, far more than the 288 required for it to pass.",
      "Barnier resigned on Thursday, and the budget was automatically withdrawn. He will remain in office on a caretaker basis with his ministers until a new government is appointed. Macron's role is unaffected.",
      "Macron has been heavily criticised for deciding to call snap elections, creating a deadlock in parliament and an escalating political crisis.",
      "He admitted in his address that his decision \"was not understood\": \"Many have blamed me for it and, I know, many continue to blame me. It's a fact and it's my responsibility.\"",
      "Addressing voters directly, he said some of his political opponents had chosen \"chaos over responsibility\" and that they were not thinking \"about you, the voters\", suggesting their focus was on the next presidential elections.",
      "Macron gave no indication of who the next prime minister would be, but said their immediate focus would be the budget for 2025.",
      "Speculation has been swirling over who could be named, with potential candidates including Defence Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, and centrist former presidential candidate Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou.",
      "Before Macron chose Barnier as prime minister, he asked his predecessor Gabriel Attal to stay on as caretaker for two months after the summer elections.",
      "It seems highly unlikely that the next government can be in place before Saturday, when world leaders including US President-elect Donald Trump are due to attend the opening ceremony of the rebuilt Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris.",
      "The building was devastated by fire in April 2019, and its reconstruction little more than five years later has drawn worldwide praise.",
      "Macron said the rebuilding of the ravaged cathedral, plus France's successful hosting of the 2024 Olympics, were \"proof that we can do great things\".",
      "\"We can do the impossible,\" he said. \"The world admires us for that.\"",

    "summary": "The outgoing president is reported to be weighing up ways to protect those the new administration may go after.",
    "story": [
      "Outgoing US President Joe Biden is considering pre-emptive pardons for prominent critics of his successor Donald Trump, multiple people familiar with the discussions have told CBS, the BBC's US partner.",
      "That is in a bid to shield them from potential retribution after Trump - who has vowed to take revenge against those who have opposed him - takes office.",
      "CBS reports that while Biden is said to have debated the possibility of issuing the pardons with senior White House aides, no specific names had been formally recommended to him.",
      "Sources have told AFP that officials are also considering the message it would send to pardon people who have not committed crimes.",
      "That is in the wake of the controversy surrounding Biden's unconditional pardoning of his son Hunter, who was set to face sentencing this month on federal felony gun and tax convictions.",

      "White House defends pardon of Hunter Biden amid backlash",
      "The awkward parallels between the Biden and Trump convictions",
      "US media reports that those who could be in line for the potential pre-emptive pardons from Biden include Dr Anthony Fauci, who has been critical of Trump's Covid response, and California's Senator-elect Adam Schiff, who led the first impeachment effort against Trump.",
      "Other Democrats who, like Schiff, had a role in the Trump impeachment cases, or who investigated the 2021 US Capitol riots, could also be granted them.",
      "In an interview with NPR last month, Schiff said he did not think pre-emptive pardons were a good idea because he believed the courts were capable of withstanding threats from Donald Trump.",
      "\"I think this is frankly so implausible as not to be worthy of much consideration,\" he said of the reports that such pardons were being considered.",
      "\"I would urge the president not to do that. I think it would seem defensive and unnecessary.\"",

      "\"He's thinking through that process very thoroughly.\"",

      "Donald Trump is not the only person to threaten retribution against those perceived to have opposed him in the past. His nominee for FBI director, Kash Patel, has said he would go after politicians and members of the media who he alleges without evidence helped overturn the 2020 US presidential election results.",

    "published": "Sat, 07 Dec 2024 05:02:32 GMT",
    "summary": "Fans of CID, one of India's longest-running TV shows, are thrilled about its much-anticipated comeback.",
    "story": [
      "\"Daya, darwaaza tod do.\" (Daya, break down the door)",
      "Most Indians will instantly recognise this dialogue from the popular detective show CID, which ran from 1998 to 2018, making it one of India's longest-running television shows.",
      "The whodunnit featured three intrepid policemen - ACP Pradyuman, inspector Daya and inspector Abhijeet - solving case after case, as no criminal was ever a match for them. The low-budget episodes had comically simple plots, iffy acting, and all it took for a suspect to confess was a good slap from ACP Pradyuman.",
      "But over the years, the show has achieved cult status, and its characters and dialogues have spawned a wealth of jokes, memes and reels.",
      "CID is set to return later this month, sparking mixed reactions among its fans. Some are eager to see the three policemen back in action but others say that the show's old-world charm might not fit in with the gritty realism of modern-day crime shows.",
      "Over the past few days, the creators of the show have been releasing teasers for upcoming episodes on Instagram, each garnering hundreds of thousands of likes and comments.",
      "Apart from the three main characters, the teasers feature familiar tropes and dialogues. These include Inspector Daya kicking open doors to reveal a suspect's hideout and ACP Pradyuman muttering his iconic line, 'kuch toh gadbad hai, Daya' (something's not right, Daya), signaling to both his team and the audience that a crime has taken place.",
      "Trisha Shah, 35, a content creator from Mumbai and a fan of the show, says that the teasers make her nostalgic.",
      "\"CID was one of the few crime shows on television back then and my parents didn't mind me watching it because of its family-friendly content,\" Ms Shah says.",
      "\"Despite being a crime show, it never showed gruesome violence, sexual crimes, foul language or anything that was not suitable for family viewing.\"",
      "In an interview to Film Companion, an entertainment journalism platform, one of the writers of the show said that they even avoided giving surnames to the characters to avoid hurting anyone's sentiments.",
      "But the show's outlandish plots more than made up for its primness, whether that was ACP Pradyuman coming back from the dead or inspector Daya single-handedly manoeuvring a poison-gas filled plane to safety.",
      "In an interview to Forbes magazine, the producer of the show, BP Singh, described these scenes and plots as \"believable nonsense\".",
      "\"You may later laugh at it [the scene]. But for those five minutes, it is so engrossing that you don't mind it,\" he told the magazine.",
      "In a rather comical fashion, the characters would also explain plots and technologies used to solve crimes through their dialogues, making it easy for even children to grasp what was happening.",
      "\"The bad guys always got caught and that was comforting to watch,\" Ms Shah says. \"I don't think I'll enjoy the show today, but back then, it was a big deal.\"",
      "In the 1990s, TV was a big deal as it was the only form of home entertainment. At the start of the decade, India eased broadcasting rights, making more channels available.",
      "\"Initially, channels like Star began showing reruns of American shows like Baywatch and The Bold and The Beautiful. But new entrants like Zee TV and Sony began producing original shows to cater to the Indian audience,\" says Harsh Taneja, an associate professor of media at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.",
      "Producers often adapted Western shows for Indian audiences by importing format Bibles -  guidelines outlining story structure - and modifying them for local context, he says. So, a show like CID often featured plots that closely resembled those of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, an American crime drama.",
      "The 1990s and 2000s saw television become a staple in households as people's spending power grew. Many homes had not just one but two televisions, leading producers to create content targeting different age groups, says Mr Taneja.",
      "Interestingly, the target audience of CID, when it was released in the 1990s, was children in the age group of six to 14. After CID, several other crime-focussed shows began to populate channels - from Crime Patrol to Savadhan India. But one could say that it was CID that created an appetite for crime shows among viewers.",
      "Priya Ravi, 40, remembers waiting eagerly for each CID episode to air when she was a child. She confesses that it was the show that made her push her parents to get a television set at their home.",
      "\"Episodes used to air twice a week, and initially I used to go to a friend's place to watch them. But then I convinced my parents to get a TV so that I could watch the episodes at home. I was so happy the day the TV arrived,\" Ms Ravi says.",
      "She says that though she won't watch the new CID episodes, she'll definitely encourage her two children, aged seven and nine, to watch them.",
      "\"If the show remains as clean as it was back in the day, I think it's a great way to introduce children to some of the realities of life and make them vigilant about their safety and surroundings,\" she says.",
      "\"I'm looking forward to the heroic trio making a comeback.\"",

      "Ivory Coast's national dish atti\u00e9k\u00e9 has gained UN cultural heritage status, along with Japanese sake, Thai prawn soup and Caribbean cassava bread. But what makes this West African staple so popular? BBC Africa correspondent Mayeni Jones grew up in Ivory Coast and is a self-professed superfan.",
      "One of my earliest childhood memories is hearing vendors sing \"Atti\u00e9k\u00e9 chaud! Atti\u00e9k\u00e9 chaud!\" or \"Hot atti\u00e9k\u00e9!\" as they strolled the streets of my neighbourhood, balancing large baskets of this national delicacy on their heads.",
      "Fast-forward 25 years and women carrying individually wrapped portions of the fermented cassava couscous still walk across Abidjan, Ivory Coast's biggest city, selling this now Unesco-recognised dish.",
      "An alternative to rice, it's hard to find any hospitality venue in the Ivory Coast that doesn't serve atti\u00e9k\u00e9. From the most basic eateries to the fanciest restaurants and even on the beach, it's everywhere.",
      "Atti\u00e9k\u00e9's popularity has spilled over the country's borders, and it is now found across Africa, especially in French-speaking countries.",
      "It's also very popular in neighbouring Ghana and my home country Sierra Leone, where they have some fairly unorthodox serving suggestions.",
      "The distinctive tangy taste of atti\u00e9k\u00e9 comes from the cassava tubers mixed with fermented cassava, which gives it its unique flavour and texture.",
      "The cassava is grated, dried and then steamed before serving.",
      "Filling and versatile, Ivorian chef R\u014dze Traore describes its texture as \"fluffy yet granular, similar to couscous\".",
      "Mr Traore adds that the slight tanginess of atti\u00e9k\u00e9 provides a unique depth to meals, perfectly balancing spicy or savoury sauces.",
      "For Paule-Odile B\u00e9k\u00e9, an Ivorian chef who competed on the UK TV programme Masterchef: The Professionals, \"sour, zingy and sweet\" are the words that come to mind when she describes the taste of atti\u00e9k\u00e9.",
      "Gluten-free and available in different grain sizes, the finest is often the most expensive. Some places even sell red atti\u00e9k\u00e9, which has been soaked in palm oil.",
      "Eaten with a variety of dishes, the most popular version is with chargrilled chicken or fish, a simple, spicy tomato-based sauce and a salsa of chopped tomatoes and onions.",
      "It was one of the first dishes I cooked for my husband when we met 15 years ago. He liked it so much, he suggested we open a restaurant serving just that.",
      "Atti\u00e9k\u00e9 is unpretentious, although traditionally reserved for special occasions like weddings and birthdays, people now eat it every day.",
      "Ms B\u00e9k\u00e9, who comes from a family of atti\u00e9k\u00e9-makers, explained some nuances.",
      "\"Our attieke will be a bit more yellow than some other regions due to the proximity of the sea,\" she said.",
      "A native of Jacqueville, a small coastal town where atti\u00e9k\u00e9 is made, she features it heavily in the menu of her New York supper clubs.",
      "Although I left Ivory Coast at the age of 14 as civil unrest broke out, I have never been able to let go of atti\u00e9k\u00e9.",
      "In London, I'd travel miles to Congolese shops to excavate bags of atti\u00e9k\u00e9 from the permafrost at the bottom of a chest freezer, stockpiling it for dinner guests I could evangelise.",
      "When I moved to Nigeria, I mandated relatives to bring me care packages from Abidjan or Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital.",
      "It was one of the first things I looked for when I moved to Johannesburg in South Africa three months ago.",
      "Where to find it is always one of the first questions I have for any Ivorians I meet outside Ivory Coast.",
      "Obviously it tastes delicious, but it's hard to describe what makes atti\u00e9k\u00e9 so special.",
      "Ivorian chef Charlie Koffi says \"atti\u00e9k\u00e9 is a dish that symbolizes togetherness\".",
      "Like injera, the fermented Ethiopian pancake, or thieboudienne, Senegal's rice-and-fish dish, atti\u00e9k\u00e9 is best enjoyed in a group.",
      "Across Ivory Coast, friends and family will gather around a big plate, eating with their hands and washing it down with a cold beer or soft drink.",
      "For me, it's also a reminder of a childhood which was cut short. I was just 13 years old when on Christmas Eve 1999, as I waited for my friends to come round for a play date, a military coup rocked Ivory Coast.",
      "As soldiers drove through the city shooting in the air and telling people to head indoors, my little sister and I clung to each other in a hallway, the only windowless space in our house.",
      "Our mum was stuck in town, unable to join us.",
      "Six months later, my mum sent us to the UK to live with our grandmother, fearing the rising political tension in the run-up to the 2000 presidential elections would result in further unrest.",
      "Just two years later, the country's first civil war would break out, and it would be another 15 years before I was able to return to my childhood home.",
      "But even when I couldn't return to Babi (Abidjan's nickname), atti\u00e9k\u00e9 was always a way to connect to the place we had left behind.",
      "Even though I'm not Ivorian, like many of the expatriates and economic migrants who moved to the country during the prosperous 1990s, Ivory Coast is home.",
      "We all speak Nouchi, the French slang that peppers Ivorian music and the streets of its cities, and we all eat atti\u00e9k\u00e9.",
      "Ivory Coast has a way of making people feel at home, and atti\u00e9k\u00e9 is part of that.",
      "When I finished university, I returned to Ivory Coast for a year to work for an international NGO.",
      "On our way back from one of our assignments in the west of the country, an Ivorian colleague explained that traditionally, atti\u00e9k\u00e9 was mostly eaten with kedjenou, a rich, smoky stew made with tomatoes, onions, and chillies.",
      "This is slow-cooked with local chicken or game in a clay pot over a wood fire, infusing the dish with a deep, flavourful essence.",
      "He claimed that it was only after the French arrived that Ivorians started serving atti\u00e9k\u00e9 with grilled fish and chicken.",
      "This is not something that I've been able to confirm, but it always rang true.",
      "Ivorians, although fiercely proud of their culture, have always been open to foreign influences in their cuisine and many regional dishes have become local staples.",
      "Now that atti\u00e9k\u00e9 has been added to the list of intangible cultural heritage in need of urgent safeguarding, perhaps more people outside the region will become aware of this delicious treat.",

      "Authorities have also been doing a \"full sweep\" of Central Park - a 2.5 mile (4km) long and 0.5 miles (0.8km) wide area in the heart of the city - and on Friday found a backpack they believe the suspect was carrying at the time of the attack. It has been sent for forensic testing, CBS reports.",
      "Officials are also attempting to make use of DNA evidence, including a water bottle and candy wrapper from the crime scene, as well as a Starbucks coffee cup, that they believe are linked to the suspect.",

      "The words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were discovered on the casings.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 19:57:23 GMT",
    "summary": "A court ruling follows intelligence allegations of Russian interference promoting a far-right candidate.",
    "story": [
      "Forty-eight hours before Romanians were due to vote in a presidential election run-off, the whole process was scrapped because of an unprecedented ruling by the constitutional court.",
      "The court's decision to annul the first round came after a far-right independent candidate, Calin Georgescu, came out of almost nowhere to lead the first round two weeks ago amid allegations of Russian interference.",
      "Georgescu has condemned the ruling as a coup and Romania may have to wait months to vote again.",
      "Why this decision matters",
      "Romania is a key Nato member on its eastern flank and shares a long border with Ukraine.",
      "It is not the first Eastern European state to fend off Russia's hybrid war, and the constitutional court has ruled that intelligence revelations of Russian meddling are sufficiently serious to put the presidential vote on hold.",
      "Moldova's recent presidential vote was held amid alleged Russian interference and voter fraud, and across the Black Sea in Georgia, the pro-Western opposition says contested elections there were hit by Kremlin meddling.",
      "Why has the vote been annulled?",
      "Opinion polls were almost neck and neck going into Sunday's race. Almost 19 million Romanians were eligible to choose between Calin Georgescu and liberal mayor and former TV journalist Elena Lasconi.",
      "Latest polls even gave Lasconi the edge in the run-off.",
      "But then on Wednesday Romania's outgoing President Klaus Iohannis declassified intelligence documents from the supreme council for national defence suggesting that almost 800 Tiktok accounts created by a \"foreign state\" in 2016 were suddenly activated last month to full capacity, backing Georgescu.",
      "Another 25,000 TikTok accounts had become active only two weeks before the first round.",
      "Romanian foreign intelligence said Russia was the \"enemy state\" involved and had engaged in hybrid attacks including tens of thousands of cyber attacks and other sabotage.",
      "Domestic intelligence put Georgescu's sudden surge in popularity down to a \"highly organised\" and \"guerilla\" social media campaign\" that involved identical messaging and social media influencers.",
      "TikToks promoting him were not marked as election content, violating Romania's laws, it said, while one account paid out $381,000 (\u00a3300,000) in the space of a month to users who pushed Georgescu's candidacy, while he said he had not paid anything for his campaign.",
      "That decision to declassify intelligence documents changed everything.",
      "Judges from the constitutional court met on Friday to consider a large number of requests to annul the first round.",
      "It was a complete about-turn from a decision four days before that approved the initial 24 November vote after a complete recount of 9.4 million votes.",
      "What does the ruling say?",
      "In its single-page judgement, the constitutional court says that in order to ensure the fairness and legality of the electoral process it has unanimously decided to annul the entire vote and the government must establish a new date for a re-run.",
      "The court says cites its role under the constitution \"to guard the observance of the procedure\" of presidential elections.",
      "It stresses the decision is final and binding.",
      "The president in Romania wields considerable power as commander-in-chief of the armed forces and with the task of appointing the prime minister.",
      "Who is Calin Georgescu?",
      "Calin Georgescu, who calls himself a university teacher, was a relative unknown in the presidential race.",
      "He denies he is a fan of Vladimir Putin, although he sees the Russian leader as a \"patriot and a leader\" and wants to put an end to political and military aid to Ukraine.",
      "\"Zero. Everything stops,\" he told the BBC's Sarah Rainsford. \"I have to take care just about my people. We have a lot of problems ourselves,\" in words that reflect his Romania-first stance.",
      "He says while Romania should remain in international organisations such as the EU and Nato, it must end its \"subservient\" role.",
      "He also condemns allegations that Russia was behind his electoral success as intelligence \"lies\".",
      "A 62-year-old agricultural engineer by profession, he held high-ranking civil service jobs years ago at Romania's environment and foreign ministries.",
      "He is also a conspiracy theorist who believes Man never landed on the Moon and the Covid-19 pandemic never happened, despite the seven million deaths worldwide, reported by the World Health Organization.",

      "Romanian court annuls result of presidential election first round",
      "Alleged Russian election-meddling in Romania resurrects dark memories",
      "What do Romanians think?",
      "Romanians are split over the constitutional court decision.",
      "\"Today the Romanian state trampled democracy underfoot,\" liberal candidate Elena Lasconi complained.",
      "Crin Antonescu, former leader of the National Liberal party however welcomed the court ruling and said he could not understand Lasconi's reaction. \"This is exactly right, to start [the whole race] again from scratch,\" he told Romanian media.",
      "There has been anger from supporters of Calin Georgescu.",
      "\"We are witnessing a lying political class scared of losing power and capable of any injustice to keep their power and positions,\" Eugen, an entrepreneur in the western city of Timisoara told the BBC.",
      "Romanians who have been unenthusiastic about both candidates are unsure whether to be glad they do not have to decide on Sunday, or concerned for the future of Romanian democracy.",
      "What happens now?",
      "The election starts all over again in three or four months' time, to give candidates a chance to gather endorsements to run.",
      "In the meantime, incumbent President Klaus Iohannis has said he will remain in post until the next president is elected.",
      "There is no reason why Georgescu cannot run again, although he may face criminal proceedings as a result of the allegations made against him which he denies.",
      "Romania has only just held parliamentary elections in which the centrist parties did better than expected. The Social Democrats are likely to lead the next coalition government.",
      "However, three far-right parties between them polled 32% of the vote, and one of them, George Simion's AUR, came second.",
      "Another factor of uncertainty is how Georgescu supporters will react to the annulment.",
      "Will they take to the streets, or look to support Calin Georgescu or another nationalist candidate when Romania eventually returns to the ballot box?"

      "Mr. Biden returned to the White House early Thursday after spending the beginning of the week in Angola. Before he left, he ignited a firestorm when he issued a sweeping pardon for his son, Hunter, who had been convicted on federal drug and gun charges, and pleaded guilty to tax charges. When asked about the pardon earlier this week, the first lady, who attended every day of Hunter Biden's Delaware trial, said \"of course I support the pardon of my son.\"",
      "This year's Christmas tree is a 35-foot Red Spruce from the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests in Virginia. A collection of 58 smaller trees are adorned with student-designed ornaments from every state and territory.",

      "2024 White House holiday decorations",
      "The tree lighting is the last part of the White House holiday transformation, with this year's theme being \"A Season of Peace and Light.\"",
      "First lady Jill Biden unveiled the holiday decor in the East Room on Monday, speaking to volunteers who made the winter wonderland come to life.",
      "\"As we celebrate our final holiday season here in the White House, we are guided by the values that we hold sacred: faith, family, and service to our country, kindness toward all of our neighbors, and the power of community,\" she said.",
      "It takes over 300 volunteers from across the country along with about 9,810 feet of ribbon, 28,125 ornaments and 2,200 paper doves to deck the halls of the White House.",
      "The White House expects to welcome over 100,000 visitors during the holiday season. The first lady on Tuesday welcomed families of National Guard members to be the first to view the decorations. Upon arrival, visitors will see a Christmas tree dedicated to Gold Star families with six stacked stars representing all six branches of the military. Down the East Colonnade guests will be surrounded by bells \"symbolizing the peaceful sounds of the holiday season.\" In the East Room, a reflective canopy twinkles next to the chandeliers like snowfall as two large Christmas trees guard the main door.",

      "The holiday volunteers are teachers, military families, nurses, and small business owners from across the country who all apply before being selected for decor duty. Bright and early the day after Thanksgiving, the volunteers arrived at the White House to begin full days of glitter and garland before the first lady unveiled all their work. The Office of the First Lady sent out special invitations to State Teachers of the Year winners like de Uribe to join the holiday volunteer tradition. Some volunteers formed text chains and Facebook groups, intending to keep in touch long after the ornaments are taken down.",
      "Centerpiece of the holiday decor",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 17:05:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Even those enrolled in Medicare have a harder time paying for treatment compared with older adults in other countries.",
    "story": [
      "In the U.S., having health insurance is necessary, but not sufficient to ensure access to affordable medical care.",
      "While the U.S. lacks a universal health care system like those that exist in most other wealthy nations, most Americans over 65 are insured through Medicare. Yet many still struggle to afford care, with high out-of-pocket costs putting necessary medications and doctor visits out of reach, according to\u00a0research from The Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit that works to promote an equitable health care system.",
      "These extra costs, for which Medicare beneficiaries are on the hook, make it harder for older Americans to access affordable care relative to their peers in nine other countries, the group found. Researchers compared coverage for older adults in the U.S. to health care systems in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.",
      "Nearly one in four older adults in the U.S. spent at least $2,000 in out-of-pocket expenses last year, compared to less than 5% of older adults in France and the Netherlands who spent that much, The Commonwealth Fund found. Only in Switzerland did older adults report spending more on health care than those in the U.S.",
      "\"The reason to focus on this population is because in the U.S. nearly every adult over 65 has Medicare,\" Munira Z. Gunja, senior researcher for international health policy and practice innovations at The Commonwealth Fund told CBS MoneyWatch. While the U.S. stands out as \"the only high-income country without a universal health system,\" when it comes to the over-65 population, \"at least, we are on par with other countries,\" she said.",
      "Does Medicare fall short?",
      "But the study suggests that the kind of coverage Medicare plans provide isn't meeting many Americans' needs. Eight percent of older adults in the U.S., more than any other wealthy country except Austria, reported delaying or forgoing medical care because of costs. And there are repercussions to not getting the care one needs: One-third of older U.S. adults who said they faced cost-related barriers to accessing care reported being either in fair or poor health.",
      "\"We find that while nearly every older adult has Medicare coverage, it is still more expensive than what older adults in other nations face, and because of that, older adults in the U.S. are more likely to skip care,\" Gunja said. \"When they need prescription drugs, they are more likely to skip getting those too.\"",
      "Oftentimes, for example, Medicare Advantage members find themselves seeing out-of-network doctors, which exposes them to \"a ton of health care costs,\" according to Gunja.",
      "One exception",
      "There's one area in which Medicare beneficiaries faced few out-of-pocket costs and, as a result, were less likely to skip care \u2014 mental health treatment. Less than 5% of residents in all nations skipped mental health care over affordability concerns. The stat illustrates that when treatment is affordable, patients are more inclined to seek out the care they need, according to Gunja.",
      "\"It's a benefit that's offered on all health plans, and we see what happens when people don't need to spend as much on a service,\" she said.",
      "Solutions?",
      "When older people skip or delay care, their health can worsen, leading to sicker patients, who tend to require more costly care. That in turn drives up federal Medicare spending, according to The Commonwealth Fund.",
      "Gunja suggests that the U.S. can look to other countries for solutions that make health care more affordable for older adults. Some examples include capping out-of-pocket expenses and fully covering hospital and physician services.",
      "\"Across the board, the U.S. generally comes out last for most measures when it comes to affordability measures,\" Gunja said. \"Getting health insurance is absolutely necessary. But it's only the first step. We need to make sure coverage is not just comprehensive, but also affordable.\"",

      "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield said Thursday that the health insurance provider is reversing a policy that was set to go into effect in February that would have limited anesthesia coverage during surgeries and other procedures, a change that had prompted an outcry from some physicians and lawmakers.",
      "The policy, which would have covered Anthem's plans in Connecticut, New York and Missouri, was disclosed in recent weeks, with the company's New York unit posting a\u00a0notice on Dec. 1. The policy would have excluded people under 22 years old and maternity care.",
      "According to the original policy statement, Anthem had said it would pay only for anesthesia treatments for the length of time that a procedure or surgery is estimated to require based on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's physician work time values. The insurer noted that claims for anesthesia \"above the established number of minutes will be denied.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News on Thursday, Anthem said it was backing away from the policy, and added there had been \"widespread misinformation about an update to our anesthesia policy.\"",
      "\"As a result, we have decided to not proceed with this policy change,\" an Anthem spokesperson wrote in an email. \"To be clear, it never was and never will be the policy of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to not pay for medically necessary anesthesia services. The proposed update to the policy was only designed to clarify the appropriateness of anesthesia consistent with well-established clinical guidelines.\"",
      "Before the announcement of Anthem's reversal, the plan had drawn criticism from medical professionals as well as Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, who wrote on social media on Wednesday that the plan is \"appalling.\"",
      "\"Saddling patients with thousands of dollars in surprise additional medical debt.   And for what? Just to boost corporate profits?\" Murphy wrote. \"Reverse this decision immediately.\"",
      "Connecticut Comptroller Sean Scanlon told the Hartford Courant Thursday that the policy would not take place in his state after negotiating with the insurer.",
      "\"After hearing from people across the state about this concerning policy, my office reached out to Anthem, and I'm pleased to share this policy will no longer be going into effect here in Connecticut,\" Scanlon told the newspaper.",
      "\"Appalling behavior by commercial health insurers\"",
      "In a statement last month, the American Society of Anesthesiologists also called on Anthem to reverse the policy.",
      "\"With this new policy, Anthem will arbitrarily pre-determine the time allowed for anesthesia care during a surgery or procedure,\" the group said. \"If an anesthesiologist submits a bill where the actual time of care is longer than Anthem's limit, Anthem will deny payment for the anesthesiologist's care.\"",
      "The insurer's new policy could result in denials of coverage to patients who might need more anesthesia because their surgery is difficult or unusual, or if a complication occurs, the group added.",
      "\"This is just the latest in a long line of appalling behavior by commercial health insurers looking to drive their profits up at the expense of patients and physicians providing essential care,\" said Donald E. Arnold, an anesthesiologist and president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. \"This egregious policy breaks the trust between Anthem and its policyholders who expect their health insurer to pay physicians for the entirety of the care they need.\"",

      "\"Given the current state of judicial affairs, First Amendment rights, the fact that corporations have the same rights as individuals, every little thing we do, unless specifically in detail instructed by Congress, it's not just that we lose in court, but we lose years,\" Califf said.",
      "One long-awaited change that could see movement soon is a ban on the food dye\u00a0Red No. 3, which advocacy groups have petitioned for. California moved last year to be the first state to ban the food dye on its own over health concerns.",
      "\"We are hopeful that, within the next few weeks, we will be acting on that petition and a decision should be forthcoming,\" said Jones.",
      "In a clash with Califf, Sanders urged Califf to call out the \"food and beverage industry, whose greed is destroying the health of millions of people\" for their role in slowing the progress of the agency's food policies.",
      "Califf told the committee that the agency was facing \"direct opposition from powerful industry forces\" on issues like food chemical safety, but also refused to \"castigate the people that work in the food and beverage industry.\"",
      "\"We have an industry that if you tried to change it overnight, there are farmers all over the United States who would not be able to grow the crops they're currently growing. So there needs to be a plan and it needs to be implemented in a mature thoughtful way across the country,\" said Califf.",

    "summary": "At least 364 pertussis cases were reported, marking the worst Thanksgiving week on record.",
    "story": [
      "At least 364 pertussis infections were reported to health authorities last week, according to figures published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, marking the worst Thanksgiving week for whooping cough in recent decades.",
      "This tops the previous Thanksgiving record of 228 cases of pertussis which were reported for the week ending Nov. 27, 2010. That year there were 27,550 cases reported by the end of 2010, below the 28,167 already tallied so far this year.",
      "Thanksgiving usually sees a slowdown in cases reported across most diseases, because of delays in testing and reporting around the holiday as well as changes in people going to the doctor.",
      "But this year's whooping cough wave is continuing to accelerate in several states this week, including in Ohio, which reported 84 cases. That is the most of any state, and more than the 67 pertussis cases that Ohio reported in the week before.",
      "\"Pertussis can be cyclical. After seeing lower numbers of reported cases in the past few years \u2014 during and after the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 nationally, pertussis is now returning to pre-pandemic trends. Ohio is no different,\" a spokesperson for Ohio's health department said in a statement.",
      "The Ohio spokesperson said this year's increase remained \"consistent with some years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,\" and has yet to top the total number of cases reported in 2013.",
      "While total cases nationwide remain lower than some previous records, the pace of weekly reported cases reached 577 ahead of Thanksgiving \u2014 more than 10 times the same time last year, and the worst in at least a decade.",
      "Health officials have cited a variety of factors for this year's wave of whooping cough cases, including gaps in immunity from vaccination or prior infection and the switch to safer but less effective vaccines in the 1990s.",
      "\"We have to acknowledge that our vaccination rates, in Montgomery County for school-age children, are low. They've decreased since the pandemic, and they're lower than the state of Ohio, and lower than the United States as well,\" said Dr. Becky Thomas, medical director of the health department for Ohio's Montgomery County.",
      "Within Ohio, Montgomery County makes up the largest share of cases reported in recent months, despite not having the most people in the state.",
      "Around 63% of their cases have been in schoolchildren and 12% are in daycares, Thomas said. The department often finds out about outbreaks first from school nurses, warning of large numbers of kids calling out sick with whooping cough.",
      "Thomas said doctors have been seeing high pertussis case counts for months, larger than the wave they saw last year.",
      "\"We had an increase in cases last fall, but nothing compared to this fall. And when we first started noticing a really significant increase was about the time that kids went back to school, so about the middle of August,\" said Thomas.",
      "Thomas said that the vast majority of reported cases in the county have said they were vaccinated for pertussis, though it is unclear if everyone was up-to-date on the shots. A third of cases have been in teens, who are recommended to have gotten a booster dose by age 12.",
      "\"We have specific data on vaccination records for entering seventh graders that shows those vaccination rates for that tetanus, whooping cough vaccine that they should have entering school are decreased,\" said Thomas.",
      "This year's whooping cough surge also comes as health departments are bracing for the return of an expected wave of COVID-19 and flu infections this winter.",
      "\"Whooping cough isn't the only respiratory illness that we're concerned about. So we're encouraging people to stay home when they're sick, practice good hand hygiene, get their health care provider if they need to if they're symptoms are worsening or severe, and of course get vaccinated,\" said Jennifer Wentzel, the county health department's commissioner.",

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 16:29:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Levels of both the flu and COVID viruses are still low across much of the country, the CDC says.",
    "story": [
      "This year's winter surge of influenza and COVID-19 has yet to arrive for most of the country, data published this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows, with trends so far a fraction of what they were at this time last year.",
      "\"COVID-19 activity remains low and is stable in most areas. Seasonal influenza activity is increasing slightly among children but remains low nationally,\" the CDC said this week, in its weekly report on data about the two viruses.",
      "The agency's updates are usually published every week by Friday, but were delayed until after the weekend because of the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "A return to normal for flu?",
      "By this time last year, data tracking outpatient visits to places like emergency rooms and doctor's offices for the flu had already climbed above the agency's baseline for the season. This year's latest report suggests flu cases are only now starting to cross that threshold.",
      "\"We're maybe slightly later than last year, and maybe quite a bit later than the year before, but those years were unusually early,\" said University of North Carolina epidemiology professor Justin Lessler, a top expert in the CDC-backed network of disease forecasters.",
      "Lessler said this year's figures look \"much closer to about where you'd expect a normal flu season to be\" before the COVID-19 pandemic, when measures to curb the outbreak scrambled seasonal patterns of flu and other respiratory germs.",
      "Compared with last year, rates of weekly flu hospitalizations are around five times lower. Emergency room visits with flu from school-age kids have accelerated, the CDC's data shows, but remain less than a third of what they were at this time last year.",
      "One big factor that could be affecting the figures this year is immunity in the population from the last two waves of influenza, alongside vaccination.",
      "\"We have had two fairly substantial seasons, which could be driving this delay. Of course the question is, does that mean we're having a delay, or a milder season. That's really kind of uncertain at this point,\" said epidemiologist Shaun Truelove, associate scientist at Johns Hopkins University's public health school.",
      "Modeling of this year's flu season gathered from different experts make different assumptions about what the country's flu immunity looks like, as they try to play out different scenarios of how this year's flu season might look like.",
      "Truelove, who also helps lead the CDC-funded disease forecasting network, also thinks that this year could mark a \"return to normal\" for flu.",
      "\"That being said, flu is never consistent. We get early seasons and late seasons. So it's hard to say exactly what that means, and everything's a bit weird post-pandemic, in terms of scale and timing,\" said Truelove.",
      "Watching for another COVID-19 wave",
      "Several COVID-19 trends that the CDC tracks also remain below what was recorded at this time in 2023. This is a contrast with previous summer waves of the virus, which have only dipped slightly into the fall before picking up again during the winter.",
      "COVID-19 emergency room visits are \"low\" or \"minimal\" in nearly all states, after this year's late summer wave of the virus. Levels of the virus in wastewater are \"minimal\" in all regions, compared to \"high\" levels around this time last year.",
      "\"Does that mean that there was enough immunity built up in that summer wave that we're going to not see a winter wave? Does it mean the winter wave is going to come, but be a little bit later and maybe a little smaller,\" said Lessler.",
      "Both Truelove and Lessler said one major \"data gap\" making comparisons to previous seasons challenging has been the lapse in nationwide COVID-19 hospitalization data during the summer surge.",
      "A pandemic-era emergency requirement for health care providers to report COVID-19 hospitalizations lapsed earlier this year, and only recently resumed under a new rule issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Other factors muddying the figures include changes to how people test and seek care for COVID-19 infections.",
      "Another big unknown is the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Most circulating variants right now are a medley of closely related variants like XEC and KP.3.1.1.",
      "\"We don't know, like we do for flu, what the average pace of COVID's evolution away from our immune system will be, when it settles down,\" Lessler said.",
      "Early data released last month by researchers at The Ohio State University found XEC looked to be more infectious compared with the parent variant it shares upstream with KP.3.1.1, but not significantly more than its siblings.",
      "\"I actually have thought it had settled down a bit, after this year. We'll see what I think after the season's done. But right now, I'm a little less sure,\" he said.",
      "Other respiratory germs on the rise",
      "While COVID-19 and flu remain at unusually low levels nationwide, rates of at least other germs that spread through coughs and sneezes remain elevated.",
      "CDC's data on emergency room visits from the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae, sometimes called \"walking pneumonia,\" have increased in recent weeks especially in babies.",
      "Cases in this year's wave of pertussis, or whooping cough, are also continuing to accelerate in several states around the country.",
      "The agency tallied 577 infections of pertussis nationwide for the week ending Nov. 23, around 33% higher than last week's count. That's higher than the peak of 2014's record pertussis wave, which reached 326 weekly infections reported in late December.",
      "Ohio remains the state with the most cases of whooping cough this past week, after 66 infections with pertussis were reported.",
      "The CDC's \"acute respiratory illness\" metric, which lumps together levels of patients showing up in emergency rooms with a broad array of cough and cold illnesses including influenza and whooping cough, tallies 14 states with \"moderate\" levels including Ohio.",

    "summary": "An appeals court judge wrote that the law that would force a sale or ban of TikTok \"survive[s] constitutional scrutiny.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court upheld a law that will ban TikTok in the U.S. in the coming months if its Chinese parent company doesn't sell its stake in the app, dealing another setback to the widely popular video-sharing service in its battle with the federal government.",
      "A panel of three judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously sided with the Justice Department in declining to review the petition for relief from TikTok and ByteDance, its Chinese parent company, saying the law is constitutional.",
      "\"We conclude the portions of the Act the petitioners have standing to challenge, that is the provisions concerning TikTok and its related entities, survive constitutional scrutiny,\" Senior Judge Douglas Ginsburg wrote in the majority opinion. \"We therefore deny the petitions.\"",
      "Congress approved\u00a0a foreign assistance package in April that included provisions giving TikTok nine months to sever ties with ByteDance or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. President Biden quickly signed the bill into law, and it is set to take effect on Jan. 19, with the possibility of a one-time 90-day delay granted by the president if a sale is in progress by then.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump tried to ban TikTok during his first term in office, but reversed his position during the presidential campaign and vowed to \"save\" the app. He takes office on Jan. 20.",
      "Lawmakers and national security officials have long had suspicions about TikTok's ties to China. Officials from both parties have warned that the Chinese government could use TikTok to spy on and collect data from its roughly 170 million American users or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content. The concern is warranted, they have argued, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering.",
      "The appeals court's decision tees up a fight at the Supreme Court over the law's ultimate fate. The parties asked the judges to make a decision by Friday so there is enough time for the high court to review the case before the law takes effect. The justices could agree to hear the case and pause the law while they consider the legal arguments, or let the appeals court's ruling stand as the final word.",
      "TikTok expects the law will be overturned by the Supreme Court, according to spokesperson Michael Hughes, who argued the law is based on \"inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information.\"",
      "\"The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" Hughes said in a statement.",
      "The Justice Department, meanwhile, applauded the decision.",
      "\"Today's decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to collect sensitive information about millions of Americans, to covertly manipulate the content delivered to American audiences, and to undermine our national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. \"As the D.C. Circuit recognized, this act protects the national security of the United States in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution. The Justice Department is committed to defending Americans' sensitive data from authoritarian regimes that seek to exploit companies under their control.\"",
      "The court's decision",
      "\"The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\" Ginsburg wrote in his opinion. \"Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\"",
      "The appeals court said that it recognized the decision will have \"significant implications\" for TikTok and its users.",
      "\"Consequently, TikTok's millions of users will need to find alternative media of communication,\" Ginsburg said. \"That burden is attributable to the [People's Republic of China's] hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security, not to the U.S. Government, which engaged with TikTok through a multi-year process in an effort to find an alternative solution.\"",
      "The D.C. Circuit found that the government's national-security justifications for banning TikTok \u2014 to counter China's efforts to collect Americans' data and limit its ability to manipulate content covertly on the platform \u2014 are \"wholly consistent\" with the First Amendment.",
      "\"The multi-year efforts of both political branches to investigate the national security risks posed by the TikTok platform, and to consider potential remedies proposed by TikTok, weigh heavily in favor of the Act,\" Ginsburg wrote. \"The government has offered persuasive evidence demonstrating that the act is narrowly tailored to protect national security.\"",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House China committee, praised the decision, calling it \"a loss for the Chinese Community Party,\" while also expressing optimism about the app's future in the U.S.",
      "\"I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,\" Moolenaar said in a statement.",
      "The House China committee spearheaded the bipartisan effort to pass the law.",
      "The legal arguments",
      "TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge in May that called the legislation \"an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power\" based on \"speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation\" that would suppress the speech of millions of Americans.",
      "\"In reality, there is no choice,\" the petition said, adding that a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\"",
      "The Chinese government vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance said \"such a fundamental rearchitecting is not remotely feasible\" under the restrictions within the legislation.",
      "\"The platform consists of millions of lines of software code that have been painstakingly developed by thousands of engineers over multiple years,\" the petition said.",
      "During oral arguments in September, the appeals panel appeared skeptical of TikTok's argument that free expression outweighs national security concerns, but the three judges were also critical of the government's stance.",
      "TikTok's lawyer Andrew Pincus said the law \"is unprecedented and its effect would be staggering.\"",
      "\"This law imposes extraordinary speech prohibition based on indeterminate future risks,\" Pincus said. \"Notwithstanding the obvious less restrictive alternatives, the government has not come anywhere near satisfying strict scrutiny.\"",
      "Judge Sri Srinivasan said, under TikTok's rationale, the U.S. would not be able to ban a foreign country from owning a major media company in the U.S. if the two are at war.",
      "\"Is your submission that Congress can't bar the enemy's ownership of a major media source in the U.S.?\" Srinivasan, an Obama appointee, asked Pincus.",
      "When Pincus noted that news outlets like Politico and Business Insider are owned by foreign entities, Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, quickly chimed in: \"But not foreign adversaries.\"",
      "Rao also pushed back on Pincus' argument that Congress did not include any evidence of its claims that TikTok poses a national security risk in the legislation.",
      "\"I know Congress doesn't legislate all the time, but here they did,\" she said. \"They actually passed a law and many of your arguments want us to treat them as an agency. It's strange. It's a very strange framework for thinking about our first branch of government.\"",
      "Attorney Jeffrey Fisher, who represents TikTok creators, compared the restrictions on TikTok to the U.S. government hypothetically banning bookstores from selling books written by foreign authors in conjunction with a foreign government.",
      "\"We're not talking about banning Tocqueville in the United States,\" Rao countered. \"We're talking about a determination by the political branches that there's a foreign adversary that is potentially exercising covert influence in the United States. Very different.\"",
      "Ginsburg, a Reagan appointee, expressed skepticism over the notion that the law singles out TikTok.",
      "\"It describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity,\" he said, noting that the company and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns. \"That's the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "Justice Department lawyer Daniel Tenny said the data on Americans that could be collected through the app \"would be quite valuable to a foreign adversary if it were trying to approach an American to try to have them be an intelligence asset.\" Tenny also spoke about the risk of content manipulation by China.",
      "\"What is being targeted is a foreign company that controls this recommendation engine and many aspects of the algorithm that's used to determine what content is shown to Americans on the app,\" Tenny said.",
      "But Srinivasan said it's Americans' choice to use the app, despite what content may appear.",
      "\"The fact that that's being denied subjects this to serious First Amendment scrutiny,\" he said.",
      "He later added, \"What gives arguable force to the other side's First Amendment argument is that it's not just that the government is targeting curation that occurs abroad. It's the reason the curation occurring abroad is being targeted, and the reason is a concern about the content consequences of that curation in the U.S.\"",

    "story": [
      "The fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson is surfacing the public's deep frustration with the health insurance industry.",
      "On \"CBS Mornings\" Friday, Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News said the main issue is that health care costs are too high.",
      "\"What we see in this country is that the number one cause of bankruptcy is health-care-related expenses,\" she said.",
      "After groceries, transportation and rent, health care costs are the No. 1 cost of concern to families in this country, according to KFF polling.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Gounder said.",
      "Can the insurance industry do something about high costs?",
      "There are things that can be done, Gounder said.",
      "Under President Barack Obama, for example, there was the Affordable Care Act, which helped to expand health insurance.",
      "\"You had Medicaid, you had the marketplace, then you also have subsidies to make it more affordable to purchase plans on the marketplace,\" Gounder said. \"Those were made even more generous during the pandemic, and then those more generous subsidies were extended under the Inflation Reduction Act under President Biden.\"",
      "But, there is still the challenge of why health care costs are rising.",
      "\"You have efforts to extend coverage and make more people have health care be available, but prices are going up,\" Gounder said.",
      "What could change in U.S. health care look like?",
      "In the U.S., people are faced with both rising health care costs and insurance premiums.",
      "According to a\u00a0KFF poll\u00a0from earlier this year, a quarter of U.S. adults say they've skipped or postponed getting the care they need simply because of the cost.",
      "Compared with other developed countries, the U.S has a different, \"very piecemeal\" approach, Gounder said.",
      "\"Many other countries have what we call socialized medicine,\" Gounder said. \"By the way, Medicare is socialized medicine, and even that socialized medicine is the most expensive in terms of health care for the elderly in the world.\"",
      "Many different proposals have been made to improve the situation, she said, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to negotiate down the price of drugs.",
      "\"We've already seen one round of price negotiations. The incoming administration wants to eliminate the Inflation Reduction Act, at least many of the provisions of that. So whether that will continue, we don't know,\" she said.",
      "There have also been mergers and acquisitions in the health care industry, which means less competition.",
      "\"Biden administration has really been trying to pursue antitrust suits to block some of these,\" Gounder said. \"The Trump administration, the prior administration, tried to make health care pricing more transparent. That was another way of trying to make things better. It's not enough. These are all sort of chipping away at a bigger problem.\"",
      "What you can do if a claim is denied",
      "In posts to social media, doctors are sharing their experiences with more and more claims being denied \u2014 something Gounder is seeing too.",
      "\"What we're also seeing now is increasing use of AI by the insurance companies to deny claims, and then you have competing AIs being developed by health care systems to fight the health insurance AIs,\" she said. \"Me as a doctor, I have to spend a lot of time on the phone with various different companies to try to explain why my patient is in the hospital.\"",
      "If you are finding your claims to be denied, Gounder suggests following a few steps:",
      "Collect all of the paperwork you can to make your case",
      "Review very carefully the statements that are sent to you and what the issues are",
      "See what your doctor can do to start in terms of filing an appeal",
      "Consider state insurance commissions that regulate insurance that you can also appeal to. Go to naic.com and look up your state.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 17:05:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Even those enrolled in Medicare have a harder time paying for treatment compared with older adults in other countries.",
    "story": [
      "In the U.S., having health insurance is necessary, but not sufficient to ensure access to affordable medical care.",
      "While the U.S. lacks a universal health care system like those that exist in most other wealthy nations, most Americans over 65 are insured through Medicare. Yet many still struggle to afford care, with high out-of-pocket costs putting necessary medications and doctor visits out of reach, according to\u00a0research from The Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit that works to promote an equitable health care system.",
      "These extra costs, for which Medicare beneficiaries are on the hook, make it harder for older Americans to access affordable care relative to their peers in nine other countries, the group found. Researchers compared coverage for older adults in the U.S. to health care systems in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.",
      "Nearly one in four older adults in the U.S. spent at least $2,000 in out-of-pocket expenses last year, compared to less than 5% of older adults in France and the Netherlands who spent that much, The Commonwealth Fund found. Only in Switzerland did older adults report spending more on health care than those in the U.S.",
      "\"The reason to focus on this population is because in the U.S. nearly every adult over 65 has Medicare,\" Munira Z. Gunja, senior researcher for international health policy and practice innovations at The Commonwealth Fund told CBS MoneyWatch. While the U.S. stands out as \"the only high-income country without a universal health system,\" when it comes to the over-65 population, \"at least, we are on par with other countries,\" she said.",
      "Does Medicare fall short?",
      "But the study suggests that the kind of coverage Medicare plans provide isn't meeting many Americans' needs. Eight percent of older adults in the U.S., more than any other wealthy country except Austria, reported delaying or forgoing medical care because of costs. And there are repercussions to not getting the care one needs: One-third of older U.S. adults who said they faced cost-related barriers to accessing care reported being either in fair or poor health.",
      "\"We find that while nearly every older adult has Medicare coverage, it is still more expensive than what older adults in other nations face, and because of that, older adults in the U.S. are more likely to skip care,\" Gunja said. \"When they need prescription drugs, they are more likely to skip getting those too.\"",
      "Oftentimes, for example, Medicare Advantage members find themselves seeing out-of-network doctors, which exposes them to \"a ton of health care costs,\" according to Gunja.",
      "One exception",
      "There's one area in which Medicare beneficiaries faced few out-of-pocket costs and, as a result, were less likely to skip care \u2014 mental health treatment. Less than 5% of residents in all nations skipped mental health care over affordability concerns. The stat illustrates that when treatment is affordable, patients are more inclined to seek out the care they need, according to Gunja.",
      "\"It's a benefit that's offered on all health plans, and we see what happens when people don't need to spend as much on a service,\" she said.",
      "Solutions?",
      "When older people skip or delay care, their health can worsen, leading to sicker patients, who tend to require more costly care. That in turn drives up federal Medicare spending, according to The Commonwealth Fund.",
      "Gunja suggests that the U.S. can look to other countries for solutions that make health care more affordable for older adults. Some examples include capping out-of-pocket expenses and fully covering hospital and physician services.",
      "\"Across the board, the U.S. generally comes out last for most measures when it comes to affordability measures,\" Gunja said. \"Getting health insurance is absolutely necessary. But it's only the first step. We need to make sure coverage is not just comprehensive, but also affordable.\"",

      "In the wake of\u00a0UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson's killing in New York City Wednesday morning, some companies are taking additional precautionary measures to protect their executives while corporate security firms are reporting an uptick in interest in their services.",
      "The shooting of Thompson, who did not appear to have a security detail with him when he was attacked outside a Manhattan hotel, is shining a light on the business of protecting prominent corporate executives, whose security costs can reach millions of dollars per year.",
      "It's common for the top brass at public companies to be protected by guards around the clock, according to security experts. Social media's amplification of everyday individuals' dissatisfaction with a particular person, product or service has only heightened the need for protection, they say. That's particularly true in an industry like health care insurance, when many Americans say they are dissatisfied with the services they receive.",
      "Indeed, in the wake of Thompson's killing, many on social media expressed vitriol for some health insurers' practices.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told CBS Mornings about the public voicing its frustrations.",
      "To be sure, some of the biggest U.S. companies, particularly those in the tech sector, were spending heavily on personal and residential security for their top executives prior to Thompson's killing. Meta, whose businesses include Facebook and Instagram, reported the highest spending on personal security for top executives last year, at more than $24 million, filings culled by research firm Equilar show.",
      "While Thompson had an in-house security detail during his New York City visit, it wasn't with him at the time of the shooting, according to CNN, which cited a source familiar with UnitedHealthcare's security.",
      "In the wake of the attack, corporate security experts said companies should take time to evaluate their corporate security protocols and beef up protective measures, if necessary, to protect against a variety of threats.",

      "Too much information",
      "In the wake of Thompson's death, some companies are taking steps to limit publicly available information about their executives. For example, a page on UnitedHealthcare's website about the company's leadership \u2014 where Thompson and other executives' bios were listed \u2014\u00a0no longer exists, and instead redirects to the company's home page.",
      "Medica, a Minnesota-based nonprofit health care firm, as well as other insurers have taken similar actions, their websites show.",
      "Medica told the Associated Press Friday that it is temporarily closing its six offices for security reasons, in addition to removing executives bios' from its website.",
      "\"Although we have received no specific threats related to our campuses, our office buildings will be temporarily closed out of an abundance of caution,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Experts say these types of moves are wise.",
      "\"I think we share too much. I don't need to know where you live and that you're married and have three wonderful kids,\" Sarnese said. \"We don't need to advertise to the public where the president and CEO are sitting.\"",
      "While executives across all industries should be evaluating their security postures, healthcare industry professionals have received more threats in recent years as a result of divisiveness that arose around safety protocols, including mask mandates, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sarnese said.",
      "\"Every industry has challenges because there is always going to be somebody who is upset with a service or product or philosophy. But COVID changed everything. We never saw the level of threats we saw during COVID toward healthcare workers and leaders, because of some of the mistrust and misinformation that was out there in the community,\" he said.",
      "\"All the ways things can go wrong\"",
      "Security industry veteran Brittney Blair of K2 Integrity said that online threat monitoring is as essential as physical protection.",
      "More companies are becoming more active in tracking cyber threats, including monitoring the web and dark web.",

    "summary": "Anthem will reverse a policy that would have capped insurance coverage for anesthesia after objections from doctors and lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield said Thursday that the health insurance provider is reversing a policy that was set to go into effect in February that would have limited anesthesia coverage during surgeries and other procedures, a change that had prompted an outcry from some physicians and lawmakers.",
      "The policy, which would have covered Anthem's plans in Connecticut, New York and Missouri, was disclosed in recent weeks, with the company's New York unit posting a\u00a0notice on Dec. 1. The policy would have excluded people under 22 years old and maternity care.",
      "According to the original policy statement, Anthem had said it would pay only for anesthesia treatments for the length of time that a procedure or surgery is estimated to require based on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's physician work time values. The insurer noted that claims for anesthesia \"above the established number of minutes will be denied.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News on Thursday, Anthem said it was backing away from the policy, and added there had been \"widespread misinformation about an update to our anesthesia policy.\"",
      "\"As a result, we have decided to not proceed with this policy change,\" an Anthem spokesperson wrote in an email. \"To be clear, it never was and never will be the policy of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to not pay for medically necessary anesthesia services. The proposed update to the policy was only designed to clarify the appropriateness of anesthesia consistent with well-established clinical guidelines.\"",
      "Before the announcement of Anthem's reversal, the plan had drawn criticism from medical professionals as well as Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, who wrote on social media on Wednesday that the plan is \"appalling.\"",
      "\"Saddling patients with thousands of dollars in surprise additional medical debt.   And for what? Just to boost corporate profits?\" Murphy wrote. \"Reverse this decision immediately.\"",

      "\"After hearing from people across the state about this concerning policy, my office reached out to Anthem, and I'm pleased to share this policy will no longer be going into effect here in Connecticut,\" Scanlon told the newspaper.",
      "\"Appalling behavior by commercial health insurers\"",
      "In a statement last month, the American Society of Anesthesiologists also called on Anthem to reverse the policy.",
      "\"With this new policy, Anthem will arbitrarily pre-determine the time allowed for anesthesia care during a surgery or procedure,\" the group said. \"If an anesthesiologist submits a bill where the actual time of care is longer than Anthem's limit, Anthem will deny payment for the anesthesiologist's care.\"",
      "The insurer's new policy could result in denials of coverage to patients who might need more anesthesia because their surgery is difficult or unusual, or if a complication occurs, the group added.",
      "\"This is just the latest in a long line of appalling behavior by commercial health insurers looking to drive their profits up at the expense of patients and physicians providing essential care,\" said Donald E. Arnold, an anesthesiologist and president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. \"This egregious policy breaks the trust between Anthem and its policyholders who expect their health insurer to pay physicians for the entirety of the care they need.\"",

    "story": [
      "Stellantis is recalling more than 300,000 Ram Heavy Duty pickup trucks because a faulty part could cause certain braking and tracking systems to fail.",
      "The Netherlands-based automaker said the hydraulic control unit on the trucks is prone to failure, which can cause the anti-lock brake, electronic stability control and traction control systems to not work properly. Stellantis said regular braking systems are not affected by the defective part and that it's unaware of any related injuries.",
      "The trucks in question are all model years 2017-18 and include the Ram 2500, 3500, 4500 and 5500. The recall includes a total of 317,630 trucks, including a small number of them in Canada, Mexico and elsewhere.",
      "Stellantis said it will advise customers who may be affected as to when they may obtain service, which will be free of charge.",
      "Customers with additional questions or concerns may call 1-800-853-1403.",
      "Last month, Stellantis announced a recall of about 207,000 Jeep and Dodge SUVs in the U.S. to fix a computer problem that can disable the anti-lock brakes and electronic stability control safety features. In September, Stellantis recalled nearly 1.5 million Ram pickup trucks worldwide to fix a software problem that can disable the electronic stability control system.",
      "Last week Stellantis announced that CEO Carlos Tavares was stepping down after nearly four years in the top spot of the carmaker.",
      "In addition to the recalls, Stellantis has been struggling with falling sales that have led to layoffs and contributed to ballooning inventory on dealer lots. Last quarter, Stellantis reported that net revenues plunged 27% from the same period a year ago.",

      "Employers added\u00a0227,000 jobs in November as the labor market rebounded from anemic growth in the prior month, when hurricanes and labor disputes dampened hiring.",
      "The unemployment rate ticked higher to 4.2% from 4.1% in the prior month. The U.S. had been forecast to add 200,000 jobs last month, according to economists surveyed by financial data firm FactSet. The unemployment rate was expected to hold steady at 4.1%.",
      "While hiring rebounded last month, the job market overall has been weakening in recent months under the strain of the Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy, with the central bank boosting borrowing rates to their highest point in 23 years to combat inflation. It's also taking longer for hundreds of thousands of out-of-work Americans to find new jobs, signaling cracks within a once-hot labor market as employers continue to cope with the impact of higher borrowing costs.",
      "\"After a prior month of hurricanes and worker strikes, we did get a bounce back in the headline payroll numbers plus positive revisions,\" said Bryon Anderson, head of fixed income at Laffer Tengler Investments, in an email. \"Jobs creation may not be as robust as in the past years, but we are not seeing a disaster in the job market. \"",
      "The end of labor disputes in October, including the Boeing machinists' strike, could have boosted job growth by almost 40,000, noted Goldman Sachs analysts in a report released ahead of the jobs report.",
      "October's jobs report was revised upward to 36,000 new jobs last month, versus the original report that employers had added 12,000 hires that month.",

      "Layoffs at lowest in two decades",
      "The Fed jacked up interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023 to combat the highest inflation in 40 years. Defying predictions, the economy kept growing despite much higher borrowing rates for consumers and businesses, although the job market has been slowing since early this year.",
      "Even so, Americans as a whole have been enjoying unusual job security. This week, the government reported that layoffs fell to just 1.6 million in October, below the lowest levels in the two decades that preceded the pandemic. At the same time, the number of job openings rebounded from a 3 1/2 year low, a sign that businesses are still seeking workers even though hiring has cooled.",
      "The economy grew at a 2.8% annual pace from July through September on healthy spending by consumers. Annual economic growth has topped a decent 2% in eight of the past nine quarters. And inflation has dropped from a 9.1% peak in June 2022 to 2.6% last month.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 00:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump wants former lawmaker and auctioneer Billy Long to replace IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he wants ex-congressman Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri and a former auctioneer, to run the IRS. As a lawmaker, Long co-sponsored legislation that aimed to wipe out much of the tax code.",
      "In making the announcement, Trump praised Long's \"32 years of experience running his own businesses in Real Estate and, as one of the premier Auctioneers in the Country.\" He also noted that since leaving Congress in 2023, Long has worked as a business and tax adviser.",
      "While Trump didn't mention the current IRS Commissioner, Danny Werfel, in his announcement, the decision signals the president-elect is likely to replace him with Long after taking office in January, Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Naming Long as the next IRS chief drew both support from conservatives as well as criticism from the left, with Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia who serves on the House Ways and Means Tax subcommittee calling it a \"terrible mistake,\" while Idaho Republican Senator Mike Crapo issued a statement saying he's looking forward to hearing Long's ideas for the tax agency. The fiscally conservative National Taxpayers Union Foundation praised Trump's choice, saying Long could help reform the IRS.",
      "Long has recently served as a tax adviser to businesses seeking to employ a controversial tax credit, but, unlike prior IRS commissioners, his background is largely outside of the tax industry, experts noted.",
      "\"This guy is an auctioneer \u2014 that's his expertise,\" Owens noted. \"This is an incredibly unserious choice.\"",
      "Werfel, who was appointed by President Biden, stepped into the role in 2023, with his term set to expire in 2027. Typically, presidents allow IRS commissioners to serve out their term, as Mr. Biden allowed Trump's former IRS appointee, Charles Rettig, to do before naming Werfel to the role.",
      "If the Senate approves his appointment to the IRS, Long would oversee an agency with 85,000 employees and an annual budget exceeding $12 billion.",
      "A spokesperson for the Trump campaign declined to comment.",
      "Here's what to know about Long and the IRS.",
      "Who is Billy Long?",
      "Long, who attended the University of Missouri but didn't graduate, described himself on a\u00a0website\u00a0for his congressional run as a \"fourth-generation native of Southwest Missouri.\" He touted his skills as an auctioneer, noting that he had been named the \"best auctioneer in the Ozarks for seven years in a row.\"",
      "Long also worked in real estate and in talk radio, hosting a show on a Missouri AM radio station.",
      "He shuttered his auction firm, Billy Long Auctions, before he was sworn into Congress in 2011, according to a local publication.",
      "What professional experience does Long have with taxes?",
      "As a congressman, Long co-sponsored some tax-related bills, including several efforts to eliminate the estate tax as well as a measure called the Tax Code Termination Act.",
      "That legislation would have wiped out much of the current tax code, replacing it with what the bill called a \"simple and fair system\" that would have applied \"a low rate to all Americans.\" Such flat taxes are considered regressive by many experts because low- and middle-income taxpayers would end up paying a larger share of their incomes than would wealthy Americans.",
      "\"As a business owner, Billy knows first-hand how government regulation and heavy taxes can affect the small businesses that serve as the economic engine of our country,\" his campaign site noted.",
      "While Long isn't an accountant or CPA, he has been involved in tax advising since leaving Congress. In a 2023 podcast, for example, he touted his work helping businesses use the Employee Retention Tax Credit, a credit that the IRS has\u00a0flagged for its high rate of fraud.",
      "In the podcast, Long also said that when he served as a congressman, he helped make the ERTC easier for businesses to claim, noting that the credit was difficult to qualify for during its first iteration.",
      "\"We went from having to say COVID adversely affected your business definitely, to taking that away, and you don't have to prove that you had any downturn,\" he said. \"We're doing recoveries for folks that had their best two years ever during COVID.\"",
      "The IRS says the ERTC is aimed at employers who paid wages to workers between March 12, 2020, and January 1, 2022, and that were either suspended by government order during the pandemic or experienced a \"required decline in gross receipts during 2020 or the first three calendar quarters of 2021.\" The credit is also available to startups that began at the end of 2021 and had less than $1 million in revenue.",
      "How does Long's experience compare with prior IRS commissioners?",
      "Long's lack of tax industry experience sets him apart from other recent IRS commissioners.",
      "Werfel, the current IRS chief, has an undergraduate degree from Cornell University and a master's degree in public policy from Duke University as well as a law degree from the University of North Carolina. He's also held a number of government jobs involved in operations and the IRS, including serving as acting commissioner of the IRS from May to December 2013, according to his biography.",
      "Werfel's predecessor, Charles Rettig, who was appointed by President-elect Trump, also held several degrees, including a master's in taxation. Before joining the IRS, Rettig worked as a tax attorney for more than three decades and served as the chairman of the IRS Advisory Council.",
      "What is happening with the IRS now?",
      "Under Werfel, the IRS has expanded audits of wealthy taxpayers and big corporations, clawing back billions in unpaid taxes, efforts that were funded by the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "The tax agency has also reduced the time it takes consumers to connect with an IRS employee, while also rolling out a free tax filing system called Direct File.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have pushed back against the expanded IRS funding, claiming\u00a0the agency would use the money to hire thousands of new agents to increase audits on middle-class taxpayers.",
      "The Treasury had said that funding could help the IRS add nearly 87,000 full-time workers over 10 years, but the agency didn't specify whether those new workers would be auditors, customer service workers or other types of employees. That figure also represented the total number of employees that could be hired, without calculating the impact of the number of IRS workers who are expected to retire or leave the department over the next several years.",
      "Some Democratic lawmakers are expressing concern that, if appointed, Long could disrupt the progress that the IRS has made under Werfel.",
      "Werfel \"has done an excellent job rebuilding the IRS, boosting customer service and enhancing enforcement aimed at wealthy tax evaders,\" Rep. Beyer said in a statement. \"Removing him will clearly signal Trump's intention to make the agency less responsive to the American people, while giving a green light to wealthy tax cheats to evade their fair share of the tax burden.\"",
      "Still, Republican lawmakers expressed support for the pick, such as Senator Crapo, who highlighted \"privacy and security\" issues at the IRS and \"inefficient use of resources.\" He added, \"I look forward to learning more about Mr. Long's vision for the agency.\"",

    "story": [
      "Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was shot to death Wednesday outside the New York Hilton Midtown in Manhattan, where the company was hosting an investor day.",
      "Thompson, 50, was\u00a0named\u00a0CEO of UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group's insurance arm, in April 2021. He first joined UnitedHealth Group in 2004 and had previously served as CEO of the company's government programs, including Medicare and retiree coverage, and community and state programs providing Medicaid and other types of coverage to millions of individuals.",
      "In his most recent role as CEO of UnitedHealthcare, he was responsible for leading growth across the company's global, employer, individual, specialty and government benefits businesses, according to a 2021 company statement announcing his appointment.",
      "\"Brian's experience, relationships and values make him especially well-suited to help UnitedHealthcare improve how health care works for consumers, physicians, employers, governments and our other partners, leading to continued and sustained long-term growth,\" UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty said at the time.",
      "Thompson held other positions over his 20 years at the company, including chief financial officer for UnitedHealthcare's Employer and Individual, Community and State and Medicare and Retirement businesses. He also served as the financial controller for UnitedHealthcare's Employer and Individual business and was a director in the company's corporate development division.",
      "A low-key CEO",
      "For a top executive at a $562 billion company that affects how millions of Americans get health care, Thompson kept a relatively low profile. At an investor meeting last year, he outlined UnitedHealth's shift to \"value-based care,\" paying doctors and other caregivers to keep patients healthy, rather than focusing on treating them when they get sick.",
      "\"Health care should be easier for people,\" Thompson said at the time. \"We are cognizant of the challenges. But navigating a future through value-based care unlocks a situation where the \u2026 family doesn't have to make the decisions on their own.\"",
      "In 2023, Thompson earned total compensation of $10.2 million, according to a\u00a0disclosure\u00a0by UnitedHealth Group.",
      "Before joining UnitedHealth Group, Thompson worked as a certified public accountant at accounting firm PwC, according to his biography on networking site LinkedIn. Thompson graduated from the University of Iowa in 1997 with a bachelor's degree in business administration and most recently resided in Maple Grove, Minnesota.",
      "Following the shooting, UnitedHealthcare canceled its Wednesday meeting with Wall Street analysts and investors, which Thompson had been scheduled to attend.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened and shocked at the passing of our dear friend and colleague Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare,\" UnitedHealth Group said in a statement. \"Brian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him. We are working closely with the New York Police Department and ask for your patience and understanding during this difficult time. Our hearts go out to Brian's family and all who were close to him.\"",
      "On LinkedIn, former colleagues described Thompson as an \"affable\" and \"popular\" leader.",
      "\"BT was whip-smart and affable \u2014 a guy who could grasp the complexities of health care and explain them in simple, relatable terms true to his Iowa upbringing,\" said Matt Burns, who served as vice president of communications at UnitedHealth Group from 2015 to 2018.",
      "Thompson is survived by his wife, Paulette Thompson, and two sons.",
      "\"We are shattered to hear about the senseless killing of our beloved Brian,\" Thompson's wife said in a statement provided to CBS News by her sister. \"Brian was an incredibly loving, generous, talented man who truly lived life to the fullest and touched so many lives. Most importantly, Brian was an incredibly loving father to our two sons and will be greatly missed. We appreciate your well wishes and request complete privacy as our family moves through this difficult time.\"",
      "Minnesota leaders express shock",
      "Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also weighed in on Thompson's death. \"This is a shocking and devastating loss for our whole community. 'Shocking' is the only word I can find at the moment,\" he said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added in a post on social media that Thompson was \"a great man.\"",
      "Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar expressed her condolences for Thompson's family and for United Healthcare employees in the state, calling the shooting \"a horrifying and shocking act of violence\" in a post on X.",

    "summary": "Payments to victims of Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com are the largest yet by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
    "story": [
      "More than 4 million Americans gouged by credit repair companies including Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com will soon collectively receive $1.8 billion in refund checks, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced Thursday.",
      "The payments make up the biggest distribution yet from the CFPB's victims relief fund, financed by civil penalties paid by companies that violate consumer protection laws, the agency said.",
      "Checks will be mailed in coming weeks to 4.3 million consumers who were charged illegal advance fees or subjected to allegedly deceptive bait-and-switch advertising by Lexington Law, CreditRepair.com and their parent companies, according to the federal agency.",
      "The CFPB in August 2023 obtained a legal judgment against the credit repair businesses, with a district court ruling the companies had violated a law that prohibits such companies from collecting fees until at least six months after their promised results.",
      "The companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after the court ruling, shutting about 80% of their business operations, including telemarketing call centers.",
      "\"Exploited vulnerable consumers\"",
      "\"Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com exploited vulnerable consumers who were trying to rebuild their credit, charging them illegal junk fees for results they hadn't delivered,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra stated in a news release. \"This historic distribution of $1.8 billion demonstrates the CFPB's commitment to making consumers whole, even when the companies that harm them shut down or declare bankruptcy.\"",
      "Since its launch in 2011, the CFPB has distributed more than $3.3 billion to consumers harmed by a range of illegal practices, such as student loan and mortgage relief scams and predatory lending. The victims relief fund allows the CFPB to provide financial relief in cases where direction compensation from the violating company is not possible.",
      "The brainchild of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, the CFPB was established after the 2008 financial crisis. Funded by the Federal Reserve, the agency has weathered several legal challenges from opponents. The Supreme Court\u00a0in May upheld\u00a0its funding structure, which had been challenged by the payday lending industry.",
      "Still, the agency's efforts could prove short-lived amid calls from some Republicans to weaken the agency or get rid of it entirely. On Wednesday, billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 among those designated by President-elect Donald Trump to\u00a0front an effort\u00a0to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash regulations and cut government spending \u2014 called for deleting the CFPB, arguing in a\u00a0post\u00a0on social media that there are \"too many duplicative regulatory agencies.\"",
      "When will the refund checks be sent?",
      "Payments will be sent between December and January to eligible consumers harmed by the companies, and those eligible do not need to take any action to receive a check.",
      "Those who think they are eligible but have not received a payment by mid-January can then contact JND Legal Administration at www.cfpb-lexlaw.org. Details about the distribution can be found here.",
      "How big will the payments be?",
      "The CFPB said the payments are based on a pro-rata share of fees paid by consumers to CreditRepair.com and Lexington Law, but that the payments might not cover all the fees they incurred.",
      "If the payments were divided evenly, each person would receive about $419.",
      "\"If funds remain after the distribution is complete, additional checks may be sent to consumers who cashed their initial check. You don't need to take any additional action,\" the agency said.",
      "Can I file a claim?",
      "No, according to the agency. \"There won't be opportunities to file claims for this redress case,\" it said.",
      "Is the refund check taxable?",
      "It's unlikely, because the checks are considered refunds for payments that consumers made to the credit repair companies, rather than taxable income, the CFPB said. \"If you have tax-related questions, however, please contact a tax advisor,\" it added.",

    "story": [
      "The sprawling, windowless warehouses that hold rows of high-speed servers powering almost everything the world does on phones and computers are increasingly becoming fixtures of the American landscape, popping up in towns, cities and suburbs across the United States.",
      "Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and urban and rural governments alike are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies.",
      "But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas, abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents are pushing back against the world's most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.",
      "In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling hills of the area's westernmost counties and butt up against wooded bike trails winding through the suburbs. But one of the latest proposals in the area, Plaza 500, would see a 466,000-square-foot facility and adjacent electrical substation built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds and a community center.",
      "The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials promised jobs and a significant property tax boost. But data center critics say the incentives aren't enough to counteract the consequences of building the facilities so close to homes.",
      "Tyler Ray, a leader in the fight against the Virginia project, worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by 2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help power the data centers' hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere.",
      "Ray and his neighbors tried to stop the development, but their efforts were largely unsuccessful. The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project was exempt.",
      "\"I don't know how a general resident, even someone who has been engaging intently on an issue, has any chance to go up against the data center industry,\" Ray said the night the supervisors voted.",
      "For local governments, attracting data centers to their municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in 2024 that Virginia's current data centers brought in $1 billion in tax revenue.",
      "For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of direct jobs \u2013 often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently that its investment in nearby Loudoun County, which included two data centers, created around 150 direct jobs, a figure that data center opponents say isn't worth the hassle. But data center advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction, technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730 indirect jobs.",
      "Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax County should reap the benefits.",
      "\"I have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the big picture,\" Smith said. \"Data centers are not going away.\"",
      "On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the 4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia river.",
      "Last year, AWS paid roughly $34 million in property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a $66 million tax break. Those payments, in addition to $1.7 in charitable donations from the company in 2023, have been instrumental in updating infrastructure and bolstering services. These funds have gone toward a new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer and $5,000 grants for homebuyers so far totaling at least $2.8 million.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 14:39:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Judge Reed O'Connor took issue with both a lack of judicial oversight and certain diversity requirements included in the deal's independent monitoring process.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Texas rejected a proposed plea agreement between the Justice Department and Boeing that would have settled the U.S. government's claims against the company, after crashes of two 737 Max jetliners that killed 346 people, according to a court order issued Thursday.",
      "In his ruling, Judge Reed O'Connor took issue with both a lack of judicial oversight and certain diversity requirements included in the deal's independent monitoring process and ordered the parties to provide the court with a plan for possible ways forward early next month.",
      "The federal government's proposed agreement with airplane manufacturing giant over the deadly crashes included various provisions, including an admission of guilt to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and a $243.6 million fine \u2014 much less than the billions the families of the victims had requested. The deal would also have required Boeing to spend $455 million on safety programs and to work with an independent monitor who would oversee the company's progress.",
      "Investigators alleged in court records that leading up to the crashes, Boeing deceived federal officials who regulated the planes. In 2021, Boeing and the Justice Department entered into a deferred prosecution agreement, which meant the criminal charge would have been dropped if Boeing had complied with the terms of the deal. But earlier this year, federal prosecutors informed the court that Boeing had not followed through on all of the requirements and intended to move forward with the case.",
      "By July, after weeks of negotiations, Boeing and the Justice Department settled on the proposed plea agreement, prompting an outcry from families of those who died in the crashes. At the time, CBS News reported the deal only covered wrongdoing by Boeing tied to the crashes and did not give the company immunity for other incidents, including a door panel that blew off a Max jetliner during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. According to a Justice Department official, the proposed agreement also did not cover any current or former Boeing officials, only the corporation.",
      "Attorneys for some of the victims' families opposed the deal, arguing the \"rotten\" agreement with the government did not justly remedy the families' claims against Boeing. In court filings, they accused Boeing of more criminality and urged stricter penalties, harsher monitoring and recognition of the lives lost.",
      "In rejecting the plea agreement, the judge took aim at diversity, equity and inclusion considerations that the parties said they would take when hiring an independent monitor. He wrote that he was \"concerned with the Government's shifting and contradictory explanations of how the plea agreement's diversity-and-inclusion provision will practically operate in this case.\"",
      "Judge O'Connor had previously raised this issue and in responsive court filings, the Justice Department defended the language, arguing it predated the Boeing agreement. \"This new language reflected not a change in policy but rather a principle that has always governed the process: that selection of a monitor must be based solely on merit, from the broadest possible pool of qualified candidates,\" they said.",
      "O'Connor ruled Thursday that the language was inappropriate: \"In a case of this magnitude, it is in the utmost interest of justice that the public is confident this monitor selection is done based solely on competency. The parties' DEI efforts only serve to undermine this confidence in the Government and Boeing's ethics and anti-fraud efforts.\"",
      "The judge also wrote that the Justice Department's previous efforts to oversee Boeing's conduct \"failed\" and said the independent monitor provision in the proposed deal did not go far enough to include the court in the process.",
      "\"At this point, the public interest requires the Court to step in. Marginalizing the Court in the selection and monitoring of the independent monitor as the plea agreement does undermines public confidence in Boeing's probation, fails to promote respect for the law, and is therefore not in the public interest,\" O'Connor wrote, \"Accordingly, the Court cannot accept the plea agreement.\"",
      "The Justice Department said it's reviewing the decision. Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "In a statement, Paul Cassell, an attorney for some of the victims' families, told CBS News, \"Judge O'Connor has recognized that this was a cozy deal between the Government and Boeing that failed to focus on the overriding concerns \u2013 holding Boeing accountable for its deadly crime and ensuring that nothing like this happens again in the future.\"",

    "summary": "A growing number of unemployed workers have been searching for a new job for more than 15 weeks, labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "The unemployment rate might be near a historic low, but it's taking longer for hundreds of thousands of out-of-work Americans to find new jobs, signaling cracks within a once-hot labor market as employers continue to cope with the impact of higher borrowing costs.",
      "About 40% of the 7 million people who were out of work in October, or roughly 2.84 million people, have been looking for work for more than 15 weeks, an increase of 20% since a year earlier, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. More than half of those job seekers have been on the hunt for new employment for more than 27 weeks, or about half a year.",
      "A drawn-out job search is increasingly common in the labor market today as companies hold off on hiring, especially in some industries such as tech and professional services, ZipRecruiter chief economist Julia Pollak told CBS MoneyWatch. It's a far cry from the heady years of 2021 and 2022, when Americans switched jobs at high rates in search of better pay and more fulfilling work, a trend termed \"The Great Resignation.\"",
      "The job market has since weakened under the strain of the Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy, with the central bank boosting borrowing rates to their highest point in 23 years to combat inflation, Pollak noted. While inflation has rapidly cooled in the past two years and the Fed began cutting rates in September, the burden of higher borrowing costs has caused consumers to pull back on buying cars and homes, impacting key sectors of the economy, Pollak said.",
      "The job market today reflects \"low hiring, low firing and low job-switching,\" Pollak noted. \"It's this 'big stay'-type of situation \u2014 it's great if you have a job you like, and it's not great if you don't have a job.\"",
      "Employers in October hired 12,000 workers, a jobs report that marked the slowest month for hiring since December 2020. As the anemic number reflects, businesses were weighed down by Hurricanes Milton and Helene as well as labor disputes such as the Boeing machinists strike.",
      "Leading up to the November 5 election, a majority of American held a\u00a0dim view of the strength of the U.S. economy, a factor partly credited with helping President-elect Donald Trump claim victory. While much of voters' anger was focused on inflation, the job market also played a role in their views, with the unemployment rate inching up from a pandemic low of 3.4%, and with some workers saying their pay\u00a0hasn't yet caught up to inflation.",
      "Since the election, though, voters' views of the economy\u00a0have improved, especially among Trump supporters, CBS News polling has found.",

      "\"The broader thread in the labor market has been a slow, gradual cooling, and the question is whether after accounting for these quirks if that will still be evident\" in Friday's data, Pollack noted, referring to businesses recovering after the storms and the labor strikes.",
      "Employers cut almost 60,000 jobs last month, an increase of 27% from a year earlier, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The automotive and tech industries had the largest numbers of layoffs last month, the group said.",
      "\"The automotive industry is currently experiencing significant challenges, including potential tariffs affecting U.S. automakers with overseas factories, intensifying competition from Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, and shifts in government subsidies for EVs,\" Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas said in a statement.",
      "The job market and interest rate cuts",
      "The slowing labor market helped sway the Federal Reserve's decision to begin cutting rates in September, which marked the central bank's\u00a0first rate cut in four years. The Fed followed with a second rate cut in November, and a majority of economists are forecasting another reduction at the central bank's December 18 meeting.",
      "According to BNP Parabas analysts, the job market may be in a period of uncertainty partly due to the election.",

      "They added, \"Though we suspect that pre-election uncertainty played a role in restraining hiring of late, this report (due on 6 December) may be too early to reveal a clear unlocking of previously postponed hiring. Uncertainties about tariffs, immigration and fiscal policy remain.\"",
      "Even so, some economists are paring their forecasts for the pace of the Fed's expected rate cuts in 2025, citing President-elect Trump's plans to impose tariffs, cut taxes and deport millions of illegal immigrants, which could, if enacted, reignite inflation.",

He chartered the first purely commercial, all-civilian American \"space tourist\" mission \u2014 Inspiration4 \u2014 in February 2021, paying SpaceX an undisclosed amount to launch him and three other civilian flyers on a two-day, 23-hour flight.",
      "He flew to space again this past September, commanding the first of three planned SpaceX Polaris missions, logging nearly five days in space on a flight that took the crew farther from Earth than any astronauts have gone since the Apollo moon program. Isaacman also became the first private citizen to carry out a spacewalk.",
      "He is scheduled to lead another Polaris mission aboard a SpaceX capsule before leading the first crew to space aboard the California rocket builder's gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "Dates have not been announced for either of those missions, and it's not yet clear what impact Isaacman's selection to lead NASA will have on those flights, whether Isaacman still intends to fly aboard one or both or what sort of influence his friendship with Musk might have on NASA's future direction.",
      "But Isaacman, a skilled pilot who flies his own MiG-29 fighter jet, made it clear in a post following Trump's announcement that NASA can expect him to be a vocal space advocate who will help \"usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilization.\"",
      "\"With the support of President Trump, I can promise you this: We will never again lose our ability to journey to the stars and never settle for second place,\" Isaacman said. \"We will inspire children, yours and mine, to look up and dream of what is possible. Americans will walk on the moon and Mars and in doing so, we will make life better here on Earth.\"",
      "He said it would be the \"honor of a lifetime to serve in this role and to work alongside NASA's extraordinary team to realize our shared dreams of exploration and discovery.\"",
      "Jim Bridenstine, Nelson's predecessor at the helm of NASA, helped kickstart the agency's Artemis moon program during the first Trump administration.",
      "He said in a statement Wednesday that \"Jared's vision for pushing boundaries, paired with his proven track record of success in private industry, positions him as an ideal candidate to lead NASA into a bold new era of exploration and discovery. I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm him.\"",
      "The Isaacman announcement comes as NASA struggles to keep the Artemis program on track amid tight budgets and what the agency's own inspector general calls the \"unsustainable\" costs of NASA's Space Launch System, or SLS, moon rocket.",
      "SpaceX supporters argue the company's more powerful, fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship rocket is the obvious choice for deep space exploration, but the huge rocket is far from operational with just a half-dozen suborbital test flights to its credit.",
      "The SLS, on the other hand, is considered operational in that it completed an initial test flight in November 2022, sending an unpiloted Orion capsule around the moon and back. But unlike the Super Heavy-Starship, the SLS is a throwaway, expendable booster expected to cost some $1.4 billion for each of its first four moon missions.",
      "NASA is currently gearing up to launch three NASA astronauts and a Canadian flyer on an SLS-Orion mission \u2014 Artemis 2 \u2014 late next year. But problems with the first Orion's heat shield and other issues threaten to push the Artemis 2 flight into 2026, years past initial expectations.",
      "It's not yet clear when the Artemis 3 mission, the first to carry astronauts to a landing near the moon's south pole, might be feasible.",
      "But that flight will feature a lunar lander built by SpaceX, a variant of the company's Starship upper stage. SpaceX has carried out six test flights of the fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship to date, but has not yet put the Starship upper stage into orbit or brought it down for an intact landing.",
      "Given the company's rapid-fire test schedule, most observers believe SpaceX will get the Super Heavy-Starship working as planned in the near future, but scores of test flights will be required to demonstrate the safety and reliability required by NASA to put astronauts aboard.",
      "And the moon mission poses unique challenges.",
      "For the initial landing mission, multiple Super Heavy \"tanker\" flights will be required to refuel the moon lander in low-Earth orbit before it can be sent to the moon. Once in lunar orbit, it will await the arrival of the Artemis 3 crew, launched aboard an Orion capsule by an SLS rocket.",
      "After boarding the Starship lander, two astronauts would descend to the surface, carry out the mission's planned exploration, and then head back up to the orbiting Orion for the trip back to Earth.",

    "summary": "Amazon allegedly stopped its fastest delivery service to almost 50,000 Prime subscribers in two District of Columbia ZIP codes.",
    "story": [
      "Amazon secretly excluded two ZIP codes from its fastest delivery service while charging nearly 50,000 Prime members who live in the areas its full Prime subscription price, the District of Columbia's attorney general alleges in a lawsuit filed Wednesday.",
      "Amazon violated consumer protection laws by stopping its quickest delivery service to the two historically lower-income neighborhoods, then misled customers about why their packages were arriving later than advertised when they complained, according to the suit filed in D.C. Superior Court.",
      "The world's biggest online retailer's paid subscription service, Amazon Prime, offers two-day delivery for millions of items, as well as next-day or same-day for many other products for $139 a year, or $14.99 a month.",
      "Amazon in June 2022 decided to stop using its fleet of branded trucks to make Prime deliveries to D.C. ZIP codes 20019 and 20020, servicing them instead with third-party delivery services like UPS and the U.S. Postal Service. The company knew the decision would result in significantly slower deliveries for the areas, but did not tell existing or prospective customers, the suit alleges.",
      "Amazon informed the attorney general's office that the change came as the result of safety concerns for its drivers, the attorney general said. Yet the company was legally obligated to disclose the change to customers.",
      "\"Amazon is charging tens of thousands of hard-working Ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide. While Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one ZIP code is worth less than a dollar in another,\" D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb stated in a news\u00a0release.\"We're suing to stop this deceptive conduct and make sure District residents get what they're paying for.\"",
      "Amazon Prime two-day delivery",
      "Last year, the rest of the city's Prime members received packages within two days of checkout 75% of the time, but those in the impacted ZIP codes received their orders within two days just 24% of the time, according to the suit.",
      "Amazon dismissed as \"categorically false\" claims that its business practices are discriminatory or deceptive.",
      "\"We want to be able to deliver as fast as we possibly can to every ZIP code across the country, however, at the same time we must put the safety of delivery drivers first,\" an Amazon spokesperson said in an emailed statement.",
      "The spokesperson added, \"In the ZIP codes in question, there have been specific and targeted acts against drivers delivering Amazon packages. We made the deliberate choice to adjust our operations, including delivery routes and times, for the sole reason of protecting the safety of drivers.\"",
      "The company said it's clear with customers about expected delivery dates. \"And we're always transparent with customers during the shopping journey and checkout process about when, exactly, they can expect their orders to arrive,\" the spokesperson said.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 10:27:28 -0500",
    "summary": "About 3.7 million people are at immediate risk of losing health coverage should the federal government cut funding for Medicaid expansions, as some allies of President-elect Donald Trump have proposed.",
    "story": [
      "With Donald Trump's return to the White House and Republicans taking full control of Congress in 2025, the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion is back on the chopping block.",
      "More than 3 million adults in nine states would be at immediate risk of losing their health coverage should the GOP reduce the extra federal Medicaid funding that's enabled states to widen eligibility, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, and the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families. That's because the states have trigger laws that would swiftly end their Medicaid expansions if federal funding falls.",
      "The states are Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia.",
      "The 2010 Affordable Care Act encouraged states to expand Medicaid programs to cover more low-income Americans who didn't get health insurance through their jobs. Forty states and the District of Columbia agreed, extending health insurance since 2014 to an estimated 21 million people and helping drive the U.S. uninsured rate to record lows.",
      "In exchange, the federal government pays 90% of the cost to cover the expanded population. That's far higher than the federal match for other Medicaid beneficiaries, which averages about 57% nationwide.",
      "Conservative policy groups, which generally have opposed the ACA, say the program costs too much and covers too many people. Democrats say the Medicaid expansion has saved lives and helped communities by widening coverage to people who could not afford private insurance.",
      "If Congress cuts federal funding, Medicaid expansion would be at risk in all states that have opted into it \u2014 even those without trigger laws \u2014 because state legislatures would be forced to make up the difference, said Renuka Tipirneni, an associate professor at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health.",
      "Decisions to keep or roll back the expansion \"would depend on the politics at the state level,\" Tipirneni said.",
      "For instance, Michigan approved a trigger as part of its Medicaid expansion in 2013, when it was controlled by a Republican governor and legislature. Last year, with the government controlled by Democrats, the state eliminated its funding trigger.",
      "Six of the nine states with trigger laws \u2014 Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Montana, North Carolina and Utah \u2014 went for Trump in the 2024 election.",
      "Most of the nine states' triggers kick in if federal funding falls below the 90% threshold. Arizona's trigger would eliminate its expansion if funding falls below 80%.",
      "Montana's law rolls back expansion below 90% funding but allows it to continue if lawmakers identify additional funding. Under state law, Montana lawmakers must reauthorize its Medicaid expansion in 2025 or the expansion will end.",
      "Across the states with triggers, between 3.1 million and 3.7 million people would swiftly lose their coverage, researchers at KFF and the Georgetown center estimate. The difference depends on how states treat people who were added to Medicaid before the ACA expansion; they may continue to qualify even if the expansion ends.",
      "Three other states \u2014 Iowa, Idaho and New Mexico\u2014 have laws that require their governments to mitigate the financial impact of losing federal Medicaid expansion funding but would not automatically end expansions. With those three states included, about 4.3 million Medicaid expansion enrollees would be at risk of losing coverage, according to KFF.",
      "The ACA allowed Medicaid expansions to adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or about $20,783 for an individual in 2024.",
      "Nearly a quarter of the 81 million people enrolled in Medicaid nationally are in the program due to expansions.",
      "\"With a reduction in the expansion match rate, it is likely that all states would need to evaluate whether to continue expansion coverage because it would require a significant increase in state spending,\" said Robin Rudowitz, vice president and director of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF. \"If states drop coverage, it is likely that there would be an increase in the number of uninsured, and that would limit access to care across red and blue states that have adopted expansion.\"",
      "States rarely cut eligibility for social programs such as Medicaid once it's been granted.",
      "The triggers make it politically easier for state lawmakers to end Medicaid expansion because they would not have to take any new action to cut coverage, said Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families.",
      "To see the impact of trigger laws, consider what happened after the Supreme Court in 2022 struck down Roe v. Wade and, with it, the constitutional right to an abortion. Conservative lawmakers in 13 states had crafted trigger laws that would automatically implement bans in the event a national right to abortion were struck down. Those state laws resulted in restrictions taking effect immediately after the court ruling, or shortly thereafter.",
      "States adopted triggers as part of Medicaid expansion to win over lawmakers skeptical of putting state dollars on the hook for a federal program unpopular with most Republicans.",
      "It's unclear what Trump and congressional Republicans will do with Medicaid after he takes office in January, but one indicator could be a recent recommendation from the Paragon Health Institute, a leading conservative policy organization led by former Trump health adviser Brian Blase.",
      "Paragon has proposed that starting in 2026 the federal government would phase down the 90% federal match for expansion until 2034, when it would reach parity with each state's federal match for its traditional enrollees. Under that plan, states could still get ACA Medicaid expansion funding but restrict coverage to enrollees with incomes up to the federal poverty level. Currently, to receive expansion funding, states must offer coverage to everyone up to 138% of the poverty level.",
      "Daniel Derksen, director of the Center for Rural Health at the University of Arizona, said it's unlikely Arizona would move to eliminate its trigger and make up for lost federal funds. \"It would be a tough sell right now as it would put a big strain on the budget,\" he said.",
      "Medicaid has been in the crosshairs of Republicans in Washington before. Republican congressional leaders in 2017 proposed legislation to cut federal expansion funding, a move that would have shifted billions in costs to states. That plan, part of a strategy to repeal Obamacare, ultimately failed.",

      "\"The move is a considerable escalation of tensions in supply chains where access to raw material units is already tight in the West,\" Project Blue cofounder Jack Bedder told Reuters.",
      "China issued the new ban just two days after the U.S. curbed exports to 140 companies in China's semiconductor industry.

    "summary": "An appeals court judge wrote that the law that would force a sale or ban of TikTok \"survive[s] constitutional scrutiny.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court upheld a law that will ban TikTok in the U.S. in the coming months if its Chinese parent company doesn't sell its stake in the app, dealing another setback to the widely popular video-sharing service in its battle with the federal government.",
      "A panel of three judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously sided with the Justice Department in declining to review the petition for relief from TikTok and ByteDance, its Chinese parent company, saying the law is constitutional.",
      "\"We conclude the portions of the Act the petitioners have standing to challenge, that is the provisions concerning TikTok and its related entities, survive constitutional scrutiny,\" Senior Judge Douglas Ginsburg wrote in the majority opinion. \"We therefore deny the petitions.\"",
      "Congress approved\u00a0a foreign assistance package in April that included provisions giving TikTok nine months to sever ties with ByteDance or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. President Biden quickly signed the bill into law, and it is set to take effect on Jan. 19, with the possibility of a one-time 90-day delay granted by the president if a sale is in progress by then.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump tried to ban TikTok during his first term in office, but reversed his position during the presidential campaign and vowed to \"save\" the app. He takes office on Jan. 20.",
      "Lawmakers and national security officials have long had suspicions about TikTok's ties to China. Officials from both parties have warned that the Chinese government could use TikTok to spy on and collect data from its roughly 170 million American users or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content. The concern is warranted, they have argued, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering.",
      "The appeals court's decision tees up a fight at the Supreme Court over the law's ultimate fate. The parties asked the judges to make a decision by Friday so there is enough time for the high court to review the case before the law takes effect. The justices could agree to hear the case and pause the law while they consider the legal arguments, or let the appeals court's ruling stand as the final word.",
      "TikTok expects the law will be overturned by the Supreme Court, according to spokesperson Michael Hughes, who argued the law is based on \"inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information.\"",
      "\"The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" Hughes said in a statement.",
      "The Justice Department, meanwhile, applauded the decision.",
      "\"Today's decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to collect sensitive information about millions of Americans, to covertly manipulate the content delivered to American audiences, and to undermine our national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. \"As the D.C. Circuit recognized, this act protects the national security of the United States in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution. The Justice Department is committed to defending Americans' sensitive data from authoritarian regimes that seek to exploit companies under their control.\"",
      "The court's decision",
      "\"The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\" Ginsburg wrote in his opinion. \"Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\"",
      "The appeals court said that it recognized the decision will have \"significant implications\" for TikTok and its users.",
      "\"Consequently, TikTok's millions of users will need to find alternative media of communication,\" Ginsburg said. \"That burden is attributable to the [People's Republic of China's] hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security, not to the U.S. Government, which engaged with TikTok through a multi-year process in an effort to find an alternative solution.\"",
      "The D.C. Circuit found that the government's national-security justifications for banning TikTok \u2014 to counter China's efforts to collect Americans' data and limit its ability to manipulate content covertly on the platform \u2014 are \"wholly consistent\" with the First Amendment.",
      "\"The multi-year efforts of both political branches to investigate the national security risks posed by the TikTok platform, and to consider potential remedies proposed by TikTok, weigh heavily in favor of the Act,\" Ginsburg wrote. \"The government has offered persuasive evidence demonstrating that the act is narrowly tailored to protect national security.\"",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House China committee, praised the decision, calling it \"a loss for the Chinese Community Party,\" while also expressing optimism about the app's future in the U.S.",
      "\"I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,\" Moolenaar said in a statement.",
      "The House China committee spearheaded the bipartisan effort to pass the law.",
      "The legal arguments",
      "TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge in May that called the legislation \"an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power\" based on \"speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation\" that would suppress the speech of millions of Americans.",
      "\"In reality, there is no choice,\" the petition said, adding that a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\"",
      "The Chinese government vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance said \"such a fundamental rearchitecting is not remotely feasible\" under the restrictions within the legislation.",
      "\"The platform consists of millions of lines of software code that have been painstakingly developed by thousands of engineers over multiple years,\" the petition said.",
      "During oral arguments in September, the appeals panel appeared skeptical of TikTok's argument that free expression outweighs national security concerns, but the three judges were also critical of the government's stance.",
      "TikTok's lawyer Andrew Pincus said the law \"is unprecedented and its effect would be staggering.\"",
      "\"This law imposes extraordinary speech prohibition based on indeterminate future risks,\" Pincus said. \"Notwithstanding the obvious less restrictive alternatives, the government has not come anywhere near satisfying strict scrutiny.\"",
      "Judge Sri Srinivasan said, under TikTok's rationale, the U.S. would not be able to ban a foreign country from owning a major media company in the U.S. if the two are at war.",
      "\"Is your submission that Congress can't bar the enemy's ownership of a major media source in the U.S.?\" Srinivasan, an Obama appointee, asked Pincus.",
      "When Pincus noted that news outlets like Politico and Business Insider are owned by foreign entities, Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, quickly chimed in: \"But not foreign adversaries.\"",
      "Rao also pushed back on Pincus' argument that Congress did not include any evidence of its claims that TikTok poses a national security risk in the legislation.",
      "\"I know Congress doesn't legislate all the time, but here they did,\" she said. \"They actually passed a law and many of your arguments want us to treat them as an agency. It's strange. It's a very strange framework for thinking about our first branch of government.\"",
      "Attorney Jeffrey Fisher, who represents TikTok creators, compared the restrictions on TikTok to the U.S. government hypothetically banning bookstores from selling books written by foreign authors in conjunction with a foreign government.",
      "\"We're not talking about banning Tocqueville in the United States,\" Rao countered. \"We're talking about a determination by the political branches that there's a foreign adversary that is potentially exercising covert influence in the United States. Very different.\"",
      "Ginsburg, a Reagan appointee, expressed skepticism over the notion that the law singles out TikTok.",
      "\"It describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity,\" he said, noting that the company and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns. \"That's the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "Justice Department lawyer Daniel Tenny said the data on Americans that could be collected through the app \"would be quite valuable to a foreign adversary if it were trying to approach an American to try to have them be an intelligence asset.\" Tenny also spoke about the risk of content manipulation by China.",
      "\"What is being targeted is a foreign company that controls this recommendation engine and many aspects of the algorithm that's used to determine what content is shown to Americans on the app,\" Tenny said.",
      "But Srinivasan said it's Americans' choice to use the app, despite what content may appear.",
      "\"The fact that that's being denied subjects this to serious First Amendment scrutiny,\" he said.",
      "He later added, \"What gives arguable force to the other side's First Amendment argument is that it's not just that the government is targeting curation that occurs abroad. It's the reason the curation occurring abroad is being targeted, and the reason is a concern about the content consequences of that curation in the U.S.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Biden is considering blanket preemptive pardons for prominent critics of President-elect Donald Trump in both parties to shield them from possible \"retribution\" or legal prosecution by the incoming administration.",
      "Multiple people familiar with the ongoing discussions tell CBS News the president has debated with senior White House aides the possibility of issuing the preemptive pardons, but no specific names have been formally recommended to him. The concept of preemptive pardons, and names of people who could benefit from them, have been more rigorously discussed among administration officials expected to help Mr. Biden make final determinations, a group that includes White House Chief of Staff Jeffrey Zients and White House Counsel Ed Siskel.",
      "Among those who could be eligible for preemptive legal relief include well-known names at the center of many of the most rancorous moments of the first Trump administration, many of whom remain the subject of his public ire.",
      "The list includes Dr. Anthony Fauci, who helped coordinate the nation's COVID-19 response and later served as Mr. Biden's top science adviser; retired Gen. Mark A. Milley, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who has called Trump a \"fascist\" and provided information for several books and news reports detailing the former president's behavior and activities around the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol; California Democratic Senator-elect Adam Schiff, and other Democratic and Republican lawmakers who led the two impeachment cases against Trump or sat on the House committee that reviewed the Jan. 6 attack \u2014   a group that includes former Wyoming Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, who actively campaigned against Trump this past fall.",
      "Fauci and Cheney were not immediately available for comment. Milley declined to comment.\u00a0In an interview with NPR in late November, Schiff said he didn't think a preemptive pardon is a good idea, because \"I think the courts are strong enough to withstand\" threats made by Trump.",
      "\"I think this is frankly so implausible as not to be worthy of much consideration,\" Schiff said. \"I would urge the president not to do that. I think it would seem defensive and unnecessary.\"",
      "News that Mr. Biden was considering preemptive pardons\u00a0was first reported this week by Politico. The White House initially would not engage on the subject this week, but confirmation that the idea is under consideration comes in the wake of the president's sweeping pardon for his son, Hunter Biden, shielding him from all potential criminal activity over 11 years.",
      "The pardon, the first ever issued by any American president for one of his children, came Sunday in the wake of Trump's announced plans to nominate Pam Bondi to serve as attorney general and Kash Patel to lead the FBI. Bondi, Patel and others set for positions in the second Trump administration have spent years discussing plans to seek retribution for Trump's critics or to take steps to stifle news outlets considered critical or hostile to the president-elect.",
      "Rep. Brendan Boyle, Democrat of Pennsylvania, first publicly suggested this week that Mr. Biden should issue preemptive pardons.",
      "\"Trump has made it clear that he is more focused on settling personal scores than on protecting the American people or upholding the rule of law,\" he said in a statement of Trump's plan to nominate Patel to lead the FBI.",
      "In addition to issuing preemptive protection to Trump's political enemies, Mr. Biden is also preparing to grant more traditional \"criminal justice pardons\" in the coming weeks for nonviolent drug offenders or others who've served time for various offensives and are often the beneficiaries of presidential pardons, according to one of the people familiar with his plans.",
      "The White House has been fielding hundreds of requests for such pardons or clemency, including from Rev. Jesse Jackson,\u00a0who this week wrote to the president asking for pardons\u00a0for his son, former Illinois Democratic congressman Jesse Jackson Jr., and his daughter-in-law, former Chicago Alderwoman Sandi Jackson. This week House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, suggested Mr. Biden should pardon \"on a case-by-case basis the working-class Americans in the federal prison system whose lives have been ruined by unjustly aggressive prosecutions for nonviolent offenses.\"",

      "The sum makes Musk, the world's richest person, the largest donor in the 2024 election cycle to either party, Federal Election Commission filings show.",
      "The bulk of Musk's spending was through his own America PAC, to which he contributed $239 million. But filings also showed that Musk was also behind a political action committee using the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's namesake \u2014 \"RBG PAC\" \u2014 in advertisements with misleading claims that Ginsburg held views on abortion that were similar to Trump's.",
      "Ginsburg's granddaughter, Clara Spera, told The New York Times in October that the PAC was an \"affront to her grandmother's legacy,\" and it was \"nothing short of appalling\" that Ginsburg's name was being used to support Trump's reelection campaign. Ginsburg openly supported abortion rights, whereas Trump put three conservative justices on the Supreme Court who were part of the majority opinion in the case striking down the federal right to an abortion.",
      "Musk put $20.5 million into the PAC, the only contribution it received. The group ran advertisements emphasizing Trump's statements that he would veto a national abortion ban if elected, and pointing to Ginsburg's statements that the decision in Roe v. Wade went too far.",
      "Musk also donated $10 million to the Senate Leadership Fund, which supports Republican Senate candidates, and $3 million to the MAHA Alliance PAC, a group affiliated with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" message.",
      "Through the America PAC, his main campaign vehicle, Musk and a handful of other donors funded a get-out-the-vote effort through door-knocking, texting, phone calls, mailers and advertisements.",
      "By far, America PAC's biggest expense was a $40.5 million payment to United States of America, Inc, a company registered last month with an address associated with Musk. It's unclear how exactly those funds were used.",
      "In October, Musk also pledged to give away $1 million a day to a registered voter in Pennsylvania who signed his petition. The sweepstakes were challenged in court, but a judge ruled that they could proceed. Musk's lawyers said the winners were not chosen by chance, but instead based on their personal stories, and the funds were part of a contract they signed to become spokespeople for his America PAC. Musk is now facing multiple lawsuits from participants who claim it was falsely billed as a lottery.",
      "He rose as a major political donor rapidly. In March, he posted on X, the social media platform Musk owns, that he would not donate to either presidential candidate. And then on July 3, he made his first contribution of $5 million to America PAC. Ten days later, he publicly announced his endorsement of Trump and quickly became a key figure in the former president's campaign.",
      "At a rally Musk held in Pennsylvania for Trump on Oct. 20, he reiterated a message featured in many of his X posts.",
      "\"This is the most important election in your lifetime,\" he said. \"If there's any election where you ever vote, it should be this one.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 12:01:03 -0500",
    "summary": "The group Students for Fair Admissions challenged the U.S. Naval Academy's use of race in its admissions program.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal district court on Friday upheld the U.S. Naval Academy's race-conscious admissions policies, rejecting a challenge brought by the group Students for Fair Admissions following the Supreme Court's landmark decision ending affirmative action in higher education.",
      "U.S. Senior District Judge Richard Bennett wrote in a 179-page decision that the Naval Academy \"established a compelling national security interest in a diverse officer corps\" for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, and tied its use of race in admissions to \"the realization of an officer corps that represents the country it protects and the people it leads.\"",
      "Bennett said the academy's race-conscious admissions policy must receive deference extended to military judgments, which he said are set by the president and not the federal judiciary.",
      "\"The Naval Academy's race-conscious admissions policies are narrowly tailored to further a compelling governmental interest in national security,\" he wrote. \"Defendants have proven that the Naval Academy's limited use of race in admissions has increased the racial diversity of the Navy and Marine Corps, which has enhanced national security by improving the Navy and Marine Corps' unit cohesion and lethality, recruitment and retention, and domestic and international legitimacy.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Naval Academy said it is reviewing the court's decision. Edward Blum, president of Students for Fair Admissions, said the group is \"disappointed\" by the ruling and will appeal.",
      "\"It is our hope that the U.S. military academies ultimately will be compelled to follow the Supreme Court's prohibition of race in college admissions,\" he said in a statement.",
      "The challenge to the Naval Academy's admissions policies was brought by Students for Fair Admissions in October 2023, just three months after the Supreme Court ruled that race-conscious admissions policies used by colleges and universities were unconstitutional. The group was behind the cases that led the high court to reject affirmative action in higher education in June 2023.",
      "Students for Fair Admissions' lawsuit came in response to a footnote in the majority opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, which said the decision did not apply to the nation's service academies. The organization sought to expand the Supreme Court's affirmative action ruling to include the Naval Academy, based in Annapolis, Maryland, and the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York, which it separately sued in September 2023.",
      "Students for Fair Admissions had argued that the Naval Academy's admissions process was unconstitutional because it discriminated based on race. But the service academy argued that a racially diverse officer corps is necessary to execute the Navy's mission and provide national security.",
      "The court held a nine-day trial in September, which included testimony from 18 witnesses.",
      "\"The evidence in this case clearly indicates that the Naval Academy does not employ quotas, admit candidates based solely on their race or ethnicity, or place minority candidates on separate admissions tracks,\" Bennett, who served over 20 years in the U.S. Army Reserve and Maryland National Guard, wrote.",
      "The court found that the Naval Academy's admissions policies mandate that race be taken into consideration only in limited circumstances. In each of those instances, Bennett said, race is \"nondeterminative\" and is one of several factors used to assess an applicant's potential as a midshipman and eventual officer in the Navy or Marine Corps.",
      "Additionally, the court found that the Naval Academy has implemented \"extensive race-neutral factors\" within and outside of its admissions policies in an effort to achieve diversity, such as socioeconomic factors, whether an applicant has faced adversity or if a candidate is a first-generation college student. The court also highlighted the academy's recruiting and outreach efforts, which it said are \"extensive and multifaceted.\"",
      "\"The Naval Academy has established a compelling national security interest in a diverse officer corps in the Navy and Marine Corps. Furthermore, that interest is indeed measurable, and the Academy's admissions program is narrowly tailored to meet that interest,\" Bennett wrote. \"In short, this court defers to the executive branch with respect to military personnel decisions.\"",
      "The Naval Academy typically receives between 14,000 and 16,000 applicants and admits roughly 1,000 midshipmen each year. Those students then enter the Navy or Marine Corps officer corps for a five-year commitment after graduating. The admissions process is rigorous \u2014 in addition to submitting SAT or ACT results, a high school transcript and personal information, prospective students must also participate in an interview and receive a nomination from a member of Congress, the vice president, president or secretary of the Navy. Applicants must also pass a physical exam performed by a Defense Department review board.",

    "summary": "After losing his bid for vice president on the Democratic ticket this November, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he is not ruling out running for a third term in the state's top office.",
    "story": [
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. \u2014 After losing his bid for vice president on the Democratic ticket this November, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he is not ruling out running for a third term in the state's top office.",
      "\"I've always said the decision to do that is really driven more by the people as they start to see if there's a desire in the direction we're going. If we see the support is there, then I would listen,\" Walz said in an interview Thursday, his first with WCCO since the campaign ended.",
      "Walz, who is halfway through his second term, said the decision about his political future will come sometime next year, but for now he is focused on the legislative session that begins in January. The make-up of the capitol will look different: A tied Minnesota House between Republicans and Democrats will end the DFL trifecta of the last two years, which saw passage of an onslaught of progressive policy wins like paid family leave, gun safety measures, legalized cannabis, abortion rights and more.",
      "That means Minnesota is back to divided government, a defining feature of his first term in office. He pledged to work with Republicans to pass the next budget, which is the big task on the to-do list next year.",
      "And the state faces a bleak financial outlook in future years. State budget prognosticators said that the state is spending more money than revenues it's taking in, which could lead to a $5 billion deficit.",
      "\"I would also make the case that our political climate is not as damaged as the national [climate] yet. I think it's still there. And look, I'm not naive, but we proved it in 2019. We were still able to get some things out,\" Walz said. \"So I think coming back now into a climate that looks like we're going to get a split House gives us an opportunity to kind of prove to the country again that we can get stuff done.\"",
      "Minnesota doesn't have term limits for governor, but If Walz were to run again, it would be notable. Democrat Rudy Perpich is the only Minnesota governor in modern history who has served three terms, though they weren't consecutive. Former Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty\u00a0tried unsuccessfully for a third term in 2018.",
      "Reflecting on the '24 campaign, Walz says he needs to \"learn more about America\"",
      "Walz's track record as governor is part of the reason Vice President Kamala Harris chose the former school teacher-turned-politician\u00a0to be her running mate. In reflecting on his time as the vice presidential nominee, Walz said he was proud of the campaign and that it was a privilege to travel across the country to make the case to voters.",
      "But he fell short.",
      "\"I think what we have to understand is the mood where people are at and understanding where they're at. I think economic issues did impact them,\" Walz told WCCO. \"I think we're going to have to understand \u2014 what type of leadership do they want? We were pledging to be inclusive. We were pledging to bring people in. Donald Trump has said that that isn't what he wants, and so if that's what America is leaning towards, I guess for me, it's to understand and learn more about America because I thought that they were going to probably move towards a more positive message.\"",
      "The Democratic Party is having a reckoning in the wake of defeat\u00a0\u2014 not only for the White House but also in Congress, where Republicans will control both chambers. Walz said his biggest lesson in losing was to listen more and for Democrats to think about how they are communicating their message.",
      "Support among working-class people propelled President-elect Donald Trump to victory. He acknowledged those trends.",
      "\"I think we're gonna have to figure out, are we communicating \u2014 I think we're communicating the right way, but are we communicating in the right spaces? Are we communicating to where people are at and where they're listening to?\" Walz said. \"To have Donald Trump seen as a champion of the middle class, I fully don't see how that would happen, but I recognize that's where people voted. So I think we have to both decide, is the message the right one?\"",
      "California is \"Trump-proofing\" its policies. Will Minnesota do the same?",
      "Democrats in California \u2014 with supermajorities in the state legislature and control of the governor's office \u2014 are in a special session to fund the attorney general's office so it's prepared to \"Trump-proof\" the state.",
      "Minnesota's political balance in St. Paul is vastly different and it's highly unlikely Republicans who will share power in the House will agree to do something similar to California. But Walz said he is contemplating what it would look like if Trump acts on some of his promises, like eliminating the Department of Education\u00a0and\u00a0clawing back money unspent for climate initiatives.",
      "Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a fellow Democrat, also told Axios he\u00a0is prepared to take legal action, as he has before with other Democratic-led states, against the incoming administration.",
      "\"I'm asking my agencies to understand what would it mean if Donald Trump does follow through with these things that he said he was going to do. What would that look like for us here, and how would we be able to respond?\" Walz told WCCO.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 00:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump wants former lawmaker and auctioneer Billy Long to replace IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he wants ex-congressman Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri and a former auctioneer, to run the IRS. As a lawmaker, Long co-sponsored legislation that aimed to wipe out much of the tax code.",
      "In making the announcement, Trump praised Long's \"32 years of experience running his own businesses in Real Estate and, as one of the premier Auctioneers in the Country.\" He also noted that since leaving Congress in 2023, Long has worked as a business and tax adviser.",
      "While Trump didn't mention the current IRS Commissioner, Danny Werfel, in his announcement, the decision signals the president-elect is likely to replace him with Long after taking office in January, Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Naming Long as the next IRS chief drew both support from conservatives as well as criticism from the left, with Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia who serves on the House Ways and Means Tax subcommittee calling it a \"terrible mistake,\" while Idaho Republican Senator Mike Crapo issued a statement saying he's looking forward to hearing Long's ideas for the tax agency. The fiscally conservative National Taxpayers Union Foundation praised Trump's choice, saying Long could help reform the IRS.",
      "Long has recently served as a tax adviser to businesses seeking to employ a controversial tax credit, but, unlike prior IRS commissioners, his background is largely outside of the tax industry, experts noted.",
      "\"This guy is an auctioneer \u2014 that's his expertise,\" Owens noted. \"This is an incredibly unserious choice.\"",
      "Werfel, who was appointed by President Biden, stepped into the role in 2023, with his term set to expire in 2027. Typically, presidents allow IRS commissioners to serve out their term, as Mr. Biden allowed Trump's former IRS appointee, Charles Rettig, to do before naming Werfel to the role.",
      "If the Senate approves his appointment to the IRS, Long would oversee an agency with 85,000 employees and an annual budget exceeding $12 billion.",
      "A spokesperson for the Trump campaign declined to comment.",
      "Here's what to know about Long and the IRS.",
      "Who is Billy Long?",
      "Long, who attended the University of Missouri but didn't graduate, described himself on a\u00a0website\u00a0for his congressional run as a \"fourth-generation native of Southwest Missouri.\" He touted his skills as an auctioneer, noting that he had been named the \"best auctioneer in the Ozarks for seven years in a row.\"",
      "Long also worked in real estate and in talk radio, hosting a show on a Missouri AM radio station.",
      "He shuttered his auction firm, Billy Long Auctions, before he was sworn into Congress in 2011, according to a local publication.",
      "What professional experience does Long have with taxes?",
      "As a congressman, Long co-sponsored some tax-related bills, including several efforts to eliminate the estate tax as well as a measure called the Tax Code Termination Act.",
      "That legislation would have wiped out much of the current tax code, replacing it with what the bill called a \"simple and fair system\" that would have applied \"a low rate to all Americans.\" Such flat taxes are considered regressive by many experts because low- and middle-income taxpayers would end up paying a larger share of their incomes than would wealthy Americans.",
      "\"As a business owner, Billy knows first-hand how government regulation and heavy taxes can affect the small businesses that serve as the economic engine of our country,\" his campaign site noted.",
      "While Long isn't an accountant or CPA, he has been involved in tax advising since leaving Congress. In a 2023 podcast, for example, he touted his work helping businesses use the Employee Retention Tax Credit, a credit that the IRS has\u00a0flagged for its high rate of fraud.",
      "In the podcast, Long also said that when he served as a congressman, he helped make the ERTC easier for businesses to claim, noting that the credit was difficult to qualify for during its first iteration.",
      "\"We went from having to say COVID adversely affected your business definitely, to taking that away, and you don't have to prove that you had any downturn,\" he said. \"We're doing recoveries for folks that had their best two years ever during COVID.\"",
      "The IRS says the ERTC is aimed at employers who paid wages to workers between March 12, 2020, and January 1, 2022, and that were either suspended by government order during the pandemic or experienced a \"required decline in gross receipts during 2020 or the first three calendar quarters of 2021.\" The credit is also available to startups that began at the end of 2021 and had less than $1 million in revenue.",
      "How does Long's experience compare with prior IRS commissioners?",
      "Long's lack of tax industry experience sets him apart from other recent IRS commissioners.",
      "Werfel, the current IRS chief, has an undergraduate degree from Cornell University and a master's degree in public policy from Duke University as well as a law degree from the University of North Carolina. He's also held a number of government jobs involved in operations and the IRS, including serving as acting commissioner of the IRS from May to December 2013, according to his biography.",
      "Werfel's predecessor, Charles Rettig, who was appointed by President-elect Trump, also held several degrees, including a master's in taxation. Before joining the IRS, Rettig worked as a tax attorney for more than three decades and served as the chairman of the IRS Advisory Council.",
      "What is happening with the IRS now?",
      "Under Werfel, the IRS has expanded audits of wealthy taxpayers and big corporations, clawing back billions in unpaid taxes, efforts that were funded by the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "The tax agency has also reduced the time it takes consumers to connect with an IRS employee, while also rolling out a free tax filing system called Direct File.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have pushed back against the expanded IRS funding, claiming\u00a0the agency would use the money to hire thousands of new agents to increase audits on middle-class taxpayers.",
      "The Treasury had said that funding could help the IRS add nearly 87,000 full-time workers over 10 years, but the agency didn't specify whether those new workers would be auditors, customer service workers or other types of employees. That figure also represented the total number of employees that could be hired, without calculating the impact of the number of IRS workers who are expected to retire or leave the department over the next several years.",
      "Some Democratic lawmakers are expressing concern that, if appointed, Long could disrupt the progress that the IRS has made under Werfel.",
      "Werfel \"has done an excellent job rebuilding the IRS, boosting customer service and enhancing enforcement aimed at wealthy tax evaders,\" Rep. Beyer said in a statement. \"Removing him will clearly signal Trump's intention to make the agency less responsive to the American people, while giving a green light to wealthy tax cheats to evade their fair share of the tax burden.\"",
      "Still, Republican lawmakers expressed support for the pick, such as Senator Crapo, who highlighted \"privacy and security\" issues at the IRS and \"inefficient use of resources.\" He added, \"I look forward to learning more about Mr. Long's vision for the agency.\"",

      "\"As we celebrate our final holiday season here in the White House, we are guided by the values that we hold sacred: faith, family, and service to our country, kindness toward all of our neighbors, and the power of community,\" she said.",
      "It takes over 300 volunteers from across the country along with about 9,810 feet of ribbon, 28,125 ornaments and 2,200 paper doves to deck the halls of the White House.",
      "The White House expects to welcome over 100,000 visitors during the holiday season. The first lady on Tuesday welcomed families of National Guard members to be the first to view the decorations. Upon arrival, visitors will see a Christmas tree dedicated to Gold Star families with six stacked stars representing all six branches of the military. Down the East Colonnade guests will be surrounded by bells \"symbolizing the peaceful sounds of the holiday season.\" In the East Room, a reflective canopy twinkles next to the chandeliers like snowfall as two large Christmas trees guard the main door.",
      "The first known Christmas tree inside the White House was in 1889 during the Benjamin Harrison administration, according to the White House. It was a much smaller affair with only a Christmas tree in the Second Floor Oval Room decorated with candles by President Harrison's grandchildren.",
      "The annual gingerbread White House manages to combine 25 sheets of gingerbread dough, 10 sheets of sugar cookie dough, 65 pounds of pastillage, 45 pounds of chocolate, 50 pounds of royal icing, and 10 pounds of gum paste into the form of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.",
      "Volunteers who bring the decorations to life",
      "Alisa Cooper de Uribe, a first-grade bilingual teacher at the New Mexico International School in Albuquerque and the 2021 New Mexico Teacher of the Year, was one of the volunteers who assembled the thousands of doves. She traveled to Washington, D.C., with her family to be part of the White House decorations team.",
      "\"It's a sisterhood, a brotherhood. It was a very collegial atmosphere,\" Cooper de Uribe told CBS News. \"And that was one of the things that I was really impressed by was how so many people who were gathered together without any knowledge of each other before, how well these people work together.\"",
      "The holiday volunteers are teachers, military families, nurses, and small business owners from across the country who all apply before being selected for decor duty. Bright and early the day after Thanksgiving, the volunteers arrived at the White House to begin full days of glitter and garland before the first lady unveiled all their work. The Office of the First Lady sent out special invitations to State Teachers of the Year winners like de Uribe to join the holiday volunteer tradition. Some volunteers formed text chains and Facebook groups, intending to keep in touch long after the ornaments are taken down.",
      "Centerpiece of the holiday decor",
      "The centerpiece of the holiday decor inside the Blue Room is a 18 \u00bd foot Fraser Fir that traveled from the Cartner Family of Cartner's Christmas Tree Farm in North Carolina. The tree was one of the survivors as thousands of others were devastated when Hurricane Helene hit the Blue Ridge Mountains. The owners named it \"Tremendous\" as a tribute to the resilience of North Carolina communities affected by Hurricane Helene.",
      "In the state dining room, there are ornaments on the Christmas tree that feature self-portraits of students, including four of de Uribe's first graders.",
      "\"It was an opportunity for the students to see themselves reflected in the White House and in this season, and that it's their place, and it's their opportunity to have their individual and unique selves and their culture shine out through their portraits,\" de Uribe said.",

    "story": [
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders praised Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s message on food issues Thursday, and said he had not made up his mind on whether he would oppose President-elect Donald Trump's pick of Kennedy to head the nation's health agencies.",
      "In an interview with CBS News correspondent Natalie Brand, the independent Vermont senator said that he feared some of Kennedy's views on health issues are \"extremely dangerous,\" criticizing Kennedy's call to pull fluoride out of U.S. water supply systems and his \"very wrong\" views on vaccines.",
      "But the Vermont independent also said he might be able to find common ground on working with Kennedy, echoing his criticism of the influence the food industry has in Washington.",
      "\"I think what he's saying about the food industry is exactly correct. I think you have a food industry concerned about their profits, could care less about the health of the American people. I think they have to be taken on,\" Sanders told Brand.",
      "Sanders, who currently serves as chair of the Senate's health committee, said he had last spoken to Kennedy years ago. He said he was looking forward to sitting down and talking with Trump's picks to head other health agencies who would report to Kennedy.",
      "\"Trump over the years, and Kennedy himself, has talked about as a health problem, the fact that we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. And if I'm not mistaken, Kennedy has talked about the need for Americans not to pay more than the people in other countries. I think that's exactly right,\" he said.",
      "Sanders spoke with Brand after a hearing where he blasted the Biden administration's Food and Drug Administration officials for falling short on addressing America's \"horrific epidemic\" of obesity and diabetes.",
      "\"Do I think the FDA has brought forth the kind of urgency that is needed to address this crisis? No, I don't. That's the point I tried to make today,\" Sanders said.",
      "Sanders' position on Kennedy drew a sharp contrast with Sen. Ed Markey, who also sits on the committee.",
      "\"Some would say what he says on diet and importance of healthy foods is reasonable. However, one reasonable opinion does not qualify someone to run the United States Department of Health and Human Services,\" the Massachusetts Democrat had said during the hearing.",
      "When asked, Sanders declined to respond to Markey's comments.",
      "\"We are several decades behind\"",
      "At the hearing, FDA officials defended the agency's work on food issues, turning many criticisms of the agency back at lawmakers for falling short of the Biden administration's budget requests on issues like reviewing the safety of chemicals added to foods.",
      "\"We are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts, because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized at some point in the past. We don't, but we are going to undertake it. But we are going to definitely struggle with the resources necessary to do that,\" said Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods.",
      "FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf also warned the agency was facing an increasingly steep battle pushing through new rules, like long-stalled efforts to move forward a new \"healthy\" standard and nutrition labels that would go on the front of food packages, as well as crack down on cigarettes.",
      "\"Given the current state of judicial affairs, First Amendment rights, the fact that corporations have the same rights as individuals, every little thing we do, unless specifically in detail instructed by Congress, it's not just that we lose in court, but we lose years,\" Califf said.",
      "One long-awaited change that could see movement soon is a ban on the food dye\u00a0Red No. 3, which advocacy groups have petitioned for. California moved last year to be the first state to ban the food dye on its own over health concerns.",
      "\"We are hopeful that, within the next few weeks, we will be acting on that petition and a decision should be forthcoming,\" said Jones.",
      "In a clash with Califf, Sanders urged Califf to call out the \"food and beverage industry, whose greed is destroying the health of millions of people\" for their role in slowing the progress of the agency's food policies.",
      "Califf told the committee that the agency was facing \"direct opposition from powerful industry forces\" on issues like food chemical safety, but also refused to \"castigate the people that work in the food and beverage industry.\"",
      "\"We have an industry that if you tried to change it overnight, there are farmers all over the United States who would not be able to grow the crops they're currently growing. So there needs to be a plan and it needs to be implemented in a mature thoughtful way across the country,\" said Califf.",

    "story": [
      "The federal Bureau of Prisons is permanently closing the notorious \"rape club\" women's prison in Dublin, Califorina, and will idle six facilities in a sweeping realignment after years of abuse, decay and mismanagement.",
      "The agency informed employees and Congress on Thursday through a notification that it plans to shutter the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin that has been the focus of controversy for a number of years. The bureau is additionally deactivating multiple minimum-security prison camps in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Colorado, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Florida.",
      "The agency said staff and inmates at the impacted locations will be moved to other facilities.",
      "The document issued by the Bureau of Prisons said it was taking \"decisive and strategic action\" to address \"significant challenges, including a critical staffing shortage, crumbling infrastructure and limited budgetary resources.\" The agency said it is not downsizing and is committed to finding positions for every affected employee.",
      "The closures are a striking coda to the Biden administration's stewardship of the Justice Department's biggest agency. After repeatedly promising to reform FCI Dublin and other troubled facilities, Bureau of Prisons Director Colette Peters is pivoting to closures and consolidation, citing inadequate staffing and staggering costs to repair aging infrastructure.",
      "The permanent shutdown of FCI Dublin, just east of San Francisco, comes seven months after\u00a0a temporary closure was announced following reform attempts\u00a0in the wake of staff-on-inmate abuse that led to the \"rape club\" moniker. At the time, it appeared the agency was set on closing the low-security prison, but officials held out the possibility that it could be repaired and reopened for a different purpose, such as housing male inmates.",
      "The assessment identified considerable repairs necessary to reopen the FCI Dublin, the agency said. Low staffing, exacerbated by the high cost of living in the Bay Area, also contributed to the decision to close the facility, the agency said.",
      "\"We understand the impact the closure will have on our employees and are committed to ensuring all are able to continue accomplishing the agency's mission at other locations,\" the statement read.",
      "The prison has been at the center of a\u00a0years-long investigation. Since 2021, at least eight employees, including a former warden, have been charged with sexually abusing inmates.",
      "Five employees have pleaded guilty. Two were convicted at trial, including former warden Ray Garcia. The case against the eighth employee is pending.",
      "At the time of the closure announcement, FCI Dublin was housing about 600 inmates.",
      "The move comes three years after the agency closed its troubled New York jail in Manhattan after myriad problems came to light in the wake of Jeffrey Epstein's suicide there, including lax security, staffing shortages and squalid, unsafe conditions such as falling concrete and busted cells.",
      "The Bureau of Prisons and the correctional workers union have repeatedly pushed for additional federal prison funding, highlighting what they say is an inadequate amount of money to address pay increases, staff retention and a multibillion-dollar repair backlog. More than half of federal prison facilities were built before 1991 and many are becoming outmoded or obsolete, the agency said.",
      "The agency said it expects that reassigning employees to remaining facilities will boost retention and cut down on mandatory overtime and augmentation, a practice by which cooks, teachers, nurses and other prison workers are assigned to guard inmates.",
      "FCI Dublin's permanent closure represents an extraordinary acknowledgement by the Bureau of Prisons that it has failed to fix the facility's culture and environment in the wake of AP reporting that exposed rampant sexual abuse within its walls. Hundreds of people who were incarcerated at FCI Dublin are suing the agency, seeking reforms and monetary compensation for mistreatment at the facility.",
      "The closures at FCI Dublin and across the federal prison system come amid an AP investigation that has uncovered deep, previously unreported flaws within the Bureau of Prisons. AP reporting has disclosed widespread criminal activity by employees, dozens of escapes, chronic violence, deaths and severe staffing shortages that have hampered responses to emergencies, including assaults and suicides.",
      "In July, President Joe Biden signed a law strengthening oversight of the agency after AP reporting spotlighted its many flaws.",

      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans on Thursday blocked two Democratic resolutions that would have compelled the House Ethics Committee to release a potentially damaging report on its investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz, voting to refer the matter back to the committee.",
      "Democratic Reps. Sean Casten of Illinois and Steve Cohen of Tennessee introduced twin privileged resolutions, forcing floor action within two legislative days. In a 206 to 198 vote, all but one Republican voted to refer Casten's resolution back to the Ethics Committee. Cohen's resolution met the same fate in a 204 to 198 vote, with one Republican voting with Democrats. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock of California was the only member to cross party lines.",
      "In a statement, Casten accused his Republican colleagues of voting \"to sweep these allegations under the rug and set an unfortunate precedent.\" He said he would continue to pursue the report's release.",
      "The votes came after President-elect Donald Trump announced last month that he intended to nominate Gaetz for attorney general, prompting intense scrutiny over the Florida Republican's background and the House Ethics Committee's investigation into allegations that Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Gaetz, who has denied the allegations, withdrew from consideration for the attorney general nomination a little over a week after Trump made the announcement.",
      "Gaetz immediately resigned from Congress after Trump announced he wanted the Florida Republican to join his Cabinet. The timing of his resignation came days before the House panel was set to vote on releasing its report on Gaetz.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, urged the committee to keep the report secret, arguing that a former member is beyond the panel's jurisdiction and it would set a \"terrible precedent.\"",
      "\"I believe it is very important to maintain the House's tradition of not issuing ethics reports on people who are no longer members of Congress,\" he said on Nov. 15. \"The House Ethics Committee's jurisdiction is over sitting members of Congress. That's an important rule.\"",
      "Casten's resolution cited four instances in which the Ethics Committee has released reports on its investigations into members after they've resigned.",
      "The bipartisan committee met Nov. 20 to consider whether to release the report, but was evenly split along party lines about how to move forward. A day later, Gaetz withdrew himself from consideration, facing a tenuous path to Senate confirmation. There was growing interest from senators on both sides of the aisle in seeing the report before a confirmation vote.",
      "The House Ethics Committee met again Thursday to discuss its investigation into allegations against Gaetz.

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 14:39:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Judge Reed O'Connor took issue with both a lack of judicial oversight and certain diversity requirements included in the deal's independent monitoring process.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Texas rejected a proposed plea agreement between the Justice Department and Boeing that would have settled the U.S. government's claims against the company, after crashes of two 737 Max jetliners that killed 346 people, according to a court order issued Thursday.",
      "In his ruling, Judge Reed O'Connor took issue with both a lack of judicial oversight and certain diversity requirements included in the deal's independent monitoring process and ordered the parties to provide the court with a plan for possible ways forward early next month.",
      "The federal government's proposed agreement with airplane manufacturing giant over the deadly crashes included various provisions, including an admission of guilt to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and a $243.6 million fine \u2014 much less than the billions the families of the victims had requested. The deal would also have required Boeing to spend $455 million on safety programs and to work with an independent monitor who would oversee the company's progress.",
      "Investigators alleged in court records that leading up to the crashes, Boeing deceived federal officials who regulated the planes. In 2021, Boeing and the Justice Department entered into a deferred prosecution agreement, which meant the criminal charge would have been dropped if Boeing had complied with the terms of the deal. But earlier this year, federal prosecutors informed the court that Boeing had not followed through on all of the requirements and intended to move forward with the case.",
      "By July, after weeks of negotiations, Boeing and the Justice Department settled on the proposed plea agreement, prompting an outcry from families of those who died in the crashes. At the time, CBS News reported the deal only covered wrongdoing by Boeing tied to the crashes and did not give the company immunity for other incidents, including a door panel that blew off a Max jetliner during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. According to a Justice Department official, the proposed agreement also did not cover any current or former Boeing officials, only the corporation.",
      "Attorneys for some of the victims' families opposed the deal, arguing the \"rotten\" agreement with the government did not justly remedy the families' claims against Boeing. In court filings, they accused Boeing of more criminality and urged stricter penalties, harsher monitoring and recognition of the lives lost.",
      "In rejecting the plea agreement, the judge took aim at diversity, equity and inclusion considerations that the parties said they would take when hiring an independent monitor. He wrote that he was \"concerned with the Government's shifting and contradictory explanations of how the plea agreement's diversity-and-inclusion provision will practically operate in this case.\"",
      "Judge O'Connor had previously raised this issue and in responsive court filings, the Justice Department defended the language, arguing it predated the Boeing agreement. \"This new language reflected not a change in policy but rather a principle that has always governed the process: that selection of a monitor must be based solely on merit, from the broadest possible pool of qualified candidates,\" they said.",
      "O'Connor ruled Thursday that the language was inappropriate: \"In a case of this magnitude, it is in the utmost interest of justice that the public is confident this monitor selection is done based solely on competency. The parties' DEI efforts only serve to undermine this confidence in the Government and Boeing's ethics and anti-fraud efforts.\"",
      "The judge also wrote that the Justice Department's previous efforts to oversee Boeing's conduct \"failed\" and said the independent monitor provision in the proposed deal did not go far enough to include the court in the process.",
      "\"At this point, the public interest requires the Court to step in. Marginalizing the Court in the selection and monitoring of the independent monitor as the plea agreement does undermines public confidence in Boeing's probation, fails to promote respect for the law, and is therefore not in the public interest,\" O'Connor wrote, \"Accordingly, the Court cannot accept the plea agreement.\"",
      "The Justice Department said it's reviewing the decision. Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "In a statement, Paul Cassell, an attorney for some of the victims' families, told CBS News, \"Judge O'Connor has recognized that this was a cozy deal between the Government and Boeing that failed to focus on the overriding concerns \u2013 holding Boeing accountable for its deadly crime and ensuring that nothing like this happens again in the future.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who President-elect Donald Trump tapped to lead the newly coined Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, are meeting with lawmakers Thursday as they seek to build support for the cost-cutting initiative.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson is hosting Musk and Ramaswamy on Capitol Hill to discuss ideas for reform with lawmakers, after Trump announced that the Tesla CEO and entrepreneur would spearhead the effort last month. The president-elect outlined that the two men would \"pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.\"",
      "Johnson said in remarks to reporters ahead of the meeting that during a \"historic moment\" for the country, the two men \"are going to help navigate through this exciting new day,\" calling them \"innovators\" and \"forward thinkers.\"",
      "\"We have long lamented the size and scope of the government, that it has grown too large,\" Johnson said. \"Government is too big, it does too many things and it does almost nothing well. And the taxpayers deserve better.\"",
      "The speaker outlined that Musk and Ramaswamy were first meeting for a \"brainstorming session\" with decision-makers in Congress, including chairs of relevant committees and the leaders of the DOGE caucuses in the House and Senate. He said that the two men were set to meet with lawmakers more broadly later in the day.",
      "\"We need to make government more efficient and that is what this whole objective is,\" Johnson said, adding that it would be a bicameral effort with bipartisan support.",
      "Last month, GOP Reps. Aaron Bean of Florida and Pete Sessions of Texas started the DOGE caucus in the House, while Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa launched its counterpart in the Senate. Ernst touted the effort on Fox News last week, noting that she has a decade-long track record on waste projects that she's bringing to the initiative.",
      "\"We look forward to working with the caucus and making sure that DOGE is successful,\" Ernst said.",
      "In recent days, some Democrats have said they will join or expressed interest in the caucus as well. Rep. Jared Moskowitz, a Florida Democrat, told reporters Wednesday that he's \"not afraid of having the conversation,\" saying that \"staying in a safe space and not having the conversation isn't going to help anybody.\"",
      "\"I think Democrats should embrace government efficiency,\" Moskowitz said, after becoming the first in his party to join the caucus. \"That doesn't mean that we're going to start cutting services, but I think it can be more efficient.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, told reporters on Thursday that she'd be willing to work with Musk if he \"wants to change government contracting to cut billions of dollars of waste out of the Pentagon budget.\"",
      "\"We're here to do work on behalf of the American people,\" Warren said. \"And if that means working with Elon Musk, I'm ready. And if it means fighting Elon Musk, I'm ready for that, too.\"",
      "Still, the DOGE initiative, with a meme-inspired acronym, has prompted operational questions, including what authority it will have to cut spending, which is authorized by Congress, and what spending it would target.",
      "Musk and Ramawsamy outlined that they are aiming to cut $500 billion in annual spending. But around two-thirds of federal spending is mandatory, while large portions of discretionary spending goes to defense. Among the areas the two men said they intended to target for cuts are The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, International organizations that receive grants and entities like Planned Parenthood. Musk and Ramaswamy have also outlined a plan to reduce the number of federal employees.",
      "Ramaswamy came into the Trump orbit after initially running against him in the presidential primary. Meanwhile, Musk, the world's richest person, became a major part of Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, even offering ahead of the election to give $1 million a day to sign his political action committee's petition backing the Constitution.

    "summary": "French Prime Minister Michel Barnier is resigning after a no-confidence vote by lawmakers, fueling concern over a \"new era of political instability.\"",
    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French Prime Minister Michel Barnier on Thursday was meeting Emmanuel Macron to submit his resignation after losing a vote of no confidence in parliament, with the president urgently seeking ways to halt growing political and financial chaos. Poised to be contemporary France's shortest-serving premier, Barnier arrived at the Elysee Palace just after 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. Eastern) for the resignation formality, with the outgoing premier and government constitutionally obliged to step down after the defeat in parliament.",
      "A majority of lawmakers supported the no-confidence vote Wednesday that was proposed by the hard-left and backed by the far-right, headed by Marine Le Pen.",
      "Barnier's record-quick ejection comes after snap parliamentary elections this summer that resulted in a hung parliament, with no political force able to form an overall majority and the far-right holding the key to the government's survival.",
      "The trigger for Barnier's ouster was his 2025 budget plan including austerity measures that were unacceptable to a majority in parliament, but that he argued were necessary to stabilize France's finances. On Monday he had forced through a social security financing bill without a vote.",
      "The successful no-confidence motion cancelled the government's entire financing plan, leading to an automatic renewal of the current budget into next year, unless any new government can somehow rush through approval of a new budget by Christmas \u2014 an unlikely scenario.",
      "\"France probably won't have a 2025 budget,\" said ING Economics in a note, predicting that the country \"is entering a new era of political instability.\"",
      "Moody's, a ratings agency, warned that Barnier's fall \"deepens the country's political stalemate\" and \"reduces the probability of a consolidation of public finances.\"",
      "The Paris stock exchange fell at the opening on Thursday before recovering to show small gains, while the yields on French government bonds were again under upward pressure in debt markets.",
      "Macron now has the unenviable task of picking a viable successor. The president was to address the nation Thursday evening, his office said. Macron has more than two years of his presidential term left, but some opponents are calling on him to resign, too.",
      "National Assembly Speaker Yael Braun-Pivet on Thursday urged Macron to waste no time in choosing a new premier, saying France could not be allowed to \"drift\" for any length of time.",
      "There was no indication early Thursday of how quickly Macron would appoint Barnier's successor, nor what their political leanings might be.",
      "Loyalist Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu and Macron's centrist ally Francois Bayrou have been touted as possible contenders, as has former Socialist premier and interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve.",
      "With the support of the far-right, a majority of 331 MPs in the 577-member chamber voted to oust the government on Wednesday night. It was the first successful no-confidence vote since a defeat for Georges Pompidou's government in 1962, when Charles de Gaulle was president.",
      "Macron flew back into Paris just ahead of the vote after wrapping up a three-day state visit to Saudi Arabia, an apparent world away from the domestic crisis.",
      "\"We are now calling on Macron to go,\" Mathilde Panot, head of the parliamentary faction of the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party, told reporters. She urged \"early presidential elections\" to solve the deepening political crisis.",
      "But taking care not to crow over the government's fall, Le Pen said in a television interview that her party \u2014 once a new premier is appointed \u2014 \"would let them work\" and help create a \"budget that is acceptable for everyone.\"",
      "Laurent Wauquiez, the head of right-wing deputies in parliament, said the far-right and hard-left bore the responsibility for a no-confidence vote.",
      "Barnier is the fifth prime minister to serve under Macron since he came to power in 2017, with every premier serving a successively shorter period.",
      "Given the composition of the National Assembly, there is no guarantee that Barnier's successor will last any longer.",
      "Strike calls across transport, education and other public sector services were kept in place Thursday despite the disappearance of the austerity budget that has prompted so much anger.",
      "The plunge into more uncertainty comes ahead of the reopening of the Notre-Dame cathedral on Saturday after a 2019 fire, a major international event hosted by Macron.",
      "Guests include Donald Trump, who will make it his first foreign trip since being re-elected to serve as the U.S. president for a second term.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A hearing of the bipartisan task force investigating the assassination attempts against President-elect Donald Trump devolved into a shouting match when Republican Rep. Pat Fallon accused acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe of \"playing politics\" when he attended a 9/11 memorial event with the nation's top leaders.",
      "Yelling between the two broke out after Fallon displayed a photo of Trump, President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and Vice President-elect JD Vance at the event in New York City in September. Rowe was standing directly behind Harris, then a candidate for the presidency, in the second row.",
      "\"Who is usually, at an event like this, closest to the president of the United States, security-wise?\" Fallon, of Texas, asked Rowe.",
      "\"The SAC of the detail,\" Rowe answered, referring to the special agent in charge of security. Fallon then questioned whether the acting director was serving in that role at the 9/11 memorial.",
      "Rowe did not answer directly. He said the photo did not show the special agent in charge because he was just out of the frame and told Fallon that he was at the event to show respect for Secret Service members who died on 9/11. \"That is the day where we remember the more than 3,000 that have died on 9/11,\" he said. \"I actually responded to Ground Zero. I was there going through the ashes at the World Trade Center.\"",
      "Rowe condemned Fallon, telling him, \"Do not invoke 9/11 for political purposes.\"",
      "The congressman, meanwhile, said Rowe's explanation was \"a bunch of horse hockey.\"",
      "\"Don't try to bully me,\" Fallon told Rowe. \"I am an elected member of Congress and I'm asking you a serious question and you are playing politics.\"",
      "The acting director then shouted back: \"And I am a public servant who has served this nation and spent time on our country's darkest day. Do not politicize it.\"",
      "Rowe said he was at the memorial to represent the Secret Service and said his presence did not effect protective operations.",
      "\"Do you know why you were there? Because you wanted to be visible because you're auditioning for this job that you're not going to get,\" Fallon yelled. \"You endangered President Biden's life, Vice President Harris' life because you put those agents out of position. Did you have a radio with you? Did you wear a vest? Did you have a weapon?\"",
      "Rowe repeatedly told Fallon that he was \"out of line.\"",
      "Rowe was selected to lead the Secret Service as its acting director after Kimberly Cheatle resigned in July following a disastrous appearance before the House Oversight Committee about the assassination attempt on Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. It's expected that Trump will nominate a permanent director once he takes office in late January.",
      "He appeared before the task force to answer questions about the security failures that allowed the gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, to gain access to a rooftop so close to where Trump was speaking. The president-elect and two attendees were wounded in the shooting, and one man died.",
      "\"July 13 was a failure of the Secret Service to adequately secure the Butler Farm Show site and protect President-elect Trump,\" Rowe said in an opening statement to lawmakers. \"That abject failure underscored critical gaps in Secret Service operations and I recognize that we did not meet the expectations of the American public, Congress and our protectees, and they rightly have that idea based on how we performed.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe testified Thursday before the bipartisan House task force investigating the assassination attempts against President-elect Donald Trump, saying he takes accountability for the agency's \"abject failure\" before the shooting at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania in July that sent shockwaves through the country.",
      "The panel, which the House voted to establish earlier this year, is tasked with looking into the security failures during the July 13 assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, and the foiled attempt in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Sept. 15. The lawmakers will also make recommendations to prevent future attacks.",
      "The Secret Service came under intense scrutiny in the wake of the initial attack, and its director at the time, Kimberly Cheatle, resigned in July after a bruising day of testimony before the House Oversight and Accountability Committee.",
      "The hearing",
      "Rowe's testimony on Thursday marked his first public appearance before the task force, which heard testimony from local law enforcement and a former Secret Service agent at a hearing earlier this year. Rowe appeared before other congressional committees after he took control of the agency.",
      "\"July 13 was a failure of the Secret Service to adequately secure the Butler Farm Show site and protect President-elect Trump,\" Rowe said in an opening statement to lawmakers. \"That abject failure underscored critical gaps in Secret Service operations and I recognize that we did not meet the expectations of the American public, Congress and our protectees, and they rightly have that idea based on how we performed.\"",
      "Rowe said he had implemented several changes within the Secret Service, including launching an aviation unit to ensure drones are overhead at events with protectees and shifting its Office of Investigations to the Office of Field Operations. The agency should better leverage technology used by other federal departments, he said, citing the Secret Service's use of a robotic dog that walks the sea wall at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's South Florida estate.",
      "The hearing broke out into a shouting match between GOP Rep. Pat Fallon of Texas and Rowe when the congressman displayed a photo of Trump, President Biden and other U.S. leaders at a memorial event for the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks this fall.",
      "Fallon took issue with Rowe's position near Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump and Mr. Biden. Fallon accused the Secret Service chief of taking the place of the agent who was in charge of security for the event.",
      "\"Do not invoke 9/11 for political purposes!\" Rowe shouted in response, telling Fallon that he responded to Ground Zero on 9/11 and was at the event in New York City in September to pay respect to Secret Service agents who died. Rowe said his closeness to Trump, Mr. Biden, Harris and vice president-elect JD Vance did not impact protective operations.",
      "\"Do you know why you were there? Because you wanted to be visible because you're auditioning for this job,\" Fallon yelled.",
      "Task force chairman Rep. Mike Kelly, a Republican whose district includes Butler, said that every employee investigators asked to speak to was made available by the Secret Service, and said the agency chose \"a path of cooperation in pursuit of the truth.\"",
      "In the course of its probe, the panel conducted 46 interviews, participated in more than a dozen briefings with agencies, reviewed 20,000 pages of documents, and visited the incident sites in Butler and West Palm Beach, Kelly said.",
      "Among the deficiencies the panel identified during its investigation were communications and intelligence failures at the Butler rally. Kelly said investigators did not find evidence suggesting that Secret Service agents in proximity to Trump knew there was a suspicious or armed person on a rooftop close to where he was speaking.",
      "The task force's findings are in line with those from other investigations into the July 13 assassination attempt, including from an independent review panel that examined the shooting.",
      "The task force's investigation",
      "Made up of seven Republicans and six Democrats, the panel is expected to submit a report of its findings in the coming weeks. Following Thursday's hearing, the panel will hold a business meeting to consider the final report, the task force said.",
      "The task force released a 53-page interim report in October focused on the July 13 incident, deeming it \"preventable,\" while outlining communication and planning shortcomings. The investigation \"clearly shows a lack of planning and coordination between the Secret Service and its law enforcement partners,\" the task force said at the time, noting that the findings were preliminary.",
      "Trump was speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania on July 13 when a gunman opened fire, with a bullet grazing the former president's ear. Secret Service snipers shot and killed the gunman, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks.",
      "The panel outlined in the interim report that \"fragmented lines of communication\" allowed the gunman to \"evade law enforcement,\" climb onto the roof of a nearby building and fire eight shots. The report claims that \"federal, state, and local law enforcement officers could have engaged Thomas Matthew Crooks at several pivotal moments.\"",
      "The task force also alleged in the report that responsibilities were not \"effectively\" confirmed by the Secret Service with local partners ahead of the shooting. Witnesses who participated in a walkthrough of the area days before the assassination attempt called it disorganized.",
      "When the interim report was released, the panel said it had received relevant information from other House committees, conducted 23 transcribed interviews with witnesses from state and local agencies, and obtained evidence in response to three subpoenas to federal, state and local agencies. Last month, the panel also issued subpoenas to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for testimony from two ATF employees.",
      "The panel has also sought information from federal agencies regarding the Sept. 15 incident. On that day, Trump was golfing at his course in West Palm Beach when the Secret Service arrested a man with an AK-47-style weapon who was within a few hundred yards of the president-elect. The man, Ryan Wesley Routh, has been charged with attempted assassination of a political figure in addition to firearms charges.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 11:27:11 -0500",
    "summary": "A growing number of unemployed workers have been searching for a new job for more than 15 weeks, labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "The unemployment rate might be near a historic low, but it's taking longer for hundreds of thousands of out-of-work Americans to find new jobs, signaling cracks within a once-hot labor market as employers continue to cope with the impact of higher borrowing costs.",
      "About 40% of the 7 million people who were out of work in October, or roughly 2.84 million people, have been looking for work for more than 15 weeks, an increase of 20% since a year earlier, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. More than half of those job seekers have been on the hunt for new employment for more than 27 weeks, or about half a year.",
      "A drawn-out job search is increasingly common in the labor market today as companies hold off on hiring, especially in some industries such as tech and professional services, ZipRecruiter chief economist Julia Pollak told CBS MoneyWatch. It's a far cry from the heady years of 2021 and 2022, when Americans switched jobs at high rates in search of better pay and more fulfilling work, a trend termed \"The Great Resignation.\"",
      "The job market has since weakened under the strain of the Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy, with the central bank boosting borrowing rates to their highest point in 23 years to combat inflation, Pollak noted. While inflation has rapidly cooled in the past two years and the Fed began cutting rates in September, the burden of higher borrowing costs has caused consumers to pull back on buying cars and homes, impacting key sectors of the economy, Pollak said.",
      "The job market today reflects \"low hiring, low firing and low job-switching,\" Pollak noted. \"It's this 'big stay'-type of situation \u2014 it's great if you have a job you like, and it's not great if you don't have a job.\"",
      "Employers in October hired 12,000 workers, a jobs report that marked the slowest month for hiring since December 2020. As the anemic number reflects, businesses were weighed down by Hurricanes Milton and Helene as well as labor disputes such as the Boeing machinists strike.",
      "Leading up to the November 5 election, a majority of American held a\u00a0dim view of the strength of the U.S. economy, a factor partly credited with helping President-elect Donald Trump claim victory. While much of voters' anger was focused on inflation, the job market also played a role in their views, with the unemployment rate inching up from a pandemic low of 3.4%, and with some workers saying their pay\u00a0hasn't yet caught up to inflation.",
      "Since the election, though, voters' views of the economy\u00a0have improved, especially among Trump supporters, CBS News polling has found.",
      "November's jobs report",
      "On Friday, the Labor Department will release the November jobs report, with economists forecasting 207,000 new hires last month, according to financial data firm FactSet. The jobless rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%, near 50-year lows.",
      "\"The broader thread in the labor market has been a slow, gradual cooling, and the question is whether after accounting for these quirks if that will still be evident\" in Friday's data, Pollack noted, referring to businesses recovering after the storms and the labor strikes.",
      "Employers cut almost 60,000 jobs last month, an increase of 27% from a year earlier, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The automotive and tech industries had the largest numbers of layoffs last month, the group said.",
      "\"The automotive industry is currently experiencing significant challenges, including potential tariffs affecting U.S. automakers with overseas factories, intensifying competition from Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, and shifts in government subsidies for EVs,\" Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas said in a statement.",
      "The job market and interest rate cuts",
      "The slowing labor market helped sway the Federal Reserve's decision to begin cutting rates in September, which marked the central bank's\u00a0first rate cut in four years. The Fed followed with a second rate cut in November, and a majority of economists are forecasting another reduction at the central bank's December 18 meeting.",
      "According to BNP Parabas analysts, the job market may be in a period of uncertainty partly due to the election.",
      "\"In September, an Atlanta Fed/Duke University survey found that 30% of businesses were paring investment plans due to uncertainty about the then-upcoming election,\" the analysts wrote in a recent research report, noting that they are predicting another rate cut this month.",
      "They added, \"Though we suspect that pre-election uncertainty played a role in restraining hiring of late, this report (due on 6 December) may be too early to reveal a clear unlocking of previously postponed hiring. Uncertainties about tariffs, immigration and fiscal policy remain.\"",
      "Even so, some economists are paring their forecasts for the pace of the Fed's expected rate cuts in 2025, citing President-elect Trump's plans to impose tariffs, cut taxes and deport millions of illegal immigrants, which could, if enacted, reignite inflation.",

    "story": [
      "Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's embattled pick for secretary of defense, received a six-figure severance payment and signed a non-disclosure agreement when he exited the organization Concerned Veterans of America. The payment came amid allegations of financial mismanagement, repeated incidents of intoxication and sexual impropriety, as well as dissension among its leaders over Hegseth's foreign policy views.",
      "The Army veteran turned Fox News host signed a non-disclosure agreement when he stepped down as CEO in January 2016, two sources associated with Concerned Veterans of America told CBS News, with one source saying the agreement included a financial payout. The CVA sources spoke to CBS News under conditions of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss legally-binding contracts, while also fearing professional reprisal.",
      "Public tax filings reviewed by CBS News confirm that Hegseth was paid more than $172,000 between October 2016 and September 2017 \u2013 well after Hegseth's formal departure from his role as CEO of Concerned Veterans of America in January 2016.",
      "Hegseth remained listed on tax filings as a former CEO working 50 hours a week between 2016 and 2017. An archived 2016 biography on Hegseth's website described him as a Fox News contributor and host, and did not list an ongoing role with Concerned Veterans for America.",
      "In a statement to the Military Times at the time of his departure, Hegseth said he was leaving his role in the organization to focus on releasing a book and other advocacy work, while CVA said it wished him well \"in all future endeavors.\"",
      "Hegseth's attorney, Timothy Parlatore, told CBS News on Wednesday evening the payment to his client by Concerned Veterans of America was a \"standard severance package.\"",
      "\"They make EVERYONE who leaves CVA sign an NDA. It was standard for all employees. Not just Pete,\" Parlatore said.",
      "Hegseth on Wednesday pushed back on reports that Trump is considering other candidates for defense secretary. On Capitol Hill as he continued to visit Republican members of Congress, he told CBS News that he does not intend to withdraw his name from consideration. He also said he spoke with Trump Wednesday morning, and the president-elect encouraged him to keep fighting.",
      "Experts consulted by CBS News said severance payments and non-disclosure agreements for outgoing CEOs are common. Such payments are issued for a number of reasons, including to maintain professional relationships, to work as an adviser to an incoming CEO, or to provide a soft landing for departing leaders, they said.",
      "Hegseth has contested the allegation that he was forced out of his CEO position. On Dec. 4 he retweeted a letter obtained by the New York Post on X, saying: \"Read for yourself. You'll see the truth is on our side.\"",
      "The letter, written on Concerned Veterans of American letterhead in January 2016, was authored by Randy Lair, a trustee of the veterans' advocacy group.",
      "\"The truth is Pete resigned his position as CEO of Concerned Veterans of America as a result of a difference of opinion as to the future of the organization and so that he could focus on other endeavors, including, his relationship with Fox News,\" Lair wrote in part.",
      "He added: \"Pete was not terminated by the organization and, in fact, we at CVA worked with him though [sic] this difficult decision and mutually agreed the end of 2015 was the best timing for both parties\u2026The bottom line is that Pete Hegseth voluntarily resigned his position and CVA recognizes and appreciates his accomplishments as CEO.\"",
      "Sources affiliated with Concerned Veterans of America at the time of Hegseth's tenure told CBS News that there was a \"difference of opinion\" over Hegseth steering the organization toward advocacy for foreign policy views that championed military intervention. Senior leaders of the organization strongly opposed Hegseth's foreign policy advocacy over its historical mission of backing conservative fixes to the Department of Veterans Affairs.",
      "However, the sources also highlighted what Lair's letter did not mention, specifically internal assessments of Hegseth's handling of the organization's finances and the alleged incidents of intoxication and sexual misconduct, which Hegseth and Parlatore, his attorney, have denied.",
      "Hegseth's financial record at Concerned Veterans for America",
      "Hegseth led Vets for Economic Freedom Trust, operating as Concerned Veterans for America, from 2012 to 2016. Tax records show that, during three of the five years of his leadership, the organization spent more money than it raised from donations and other means.",
      "Filings for October 2012 to September 2013 show the organization brought in $3.8 million but spent $3.9 million, representing a shortfall of $130,000. Hegseth's CEO compensation is listed as $67,500.",
      "Filings for October 2013 to September 2014 show revenue swelled $15.7 million but the organization spent $16.1 million \u2014 including $8.6 million on advertising and promotion \u2014 resulting in a shortfall of $428,000. Hegseth's salary is listed as $144,894.",
      "Filings for October 2014 to September 2015 show Hegseth's salary grew to $182,549 and the organization ran a surplus for the first time since 2011, with revenue of $14.1 million and expenses of just under $14 million.",
      "However, the organization again spent more than it raised the following year, when Hegseth was listed as the outgoing CEO. Filings for October 2015 to September 2016 show the organization raised just under $16 million but spent $16.4 million, resulting in a shortfall of $437,000.",
      "The filings show expenses at the organization were slashed after Hegseth's departure. From October 2016 to September 2017, compensation, salaries and wages were reduced to $2 million, down from almost $7 million the previous year. Spending on travel was reduced to $416,000, down from almost $2.4 million, and spending on conferences, conventions and meetings amounted to $124,000, down from $2.4 million.",
      "Hegseth has denied allegations of financial mismanagement, repeated incidents of intoxication and sexual impropriety at the organization. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal published Dec. 4, Hegseth said, \"We had hundreds of employees and thousands of volunteers \u2014 yet based on the anonymous accusations of a few disgruntled employees, the legacy media has made it sound as if we ran a college frat house. That's just untrue.\"",
      "Allegations at Vets for Freedom",
      "Prior to joining Concerned Veterans for America, Hegseth led Vets for Freedom (VFF) from 2007 to 2010, where he also faced allegations of financial mismanagement.",
      "In 2008, the organization raised $8.7 million, but spent $9.1 million. Filings show it received a loan of $20,000 to \"provide additional liquidity to the organization.\"",
      "The New Yorker reported that donors were concerned their money was being wasted and arranged for VFF to be merged with another organization, Military Families United, which took over most of its management.",
      "Revenue at VFF dwindled to $268,000 by 2010 and by 2011, the organization's revenue was listed as $22,000. Hegseth joined Concerned Veterans for America the following year.",
      "Margaret Hoover, host of the PBS program \"Firing Line\" and a former adviser to Vets for Freedom, said in an interview on CNN that Hegseth had managed the organization \"very poorly.\" Hoover expressed doubt about his ability to run the sprawling Defense Department when he had struggled with a staff of less than 10 people, and a budget of under $10 million.",

      "\"And that's an increase of 50% from 2018, just six years ago,\" added the Connecticut Democrat, who chairs panel.",
      "Overall, five U.S. carriers collected $12.4 billion in seat fees between 2018 and 2023, in addition to baggage and other charges, according to a report released last week by Democrats on the subcommittee.",
      "Speaking on behalf of their respective airlines at the hearing were Steve Johnson, vice chair and chief strategy officer, American Airlines; Peter Carter, chief external affairs officer, Delta Air Lines; Andrew Nocella, EVP and chief commercial officer, United Airlines; Robert Schroeter, SVP, chief commercial officer, Frontier Airlines; and Matthew Klein, EVP and chief commercial officer, Spirit Airlines",
      "\"Terrible experience\"",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley criticized Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines during the two-hour hearing for bonuses paid to gate employees to charge customers extra fees for large carry-ons. The subcommittee says Spirit and Frontier paid employees $26 million in incentives to strictly enforce airline bag policies in 2022 and 2023.",
      "\"You guys do appreciate that flying on your airlines is a disaster, don't you?\" the Missouri Republican said, adding, \"Flying on your airlines is horrible, it's a terrible experience. I mean, I say this as a father of three young children. But I can't tell you \u2014 nobody enjoys flying on your airlines, it's a disaster.\"",
      "Spirit charges between $15 and $77 for a carry-on bag that won't fit under a seat.",
      "Airlines say that their fee policies are transparent and allow passengers to choose various travel experiences at different price points. Frontier said its incentive program aims to ensure \"that all customers are treated equally and fairly,\" CBS News' Kris Van Cleave reported ahead of the Wednesday hearing.",
      "\"We respectfully disagree with numerous statements and conclusions contained in the report,\" Spirit said.",
      "Asked for his response to the subcommittee's findings, United CEO Scott Kirby told Van Cleave, \"At United at least, we're 100% focused on getting customers to choose to fly United. If you don't want to check a bag, you shouldn't have to pay the implied cost of checking a bag. We're creating options for customers and it's working.\"",
      "Airline fees have been a frequent target of criticism by the Biden administration, all the way up to\u00a0President Joe Biden. A Transportation Department rule that took effect in October\u00a0entitles airline passengers to automatic refunds when flights are canceled or significantly delayed, while also requiring airlines to reveal\u00a0fees\u00a0upfront.",
      "The airline industry is suing to block another regulation requiring more prominent disclosure of baggage and cancellation fees. An appeals court has blocked that rule, and its fate is uncertain under President-elect Donald Trump.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump says he intends to nominate Paul Atkins, the CEO of Patomak Partners and a former SEC commissioner, to head the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Trump said Atkins, the CEO of Patomak Partners and a former SEC commissioner, was a \"proven leader for common sense regulations.\" In the years since leaving the SEC, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation.",
      "\"He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The commission oversees U.S. securities markets and investments and is currently led by Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government's crackdown on the crypto industry. Gensler, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, announced last month that he would be stepping down from his post on the day that Trump is inaugurated \u2014 Jan. 20, 2025.",
      "Trump, once a crypto skeptic, had pledged to make the U.S. \"the crypto capital of the planet\" and create a \"strategic reserve\" of bitcoin. Money has poured into crypto assets since he won. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, is now above $95,000. And shares in crypto platform Coinbase have surged more than 70% since the election.",
      "Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of Coinbase, congratulated Atkins in a post on X.",
      "\"We appreciate his commitment to balance in regulating U.S. securities markets and look forward to his fresh leadership at (the SEC),\" Grewal wrote. \"It's sorely needed and cannot come a day too soon.\"",
      "Congressman Brad Sherman, a California Democrat and a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, said he worries Atkins would not sufficiently regulate cryptocurrencies as SEC chair.",
      "\"He'd probably take the position that no cryptocurrency is a security, and hence no exchange that deals with crypto is a securities exchange,\" Sherman said. \"The opportunity to defraud investors would be there in a very significant way.\"",
      "Atkins began his career as a lawyer and has a long history working in the financial markets sector, both in government and private practice. In the 1990s, he worked on the staffs of two former SEC chairmen, Richard C. Breeden and Arthur Levitt.",
      "His work as an SEC commissioner started in 2002, a time when the fallout from corporate scandals at Enron and WorldCom had turned up the heat on Wall Street and its government regulators.",
      "Atkins was widely considered the most conservative member of the SEC during his tenure at the agency and was known to have a strong free-market bent. As a commissioner, he called for greater transparency in and analysis of the costs and benefits of new SEC rules.",
      "He also emphasized investor education and increased enforcement efforts against those who steal from investors over the internet, manipulate markets, engage in Ponzi schemes and other types of fraud.",
      "At the same time, Atkins objected to stiff penalties imposed on companies accused of fraudulent conduct, contending that they did not deter crime. He caused a stir in the summer of 2006 when he said the practice of granting stock options to executives before the disclosure of news that was certain to increase the share price did not constitute insider trading.",
      "U.S. Rep. Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said Atkins has the experience needed to \"restore faith in the SEC.\"",
      "\"I'm confident his leadership will lead to clarity for the digital asset ecosystem and ensure U.S. capital markets remain the envy of the world,\" McHenry posted on X.",
      "Atkins already has some experience working for Trump. During Trump's first term, Atkins was a member of the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, an advisory group of more than a dozen CEOs and business leaders who offered input on how to create jobs and speed economic growth.",
      "In 2017, Atkins joined the Token Alliance, a cryptocurrency advocacy organization.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump's victory in the hopes that he would push through legislative and regulatory changes that they've long lobbied for.",

    "summary": "Several candidates under consideration to replace Trump's defense pick, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Pentagon, Pete Hegseth, is showing defiance amid misconduct allegations as support for his confirmation appeared to be in doubt. There are now several candidates under consideration to replace him as Trump's intended nominee, sources familiar with the transition tell CBS News, among them, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst.",
      "But the embattled former Fox News host on Wednesday pushed back on reports that Trump is considering other candidates for defense secretary. On Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning, as he continued to visit Republican members of Congress, Hegseth told CBS News that he does not intend to withdraw his name from consideration. He also said he spoke with Trump Wednesday morning, and the president-elect encouraged him to keep fighting.",
      "\"I spoke to the president-elect this morning. He said, 'Keep going, keep fighting. I'm behind you all the way,'\" Hegseth said. \"Why would I back down? I've always been a fighter. I'm here for the fighters. This is personal and passionate for me.\"",
      "In an interview with SiriusXM's \"The Megyn Kelly Show\" Wednesday, Hegseth said he had spoken with Trump earlier in the day and that the incoming president had told him, \"I've got your back.\" On reports of the possibility that DeSantis could replace him as defense chief nominee, he told Kelly, \"It's all the president's choice. I spoke to the president this morning. He said, I'm his guy.\"",
      "Despite the acrimony between DeSantis and Trump during the primary campaign, the Florida governor is interested in the job, according to two sources familiar with DeSantis' thinking. His second and final term as governor ends in January 2027. Trump has already announced a series of Cabinet nominees who hail from Florida, including Sen. Marco Rubio, for secretary of state. Although serving as defense secretary would pose some political risk, DeSantis believes it would position him well for a presidential run in 2028, the source said.",
      "Hegseth, a former \"Fox & Friends\" weekend co-host and Army veteran, has been meeting with Senate Republicans in recent weeks to build support for his confirmation. But reports in recent days that detailed alleged sexual misconduct, financial mismanagement at veterans' charities, repeated intoxication and infidelity appeared to be softening his support. Some Senate Republicans have called the allegations \"disturbing\" and said they came as a surprise.",
      "Still, Hegseth on Wednesday told reporters at the Capitol his meetings with Senate Republicans have been \"a wonderful process.\" In his interview with Kelly, Hegseth said, \"No one has looked me in the eye and said, 'I have concerns and I can't vote for you.' In fact, most have said, 'Let's take a picture, and I'm behind you all the way.'\"",
      "Hegseth also defended himself in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal Wednesday. Amid reports about his removal as the head of a veterans' charity over allegations of financial mismanagement, intoxication, sexual misconduct and fostering a toxic work climate, Hegseth wrote of his work for that organization, Concerned Veterans for America.",
      "\"We fought entrenched interests and mobilized veterans and patriotic Americans across the country,\" he said, denying reports of any misconduct and accusing the media of publishing falsehoods.",
      "\"We had hundreds of employees and thousands of volunteers\u2014yet based on the anonymous accusations of a few disgruntled employees, the legacy media has made it sound as if we ran a college frat house,\" he wrote. \"That's just untrue.\"",
      "Hegseth also said that he left CVA over \"an internal difference of opinion about its future. I wanted to engage in foreign policy; our donors didn't.\" And he added that the group's leadership \"wrote me a glowing letter when I left.\"",
      "In his interview with Kelly, Hegseth addressed the sexual assault allegation that emerged in late November. He responded \"absolutely not\" when asked if he had raped a woman in a Monterey, California, hotel in 2017. He admitted that it would have once been a fair characterization to call him a \"serial cheater\" but says he has changed. \"I may have been drinking, but I was cognizant enough to remember every single detail. And I'm not here to say that my conduct was good,\" he said. \"Being in a hotel room with someone that's not the person you're with is not OK. I own up to that, and I've had to own up to that, and that's been difficult.\"",
      "He said he paid his accuser \"because I had to \u2014 or at least I thought I did at the time.\" He explained that he was newly married, was under consideration for a role in the first Trump administration and wanted to protect his family and his Fox News job.",
      "He also responded to reporting by NBC News that cited current and former Fox News employees who said that \"on more than a dozen occasions\" while Hegseth was a \"Fox & Friends Weekend\" co-host, \"they smelled alcohol on him before he went to air,\" and appeared on TV \"after they'd heard him talk about being hungover as he was getting ready or on set.\" The report said \"[t]hree current employees said his drinking remained a concern up until Trump announced him as his choice to run the Pentagon, at which point Hegseth left Fox.\"",
      "But in the op-ed, Hegseth did not directly address allegations about his alcohol consumption. \"I've been at Fox News\u2014where I saw my work as a continuation of my mission to fight for America. Again, the legacy press has used anonymous sources to try to discredit even that,\" and he referred readers to his X feed for statements of support from professional colleagues. He did tell Kelly, \"I've never had a drinking problem.\"",
      "North Dakota GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer is scheduled to meet with Hegseth Wednesday afternoon and told reporters earlier in the day, \"The allegations are very, very serious. They can't be trivialized. And I just want to know that, that he's redeemed, and going forward, he's going to be better.\"",
      "Cramer also added, \"I think the mood of the conference is one of the pretty serious, really, really serious about it, and serious about how these things affect his ability to do the job, the ability of the troops to look up to him.\"",
      "He suggested the Republican conference was watching for signals from the Trump transition team about Hegseth.",
      "\"There's the mood of the conference, and then there's the mood of the Trump transition team itself,\" he said. \"So we'll see what kind of messages and signals we hear throughout the course of the day. As you can tell, these things have been breaking pretty fast and furious.\"",
      "Cramer said of Ernst that she would be \"easy to confirm, and I think she'd be great,\" and in fact, \"if she wanted it, she'd be my first pick.\"",
      "\"I have never backed down from a fight and won't back down from this one,\" Hegseth wrote, adding, \"I look forward to an honest confirmation hearing with our distinguished senators\u2014not a show trial in the press.\"",
      "Hegseth has continued to meet with the Republican senators who will weigh in on his nomination. But one prominent Republican, Sen. Josh Hawley, told reporters Wednesday afternoon that Hegseth canceled their upcoming meeting.",
      "\"I was supposed to sit down with him tomorrow, but they canceled that meeting,\" Hawley said.",
      "\"I don't know where things stand at the moment,\" he said of Hegseth's expected nomination and added, \"It's not 100% clear to me who [Trump] wants as secretary of defense right now.\"",
      "Hegseth told Kelly he planned to keep meeting with senators to earn their support, but he acknowledged that there's a possibility he may not be confirmed. \"That's the president's call,\" he said when asked whether he would withdraw from the process.",

      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he has named longtime aide Peter Navarro, who served on the White House Trade Council in the first Trump administration, to be \"senior counselor for trade and manufacturing.\"",
      "The announcement comes just months after Navarro, 75, was released from prison after serving a four-month sentence for defying a congressional subpoena. Navarro was subpoenaed for records and testimony in 2022 by the now-defunct House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, and he refused to comply, claiming that Trump had asserted executive privilege over the material sought by the committee.",
      "A federal judge in Washington convicted Navarro of two counts of contempt, and he reported to a Florida federal correctional facility in March to serve a four-month sentence. He spoke at the Republican National Convention in July the same day he was released from prison, slamming the \"Department of Injustice\" in his speech.",
      "Trump praised Navarro in the announcement Wednesday as a \"man who was treated horribly by the Deep State, or whatever else.\"",
      "As a trade adviser in the first Trump administration, Navarro endorsed \"America First\" trade policies, including steep tariffs to protect domestic industries.",
      "In the social media post announcing Navarro's selection, Trump praised Navarro's time as a trade adviser. \"The Senior Counselor position leverages Peter's broad range of White House experience, while harnessing his extensive Policy analytic and Media skills,\" Trump wrote. \"His mission will be to help successfully advance and communicate the Trump Manufacturing, Tariff, and Trade Agendas.\"",
      "Trump announced in 2016 that Navarro would be serving at the helm of the newly formed White House Trade Council and as director of trade and industrial policy. Prior to that, he had written a book called \"Death by China\" that endorsed a hardline toward trade with China.",
      "In March 2020, Trump named Navarro as policy coordinator of the Defense Production Act, which Trump invoked on March 18, 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, to manufacture medical supplies and PPE. On \"60 Minutes\" in April 2020, Navarro fiercely defended protectionist trade policies despite the shortage of that equipment before the pandemic.",
      "\"It's the globalization of production through multinational corporations, who salute no flag, who love cheap sweatshop labor, and who love the massive subsidies that the Chinese government throws at production to bring it from here to there,\" Navarro told \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker.",
      "Congressional subpoena and prison time",
      "The House Jan. 6 committee subpoenaed records and testimony from Navarro, alleging that he developed plans to overturn the outcome of the 2020 election. \"Mr. Navarro appears to have information directly relevant to the Select Committee's investigation into the causes of the January 6th attack on the Capitol,\" said the committee's chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson, at the time.",
      "In 2021, Navarro wrote a book in which he wrote that he and other Trump advisers constructed a plan called the \"Green Bay Sweep\" as the \"last, best chance to snatch a stolen election from the Democrats' jaws of deceit.\" Additionally, in the weeks leading up to the Jan. 6 attack, Navarro promoted a document he called the \"Navarro Report\" that asserted baseless and discredited claims of election fraud.",
      "Navarro refused to comply with the subpoena, saying that Trump had invoked executive privilege. The committee recommended in a unanimous vote to recommend contempt charges, with the Justice Department ultimately agreeing, charging him with two counts of contempt.",
      "Navarro testified at an evidentiary hearing that Trump invoked executive privilege in a Feb. 2022 conversation, 11 days after he was subpoenaed. But U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta barred that defense, saying there was no evidence that any official assertion was made, and Navarro did not testify at his one-day trial.",
      "In his sentencing, Mehta noted Navarro's public statements after the attack and said there was no evidence of executive privilege. While Mehta said that it appeared that Navarro at least believed he was operating under the guise of executive privilege, he said executive privilege is not a \"magical dust\" or \"a get-out-of-jail free card.\"",
      "Navarro attempted to appeal his conviction, even requesting after he surrendered to prison his case be heard by the Supreme Court, which declined. He reported to prison in March and served four months at the Federal Correctional Institute in Miami, which is reserved for older inmates.",

      "The long-winged seabird named Wisdom, a Laysan albatross, returned to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge at the northwestern edge of the Hawaiian Archipelago and laid what experts estimate may be her 60th egg, the Pacific Region of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service said in a Facebook post this week.",

The islands of the Midway Atoll were she nests are awash with plastic pollution. The 60 Minutes team found that many of Wisdom's fellow albatrosses have died around her with bellies full of plastic, making her a source of some optimism for researchers.",

      "Viewers \u2014 who should prepare for frigid temperatures \u2014 should lie flat on their backs with their feet facing south. Give your eyes a half hour to adjust to the dark.",

      "\"Based on the data, we have decided, unanimously, to move forward with the current Artemis 2/Orion capsule and heat shield with a modified entry trajectory...to lessen the heat coming back into the Earth's atmosphere,\" Nelson said.",
      "\"Additionally, we need to complete our updates to the Orion environmental controls and the life support systems that were identified earlier this year.\"",
      "Future heat shields for the Artemis 3 moon landing mission and subsequent flights will use essentially the same materials but with modifications to improve their performance during re-entry.",
      "In the meantime, Nelson said, \"We are planning for Artemis 2 to launch in April of '26 and we're going to do all in our power, with our commercial partners, to launch earlier.\"",
      "The Artemis program aims to send astronauts to the moon's south polar region where ice deposits may allow crews to one day extract oxygen and hydrogen to produce air, water and rocket propellants that would not have to be carried up, at great expense, from Earth.",
      "Following the launch of Artemis 2, Nelson said NASA is going \"to make (any) adjustments that are necessary, and we plan to launch Artemis 3, the first landing on the moon in over a half century. Assuming the SpaceX lander is ready, we plan to launch Artemis 3 in mid-2027. That will be well ahead of the Chinese government's announced intention (of sending taikonauts to the moon in) 2030...We need to get this Artemis 2 test flight right to ensure the success of our return to the moon.\"",
      "NASA launched the Artemis program's first test flight, Artemis 1, in November 2022, using the agency's new Space Launch System, or SLS, rocket to send an unpiloted Lockheed Martin-built Orion capsule on a looping flight around the moon and back.",
      "NASA had planned to launch the Artemis 2 mission at the end of this year to carry a three-man one-woman crew around the moon to thoroughly test the spacecraft's life support, propulsion and other systems.",
      "But after the Artemis 1 flight, engineers discovered the Orion capsule's 16-foot-wide heat shield suffered unexpected damage during it's high-speed return from the moon using a technique called a \"skip entry.\"",
      "In a skip entry, the capsule dips into the atmosphere, slows and rises back up before dropping back into the atmosphere for the final descent. The idea is similar to how a flat rock can skip across a still pond. Skip entries provide a number of benefits, including a wider range of splashdown targets.",
      "The Orion heat shield is designed to ablate, or char, during re-entry when the spacecraft enters Earth's atmosphere at more than 25,000 mph. But the charred material is intended to stay in place, providing a layer of insulation. During the Artemis 1 re-entry, more charred material separated from the heat shield than computer models predicted.",
      "While the unexpected \"liberation\" had no impact on the spacecraft \u2014 NASA said astronauts would not have even noticed had any been on board \u2014 engineers wanted to make sure they understood the underlying cause so they could update computer models to accurately predict re-entry effects across multiple trajectories.",
      "After hundreds of tests and an exhaustive engineering analysis, NASA has \"since determined that while the capsule was dipping in and out of the atmosphere as part of that planned skip entry, heat accumulated inside the heat shield's outer layer,\" said Pam Melroy, a former shuttle commander and now deputy administrator of NASA.",
      "That heat build up led to \"gases forming and becoming trapped inside the heat shield,\" she said. \"This caused internal pressure to build up and led to cracking and uneven shedding of that outer layer.\"",
      "While the same type of heat shield will be used for the Artemis 2 mission in April 2026, the crew will use a modified re-entry trajectory to reduce the sort of heating that damaged the Artemis 1 heat shield.",
      "As for the Artemis 3 lunar landing flight, the new mid-2027 target launch date assumes SpaceX's lunar lander, a variant of the upper stage used by the company's new Super Heavy-Starship rocket, completes multiple test flights in Earth orbit, along with at least one unpiloted lunar landing.",
      "On Wednesday, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he was selecting billionaire Jared Isaacman, a space veteran with strong ties to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, to serve as NASA's next administrator.",
      "During the news conference Thursday, Nelson was asked whether he was concerned that the next administration might make major changes to the Artemis program given SpaceX's development of the new Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "\"First of all, there is one human-rated spacecraft that is flying and that has already flown beyond the moon, and that's the SLS (Space Launch System) combined with Orion,\" Nelson said. \"Secondly, this is a partnership. It's a commercial partnership. It's an international partnership.",
      "\"I think what is going to happen over time is you're going to have a number of years that we're going to have the partners flying with NASA, and then whatever the technologies that are developed later on will dictate what is going to be the system that's flying.\"",
      "He concluded by saying, \"I don't see the concern that your question raises, although it's a legitimate question, that you're suddenly going to have Starship take over everything.\"",

    "summary": "Jared Isaacman is an entrepreneur and veteran private astronaut with strong ties to Elon Musk and his rocket company SpaceX.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, a veteran private astronaut with strong ties to Elon Musk and his rocket company SpaceX, has been picked to serve as NASA's next administrator, President-elect Donald Trump  announced Wednesday.",
      "If confirmed, Isaacman, 41, would be the fifth NASA administrator with spaceflight experience, replacing former Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, who flew into orbit aboard the space shuttle Columbia in early 1986.",
      "\"I am delighted to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,\" Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social. \"... Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.\"",
      "Isaacman founded the payment processing company later named Shift4 Payments while he was a high school student. He chartered the first purely commercial, all-civilian American \"space tourist\" mission \u2014 Inspiration4 \u2014 in February 2021, paying SpaceX an undisclosed amount to launch him and three other civilian flyers on a two-day, 23-hour flight.",
      "He flew to space again this past September, commanding the first of three planned SpaceX Polaris missions, logging nearly five days in space on a flight that took the crew farther from Earth than any astronauts have gone since the Apollo moon program. Isaacman also became the first private citizen to carry out a spacewalk.",
      "He is scheduled to lead another Polaris mission aboard a SpaceX capsule before leading the first crew to space aboard the California rocket builder's gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "Dates have not been announced for either of those missions, and it's not yet clear what impact Isaacman's selection to lead NASA will have on those flights, whether Isaacman still intends to fly aboard one or both or what sort of influence his friendship with Musk might have on NASA's future direction.",
      "But Isaacman, a skilled pilot who flies his own MiG-29 fighter jet, made it clear in a post following Trump's announcement that NASA can expect him to be a vocal space advocate who will help \"usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilization.\"",
      "\"With the support of President Trump, I can promise you this: We will never again lose our ability to journey to the stars and never settle for second place,\" Isaacman said. \"We will inspire children, yours and mine, to look up and dream of what is possible. Americans will walk on the moon and Mars and in doing so, we will make life better here on Earth.\"",
      "He said it would be the \"honor of a lifetime to serve in this role and to work alongside NASA's extraordinary team to realize our shared dreams of exploration and discovery.\"",
      "Jim Bridenstine, Nelson's predecessor at the helm of NASA, helped kickstart the agency's Artemis moon program during the first Trump administration.",
      "He said in a statement Wednesday that \"Jared's vision for pushing boundaries, paired with his proven track record of success in private industry, positions him as an ideal candidate to lead NASA into a bold new era of exploration and discovery. I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm him.\"",
      "The Isaacman announcement comes as NASA struggles to keep the Artemis program on track amid tight budgets and what the agency's own inspector general calls the \"unsustainable\" costs of NASA's Space Launch System, or SLS, moon rocket.",
      "SpaceX supporters argue the company's more powerful, fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship rocket is the obvious choice for deep space exploration, but the huge rocket is far from operational with just a half-dozen suborbital test flights to its credit.",
      "The SLS, on the other hand, is considered operational in that it completed an initial test flight in November 2022, sending an unpiloted Orion capsule around the moon and back. But unlike the Super Heavy-Starship, the SLS is a throwaway, expendable booster expected to cost some $1.4 billion for each of its first four moon missions.",
      "NASA is currently gearing up to launch three NASA astronauts and a Canadian flyer on an SLS-Orion mission \u2014 Artemis 2 \u2014 late next year. But problems with the first Orion's heat shield and other issues threaten to push the Artemis 2 flight into 2026, years past initial expectations.",
      "It's not yet clear when the Artemis 3 mission, the first to carry astronauts to a landing near the moon's south pole, might be feasible.",
      "But that flight will feature a lunar lander built by SpaceX, a variant of the company's Starship upper stage. SpaceX has carried out six test flights of the fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship to date, but has not yet put the Starship upper stage into orbit or brought it down for an intact landing.",
      "Given the company's rapid-fire test schedule, most observers believe SpaceX will get the Super Heavy-Starship working as planned in the near future, but scores of test flights will be required to demonstrate the safety and reliability required by NASA to put astronauts aboard.",
      "And the moon mission poses unique challenges.",
      "For the initial landing mission, multiple Super Heavy \"tanker\" flights will be required to refuel the moon lander in low-Earth orbit before it can be sent to the moon. Once in lunar orbit, it will await the arrival of the Artemis 3 crew, launched aboard an Orion capsule by an SLS rocket.",
      "After boarding the Starship lander, two astronauts would descend to the surface, carry out the mission's planned exploration, and then head back up to the orbiting Orion for the trip back to Earth.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 17:26:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Abutting homes, schools an parks, the sprawling warehouses are a huge drain on local resources and major pollutant.",
    "story": [
      "The sprawling, windowless warehouses that hold rows of high-speed servers powering almost everything the world does on phones and computers are increasingly becoming fixtures of the American landscape, popping up in towns, cities and suburbs across the United States.",
      "Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and urban and rural governments alike are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies.",
      "But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas, abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents are pushing back against the world's most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.",
      "In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling hills of the area's westernmost counties and butt up against wooded bike trails winding through the suburbs. But one of the latest proposals in the area, Plaza 500, would see a 466,000-square-foot facility and adjacent electrical substation built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds and a community center.",
      "The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials promised jobs and a significant property tax boost. But data center critics say the incentives aren't enough to counteract the consequences of building the facilities so close to homes.",
      "Tyler Ray, a leader in the fight against the Virginia project, worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by 2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help power the data centers' hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere.",
      "Ray and his neighbors tried to stop the development, but their efforts were largely unsuccessful. The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project was exempt.",
      "\"I don't know how a general resident, even someone who has been engaging intently on an issue, has any chance to go up against the data center industry,\" Ray said the night the supervisors voted.",
      "For local governments, attracting data centers to their municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in 2024 that Virginia's current data centers brought in $1 billion in tax revenue.",
      "For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of direct jobs \u2013 often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently that its investment in nearby Loudoun County, which included two data centers, created around 150 direct jobs, a figure that data center opponents say isn't worth the hassle. But data center advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction, technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730 indirect jobs.",
      "Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax County should reap the benefits.",
      "\"I have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the big picture,\" Smith said. \"Data centers are not going away.\"",
      "On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the 4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia river.",
      "Last year, AWS paid roughly $34 million in property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a $66 million tax break. Those payments, in addition to $1.7 in charitable donations from the company in 2023, have been instrumental in updating infrastructure and bolstering services. These funds have gone toward a new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer and $5,000 grants for homebuyers so far totaling at least $2.8 million.",
      "\"This road right here? Wouldn't happen if it wasn't for AWS,\" said Boardman Mayor Paul Keefer, riding in the passenger seat of Police Chief Rick Stokoe's cruiser, pointing out the window at construction workers shifting dirt and laying pavement.",
      "AWS has cultivated relationships with local officials including Keefer and Stokoe, who have both been in positions to vote on whether to authorize tax breaks with the company. Some former county commissioners and residents worry that those relationships are too cozy.",
      "Kevin Miller, AWS's vice president of global data centers, said in an interview with the Associated Press that \"our interest is in being a model corporate citizen, to really be partners with those communities.\"",
      "Skepticism of the deals started years ago, when three formerly elected officials allegedly helped approve data center deals while also owning a stake in a company that contracted with AWS to provide fiber optic cables for the data centers. In June, they each paid $2,000 to settle an ethics complaint.",
      "Those officials are no longer in office. But the latest data center deal struck between Morrow County officials and AWS, which gives the company an estimated $1 billion in tax breaks spread over the 15 years to build five new data centers, again raised eyebrows.",
      "Two former Morrow County Commissioners, Jim Doherty and Melissa Lindsay, pushed unsuccessfully in 2022 for AWS to pay more in taxes in new data center negotiations.",
      "\"We didn't want to blow it up. We didn't want to run them off,\" said Lindsay. \"But there were better deals to be made.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 19:28:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Craig Garriott has built satellites for Boeing for nearly three decades.",
    "story": [
      "Whether it's providing internet to storm-ravaged communities or supporting American troops at war, Craig Garriott has long believed the satellites he builds for Boeing helped protect lives.",
      "Now, Garriott, 53, says, it's the lives of hundreds of technicians at the Boeing facility where he has worked for nearly three decades that need protecting from company management.",
      "\"They've taken the focus off quality, the focus off the people on the floor, and they've put it completely on profit and going fast,\" Garriott said in an exclusive interview with CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave. \"I'm afraid with Boeing in the hands that it's in now down here, they're not gonna listen to me until somebody dies.\"",
      "He said efforts by Boeing executives to boost production at the company's Los Angeles-area military and commercial satellite plant have led to a \"toxic culture\" that has put workers there in danger. Garriott recalled how a four-ton satellite estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars crashed to the factory floor after it wasn't properly secured \u2014 an incident so catastrophic he compared it to \"a plane falling out of the sky.\"",
      "\"One person was underneath that satellite and they barely got out,\" said Garriott, who also represents 600 hourly workers as the head of the local carpenters union. \"It's the worst thing that can possibly happen on a site.\"",
      "A Boeing spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about the incident. In a statement to CBS News, the spokesperson said, \"Boeing is dedicated to the safety of its employees, and all employees are empowered and encouraged to report any safety concerns.\"",
      "Garriott's allegations echo concerns raised by multiple whistleblowers who have worked on Boeing's commercial airliners, including the troubled 737 MAX. And they add to struggles already facing Boeing's space division.",
      "The most high-profile Boeing space failure occurred in September, when the company's Starliner spacecraft experienced a cascade of technical troubles on a manned test flight to the International Space Station. NASA considered the return flight too risky, and sent it back to Earth without the two astronauts it had planned to shuttle home. Those astronauts will instead travel back next year in a capsule built by rival SpaceX and its CEO Elon Musk.",
      "Tapped by President-elect Trump to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, Musk is set to potentially wield enormous influence over lucrative space and defense contracts, which could put Boeing at a further disadvantage.",
      "Boeing, the company that helped put a man on the moon, is now exploring a new course \u2014 indicating it may sell off parts of its space business, according to a recent report in the Wall Street Journal. During Boeing's October earnings call, new CEO Kelly Ortberg suggested he was reevaluating the company's portfolio.",
      "\"We're better off doing less and doing it well than doing more and not doing it well,\" Ortberg said.",
      "The Boeing spokesperson did not respond to questions about how the company views competition from SpaceX or about steps it is taking to prepare for the incoming administration.",
      "Garriott estimates he's raised 300-400 safety violations over past year",
      "Acquired by Boeing in 2000, the satellite manufacturing facility has long been considered one of Boeing's more stable business units. It relies in part on a union workforce that Garriott said is responsible for constructing and testing satellites and their component parts.",
      "\"This is perhaps the most technical group of hourly people that you'll probably find on this planet,\" said Garriott, who estimated he's raised between 300 and 400 safety violations over the past year. Those complaints, he said, range from obstructed fire extinguishers and fire alarms to concerns over heavy machinery blocking exits and trapping workers in certain parts of the factory.",
      "In October, union workers filed a complaint with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration that, according to Garriott, highlighted unsafe conditions on the factory floor.",
      "Another technician at the facility, who spoke to CBS News on the condition he remain anonymous to protect his job, said safety had become \"an afterthought\" and quality had \"degraded\" over the past five to six years.",
      "\"You speak up now, you're a troublemaker\"",
      "Garriott sued Boeing in April alleging company management retaliated against him for raising safety issues. He said he's been harassed by leadership at the facility and has been the target of dozens of corporate investigations that he says turned up nothing and were only meant to intimidate him.",
      "\"When I first started at Boeing, the guys that spoke up and said, 'Hey, this doesn't feel right,' those guys were revered,\" Garriott said. \"You speak up now, you're a troublemaker.\"",
      "In a statement, Boeing said it investigated Garriott's claims and disputed the allegations he made in his lawsuit.",
      "'We have strict policies prohibiting retaliation toward employees who raise concerns, and Boeing did not retaliate against Mr. Garriott,\" the Boeing spokesperson said.",
      "Garriott is the latest whistleblower claiming the company retaliated against him after raising safety concerns. John Barnett, a former quality manager at the company's 787 Dreamliner factory, died by suicide in March while in Charleston, South Carolina, giving testimony in his whistleblower retaliation case.",
      "Barnett's mother, Vicky Stokes, told CBS News in April she holds the aircraft manufacturing giant responsible for the grinding treatment that ultimately left her son despondent.",
      "\"If this hadn't gone on so long, I'd still have my son, and my sons would have their brother and we wouldn't be sitting here. So in that respect, I do,\" Stokes said when asked if she places some of the blame for her son's death on Boeing.",
      "In June, former Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told lawmakers on the Senate investigations subcommittee that Boeing's culture is \"far from perfect,\" but said the company is \"committed to making sure every employee feels empowered to speak up if there is a problem.\" He also said Boeing is working on improving \"transparency and accountability, while elevating employee engagement.\"",
      "Garriott said although his family fears he will endure further reprisals from Boeing, he's now speaking out publicly in an effort to improve conditions for workers he said he took an oath as union head to protect.",
      "\"I'm not gonna stop till I know that Boeing understands that these people mean something, they matter,\" Garriott said, urging company executives to open up a dialogue with workers on the factory floor. \"Make 'em feel like they matter. Make 'em feel like their safety matters.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:59:07 -0500",
    "summary": "Bluesky has added millions of new subscribers in the last month as some users leave X. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "It's unusual for a new social media service to get a foothold in a marketplace entrenched by the likes of X (formerly Twitter), Instagram and TikTok which, dominate people's phones. But Bluesky, a nearly 2-year-old app, is now grabbing attention amid a recent surge of new users, which the company says is likely due to growing frustrations with X.",
      "While the platform has grown since it opened as an invite-only service in February 2023, its membership snowballed following the November 5 presidential election. Bluesky currently has more than 22 million users, up from about 12 million people in mid-October, according to the company's data.",
      "Bluesky believes its recent growth is partly due to changes at X under billionaire owner Elon Musk, according to Bluesky Chief Operating Officer Rose Wang, who recently spoke to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Musk, who bought Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion, has overhauled the service, changing its name to X\u00a0and\u00a0prioritizing accounts from people who pay for a blue checkmark \u2014 although accounts with more than 2,500 \"verified subscriber followers\" get access to Premium features for free.",
      "Ad sales almost immediately softened after Musk took over the platform, with companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Disney removing paid ads from X\u00a0last year. Most recently, The Guardian said it would no longer be posting its content under its official account on X. In its announcement, the British newspaper described X as \"toxic,\" adding that the platform has been used by Musk to shape political discourse.",
      "Musk became one of the most viral voices on elections during the 2024 campaign, frequently sharing conspiratorial narratives while promoting President-elect Donald Trump, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "When Twitter became X, \"it was no longer a public town square, and now it's more of a partisan microphone,\" Wang said, adding, \"that is a big reason why we think people are coming over.\"",
      "X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "What is the difference between X and Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky resembles the \"old Twitter\" in terms of layout and content,\u00a0wrote\u00a0PCWorld tech writer Dave Parrack in a recent column. He added, \"Bluesky feels like a safe haven. There's very little trolling, and when it does happen, people aren't biting.\"",
      "Bluesky users can find people to follow through so-called \"starter packs,\" or curated lists of people to follow by interest or fields, such as this group of garden writers. That enables users to quickly build a feed of posts from people that they pick, rather than being fed content by a corporate algorithm, the company says.",
      "Because people can tailor their interests and connect with other like-minded users, there's more interaction on the service than on X, according to Wang.",
      "Some companies are also reporting more engagement with their posts on the Bluesky app versus rival platforms. An executive for The Boston Globe, for instance\u00a0noted\u00a0that the newspaper's posts on Bluesky receive three times the traffic as on Meta's Threads.",
      "\"Thirty percent of users Bluesky are posters versus 1% on Twitter,\" Wang said.",
      "Even so, it's questionable whether Bluesky's jump in new users is making much of a dent in X's consumer base.",
      "The presidential election delivered a surge in traffic to Musk's social media service, according to tracking service Similarweb. It found that more than 46 million U.S. users visited X on November 6, the day after President-elect Donald Trump's win \u2014 more than any day in the prior year. About 115,000 people in the U.S. deactivated their accounts on X that same day, its data shows.",
      "How Bluesky makes money",
      "While Bluesky's user base is growing quickly, the company remains small in terms of its funding and staff, which Wang describes as \"a tiny team of 20\" employees, including herself and CEO Jay Graber. The service was created by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, although the business has been independent since 2021.",
      "In October, the company\u00a0raised $15 million in venture funding, which followed a seed round of $8 million in 2023. Wang noted that Bluesky is focused on figuring out how to sustain its business, which will soon include new revenue streams from subscriptions and financial transactions.",
      "\"We are launching subscriptions at the end of this year,\" Wang noted. \"It'll be custom aesthetics, custom avatar frames, maybe more video uploads.\"",
      "The company is also planning to enable financial transactions between users, such as if a game designer wants to sell his or her products to Bluesky users. The service would take a portion of the payment, Wang noted.",
      "Bluesky doesn't accept advertising, nor has it marketed itself in the wake of Musk's takeover of Twitter, she added.",
      "To be sure, Bluesky may never achieve the size of bigger social media networks, which advertisers flock to in order to reach much larger groups of users. For instance, Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, had more than 3 billion daily users across its apps in the most recent quarter, and\u00a0booked almost $40 billion in revenue during that time.",
      "How do you sign up for Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky opened as an invitation-only platform in February 2023, but anyone can now sign up for the service.",
      "User handles on the service are a little bit different than X or other social media networks because they end with the site's domain, .bsky.social. Posts are limited to 300 characters, 20 more than on X. Photos and videos can also uploaded, though videos can't be longer than 60 seconds. GIFs and emojis are available, too.",
      "As with other platforms, you can tag people on Bluesky by typing \"@\" before their username, you can like posts by tapping a heart icon, and use hashtags to highlight a theme. Bluesky has added a\u00a0menu\u00a0to hashtags, so that when users click on one they'll get different options for seeing, or muting, posts on a particular topic.",
      "\"It's more of a community space \u2014 it's more of a Reddit model, where you land in those cosy corners,\" Wang added. \"At the end of the day it's all about the people, and what I encourage people to do is just come to Bluesky, give it a chance and see for yourself what the experience is like.\"",

    "summary": "Police are looking for a person of interest in connection with the deadly shooting of the CEO of UnitedHealthcare.",
    "story": [
      "A person of interest wanted for questioning in the deadly shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson is believed to have left New York City, police said Friday. Meanwhile, investigators found in Central Park what's believed to be the suspected gunman's backpack, law enforcement officials told CBS News.",
      "The officials told CBS News it's not clear what the backpack contained. The New York Police Department said the backpack was being analyzed to determine if it belonged to the suspect, who is believed to have disposed of his backpack in Central Park as he was fleeing Wednesday's shooting in midtown Manhattan.",
      "CBS News obtained photos of the backpack from the NYPD Friday night.",
      "Police have not named a suspect in the investigation, but investigators are looking for a person of interest who's wanted for questioning in the case. The person of interest may have boarded a bus at a Manhattan bus terminal bound for Atlanta, a person familiar with the matter told CBS News. Joseph Kenny, the NYPD's chief of detectives, told reporters Friday that investigators don't know what bus the man may have taken.",
      "\"We have him in a taxicab, and the taxicab  takes him up to 178th Street and Broadway, which as we know is a Port Authority bus center,\" Kenny told CNN. \"Those buses are interstate buses. That's why we believe he may have left New York City.\"",
      "The Atlanta Police Department said that they were contacted by the NYPD and will be providing assistance as needed with the manhunt now expanding beyond New York City. Investigators were following leads in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The NYPD has asked about 80 major police departments across the U.S. for assistance on the case, senior officials told CBS News.",
      "The FBI, which is also assisting the NYPD with the investigation, announced a $50,000 reward Friday night for information leading to an arrest in the case.",
      "Days before the shooting, the person of interest took a bus that had originated in Atlanta to New York City, a person briefed on the investigation confirmed to CBS News on Thursday. It is unclear when the person of interest got on the bus, whether it was in Atlanta, or on another stop along the way.",
      "When the person was in New York City, he used a fake ID with a fake name to check in to Hostelling International New York City, a hostel on Amsterdam Avenue, in the Upper West Side neighborhood of Manhattan, according to a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation. The official said police believe the name on the ID was made up and does not belong to anyone else.",
      "The NYPD shared two images Thursday showing the person at the hostel. They did not say when the photos were taken.",
      "The photos were taken\u00a0with his mask pulled down as he talked to a woman at the front desk. New York police interviewed the woman, who told officers she asked to \"see his pretty smile,\" a high-ranking source told CBS News New York.",
      "\"They were having a flirtatious moment and he pulls it down and he gives a big smile and that one informal moment between two human beings remains at this moment the most significant clue to date in this whole case,\" said John Miller, former NYPD deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism.",
      "Kenny told reporters that the person of interest was seen on security video arriving at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in midtown Manhattan between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. on Nov. 24.",
      "Police were able to identify him with surveillance video of him walking through the terminal, police sources with direct knowledge of the investigation previously told CBS News. That video was used to trace him to a Greyhound bus.",
      "From the Port Authority, he took a cab to the vicinity of the Hilton Midtown hotel   \u2014 near which the fatal shooting of Thompson occurred on Dec. 4 \u2014 and was there for about 30 minutes. He then took a cab to the hostel, Kenny said. He briefly checked out of the hostel on Nov. 29, Kenny said, but then checked back in on Nov. 30.",
      "Bus riders who pay cash for a ticket aren't required to show a valid ID. Port Authority police is working with Greyhound to determine if the person of interest provided ID at any point, and they are investigating at which point he purchased the ticket between Atlanta and New York.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 20:44:33 -0500",
    "summary": "An appeals court judge wrote that the law that would force a sale or ban of TikTok \"survive[s] constitutional scrutiny.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court upheld a law that will ban TikTok in the U.S. in the coming months if its Chinese parent company doesn't sell its stake in the app, dealing another setback to the widely popular video-sharing service in its battle with the federal government.",
      "A panel of three judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously sided with the Justice Department in declining to review the petition for relief from TikTok and ByteDance, its Chinese parent company, saying the law is constitutional.",
      "\"We conclude the portions of the Act the petitioners have standing to challenge, that is the provisions concerning TikTok and its related entities, survive constitutional scrutiny,\" Senior Judge Douglas Ginsburg wrote in the majority opinion. \"We therefore deny the petitions.\"",
      "Congress approved\u00a0a foreign assistance package in April that included provisions giving TikTok nine months to sever ties with ByteDance or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. President Biden quickly signed the bill into law, and it is set to take effect on Jan. 19, with the possibility of a one-time 90-day delay granted by the president if a sale is in progress by then.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump tried to ban TikTok during his first term in office, but reversed his position during the presidential campaign and vowed to \"save\" the app. He takes office on Jan. 20.",
      "Lawmakers and national security officials have long had suspicions about TikTok's ties to China. Officials from both parties have warned that the Chinese government could use TikTok to spy on and collect data from its roughly 170 million American users or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content. The concern is warranted, they have argued, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering.",
      "The appeals court's decision tees up a fight at the Supreme Court over the law's ultimate fate. The parties asked the judges to make a decision by Friday so there is enough time for the high court to review the case before the law takes effect. The justices could agree to hear the case and pause the law while they consider the legal arguments, or let the appeals court's ruling stand as the final word.",
      "TikTok expects the law will be overturned by the Supreme Court, according to spokesperson Michael Hughes, who argued the law is based on \"inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information.\"",
      "\"The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" Hughes said in a statement.",
      "The Justice Department, meanwhile, applauded the decision.",
      "\"Today's decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to collect sensitive information about millions of Americans, to covertly manipulate the content delivered to American audiences, and to undermine our national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. \"As the D.C. Circuit recognized, this act protects the national security of the United States in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution. The Justice Department is committed to defending Americans' sensitive data from authoritarian regimes that seek to exploit companies under their control.\"",
      "The court's decision",
      "\"The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\" Ginsburg wrote in his opinion. \"Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\"",
      "The appeals court said that it recognized the decision will have \"significant implications\" for TikTok and its users.",
      "\"Consequently, TikTok's millions of users will need to find alternative media of communication,\" Ginsburg said. \"That burden is attributable to the [People's Republic of China's] hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security, not to the U.S. Government, which engaged with TikTok through a multi-year process in an effort to find an alternative solution.\"",
      "The D.C. Circuit found that the government's national-security justifications for banning TikTok \u2014 to counter China's efforts to collect Americans' data and limit its ability to manipulate content covertly on the platform \u2014 are \"wholly consistent\" with the First Amendment.",
      "\"The multi-year efforts of both political branches to investigate the national security risks posed by the TikTok platform, and to consider potential remedies proposed by TikTok, weigh heavily in favor of the Act,\" Ginsburg wrote. \"The government has offered persuasive evidence demonstrating that the act is narrowly tailored to protect national security.\"",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House China committee, praised the decision, calling it \"a loss for the Chinese Community Party,\" while also expressing optimism about the app's future in the U.S.",
      "\"I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,\" Moolenaar said in a statement.",
      "The House China committee spearheaded the bipartisan effort to pass the law.",
      "The legal arguments",
      "TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge in May that called the legislation \"an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power\" based on \"speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation\" that would suppress the speech of millions of Americans.",
      "\"In reality, there is no choice,\" the petition said, adding that a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\"",
      "The Chinese government vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance said \"such a fundamental rearchitecting is not remotely feasible\" under the restrictions within the legislation.",
      "\"The platform consists of millions of lines of software code that have been painstakingly developed by thousands of engineers over multiple years,\" the petition said.",
      "During oral arguments in September, the appeals panel appeared skeptical of TikTok's argument that free expression outweighs national security concerns, but the three judges were also critical of the government's stance.",
      "TikTok's lawyer Andrew Pincus said the law \"is unprecedented and its effect would be staggering.\"",
      "\"This law imposes extraordinary speech prohibition based on indeterminate future risks,\" Pincus said. \"Notwithstanding the obvious less restrictive alternatives, the government has not come anywhere near satisfying strict scrutiny.\"",
      "Judge Sri Srinivasan said, under TikTok's rationale, the U.S. would not be able to ban a foreign country from owning a major media company in the U.S. if the two are at war.",
      "\"Is your submission that Congress can't bar the enemy's ownership of a major media source in the U.S.?\" Srinivasan, an Obama appointee, asked Pincus.",
      "When Pincus noted that news outlets like Politico and Business Insider are owned by foreign entities, Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, quickly chimed in: \"But not foreign adversaries.\"",
      "Rao also pushed back on Pincus' argument that Congress did not include any evidence of its claims that TikTok poses a national security risk in the legislation.",
      "\"I know Congress doesn't legislate all the time, but here they did,\" she said. \"They actually passed a law and many of your arguments want us to treat them as an agency. It's strange. It's a very strange framework for thinking about our first branch of government.\"",
      "Attorney Jeffrey Fisher, who represents TikTok creators, compared the restrictions on TikTok to the U.S. government hypothetically banning bookstores from selling books written by foreign authors in conjunction with a foreign government.",
      "\"We're not talking about banning Tocqueville in the United States,\" Rao countered. \"We're talking about a determination by the political branches that there's a foreign adversary that is potentially exercising covert influence in the United States. Very different.\"",
      "Ginsburg, a Reagan appointee, expressed skepticism over the notion that the law singles out TikTok.",
      "\"It describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity,\" he said, noting that the company and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns. \"That's the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "Justice Department lawyer Daniel Tenny said the data on Americans that could be collected through the app \"would be quite valuable to a foreign adversary if it were trying to approach an American to try to have them be an intelligence asset.\" Tenny also spoke about the risk of content manipulation by China.",
      "\"What is being targeted is a foreign company that controls this recommendation engine and many aspects of the algorithm that's used to determine what content is shown to Americans on the app,\" Tenny said.",
      "But Srinivasan said it's Americans' choice to use the app, despite what content may appear.",
      "\"The fact that that's being denied subjects this to serious First Amendment scrutiny,\" he said.",
      "He later added, \"What gives arguable force to the other side's First Amendment argument is that it's not just that the government is targeting curation that occurs abroad. It's the reason the curation occurring abroad is being targeted, and the reason is a concern about the content consequences of that curation in the U.S.\"",

      "The sum makes Musk, the world's richest person, the largest donor in the 2024 election cycle to either party, Federal Election Commission filings show.",
      "The bulk of Musk's spending was through his own America PAC, to which he contributed $239 million. But filings also showed that Musk was also behind a political action committee using the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's namesake \u2014 \"RBG PAC\" \u2014 in advertisements with misleading claims that Ginsburg held views on abortion that were similar to Trump's.",
      "Ginsburg's granddaughter, Clara Spera, told The New York Times in October that the PAC was an \"affront to her grandmother's legacy,\" and it was \"nothing short of appalling\" that Ginsburg's name was being used to support Trump's reelection campaign. Ginsburg openly supported abortion rights, whereas Trump put three conservative justices on the Supreme Court who were part of the majority opinion in the case striking down the federal right to an abortion.",
      "Musk put $20.5 million into the PAC, the only contribution it received. The group ran advertisements emphasizing Trump's statements that he would veto a national abortion ban if elected, and pointing to Ginsburg's statements that the decision in Roe v. Wade went too far.",
      "Musk also donated $10 million to the Senate Leadership Fund, which supports Republican Senate candidates, and $3 million to the MAHA Alliance PAC, a group affiliated with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" message.",
      "Through the America PAC, his main campaign vehicle, Musk and a handful of other donors funded a get-out-the-vote effort through door-knocking, texting, phone calls, mailers and advertisements.",
      "By far, America PAC's biggest expense was a $40.5 million payment to United States of America, Inc, a company registered last month with an address associated with Musk. It's unclear how exactly those funds were used.",
      "In October, Musk also pledged to give away $1 million a day to a registered voter in Pennsylvania who signed his petition. The sweepstakes were challenged in court, but a judge ruled that they could proceed. Musk's lawyers said the winners were not chosen by chance, but instead based on their personal stories, and the funds were part of a contract they signed to become spokespeople for his America PAC. Musk is now facing multiple lawsuits from participants who claim it was falsely billed as a lottery.",
      "He rose as a major political donor rapidly. In March, he posted on X, the social media platform Musk owns, that he would not donate to either presidential candidate. And then on July 3, he made his first contribution of $5 million to America PAC. Ten days later, he publicly announced his endorsement of Trump and quickly became a key figure in the former president's campaign.",
      "At a rally Musk held in Pennsylvania for Trump on Oct. 20, he reiterated a message featured in many of his X posts.",
      "\"This is the most important election in your lifetime,\" he said. \"If there's any election where you ever vote, it should be this one.\"",

    "story": [
      "In the wake of\u00a0UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson's killing in New York City Wednesday morning, some companies are taking additional precautionary measures to protect their executives while corporate security firms are reporting an uptick in interest in their services.",
      "The shooting of Thompson, who did not appear to have a security detail with him when he was attacked outside a Manhattan hotel, is shining a light on the business of protecting prominent corporate executives, whose security costs can reach millions of dollars per year.",
      "It's common for the top brass at public companies to be protected by guards around the clock, according to security experts. Social media's amplification of everyday individuals' dissatisfaction with a particular person, product or service has only heightened the need for protection, they say. That's particularly true in an industry like health care insurance, when many Americans say they are dissatisfied with the services they receive.",
      "Indeed, in the wake of Thompson's killing, many on social media expressed vitriol for some health insurers' practices.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told CBS Mornings about the public voicing its frustrations.",
      "To be sure, some of the biggest U.S. companies, particularly those in the tech sector, were spending heavily on personal and residential security for their top executives prior to Thompson's killing. Meta, whose businesses include Facebook and Instagram, reported the highest spending on personal security for top executives last year, at more than $24 million, filings culled by research firm Equilar show.",
      "While Thompson had an in-house security detail during his New York City visit, it wasn't with him at the time of the shooting, according to CNN, which cited a source familiar with UnitedHealthcare's security.",
      "In the wake of the attack, corporate security experts said companies should take time to evaluate their corporate security protocols and beef up protective measures, if necessary, to protect against a variety of threats.",
      "\"My phone has been ringing off hook, with calls in particular coming from health care leaders who are reevaluating their security,\" said Paul Sarnese, a safety and security consultant and former president of the International Association for Healthcare Security and Safety (IAHSS).",
      "He said the deadly incident will likely prompt more executives to seek more robust protection. \"This incident will definitely change those executives' minds that might have been reluctant to initiate security protocols. I think they'll be more receptive to executive protection,\" he said.",
      "Too much information",
      "In the wake of Thompson's death, some companies are taking steps to limit publicly available information about their executives. For example, a page on UnitedHealthcare's website about the company's leadership \u2014 where Thompson and other executives' bios were listed \u2014\u00a0no longer exists, and instead redirects to the company's home page.",
      "Medica, a Minnesota-based nonprofit health care firm, as well as other insurers have taken similar actions, their websites show.",
      "Medica told the Associated Press Friday that it is temporarily closing its six offices for security reasons, in addition to removing executives bios' from its website.",
      "\"Although we have received no specific threats related to our campuses, our office buildings will be temporarily closed out of an abundance of caution,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Experts say these types of moves are wise.",
      "\"I think we share too much. I don't need to know where you live and that you're married and have three wonderful kids,\" Sarnese said. \"We don't need to advertise to the public where the president and CEO are sitting.\"",
      "While executives across all industries should be evaluating their security postures, healthcare industry professionals have received more threats in recent years as a result of divisiveness that arose around safety protocols, including mask mandates, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sarnese said.",
      "\"Every industry has challenges because there is always going to be somebody who is upset with a service or product or philosophy. But COVID changed everything. We never saw the level of threats we saw during COVID toward healthcare workers and leaders, because of some of the mistrust and misinformation that was out there in the community,\" he said.",
      "\"All the ways things can go wrong\"",
      "Security industry veteran Brittney Blair of K2 Integrity said that online threat monitoring is as essential as physical protection.",
      "More companies are becoming more active in tracking cyber threats, including monitoring the web and dark web.",

      "A United States Navy seaman who died during the attack on Pearl Harbor has been accounted for decades after his death, military officials said Thursday.",
      "U.S. Navy Seaman 2nd Class John C. Auld, 23, was from Newcastle, England, according to a news release from the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. He was assigned to the USS Oklahoma, a battleship moored at Pearl Harbor, in 1941.",
      "On Dec. 7, Auld was aboard the ship when Japanese pilots attacked Pearl Harbor. During the attack, the USS Oklahoma took multiple torpedo hits and capsized just 12 minutes after it was first hit, according to the Department of Defense. Four hundred and twenty-nine crewmembers, including Auld, died. Only 32 crewmembers survived, thanks to what the Department of Defense called \"acts of valor\" by other military members. It was the greatest death toll from any ship that day, other than the USS Arizona, which lost over 1,100 seamen.",
      "It took three years for Navy personnel to recover the crew's remains. The remains were interred in the Halawa and Nu'uanu Cemeteries on Oahu in 1944, and in 1947, military officials began working to identify the remains. The remains were disinterred and transferred to a laboratory, where 35 sets of remains were identified.",
      "The unidentified remains were buried again at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, Hawaii. The names of those who could not be identified were recorded on the Courts of the Missing at the cemetery.",
      "Between June and November 2015, those remains were again exhumed and analyzed at the DPAA's laboratory. Scientists used anthropological analysis, DNA analysis, and circumstantial and material evidence to make the identification. In 2018, Auld's remains were identified. However, it wasn't until recently that the DPAA was made aware that Auld's family had been notified of his identification, which led to a delay in the announcement.",
      "The Department of Defense announced earlier this month that the remains of all crewmembers who died aboard the USS Oklahoma have been identified. Pearl Harbor survivors will commemorate the 83rd anniversary of the attack on Saturday.",
      "Now that Auld has been identified, a rosette will be placed next to his name at the Courts of the Missing. He was buried in Albuquerque, New Mexico on Friday morning, according to the DPAA and a funeral notice shared online.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 12:01:03 -0500",
    "summary": "The group Students for Fair Admissions challenged the U.S. Naval Academy's use of race in its admissions program.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal district court on Friday upheld the U.S. Naval Academy's race-conscious admissions policies, rejecting a challenge brought by the group Students for Fair Admissions following the Supreme Court's landmark decision ending affirmative action in higher education.",
      "U.S. Senior District Judge Richard Bennett wrote in a 179-page decision that the Naval Academy \"established a compelling national security interest in a diverse officer corps\" for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, and tied its use of race in admissions to \"the realization of an officer corps that represents the country it protects and the people it leads.\"",
      "Bennett said the academy's race-conscious admissions policy must receive deference extended to military judgments, which he said are set by the president and not the federal judiciary.",
      "\"The Naval Academy's race-conscious admissions policies are narrowly tailored to further a compelling governmental interest in national security,\" he wrote. \"Defendants have proven that the Naval Academy's limited use of race in admissions has increased the racial diversity of the Navy and Marine Corps, which has enhanced national security by improving the Navy and Marine Corps' unit cohesion and lethality, recruitment and retention, and domestic and international legitimacy.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Naval Academy said it is reviewing the court's decision. Edward Blum, president of Students for Fair Admissions, said the group is \"disappointed\" by the ruling and will appeal.",
      "\"It is our hope that the U.S. military academies ultimately will be compelled to follow the Supreme Court's prohibition of race in college admissions,\" he said in a statement.",
      "The challenge to the Naval Academy's admissions policies was brought by Students for Fair Admissions in October 2023, just three months after the Supreme Court ruled that race-conscious admissions policies used by colleges and universities were unconstitutional. The group was behind the cases that led the high court to reject affirmative action in higher education in June 2023.",
      "Students for Fair Admissions' lawsuit came in response to a footnote in the majority opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, which said the decision did not apply to the nation's service academies. The organization sought to expand the Supreme Court's affirmative action ruling to include the Naval Academy, based in Annapolis, Maryland, and the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York, which it separately sued in September 2023.",
      "Students for Fair Admissions had argued that the Naval Academy's admissions process was unconstitutional because it discriminated based on race. But the service academy argued that a racially diverse officer corps is necessary to execute the Navy's mission and provide national security.",
      "The court held a nine-day trial in September, which included testimony from 18 witnesses.",
      "\"The evidence in this case clearly indicates that the Naval Academy does not employ quotas, admit candidates based solely on their race or ethnicity, or place minority candidates on separate admissions tracks,\" Bennett, who served over 20 years in the U.S. Army Reserve and Maryland National Guard, wrote.",
      "The court found that the Naval Academy's admissions policies mandate that race be taken into consideration only in limited circumstances. In each of those instances, Bennett said, race is \"nondeterminative\" and is one of several factors used to assess an applicant's potential as a midshipman and eventual officer in the Navy or Marine Corps.",
      "Additionally, the court found that the Naval Academy has implemented \"extensive race-neutral factors\" within and outside of its admissions policies in an effort to achieve diversity, such as socioeconomic factors, whether an applicant has faced adversity or if a candidate is a first-generation college student. The court also highlighted the academy's recruiting and outreach efforts, which it said are \"extensive and multifaceted.\"",
      "\"The Naval Academy has established a compelling national security interest in a diverse officer corps in the Navy and Marine Corps. Furthermore, that interest is indeed measurable, and the Academy's admissions program is narrowly tailored to meet that interest,\" Bennett wrote. \"In short, this court defers to the executive branch with respect to military personnel decisions.\"",
      "The Naval Academy typically receives between 14,000 and 16,000 applicants and admits roughly 1,000 midshipmen each year. Those students then enter the Navy or Marine Corps officer corps for a five-year commitment after graduating. The admissions process is rigorous \u2014 in addition to submitting SAT or ACT results, a high school transcript and personal information, prospective students must also participate in an interview and receive a nomination from a member of Congress, the vice president, president or secretary of the Navy. Applicants must also pass a physical exam performed by a Defense Department review board.",

    "story": [
      "Employers added\u00a0227,000 jobs in November as the labor market rebounded from anemic growth in the prior month, when hurricanes and labor disputes dampened hiring.",
      "The unemployment rate ticked higher to 4.2% from 4.1% in the prior month. The U.S. had been forecast to add 200,000 jobs last month, according to economists surveyed by financial data firm FactSet. The unemployment rate was expected to hold steady at 4.1%.",
      "While hiring rebounded last month, the job market overall has been weakening in recent months under the strain of the Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy, with the central bank boosting borrowing rates to their highest point in 23 years to combat inflation. It's also taking longer for hundreds of thousands of out-of-work Americans to find new jobs, signaling cracks within a once-hot labor market as employers continue to cope with the impact of higher borrowing costs.",
      "\"After a prior month of hurricanes and worker strikes, we did get a bounce back in the headline payroll numbers plus positive revisions,\" said Bryon Anderson, head of fixed income at Laffer Tengler Investments, in an email. \"Jobs creation may not be as robust as in the past years, but we are not seeing a disaster in the job market. \"",
      "The end of labor disputes in October, including the Boeing machinists' strike, could have boosted job growth by almost 40,000, noted Goldman Sachs analysts in a report released ahead of the jobs report.",
      "October's jobs report was revised upward to 36,000 new jobs last month, versus the original report that employers had added 12,000 hires that month.",
      "Hiring in November rose in health care, leisure and hospitality, the government sector and social assistance, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. The retail industry shed 28,000 jobs last month, however, it added.",
      "Layoffs at lowest in two decades",
      "The Fed jacked up interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023 to combat the highest inflation in 40 years. Defying predictions, the economy kept growing despite much higher borrowing rates for consumers and businesses, although the job market has been slowing since early this year.",
      "Even so, Americans as a whole have been enjoying unusual job security. This week, the government reported that layoffs fell to just 1.6 million in October, below the lowest levels in the two decades that preceded the pandemic. At the same time, the number of job openings rebounded from a 3 1/2 year low, a sign that businesses are still seeking workers even though hiring has cooled.",
      "The economy grew at a 2.8% annual pace from July through September on healthy spending by consumers. Annual economic growth has topped a decent 2% in eight of the past nine quarters. And inflation has dropped from a 9.1% peak in June 2022 to 2.6% last month.",
      "Even so, Americans were deeply frustrated by still-high prices under the Biden-Harris administration, and partly for that reason chose last month to return Donald Trump to the White House.",
      "The progress against inflation and the slowdown in hiring, which eases pressure on companies to raise wages and prices, led the Fed to cut its key rate in September and again last month. Another rate cut is expected to be announced when the Fed meets December 17-18.",

      "The long-winged seabird named Wisdom, a Laysan albatross, returned to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge at the northwestern edge of the Hawaiian Archipelago and laid what experts estimate may be her 60th egg, the Pacific Region of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service said in a Facebook post this week.",
      "Wisdom and her mate, Akeakamai, had returned to the atoll in the Pacific Ocean to lay and hatch eggs since 2006.

    "summary": "Most ruling party South Korean lawmakers are boycotting a vote on whether to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol after his martial law declaration.",
    "story": [
      "Most ruling party lawmakers were boycotting a parliamentary vote Saturday to deny a two-thirds majority sought by the opposition to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived imposition of martial law, as protests grew nationwide calling for his removal.",
      "The likely defeat of the motion is expected to intensify public protests calling for Yoon's ouster and deepen political chaos in South Korea, with a survey suggesting a majority of South Koreans support the president's impeachment. Yoon's martial law declaration drew criticism from his own ruling conservative party, but it is also determined to oppose Yoon's impeachment apparently because it fears losing presidency to liberals.",
      "Impeaching Yoon would require support from two-thirds of the National Assembly, or 200 of its 300 members. The opposition parties who brought the impeachment motion have 192 seats, meaning they need at least eight additional votes from Yoon's People Power Party.",
      "The opposition-controlled parliament began a vote earlier Saturday, but only three lawmakers from PPP took part with opposition members. If the number of lawmakers who cast ballots doesn't reach 200, the motion will be scrapped at midnight, according to National Assembly. Opposition parties could submit a new impeachment motion after a new parliamentary session opens next Wednesday.",
      "National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik urged ruling party members to return to the chamber to participate in the vote, stressing that it was closely watched by the nation and also the world.",
      "\"Don't make a shameful judgment and please vote based on your convictions,\" Woo said. \"I plead to you, for the future of the Republic of Korea.\"",
      "Earlier Saturday, Yoon issued a public apology over the martial law decree, saying he won't shirk legal or political responsibility for the declaration and promising not to make another attempt to impose martial law. He said would leave it to his party to chart a course through the country's political turmoil, \"including matters related to my term in office.\"",
      "\"The declaration of this martial law was made out of my desperation. But in the course of its implementation, it caused anxiety and inconveniences to the public. I feel very sorry over that and truly apologize to the people who must have been shocked a lot,\" Yoon said.",
      "Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has struggled to push his agenda through an opposition-controlled parliament and grappled with low approval ratings amid\u00a0scandals\u00a0involving himself and his wife. In his martial law announcement on Tuesday night, Yoon called parliament a \"den of criminals\" bogging down state affairs and vowed to eliminate \"shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces.\"",
      "The turmoil resulting from Yoon's bizarre and poorly-thought-out stunt has\u00a0paralyzed South Korean politics\u00a0and sparked alarm among key diplomatic partners, including neighboring Japan and Seoul's top ally the United States, as one of the strongest democracies in Asia faces a political crisis that could unseat its leader.",
      "Tuesday night saw special forces troops encircling the parliament building and army helicopters hovering over it, but the military withdrew after the National Assembly unanimously voted to overturn the decree, forcing Yoon to lift it before daybreak Wednesday. The declaration of martial law was the first of its kind in more than 40 years in South Korea. Eighteen lawmakers from the ruling party voted to reject Yoon's martial law decree along with opposition lawmakers.",
      "The passage of Yoon's impeachment motion appeared more likely Friday when the chair of Yoon's party called for his removal on Friday, but the party remained formally opposed to impeachment.",
      "On Saturday, tens of thousands of people packed streets near the National Assembly, waving banners, shouting slogans and dancing and singing along to K-pop songs with lyrics changed to call for Yoon's ouster. A smaller crowd of Yoon's supporters, which still seemed to be in the thousands, rallied in separate streets in Seoul, decrying the impeachment attempt they saw as unconstitutional.",
      "Lawmakers on Saturday first voted on a bill appointing a special prosecutor to investigate stock price manipulation allegations surrounding Yoon's wife. Some lawmakers from Yoon's party were seen leaving the hall after that vote, triggering angry shouts from opposition lawmakers.",
      "If Yoon is impeached, his powers will be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to remove him from office. If he is removed, an election to replace him must take place within 60 days.",
      "Opposition lawmakers say that Yoon's attempt at martial law amounted to a self-coup, and drafted the impeachment motion around rebellion charges.",
      "Lee Jae-myung, the leader of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, told reporters that Yoon's speech was \"greatly disappointing\" and that the only way forward is his immediate resignation or impeachment.",
      "On Friday,\u00a0PPP chair Han Dong-hun,\u00a0who criticized Yoon's martial law declaration, said he had received intelligence that during the brief period of martial law Yoon ordered the country's defense counterintelligence commander to arrest and detain unspecified key politicians based on accusations of \"anti-state activities.\"",

      "The Defense Ministry said it had suspended the defense counterintelligence commander, Yeo In-hyung, who Han alleged had received orders from Yoon to detain the politicians. The ministry also suspended the commanders of the capital defense command and the special warfare command over their involvement in enforcing martial law.",

    "story": [
      "A United States Navy seaman who died during the attack on Pearl Harbor has been accounted for decades after his death, military officials said Thursday.",
      "U.S. Navy Seaman 2nd Class John C. Auld, 23, was from Newcastle, England, according to a news release from the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. He was assigned to the USS Oklahoma, a battleship moored at Pearl Harbor, in 1941.",
      "On Dec. 7, Auld was aboard the ship when Japanese pilots attacked Pearl Harbor. During the attack, the USS Oklahoma took multiple torpedo hits and capsized just 12 minutes after it was first hit, according to the Department of Defense. Four hundred and twenty-nine crewmembers, including Auld, died. Only 32 crewmembers survived, thanks to what the Department of Defense called \"acts of valor\" by other military members. It was the greatest death toll from any ship that day, other than the USS Arizona, which lost over 1,100 seamen.",
      "It took three years for Navy personnel to recover the crew's remains. The remains were interred in the Halawa and Nu'uanu Cemeteries on Oahu in 1944, and in 1947, military officials began working to identify the remains. The remains were disinterred and transferred to a laboratory, where 35 sets of remains were identified.",
      "The unidentified remains were buried again at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, Hawaii. The names of those who could not be identified were recorded on the Courts of the Missing at the cemetery.",
      "Between June and November 2015, those remains were again exhumed and analyzed at the DPAA's laboratory. Scientists used anthropological analysis, DNA analysis, and circumstantial and material evidence to make the identification. In 2018, Auld's remains were identified. However, it wasn't until recently that the DPAA was made aware that Auld's family had been notified of his identification, which led to a delay in the announcement.",
      "The Department of Defense announced earlier this month that the remains of all crewmembers who died aboard the USS Oklahoma have been identified. Pearl Harbor survivors will commemorate the 83rd anniversary of the attack on Saturday.",
      "Now that Auld has been identified, a rosette will be placed next to his name at the Courts of the Missing. He was buried in Albuquerque, New Mexico on Friday morning, according to the DPAA and a funeral notice shared online.",

    "story": [
      "An alternative healer who advocated \"slapping therapy\" to treat a range of maladies was sentenced Friday to 10 years in prison for the death of a 71-year-old diabetic woman who stopped taking insulin during one of his workshops.",
      "Hongchi Xiao, 61, was convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence for failing to get medical help for Danielle Carr-Gomm as she howled in pain and frothed at the mouth during the fourth day of a workshop in October 2016.",
      "Xiao, of Cloudbreak, California, promoted paida lajin therapy, getting patients to slap themselves repeatedly to release \"poisonous waste\" from the body. The technique has its roots in Chinese medicine but critics say it has no scientific basis and patients often end up with bruises, bleeding - or worse.",
      "Carr-Gomm was one of two of Xiao's patients who died.",
      "He was extradited from Australia, where he had been convicted of manslaughter after a 6-year-old boy died when his parents withdrew his insulin medication after attending one of his workshops in Sydney.",
      "\"I consider you dangerous even though you do not share the characteristics of most other dangerous offenders,\" Justice Robert Bright said during sentencing at Winchester Crown Court.",
      "\"You knew from late in the afternoon of day one of the fact that Danielle Carr-Gomm had stopped taking her insulin,\" the judge said. \"Furthermore, you made it clear to her you supported this.\"",
      "Bright said Xiao only made a \"token effort\" to get Carr-Gomm to take her insulin once it was too late and had shown no sign of remorse as he continued to promote paida lajin in prison.",
      "Carr-Gomm was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 1999 and was desperate to find a cure that didn't involve injecting herself with needles, her son, Matthew, said.",
      "\"She always maintained a healthy lifestyle and was adamant that nothing would stop her from living a full life,\" Matthew said, according to the BBC.",
      "She sought out alternative treatments and had attended a previous workshop by Xiao in Bulgaria a few months before her death in which she also became seriously ill after ceasing her medication.",
      "However, she recorded a video testimonial, calling Xiao a \"messenger sent by God\" who was \"starting a revolution to put the power back in the hands of the people to cure themselves and to change the whole system of healthcare.\"",
      "The court heard that Xiao said \"well done\" to Carr-Gomm after she told the participants that she had stopped taking her insulin at the week-long retreat, the BBC reported.",
      "By day three, Carr-Gomm was \"vomiting, tired and weak, and by the evening she was howling in pain and unable to respond to questions,\" prosecutor Duncan Atkinson said.",
      "A chef who wanted to call an ambulance said she deferred to those with holistic healing experience.",
      "\"Those who had received and accepted the defendant's teachings misinterpreted Mrs. Carr-Gomm's condition as a healing crisis,\" Atkinson said.",
      "The BBC reported that while sentencing Xiao on Friday, Bright said: \"You congratulated her [Danielle] when you found out she had stopped taking insulin. You failed to summon emergency medical care when you of all people knew she was likely to die without insulin. I believe you will continue to practice it. There is a risk you will actively or tacitly encourage followers to reduce their medication.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 12:21:15 -0500",
    "summary": "French Prime Minister Michel Barnier is resigning after a no-confidence vote by lawmakers, fueling concern over a \"new era of political instability.\"",
    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French Prime Minister Michel Barnier on Thursday was meeting Emmanuel Macron to submit his resignation after losing a vote of no confidence in parliament, with the president urgently seeking ways to halt growing political and financial chaos. Poised to be contemporary France's shortest-serving premier, Barnier arrived at the Elysee Palace just after 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. Eastern) for the resignation formality, with the outgoing premier and government constitutionally obliged to step down after the defeat in parliament.",
      "A majority of lawmakers supported the no-confidence vote Wednesday that was proposed by the hard-left and backed by the far-right, headed by Marine Le Pen.",
      "Barnier's record-quick ejection comes after snap parliamentary elections this summer that resulted in a hung parliament, with no political force able to form an overall majority and the far-right holding the key to the government's survival.",
      "The trigger for Barnier's ouster was his 2025 budget plan including austerity measures that were unacceptable to a majority in parliament, but that he argued were necessary to stabilize France's finances. On Monday he had forced through a social security financing bill without a vote.",
      "The successful no-confidence motion cancelled the government's entire financing plan, leading to an automatic renewal of the current budget into next year, unless any new government can somehow rush through approval of a new budget by Christmas \u2014 an unlikely scenario.",
      "\"France probably won't have a 2025 budget,\" said ING Economics in a note, predicting that the country \"is entering a new era of political instability.\"",
      "Moody's, a ratings agency, warned that Barnier's fall \"deepens the country's political stalemate\" and \"reduces the probability of a consolidation of public finances.\"",
      "The Paris stock exchange fell at the opening on Thursday before recovering to show small gains, while the yields on French government bonds were again under upward pressure in debt markets.",
      "Macron now has the unenviable task of picking a viable successor. The president was to address the nation Thursday evening, his office said. Macron has more than two years of his presidential term left, but some opponents are calling on him to resign, too.",
      "National Assembly Speaker Yael Braun-Pivet on Thursday urged Macron to waste no time in choosing a new premier, saying France could not be allowed to \"drift\" for any length of time.",
      "There was no indication early Thursday of how quickly Macron would appoint Barnier's successor, nor what their political leanings might be.",
      "Loyalist Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu and Macron's centrist ally Francois Bayrou have been touted as possible contenders, as has former Socialist premier and interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve.",
      "With the support of the far-right, a majority of 331 MPs in the 577-member chamber voted to oust the government on Wednesday night. It was the first successful no-confidence vote since a defeat for Georges Pompidou's government in 1962, when Charles de Gaulle was president.",
      "Macron flew back into Paris just ahead of the vote after wrapping up a three-day state visit to Saudi Arabia, an apparent world away from the domestic crisis.",
      "\"We are now calling on Macron to go,\" Mathilde Panot, head of the parliamentary faction of the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party, told reporters. She urged \"early presidential elections\" to solve the deepening political crisis.",
      "But taking care not to crow over the government's fall, Le Pen said in a television interview that her party \u2014 once a new premier is appointed \u2014 \"would let them work\" and help create a \"budget that is acceptable for everyone.\"",
      "Laurent Wauquiez, the head of right-wing deputies in parliament, said the far-right and hard-left bore the responsibility for a no-confidence vote.",
      "Barnier is the fifth prime minister to serve under Macron since he came to power in 2017, with every premier serving a successively shorter period.",
      "Given the composition of the National Assembly, there is no guarantee that Barnier's successor will last any longer.",
      "Strike calls across transport, education and other public sector services were kept in place Thursday despite the disappearance of the austerity budget that has prompted so much anger.",
      "The plunge into more uncertainty comes ahead of the reopening of the Notre-Dame cathedral on Saturday after a 2019 fire, a major international event hosted by Macron.",
      "Guests include Donald Trump, who will make it his first foreign trip since being re-elected to serve as the U.S. president for a second term.",

    "summary": "A court handwriting expert may have helped reveal true identity of a leading Byzantine painter.",
    "story": [
      "Crime-solving techniques applied to a medieval illuminated manuscript in Paris may have solved a centuries-old puzzle - the true identity of a leading Byzantine painter who injected humanity into the rigid sanctity of Orthodox religious art.",
      "A contemporary of Giotto, considered the father of Western painting, the artist conventionally known as Manuel Panselinos was equally influential in a totally different tradition that's largely overlooked in the West.",
      "But nothing is known of his life, and scholars now believe Panselinos was just a nickname that eventually supplanted the real name of the man for whom it was coined - likely Ioannis Astrapas, from the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki.",
      "The art of Byzantium, that decorates churches across Greece, Serbia and other Orthodox countries, stands out for the stark formalism of its elongated, glowering saints, quasi-cubist mountains and doe-eyed Madonnas.",
      "Work attributed to Panselinos, from the late 13th and early 14th centuries, is considered the finest produced in an empire that straddled Europe and Asia and endured from the fall of Rome until the capture of the imperial capital Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks in 1453.",
      "Art historians had long suspected that the name - Greek for \"full moon\" - could have originated as a nickname for some member of the so-called Macedonian School of painting, based in Thessaloniki.",
      "Recent research by a Greek monk and linguistics scholar linked \"Panselinos\" with Macedonian School painter Astrapas. Now court handwriting expert Christina Sotirakoglou has matched lettering on a manuscript tentatively attributed to Astrapas with characters on a church painting in northern Greece, long seen as Panselinos' best work.",
      "Father Cosmas Simonopetritis, a former senior administrator in Mount Athos, the semiautonomous monastic community where the Protato church stands, says Sotirakoglou's and his own research \"clearly prove\" Panselinos' real identity.",
      "\"Panselinos was a real person, and (the name) was just the nickname by which Ioannis Astrapas became known,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "Constantinos Vafiadis, a professor of Byzantine art in Athens who was not involved in the studies, said he found merit in the nickname theory and Astrapas link, even though it appeared more than one painter had undertaken the Protato project.",
      "\"I agree with attributing part of the paintings to Ioannis Astrapas,\" he said. \"But again there remains much ground for future research into that person, because other Mount Athos monuments from the same period have not yet been sufficiently published.\"",
      "\"Panselinos\" - a role model for generations of painters - and his contemporaries are associated with a renaissance of kinds in Orthodox art that revived forms and techniques inherited from antiquity. Facial expressions acquired a deeper humanity, and greater attention was paid to proportion and depth of field in composition.",
      "Father Cosmas said Astrapas was an \"extremely gifted painter ... with vast knowledge who harmonically combined the ancient, classical world with Orthodox Byzantine spirituality.\"",
      "\"And that ... makes his work unique worldwide,\" he added.",
      "Artists' signatures were not common at the time, although some survive from members of the Astrapas family. There are none by \"Panselinos.\"",
      "The trail started with earlier research linking Astrapas with the artist and scholar who wrote and illustrated Marcian Codex GR 516, an early 14th century Greek handwritten text treating subjects from astronomy to music theory. Among the painted illustrations was a full moon.",
      "\"For me ... that was the main proof,\" Father Cosmas said.",
      "With a name found for the hand that produced the manuscript, the next step was to check its style against writing on the Protato painting, traditionally linked with \"Panselinos.\"",
      "\"Mrs. Sotirakoglou, who is a handwriting expert, filled in that blank,\" Father Cosmas said.",
      "There was one problem: Women have for more than 1,000 years been banned from entering Mount Athos.",
      "\"I was forced to study the Protato paintings based on photographs,\" Sotirakoglou, who works as a court consultant on identifying or authenticating handwriting in criminal cases, told the AP.",
      "\"(The work) was very difficult, because the writing on the wall paintings is in capital letters, and the painters subdued their personal handwriting to conform\" with the traditional format, she said - rather like anonymous letter-writers' attempts to disguise their true style. \"The Marcian codex is written in very small lower-case letters.\"",
      "The first clue came from the Greek letter Phi, the English F.",
      "\"It's a Phi that stands out, and is similar\" in both the manuscript and the Protato painting, she said. \"Matches also followed with other letters, T, with its proportions, which is bigger, covering the other letters and is topped with a curve, the proportions of the K.\"",
      "\"But when the Phi was revealed, the code of the writing was broken and the job became much easier,\" she added.",
      "Father Cosmas said that during his administrative duties on Mount Athos he attended services at the Protato church on a daily basis.",
      "\"That's where my desire was born ... to explore the mystery around the name and the identity of Panselinos,\" he said, adding that he thinks the artist \"has now acquired his true identity.\"",

    "summary": "Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department said it was increasing the reward for the top leader of the Jalisco cartel to $15 million.",
    "story": [
      "Mexican soldiers and marines have seized over a ton of fentanyl pills in two raids in the north, with officials calling it the biggest catch of the synthetic opioid in the country's history.",
      "The raids came after a sharp drop in fentanyl seizures in Mexico earlier this year, and days after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatened to impose 25% tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico unless those countries cracked down on the flow of migrants and drugs across the border.",
      "Experts say the timing may not be a coincidence.",
      "\"It is clear that the Mexican government has been managing the timing of fentanyl seizures,\" said security analyst David Saucedo. \"But under the pressure by Donald Trump, it appears President Claudia Sheinbaum's administration is willing to the increase the capture of drug traffickers and drug seizures that Washington is demanding.\"",
      "Saucedo said it's clear the Mexican government \"doesn't see fentanyl as one of its own problems, and fighting it isn't its priority,\" He added there would only be big busts \"when there is pressure from Washington.\"",
      "Mexico's top security official said soldiers and marines late Tuesday spotted two men carrying guns in the northern state of Sinaloa, home to the drug cartel of the same name.",
      "They chased the men, who ran into two houses. In one house soldiers found about 660 pounds of fentanyl, and in the other a truck packed with about 1,750 pounds of the drug, mostly in pill form.",
      "\"In Sinaloa, we achieved the biggest seizure in history of fentanyl,\" Public Safety Secretary Omar Garcia Harfuch wrote in his social media accounts. Several guns were also seized and two men were arrested.",
      "President Sheinbaum said Wednesday that \"this is an investigation that had been going on for some time, and yesterday it bore fruit.\"",
      "But that claim contrasts with the seemingly random nature of the bust, which started when a military patrol \"noticed the presence of two men carrying what appeared to be guns.\"",
      "In the past, Mexican security forces have sometimes used the story of following armed men running into houses as a pretext to enter homes without search warrants. In at least one case, the government version was disproved by security camera footage.",
      "The latest haul was striking because fentanyl seizures in Mexico had fallen dramatically in the first half of the year. At some points during the summer, under former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, federal forces reported seizures amounted to as little as 50 grams (2 ounces) per week.",
      "Figures for the first half of 2024 show that Mexican federal forces seized only 286 pounds (130 kilograms) of fentanyl nationwide between January and June, down 94% from the 5,135 pounds (2,329 kilograms) seized in 2023.",
      "The synthetic opioid has been blamed for about 70,000 overdose deaths annually in the United States, and U.S. officials have tried to step up efforts to seize it as it comes over the border, often in the form of counterfeit pills made in Mexico from precursor chemicals largely imported from China.",
      "As \"60 Minutes\" reported, the fentanyl crisis began 10 years ago when the cartels started to wrestle control of the supply chain from China, purchasing the drug's precursor chemicals to make fentanyl themselves in clandestine labs in Mexico. In 2019, China \"scheduled,\" or blocked, finished fentanyl from being exported to the U.S., further cementing the cartels' domination of the pipeline.",
      "L\u00f3pez Obrador always denied that fentanyl is even produced in Mexico, though experts - and even members of his own administration - acknowledge that it is.",
      "And if Mexico doesn't go after those fentanyl production facilities, then they will still be churning out similar quantities in the future.",
      "\"It's a very very big seizure,\" Saucedo said. \"But if they don't dismantle the labs, this kind of production will continue.\"",
      "Also Wednesday, the U.S. State Department announced it was increasing the reward for the top leader of another cartel, Nemesio Oseguera, from $10 million to $15 million.",
      "Oseguera, known by his nickname \"El Mencho,\" leads the Jalisco cartel, which like Sinaloa, is heavily involved in the manufacture and distribution of fentanyl and methamphetamines.",

      "At the trial, the jurors were driven back and forth to court in vans with tinted windows to protect their anonymity, the BBC reported, and their identities were even kept from prosecutors and defense lawyers.",

    "story": [
      "Manila, Philippines\u00a0\u2014 Philippine police officials said Thursday they were checking reports that a kidnapped American died after being shot twice while resisting his Oct. 17 abduction by gunmen in the country's south. Elliot Eastman, 26, from Vermont, was shot twice with an M16 rifle while trying to fight off his four kidnappers, who posed as police officers, in the coastal town of Sibuco in Zamboanga del Norte province, police said.",
      "The kidnappers dragged him to a motorboat and sped off, according to earlier police reports.",
      "A massive search for Eastman and his abductors led to the arrest of a number of suspects, but he has not been found. Three suspects were killed in a gunbattle with police in the south last month.",
      "Regional police spokesperson Lt. Col. Ramoncelio Sawan said investigators received information from a relative of one of the suspects that Eastman died due to gunshot wounds in the thigh and abdomen while being taken away by his abductors. The kidnappers decided to throw his body into the sea after he died, the relative said.",
      "The information about Eastman's death was later corroborated by a key suspect in the kidnapping who was arrested recently, and his sworn statement has been submitted to government prosecutors, Sawan said. Criminal complaints of kidnapping have been filed against several suspects, he said.",
      "\"We are constrained to believe that he has died. All of the information that we have points to that,\" Sawan said. But he added that without the victim's body, \"we're still leaving a little bit of hope that it may not be the case\" and police would continue their investigation.",
      "Philippine police have informed Eastman's Filipino wife and the U.S. Embassy in Manila about his reported death, Sawan said.",
      "The embassy said it's aware of the police report and is coordinating with Philippine authorities, but did not comment further due to privacy considerations.",
      "Eastman traveled out of the Philippines and returned to Sibuco to attend his wife's graduation when he was kidnapped. He had been posting YouTube and Facebook videos of his life in Sibuco, a poor, remote coastal town, where the suspects spotted him, police said earlier.",
      "They said the suspects appeared to be common criminals who did not belong to any Muslim rebel groups which have been accused of ransom kidnappings in the past.",
      "Security problems have long hounded the southern Philippines, the homeland of a Muslim minority in the largely Roman Catholic nation.",
      "The southern third of the Philippines has bountiful resources but has long been hamstrung by poverty, insurgencies and outlaws.",
      "On his YouTube page, Eastman said he came to the Philippines and met \"the love of my life deep in the mountains\" of Zamboanga del Norte, which he said he would be exploring to offer followers a glimpse of \"day to day life as the first and only foreigner\" to take up permanent residence in the remote region.",
      "A 2014 peace agreement between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the largest of several Muslim separatist groups, has considerably eased widespread fighting in the south. Relentless military offensives have weakened smaller armed groups such as the Abu Sayyaf, reducing kidnappings, bombings and other violence.",
      "The Abu Sayyaf has targeted Americans and other Western tourists and missionaries, most of whom were freed after ransoms were paid. A few were killed, including American Guillermo Sobero, who was beheaded on the southern island of Basilan, and a U.S. missionary, Martin Burnham, who was killed while Philippine army forces were trying to rescue him and his wife, Gracia Burnham, in 2002 in a rainforest near Sibuco.",

      "David Blum of New York Magazine first coined the term Brat Pack in 1985, when he compared a group of then rising stars in their 20s, including Lowe, to the famous Rat Pack. Though the cohort disliked the label, it became popular with fans, and its members are still known by the nickname almost four decades later.",
      "During an interview with the Wall Street Journal published Tuesday, Lowe, now 60, explained that he now views the label in a more favorable light.",

      "Along with Lowe, the Brat Pack members include Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Demi Moore, Andrew McCarthy, Ally Sheedy, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall, Estevez and Jon Cryer, among others. However, which actors fit into the group has not always been clear.",
      "In Blum's New York Magazine article, titled \"Hollywood's Brat Pack,\" the journalist designated Lowe, Estevez and Nelson as members of the Brat Pack, though he named other young stars including Tom Cruise, Sean Penn and Nicolas Cage as potential members.",
      "\"This is the Hollywood 'Brat Pack,'\" Blum wrote. \"It is to the 1980s what the Rat Pack was to the 1960s\u2014a roving band of famous young stars on the prowl for parties, women, and a good time.\"",
      "The '80s stars branded as the Brat Pack have often expressed their dislike of the moniker. (Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images)",
      "During an August interview with People magazine, Lowe expressed his disdain for Blum's story and the label.",
      "\"The article was horrible,\" he said. \"It was a hit piece, there's no doubt about it. It was designed to belittle us, make us look small, with that journalistic trick of plausible deniability.\"",
      "In a 1987 Los Angeles Times article, Blum defended himself against the backlash that he received from the actors he deemed the Brat Pack in his New York Magazine story.",
      "Blum wrote that the article originated as a profile on Estevez during the filming of \"St. Elmo's Fire.\" He revealed that he came up with the Brat Pack moniker after spending a night out with Estevez, Lowe and Nelson.",
      "\"I wouldn\u2019t call it an inspiration exactly. I did think it was pretty clever,\" Blum wrote. \"It also seemed like an excellent way to describe the actors I\u2019d gotten to know ever so slightly through my reporting.\"",
      "He continued, \"They had acted like \u2014 well, I might as well say it \u2014 brats, which is not to say that I would not have acted precisely the same way if I were 23 years old, famous and rich. I might have. I might have been worse. But these guys definitely fit the bill.\"",
      "The term Brat Pack was coined by journalist David Blum. (Frank Edwards/Fotos International/Getty Images)",
      "Lowe told People magazine that experiencing the aftereffects of Blum's article \"was no fun.\" However, he noted that the author's portrayal of him in the story was not as negative as those of the other actors.",
      "\"I actually came out okay in it,\" he said. \"It was the one night I went home early. What a rarity. So somebody was looking out for me.\"",

      "ROB LOWE REVEALS THREE SECRETS TO HIS 31-YEAR MARRIAGE",
      "\"Everyone in Hollywood differs over who belongs to the Brat Pack,\" he wrote. \"That is because they are basing their decision on such trivial matters as whose movie is the biggest hit, whose star is rising and whose is falling, whose face is on the cover of Rolling Stone and whose isn\u2019t. And occasionally, some poor, misguided fool bases his judgment on whose talent is the greatest.\"",
      "\"All of us should feel lucky to have been given a name for what we contributed as actors and that fans still care 40 years later.\"",
      "Blum went on to claim that, unlike the Rat Pack's Marlon Brando, James Dean, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, none of the Brat Pack members had accumulated years of acting study. He also noted that the Brat Pack actors were not college graduates.",
      "In the WSJ article, Lowe recalled how he fell in love with acting at a young age after watching the musical \"Oliver!\"",
      "When Lowe was 12, his family moved to Malibu, California, where he began filming movies using a Super 8 camera with Sean Penn's late brother Chris Penn and other kids, some of whom would later rise to stardom.",

      "\"I figured film school could wait,\" he added. \"Then came two movies a year and I never went to college. I learned to act by watching more experienced actors on sets and by doing the job. Later, I began working with an acting coach.\"",

    "story": [
      "Elton John completed his \"Farewell Yellow Brick Road\" tour in Stockholm, Sweden on Saturday, after five years and 330 shows. He addressed the crowd and thanked his fans, saying he will miss them and their support has \"humbled\" him.",
      "World-renowned singer-songwriter Elton John confirmed he has lost sight in his right eye after suffering from a severe infection.",
      "On the opening night of his musical adaptation of \"The Devil Wears Prada\" in London, John shared, \"I haven\u2019t been able to come to many of the previews because, as you know, I have lost my eyesight.\"",

      "\"Since Sir Elton John did not state what type of eye infection he has, it is unclear whether he has complete blindness in his right eye or if there is still some partial vision,\"\u00a0Dr. Thuy Tran, optometrist and founder of Oculist in New York City, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"It is possible that he may still be able to perceive light and motion, but is unable to discern enough details to read letters or musical notes,\" added Tran, who did not treat the singer.",
      "\"He may also be experiencing other signs and symptoms, such as thick mucous discharge, pain, irritation, excessive tearing and redness.\"",
      "Types of eye infections",
      "The most common types of eye infections are viral conjunctivitis and bacterial conjunctivitis, according to Tran.",
      "\"Viral conjunctivitis, caused by adenovirus, are like common colds and typically resolve on their own within a few weeks,\" she said.",
      "\"When caused by herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus (same virus that is responsible for chicken pox and shingles), or cytomegalovirus (seen in immunocompromised individuals i.e. those with HIV/AIDS), more serious complications, such as corneal scarring, retinal damage and vision loss, may result.\"",
      "ASK A DOCTOR: 'WHY ARE MY EYES OFTEN BLOODSHOT?'",
      "Bacterial eye infections usually resolve within a week with proper antibiotic treatment, usually eyedrops or ointment, the doctor noted.",
      "\"A hyperacute bacterial eye infection, however, can be severe and rapidly progressive,\" Tran warned. \"If not treated immediately, it can lead to corneal ulcers, scarring and blindness.\"",
      "\"This condition is most commonly caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a type of bacteria that can be transmitted through sexual contact.\"",
      "Bacterial eye infections usually resolve within a week with proper antibiotic treatment, usually eyedrops or ointment. (iStock)",
      "Fungal eye infections are often caused by fungi that are naturally present in our environment, according to Tran.",
      "\"Common risk factors include trauma to the eye with plant material, extended contact lens wear and diabetes,\" she said.",
      "Fungal infections are usually treated with topical or oral antifungal therapies.",
      "\"Rarely, they can lead to a medically-urgent condition known as endophthalmitis, which often requires hospitalization for administration of intravenous medications.\"",
      "Potential for permanent damage",

      "An internal infection can be caused by a virus, said Cunningham, who also did not treat Elton John. If it reaches the retina, or the back of the eye, permanent vision loss can occur.",
      "More commonly, eye infections are the result of external triggers and trauma to the front of the eye, like scratches, chemical splashes or the misuse of contact lenses, he noted.",

      "These incidents then allow bacteria and other foreign organisms to \"colonize in the eye,\" Cunningham said.",
      "\"Because [the eye] is specifically designed to transmit light, the cellular structure of all the tissues is very precise, and it cannot be altered.\"",

      "\"So, any amount of immune response or even bacterial or viral infection is going to cause not only a disruption in the cells, but it could potentially cause scarring \u2013 and that is going to reduce vision, very often on a permanent level,\" he went on.",
      "While the eye is sensitive and may have a harder time warding off infection since it\u2019s a \"compartmentalized\" system, Cunningham said, the cornea is also the \"fastest-healing tissue in the human body.\"",
      "Eye infections are more likely to affect the elderly, according to an expert. (iStock)",
      "But as people age, the body heals more slowly \u2013 so someone like John, who is 77 years old, will be at a higher risk of elongated infection compared to those who are younger.",
      "\"A little kid can scratch their eye and within hours be completely healed,\" Cunningham said. \"In an elderly person, [injury] can last for days, and that's where the chance of infection builds up \u2013 every minute that the tissue is still compromised.\"",

      "\"Kash is a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and \u2018America First\u2019 fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People,\" Trump said in a social media post announcing his intent to nominate Patel for FBI director.",

      "For Trump to install Patel as FBI director, two things must happen: Wray must exit the job, and Patel must earn Senate confirmation.",
      "How Wray will leave remains unclear.",
      "He could opt to voluntarily vacate the position on his own before Trump's inauguration, though he has not yet said whether he plans to do so.

      "What is scambaiting?",
      "Scambaiting is when someone interacts with a scammer to waste their time and resources. Some of these online experiences are entertaining and even hilarious to watch. Instead of falling for their sneaky tricks, scambaiters play along, knowing it's a scam, and take on the role of a potential victim to keep the scammers busy.

      "TOP 10 ROBOCALL HOTSPOTS IN AMERICA",
      "Why scambaiting matters",
      "So, why should we care about scambaiting? This creative strategy offers several compelling benefits. First and foremost, it effectively wastes scammers' time. Every minute they spend on the phone with Daisy is a minute they can't use to target real victims. By keeping them occupied, we can potentially prevent them from scamming someone else.",
      "In addition to wasting time, scambaiting raises awareness about common scams. It serves as an educational tool, helping others recognize and avoid falling prey to similar tactics. The more people understand how these scams operate, the less likely they are to become victims. Moreover, watching scammers get flustered sheds light on the lengths these criminals will go to and highlights the importance of staying vigilant against their schemes.",

      "That's Daisy, an artificial intelligence-powered grandma developed by Virgin Media O2 to interact with scammers. When a scam call comes in, Daisy automatically answers and engages the caller in conversation, wasting their time. With her friendly personality and quick thinking, she keeps them on the line while gathering useful information about their tactics.\u00a0Daisy combines various AI models that work together to listen and respond to fraudulent calls instantaneously. She's so lifelike that she has successfully kept numerous fraudsters on calls for 40 minutes at a time. By tricking the criminals into thinking they were defrauding a real person and playing on scammers' biases about older people, Daisy has prevented them from targeting real victims.",
      "Now, before you get too excited, Daisy is currently only available for customers of Virgin Media O2 in the U.K., but other companies in the U.S. are beginning to offer similar AI-driven solutions. For instance,\u00a0Apate.ai has developed AI.Callee, which engages scammers in real-time conversations across various channels. Another U.S. company,\u00a0Scamnetic, has launched an AI-based scam-detection solution that can be integrated into enterprise platforms to protect consumers from various types of scams.",

      "Protecting yourself from robocall scams",
      "While scambaiting can be a fun way to fight back against scams, the best defense is simply not picking up and answering scam calls in the first place. One effective strategy is to consider investing in personal data removal services that wipe your information from public databases on the internet. By reducing your digital footprint, you can make it more difficult for scammers to contact you in the first place. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

While it's entertaining to imagine scammers being outwitted by a chatty AI grandma, it's important to remember that the ultimate goal is to protect vulnerable individuals from falling victim to these schemes. As technology evolves, so do the tactics of scammers, making it crucial for everyone to stay informed and vigilant.

      "One of the phishing scams we encountered recently is an email claiming that you've won a Rachel Ray Cucina Cookware Set. This email is particularly deceptive because it appears to come from a reputable retailer, Kohl's, but there are several red flags to watch out for. The email falsely claims to be from \"Kohl's Department\" instead of the official \"Kohl's.\" This slight alteration is a common tactic used by scammers to trick recipients into believing the email is legitimate.",
      "The email's reply-to address is tech@student.lvusd.org, which is clearly unrelated to Kohl's. Official emails from Kohl's would not use a student email address. The message includes phrases like \"You have won a Rachel Ray Cucina Cookware Set\" to create a sense of urgency and excitement, prompting you to click on the provided link without proper verification.",
      "Fake Kohl\u2019s email. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Additional red flags to spot phishing emails",
      "As you can see, phishing emails can be hard to distinguish from genuine ones, especially during the busy holiday season when you may receive many emails from various sources. However, there are some additional red flags beyond the ones we've already mentioned that can help you identify a fake email. Here are some of them:",
      "Check the sender\u2019s address and domain name. Fake emails often use spoofed or similar-looking addresses and domain names to deceive you. For example, an email from support@amaz0n.com or info@fedex.delivery.com is likely a phishing attempt. You'll notice in the Apple phishing email below the email address has just a bunch of letters and numbers. Always verify the sender\u2019s address and domain name before opening or responding to an email.",
      "Check the spelling and grammar. Phishing emails often contain spelling and grammar errors or use poor or unnatural language. For example, an email that says, \"Dear Customer, Your order has been shipped. Please confirm your delivery address by clicking here.\" It is suspicious because it does not address you by name, uses a generic greeting and asks you to click on a link. Always read the email carefully and look for any mistakes or inconsistencies.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Check the links and attachments. Fake emails often contain links and attachments that lead to malicious websites or download malware to your device. For example, an email that says, \"You have won a $100 gift card from Walmart. Click here to claim your prize.\" It is likely a scam. On a laptop or desktop, always carefully hover your mouse over the links and check the URL before clicking on them, and never open or download any attachments from unknown or suspicious sources.",
      "How to handle spam emails",
      "Use strong antivirus software: The first and most crucial step to protect yourself from accidentally clicking on fake links in spam emails is to have strong antivirus software installed on your device. This software can detect and block malicious emails and links, providing an extra layer of security.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "Do not open or reply to spam emails.\u00a0This can confirm your email address to the sender and encourage them to send you more spam. It can also expose you to malicious links or attachments that can harm your device or data.",
      "Mark spam email as junk or spam. Most email providers have a\u00a0feature that allows you to flag spam emails and move them to a separate folder. This can help you filter out spam emails from your inbox and also improve the spam detection of your email provider.",
      "Do not share your email address publicly or with unknown sources.\u00a0This can reduce the chances of your email address being collected by spammers. You can also use a disposable or\u00a0email alias for signing up for online services that you do not trust or need.",
      "Use a personal data removal service: Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams during the busy holiday season.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "1. Disconnect your device from the internet.\u00a0This will prevent any further communication or data transfer between your device and the malicious website or\u00a0malware. You can do this by turning off your Wi-Fi or unplugging your ethernet cable.",
      "2. Scan your device for malware. Use a reputable\u00a0antivirus software to scan your device and remove any potential threats.

      "4. You should also\u00a0enable\u00a0two-factor authentication for your online accounts, which adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code or a device confirmation in addition to your password.",
      "5. Monitor your accounts and credit reports.\u00a0If you have entered or provided any financial information on the malicious website or link you clicked on, you should monitor your bank accounts, credit cards and credit reports for any suspicious or unauthorized activity.",
      "6. You should also\u00a0contact your bank or credit card company and inform them of the incident. You may need to cancel or freeze your cards or accounts to prevent any further fraud.",
      "7. Report the phishing email.\u00a0You should also report the phishing email to the sender\u2019s legitimate organization, such as your bank, retailer or delivery service, and to the authorities, such as the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or the\u00a0Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG). This will help them to take action and prevent others from falling for the same scam.",
      "8. Use identity theft protection services\u00a0if you entered your personal information on any links you clicked on or websites that you were directed to. Identity theft protection companies can monitor your personal information (home title, Social Security number, phone number, email address) and alert you in the event they become breached.

Historically, Play Protect hasn\u2019t been 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android phones. The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you of any\u00a0phishing emails or\u00a0ransomware scams.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Download apps from reliable sources: It\u2019s important to download apps only from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. You might say I am contradicting myself, but the Play Store is still safer than other options out there. They have strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software.\u00a0However, even with the security measures provided by Google Play, downloading apps from the store does not guarantee 100% protection against malware or harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they can pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Never trust download links that you get through SMS.",
      "3. Be cautious with app permissions: Always review the permissions requested by apps before installation. If an app requests access to features that seem unnecessary for its function, it could be a sign of malicious intent. Do not give any app Accessibility permissions unless you really need to. Avoid granting permissions that could compromise your personal data.",
      "4. Take loans from legit institutions:\u00a0Always take loans from legitimate financial institutions like banks or well-known lenders. Avoid sketchy apps or services promising instant cash with minimal requirements. They\u2019re often too good to be true.

      "It can be tempting to use apps that promise instant loans, especially when you need the money. But they're often just trying to scam you and push you into a never-ending debt cycle. If you need a loan, go to a trusted bank or lender. Protecting yourself from malicious apps like those infected with SpyLoan malware starts with staying informed and cautious. Always scrutinize the apps you download, stick to trusted platforms, and think twice before sharing sensitive information.",

This means that any new vulnerabilities discovered in the operating system will not be patched, leaving your computer exposed to potential attacks.",

However, if a new computer isn\u2019t in your budget right now, using a supported antivirus on your Windows 7 machine is a good step.",
      "2) Install strong antivirus software: If upgrading isn't possible immediately, install a strong, reputable, up-to-date antivirus software that's compatible with Windows 7. However, keep in mind that this is a temporary solution and doesn't address all the vulnerabilities in the operating system itself. There are several antivirus programs that continue to support Windows 7.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Consider a new computer: While it's understandable that you're on a fixed budget, investing in a new computer might be the most cost-effective solution in the long run.

Well, get ready to have your mind blown! Scientists at the Technical University of Munich have cooked up something that might just change the game for anyone who's ever wished walking was a little easier.",
      "They call it the WalkON system, a pair of high-tech shorts that's not your average gym wear. These bad boys can cut down the energy you need for a stroll or jog by up to 18%! Whether you're a spring chicken or in your golden years, these shorts could be a game-changer, especially if stairs have become your nemesis or long walks leave you winded.",

      "Enter by\u00a0signing up for my free newsletter.",
      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the robotic shorts work",
      "The WalkON system combines sensors, artificial tendons and smart motors to enhance your natural walking motion. It starts with advanced sensors embedded in the shorts that continuously monitor the stress on your tendons. These sensors are incredibly precise, picking up on subtle changes in your movement, including how fast you\u2019re walking and the angle of your hips.",
      "Connected to these sensors are two thin artificial tendons that extend from your thighs to a specially designed waist belt. These tendons play a crucial role in how the system assists you. When you start to walk, the shorts analyze your gait pattern and can even detect the moment you transition from standing to walking. As each leg enters the \"swing phase,\" the system knows exactly when to kick in.",
      "At just the right moment, small but powerful motors activate and gently pull on the artificial tendons. This action helps lift your thigh, reducing the effort needed by your hip flexor muscles, making it feel much easier to move. What\u2019s really impressive is how adaptable WalkON is; whether you prefer a slow stroll or a brisk jog, the system adjusts its level of assistance based on your speed and leg weight. All of this happens seamlessly, so you experience a natural enhancement to your movement rather than feeling like you\u2019re being pushed or pulled by a machine.",

This reduction in energy expenditure is equivalent to the feeling of instantly losing 22 pounds or 13 pounds, respectively. The system allows you to walk slowly or jog, providing versatility in movement.

Additionally, individuals weakened by illness can find significant advantages in using WalkON to enhance their mobility and independence. Furthermore, the device is designed for those looking to maintain an active and healthy lifestyle, making it a versatile solution for a wide range of users.",

      "WEARABLE EXOSKELETON CAN TURN YOU INTO A SUPERHUMAN ATHLETE",
      "Comparison to other exoskeletons",
      "Unlike traditional rigid exoskeletons, WalkON's soft, flexible design offers several advantages over its more cumbersome counterparts. Conventional exoskeletons often feature rigid frames that can be difficult and time-consuming to put on, limiting their practicality for daily use.",
      "In contrast, WalkON's soft robotic shorts can be put on quickly and easily, similar to regular clothing, and are more than a mechanical device. Professor Lorenzia Masia, the lead researcher, aptly compares WalkON to an electric bike for walking. This analogy highlights the system's ability to enhance natural movement without overpowering it, making mobility more accessible and appealing to a wider range of users. The lightweight, tendon-driven design of WalkON allows for a more natural range of motion, adapting to the user's movements rather than constraining them.",
      "Furthermore, WalkON's compact and unobtrusive nature addresses a common concern with exoskeletons: social acceptance. Its design allows it to be worn discreetly under regular clothing, potentially increasing user comfort in social situations. This feature, combined with its efficiency in reducing metabolic cost, positions WalkON as a more practical solution for everyday use compared to bulkier exoskeleton systems.",
      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Availability and cost",
      "Given the current stage of development and testing, it's likely that WalkON could be available to you within the next three to five years, pending further research and regulatory approvals.",
      "While no exact price point is yet available, we can compare it to other assistive technologies. Current exoskeletons can cost anywhere from $40,000 to $100,000-plus. However, given WalkON's simpler design and intended widespread use, it's possible that it could be priced more affordably, perhaps in the range of $5,000 to $15,000 when it first hits the market. As with many technologies, the price could decrease over time as production scales up.",
      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The WalkON system's potential to enhance mobility for people of all ages, particularly older adults and those with health challenges, is immense. By making movement easier and more efficient, WalkON could encourage more active lifestyles, potentially improving overall health and quality of life for many individuals. While questions about availability and cost remain, the development of WalkON is a promising sign that we're moving towards more accessible and user-friendly mobility assistance solutions.",

      "Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to discuss what Americans should be concerned about with the data breach; he also talks about Apple's bold new move toward AI.",
      "There are companies whose entire business model is built around collecting personal data, including criminal records, employment details, addresses and more. They use this data to offer background check services to other businesses and individuals. However, while they profit from this information, they often fail to adequately protect it. Earlier this year, the National Public Data made headlines for\u00a0failing to secure 2.7 billion records of people whose data it collected. Now, on a smaller scale, another data aggregator has exposed the personal information of 600,000 Americans.",

      "Illustration of a hacker (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What information leaked?",
      "As reported by\u00a0Website Planet, the exposed database contained 644,869 PDF files, totaling 713.1 GB of sensitive data. These documents mainly consisted of background checks but also included court records, vehicle ownership details such as license plates and VINs, and property ownership reports. The background checks alone revealed highly sensitive personal data, including full names, home addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, employment details, information about family members, social media accounts and criminal histories.",
      "The worst part is that the database was left publicly accessible without password protection or encryption, allowing anyone to grab it. Anyone with the link could view and download the files. Plus, the files were named in a way that exposed personal details, using formats like \"First_Middle_Last_State.PDF.\" This made sensitive information visible even without opening the files.",

      "The database that exposed over 600,000 records belongs to SL Data Services LLC, an information research provider that appears to prioritize convenience over basic data security. The company operates a sprawling network of around 16 websites, including Propertyrec, which advertises real estate ownership data and property records. However, SL Data Services\u2019 business goes far beyond property records, offering services like criminal background checks, DMV records and even birth and death records.",
      "While Propertyrec promotes its affordability, claiming users can search for documents for as little as $1, customer reviews paint a different picture. Many users report being unknowingly enrolled in subscription services, resulting in recurring charges instead of the promised one-time fees. This predatory business practice raises further questions about the company\u2019s ethics and transparency.",

      "The exposure of sensitive personal info in this breach is a big deal for the people involved. The database has detailed data about them, and that\u2019s basically a jackpot for cybercriminals. This kind of leak can lead to various dangerous outcomes.",
      "For one, attackers could use this info to run phishing scams or social engineering tricks. If they know details like your job, family or even criminal history, they can send super convincing messages to trick you into sharing even more sensitive details, like your financial info. That\u2019s not all. Criminals could also use this leaked data to impersonate someone and apply for loans, credit cards or other services in their name.",
      "What really gets me, though, is that most people whose info got leaked probably won\u2019t even find out about it unless they\u2019re using a service to remove their data. A lot of them might not have even known they were being background-checked in the first place. For those with criminal records, this kind of leak could cause major reputational damage or lead to discrimination, even if the info is outdated or flat-out wrong.",

      "7 ways to protect yourself from data leaks",
      "1) Remove your personal information from the internet:\u00a0While no service can promise to completely erase your data from the internet, using a data removal service is one of the best steps you can take. They do the heavy lifting by actively scanning and removing your personal information from hundreds of websites. This helps protect you from scammers who may cross-reference data from breaches with other information they find on the dark web.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2) Be wary of mailbox communications:\u00a0With your address exposed, bad actors could try to scam you through physical mail. They may impersonate companies or people you trust and send fake urgent letters about things like missed deliveries, account suspensions or security alerts. Be skeptical of unexpected communications and verify any claims before taking action.",
      "3) Be cautious of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software: The leaked data could lead to phishing attacks via email, phone calls or messages from unknown sources. Be on high alert for any requests for personal information, especially if they seem urgent or ask you to click on suspicious links. Always verify the legitimacy of any request before responding.",
      "To protect your devices from malicious links, make sure you have strong antivirus protection. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Monitor your accounts: Given the scope of this breach, it\u2019s crucial to start regularly reviewing your bank accounts, credit card statements and other financial accounts. Keep an eye out for any unauthorized transactions and report them immediately to your bank or credit card company to prevent further damage.",
      "5) Use strong, unique passwords: Create complex passwords for each of your online accounts and consider using a\u00a0password manager to keep track of them securely.",
      "6) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Implement this extra layer of security on all accounts that offer it to prevent unauthorized access.",
      "7) Regularly update your software: Keep your operating system, apps and security tools\u00a0up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities.",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It\u2019s alarming how many companies profit from collecting personal data, yet fail to protect it adequately. Recent breaches, including one exposing the sensitive information of 600,000 Americans, highlight this negligence. With unprotected databases containing everything from criminal records to addresses, cybercriminals have a treasure trove of information to exploit. This situation underscores the urgent need for you to take proactive steps to safeguard your privacy and demand better security practices from these data aggregators.",

Isn't it easy to find someone's number these days, no matter what?\" Yes. And if you've already had your fair share of telemarketers call you, maybe you feel like you've got it under control.",
      "The problem is that scammers with the right knowledge and the wrong intentions can wreak havoc just by having your phone number in their possession.",
      "Once they do, they can use it to trick you in all sorts of ways.",

      "Illustration of a scammer using SIM swapping\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "9 ways you can get scammed if your phone number falls into the wrong hands",
      "In today\u2019s digital age, your phone number is more than just a way for friends and family to reach you. It can be a gateway for scammers to access your personal information and wreak havoc on your life. From\u00a0phishing attempts to extortion, the risks are numerous and varied. Here are nine ways scammers can exploit your phone number if it falls into the wrong hands:",
      "Scammers can also use your phone number to launch rather easy\u00a0phishing attacks. They might send text messages or make calls posing as your bank or a popular online service that you subscribe to. The goal is to call you and trick you into providing login credentials, credit card details or other personal information, which they can then use for fraudulent activities. And once they have all your other information, they can do a lot more damage just by having your phone number as that initial segue.",
      "In some cases, scammers use your phone number for extortion or blackmail. They may claim to have compromising information about you and demand payment to keep it private. By contacting you directly, they can apply continuous pressure, making their threats seem more real and immediate.",
      "One unique way they do this to target elderly people is by pretending to be your grandchild or another relative in distress. The scammer often claims that your grandchild is in an emergency situation \u2014 such as needing bail money or medical assistance \u2014 and urgently requests financial help. With AI voice cloning technology, they may even be able to use your grandchild's voice. This emotional manipulation usually gets the victim to pay up.",
      "This one may not be as dramatic, but your phone number can be sold to\u00a0robocall and spam message services. These automated systems bombard you with unwanted calls and texts, often promoting scams or fraudulent products. While these may seem like minor annoyances, they can lead to bigger scams if you engage with the messages or follow their instructions. Hang up on them.",
      "HOW TO STOP ANNOYING ROBOCALLS",
      "Illustration of a scammer with cash in his hand\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Phone number spoofing is a common tactic where scammers disguise their caller ID to appear as a trusted contact by calling from what appears to be a familiar number as it may have the same area code where you live, an area code where your friends or family live or even the actual phone number of someone close which you can recognize.",
      "This makes it more likely that you'll answer the call, giving them the opportunity to deceive you into revealing personal information or transferring money. This is, of course, the case when phone spoofing is used against you. But in situations where they use YOUR phone number, they can be scamming those close to you without you even knowing!",
      "With these phone spoofing tactics, scammers can use your phone number to\u00a0impersonate government officials, such as IRS agents or Social Security administrators. They may call you claiming there\u2019s an urgent issue, like unpaid taxes or suspicious activity involving your Social Security number. This ploy often involves threats of legal action or arrest to pressure you into providing sensitive information or making immediate payments.",
      "Instead of pretending to be from a government agency, another trick is for scammers to try their luck by posing as a representative from a utility company, like an electric or water company. Scammers will claim that you have an overdue invoice and threaten to cut off your service unless you pay immediately. Using your phone number, they can contact you repeatedly, making the scam seem more legitimate (and pressing).",
      "SIM swapping or a\u00a0port-out scam is when scammers transfer your phone number to a new SIM card in their possession. By convincing your mobile carrier to reroute your number, they can receive all your calls and messages, including those containing two-factor authentication codes. This allows them to bypass security measures and take over your online accounts.",

      "With SIM swapping techniques/port-out, scammers can also use your phone number as a key to access sensitive data stored in your online accounts. By initiating password resets and intercepting verification codes sent via SMS, they can gain unauthorized access to your email, social media and banking accounts, leading to significant personal and financial damage.",
      "Finally, scammers can use all the tactics above to not only access the accounts you already have but also create fake online accounts in your name. These accounts can be used for a variety of malicious purposes, such as spreading malware, launching further scams or conducting identity theft. The presence of your phone number makes these accounts appear more legitimate, increasing the chances of deceiving others.",

      "How to protect yourself from these scams",
      "To protect your phone number from falling into the hands of scammers, here\u2019s what you can do:",
      "1. Be cautious about sharing your phone number publicly: Avoid posting your phone number on public forums, websites or social media platforms where it can be easily accessed by scammers.",
      "2. Limit exposure of your phone number on social media and other online platforms:\u00a0Use privacy settings to restrict who can see your contact information. Most social media platforms and online services offer privacy settings that allow you to control who can view your personal information. Make sure to review and adjust these settings regularly. Only share your phone number with trusted contacts.",
      "3. Consider using a secondary number for online registrations and transactions:\u00a0Services like Google Voice can provide you with a secondary number that you can use for online activities, keeping your primary number private.",
      "4. Monitor your accounts regularly for unusual activity: Check your bank accounts, email and other online accounts for any signs of unauthorized access or suspicious activity.",
      "5. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Use two-factor authentication apps instead of SMS-based verification where possible:\u00a0Two-factor authentication (2FA) provides an extra layer of security that is more difficult for scammers to bypass compared to SMS-based verification.",
      "7. Use an identity theft protection service: Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "8. Remove your personal information from the internet:\u00a0While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with the information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

    "title": "Voters want more US involvement on world stage despite isolationist talk, Ronald Reagan Institute survey finds",
    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 18:38:11 -0500",
    "summary": "The Ronald Reagan Institute released its sixth annual National Defense Survey and found &apos;record high&apos; support for U.S. involvement abroad despite a growing sense that isolationism could be on the rise.",
    "story": [
      "Rachel Hoff, Policy Director at the Ronald Reagan Institute tells Fox News Digital the vast majority of Americans prioritize national security and foreign policy despite campaign rhetoric suggesting otherwise.",
      "FIRST ON FOX: An overwhelming majority of Americans view foreign policy and national defense as being \"somewhat\" or \"extremely\" important to them, according to a new survey from the Ronald Reagan Institute that also weighed U.S. attitudes about rival nations and revealed which is viewed as posing the \"greatest threat\" to the country.",
      "As Americans await another change in the White House while the Biden and Trump administrations prepare for the executive reshuffle, and uncertainty has set the tone for what the U.S.\u2019s geopolitical future will look like amid increasingly volatile relations with nations like Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, there is stark uniformity in the way Americans view the topic of national defense.",
      "\"Americans who cast their votes for different candidates share an unshakable core set of beliefs: the United States must lead on the world stage, backed by a strong military that can secure the peace through its strength,\" the Ronald Reagan Institute said in a report first obtained by Fox News Digital detailing its 2024 National Defense Survey results.",
      "US 'SLEEPWALKING' INTO WWIII, EXPERTS WARN NATION IS UNDERPREPARED: 'WE DO NOT HAVE OUR CHURCHILL'",
      "The survey\u2019s results \u2013 which reflected the answers from some 2,500 questionnaires issued between Nov. 8-14 through telephone and online based platforms \u2013 not only highlight that U.S. security and foreign policy issues remain important topics, but they also indicated that the U.S. should take the lead in major international issues.",
      "The opinion shows a divergence from the position frequently pushed by president-elect Donald Trump, who has long championed an \"America first\" policy, which some fear could isolate the U.S. during a geopolitically turbulent time as Russia\u2019s aggression continues to ramp up in Europe, Iran remains a chief threat in the Middle East, and China continues to pose a threat politically, militarily and economically.",
      "\"I think it's really interesting to compare some of the campaign rhetoric that we saw, frankly, from both candidates, and see where that is and is not resonating with the American people,\" Rachael Hoff Policy Director at the Ronald\u00a0Reagan Institute, told Fox News Digital in reference to both Trump and his previous campaign challenger Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "The survey also found that since the annual poll began six years ago, \"a record high\" number of Americans support \"U.S. leadership and international engagement\" with a strong support for a global military posture.",
      "Parachutists jump from a U.S. airplane near Burgenlengenfeld, Germany, on April 12, 2016. (Armin Weigel/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "\"This represents a significant 15-point increase since just last year and a steady upward trend from a low-point in the early 2020s,\" the report said, noting that this shift was most prevalent among younger survey takers which saw a 32-point jump this year for those under the age of 30, along with a 19-point increase for those between the ages of 30 and 44.",
      "WHAT DOES PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP\u2019S WIN MEAN FOR US AMID WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA, UKRAINE?",
      "The drive for more U.S. involvement abroad particularly in East Asia, which includes areas like China and the Korean peninsula, the Middle East and Europe reflects the growing concern Americans have over not only the burgeoning alliance between Russia, Iran, North Korea and China, but on whether the U.S.\u00a0 military can stand up to these nations.",
      "While more than half of male survey takers, 59%, said they believe the U.S. could win a war against China, the female participants were more skeptical with only 45% expressing the same confidence, while 23% said they were unsure compared to 18% of male participants expressing the same.",
      "President Ronald Reagan waves to the crowd.",
      "More confidence in the U.S. military was displayed when asked if the U.S. could win a war against Russia, though again women signaled less confidence than their male peers, with 73% of male participants saying the U.S. would come out on top compared to only 56% of female survey takers.",
      "While it remains unclear why female participants were less confident in the U.S. military, the majority of survey takers collectively agreed that China is the U.S.\u2019s greatest threat, though Russia as the U.S.\u2019s chief enemy.",
      "TIRED OF UKRAINE? REMEMBER SOUTH VIETNAM",
      "\"One of the biggest trends that we've seen in the last three or four years in the poll is really the consensus growing that China is the is the greatest threat that we face \u2013 \u00a0that's really resonating with the American people, and it's something that clearly we've heard on a bipartisan basis from national security leaders in Washington,\" Hoff said. \u00a0That doesn't mean that Americans don't perceive Russia, Iran, North Korea, or even the cooperation between those malign actors as a threat.",

      "\"In fact, one interesting takeaway from our poll this year is that 85% of Americans, a huge percentage\u2026are concerned about the cooperation and collaboration between Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, and we're seeing that play out under the front lines in Ukraine,\" Hoff added. \"We're seeing it play out in the Middle East and it's something that Americans want our government to understand and to get after.\"",
      "Hoff explained that though the survey \u2013 which reflected information made clear in the lead up to and after the U.S. general election \u2013 showed Americans prioritize paying for domestic issues like healthcare, border security and social security above the military and foreign policy-based initiatives, national security and geopolitics remain a major issue for Americans.",
      "\"What we see from the poll across the board is that they don't see foreign policy and national security as something that they want to divest from,\" she said. \"When asked to sort of put those in competition with each other, that's where it gets really, really tough.",
      "\"But they clearly want their government to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time,\" Hoff said. \"The perception that there's kind of a growing isolationist sentiment in this country really doesn't bear out in the data.",

And it turns out, when you ask the American people, that's simply not the case,\" Hoff said.",
      "\"They want America to lead from a position of strength. They want us to have a strong military,\" she continued. \"They want us to stand up for the values of freedom and democracy around the world. And that's true on a bipartisan basis among both Republicans and Democrats, those who voted for President Trump and has voted for Vice President Harris.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 07 Dec 2024 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump has moved quickly to identify top officials for his next administration, but it hasn't all gone smoothly.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump is building his second administration at a breakneck speed, announcing his choices for nearly all of the roughly two dozen top-tier nominations, including Cabinet posts, at earlier dates than he did when starting his first term. It\u2019s a sign not only that Trump\u2019s team has more experience than it did in 2016, but also that it has a much more defined sense of what it wants: loyalty.",
      "The expedited pace, however, has not come without setbacks and intrigue. Trump has long skipped the careful vetting of the backgrounds and financial records of potential picks that most incoming administrations undertake. This approach has led to surprise controversies and unexpected bumps for some of his more contentious choices.",
      "Trump has \u201cbotched up the nomination process pretty bad,\u201d a Republican senator said, adding, \u201cThey clearly aren\u2019t vetting these people.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s also extensive jockeying between influential voices like Trump\u2019s sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, and other transition staffers, including chief of staff Susie Wiles.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 over there. I think Don Jr. has been trying to do things at times. It\u2019s like Susie will have a meeting and then Don Jr. will say something else,\" a transition source said, who said they were not implying there's any tension between the two, just that there are big personalities on the team. \"Some of it has been kind of weird.\u201d",
      "Trump Jr.\u2019s most overt influence to date was felt in his negative feedback of former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for another administration role. Pompeo is now disliked by much of the MAGA base and faced direct pushback from Trump\u2019s eldest child.",
      "This account of the Trump transition effort is based on interviews with a dozen people familiar with or involved in the process. Many were granted anonymity to speak candidly or because they were not authorized to speak on the record.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump was re-elected by a resounding mandate from the American people to change the status quo in Washington. That\u2019s why he has chosen brilliant and highly-respected outsiders to serve in his Administration, and he will continue to stand behind them as they fight against all those who seek to derail the MAGA Agenda,\u201d Trump transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \u201cAlongside his highly-qualified nominees, President Trump will shatter the Deep State and restore government that is controlled by the people.\u201d",
      "Though many of Trump\u2019s nominees appear poised for relatively easy confirmation, some of his highest-profile picks have become bogged down in controversy; two have already withdrawn their names from consideration, and others \u2014 most notably Pete Hegseth, Trump\u2019s pick for defense secretary \u2014 may not have the votes to be confirmed. Trump also changed his mind and announced a new pick for White House counsel.",
      "For his first administration, Trump lost just one nominee. And even those who are moving forward this time have been the subject of, at times, internal fights among longtime Trump loyalists, family members and the newest \u2014 perhaps biggest \u2014 influence: tech billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "\u201cI think he is around Musk more than anyone else,\u201d a Trump ally familiar with the transition said. \u201cThere are several of the traditional sort of transition tensions and fighting over picks, but Musk casts a huge shadow.\u201d",
      "Musk, who poured more than $250 million into helping Trump get elected, is not only co-chairing the new Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE \u2014 a nongovernmental entity that has promised to make $2 trillion in cuts to the federal budget \u2014 but he has also been a prominent voice on key picks, most notably Kash Patel, Trump\u2019s pick to be FBI director. Patel is a vocal backer who has spread baseless \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy theories, calling for the purge of perceived Trump enemies from within the FBI and to \u201cshut down\u201d the bureau\u2019s Washington headquarters on his first day in office.",
      "\u201cElon was the principal guy behind Patel,\u201d the Trump ally said. \u201cHe is a big reason he ultimately got picked.\u201d",
      "During Trump\u2019s first transition process, there was a tug of war between his MAGA movement and those seen as more traditional Republicans. This time, that\u2019s less the case. Not only are the voices in the president-elect\u2019s ear all generally philosophically aligned, but also Trump himself is taking a much more hands-on approach.",
      "\u201cNow he is coming in with a much clearer vision,\u201d the Trump ally said. \u201cHe has been in the job, so he knows exactly what the job is. And you know the No. 1 thing he wants is loyalty and competence.\u201d",
      "Another Trump ally, who notoriously views fighting among staff and decision-makers as a positive rather than a negative, said the president-elect is getting involved in more than just top-tier appointments.",
      "\u201cHe is not just interested in who the Cabinet secretaries are, but also looking at who the deputy secretary candidates are, as well as the assistant secretary candidates,\u201d the person said.",

      "Pete Hegseth's drinking worried colleagues at Fox News, sources tell NBC News",
      "Part of the strategy has been to avoid \u201cunforced errors or distractions\u201d by keeping potential nominees largely offline and away from television interviews.",
      "\u201cI think you\u2019re seeing the campaign discipline translate to the transition,\u201d a transition source said.",
      "Among the most heated Cabinet fights is the one over Hegseth. The former Fox News host and Army National Guard veteran has been meeting with Republican senators over the past week in an attempt to alleviate concerns over allegations of drinking and his treatment of women.",
      "For many Trump supporters, the Hegseth nomination has become a litmus test for how loyal Republicans, specifically those in the Senate who would have to vote to confirm him, are to the president-elect\u2019s pledge to install people who will fundamentally remake key swaths of the federal government.",
      "Trump and his allies have already promised primary challengers for senators who do not vote to confirm Hegseth, including skeptics like Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who is a member of the Armed Services Committee and a veteran. MAGA adherents have turned their wrath on Ernst, believing that she wants the job for herself \u2014 even though she has not indicated so publicly.",
      "\u201cPeople in Iowa have a well-funded primary challenger ready against her,\u201d Charlie Kirk, founder of the influential conservative group Turning Point USA, wrote on social media. \u201cHer political career is in serious jeopardy.\u201d",
      "Hegseth has been defiant and pledged to keep fighting, and Trump has continued to back him, posting as recently as Friday morning that he \u201cis doing very well.\u201d",
      "But the Hegseth drama has spun off its own political intrigue, as a shortlist of potential replacements has been publicly discussed, including Ernst, Tennessee Sen. Bill Hagerty, former Trump administration Pentagon official Elbridge Colby, Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt and most surprisingly, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
      "The DeSantis chatter has caught particular attention because he had an intense political rivalry with Trump during the 2024 Republican presidential primary and has a history of bad blood with several Trump staffers, including Wiles, who ran his 2018 gubernatorial campaign before the two had a falling out.",
      "\u201cWe have all advised him on the pros and cons here, and I think given him good advice,\u201d a Trump official said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, if he can get over it, why can\u2019t we.\u201d",
      "The emergence of DeSantis\u2019 name has also stirred up potential considerations for the 2028 presidential race. DeSantis is likely to once again consider a run for the White House, which many anticipate would put him on a collision course with Vice President-elect JD Vance, who is also expected to consider a run and would likely try to tap into the same pool of Trump voters DeSantis would need.",
      "Trump\u2019s transition team brushed off any concerns that potentially nominating DeSantis as defense secretary could elevate his presidential prospects.",
      "\u201cRon is not a full [Trump] convert, but he has a little star power, and that\u2019s something the president likes. There is media value there,\u201d a person involved in the transition said. \u201cAnd if we pull him in and hug him tight, he\u2019s part of our administration. He could not run against our administration.\u201d",
      "\u201cThen it becomes a personality test,\u201d the person added. \u201cJD wins that 100% of the time.\u201d",
      "The highest-profile defeat to date for Trump was around former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to be attorney general. Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration after it became clear an investigation into allegations of sex trafficking and sex with a minor would prevent him from getting enough votes to be confirmed. Gaetz was never charged and has denied the allegations.",
      "Six hours after Gaetz withdrew late last month, Trump nominated former two-term Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a longtime ally, as his replacement. Bondi\u2019s pick prompted some pushback over her past comments about prosecuting prosecutors who came after Trump, but she is widely considered to be a pick who will be able to secure Senate confirmation.",
      "Bondi did play an influential role in suggesting the other Trump pick who has withdrawn his name \u2014 Tampa-area Sheriff Chad Chronister, who was the president-elect\u2019s choice to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration, according to two sources familiar with the decision.",
      "Last week, Chronister posted on social media that he was pulling his name \u201cas the gravity of this very important responsibility set in,\u201d a claim quickly undercut by Trump himself. In his own post, Trump pointed to how Chronister handled the coronavirus pandemic, including a 2020 decision to arrest a Tampa-area pastor who flouted pandemic-era lockdown orders.",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t pull out,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI pulled him out, because I did not like what he said to my pastors and other supporters.\u201d",

      "Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is not expected to have a formal role in a\u00a0 second administration, advocated for private equity executive Marc Rowan to be nominated for treasury secretary, four sources told NBC News, but Trump instead chose hedge fund executive Scott Bessent.",
      "But the speed at which things are moving and, at times, complicating some of Trump\u2019s nominations is part of an aggressive strategy that is by design.",
      "\u201cTrump is in a pretty aggressive mode of trying to shove the system as hard and as fast as he can,\u201d said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a staunch ally. \u201cIf 5% do not make it, he would regard that as a reasonable price for being as daring as he is and he will get 95%.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe is being Trump!\u201d Gingrich continued. \u201cThat is the guy that got to be president despite everything.\u201d"

    "published": "Sat, 07 Dec 2024 01:23:56 GMT",
    "summary": "When Tulsi Gabbard arrived in Congress, she was seen as a rising Democratic star. But over time, her views on Russia and Syria shocked, puzzled and alarmed her colleagues.",
    "story": [
      "In the spring of 2018, congressional staffers were anxious ahead of the House Foreign Affairs Committee meeting.",
      "A Syrian defector who had risked his life to expose atrocities committed by the Assad regime was due to appear behind closed doors at a private briefing for lawmakers.",
      "No cameras would be present, but congressional aides worried about one committee member, Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who had repeatedly defended the Syrian regime and even met its leader, Bashar al-Assad, in an unannounced trip in 2017.",
      "The aides were concerned Gabbard might leak the name of the defector, who had hidden his identity out of fear of reprisals from the Assad regime. Some worried that she might even reveal his identity to someone associated with the Syrian government, which at that point had killed hundreds of thousands of its own citizens, according to human rights groups.",
      "Both Democratic and Republican aides told the Syrians accompanying the defector, known as \u201cCaesar,\u201d to ensure that he covered his face before Gabbard entered the room \u2014 just in case.",
      "\u201cIt was Democratic and Republican staffers on the committee coordinating with me to figure out how do we make sure that Tulsi doesn\u2019t take a photograph of Caesar, or learn his real name, or record his voice,\u201d said Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force who helped organize Caesar\u2019s appearance and translated for the session.",
      "In the past, Caesar had spoken privately to members of Congress without his face covered when Gabbard was not present. But not at the special briefing in the summer of 2018.",
      "\u201cThere were bipartisan concerns for Caesar\u2019s safety,\u201d a former staffer who was involved in the discussions and asked not to be named.\u00a0\u201cMost specifically, because then congresswoman Gabbard had earlier returned from Damascus and met with Assad,\u201d the former staffer told NBC News.",
      "The episode reflects the deep misgivings that many lawmakers, intelligence officials and human rights activists have harbored for years about Gabbard.",
      "Now, President-elect Donald Trump has nominated the former lawmaker to serve as the country\u2019s highest-ranking intelligence official.\u00a0If confirmed, Gabbard would have access to a trove of top secret material and have the final word on what spy agencies share with the president in regular intelligence briefings.",
      "A spokesperson for the Trump transition team said Gabbard, a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve, has an active top secret security clearance and has never breached the confidentiality rules around classified information.",
      "\u201cAs someone who served for eight years in the U.S. House of Representatives and attended many classified briefings, there is zero evidence that confidentiality has ever been violated,\u201d said spokesperson Alexa Henning.",
      "Asked about the case of congressional staffers in 2018 who were concerned she might not safeguard the Syrian defector\u2019s anonymity, she said: \u201cThis is another smear by anonymous officials with no proof.\u201d",
      "As a presidential candidate, a member of Congress and a commentator supporting Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, Gabbard has been accused of repeatedly echoing propaganda spread by Russia and the Assad regime, including questioning U.S. intelligence assessments that the Syrian government carried out multiple chemical weapons attacks on its own people.",
      "On Thursday, nearly 100 former diplomats, national security officials and intelligence officials wrote to Senate leaders expressing alarm at Gabbard\u2019s nomination. The former officials, who have served under both Democratic and Republican administrations, urged closed-door confirmation hearings to allow lawmakers to carry out a full review of government information about Gabbard.",
      "\u201cSeveral of Ms. Gabbard\u2019s past actions call into question her ability to deliver unbiased intelligence briefings to the President, Congress, and to the entire national security apparatus,\u201d the letter stated.",
      "At a moment of upheaval in the Middle East, with anti-regime forces making dramatic advances on the ground in Syria, Gabbard\u2019s views on Syria and its Russian and Iranian allies will be under scrutiny as senators weigh her nomination.",
      "She is expected to begin meeting with lawmakers next week in advance of her confirmation hearings.",
      "Henning, the spokesperson for Gabbard on the transition team, dismissed the letter as an \u201cunfounded\u201d attack by people who oversaw foreign policy and intelligence debacles in the past, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq.",
      "\u201cThese unfounded attacks are from the same geniuses who have blood on their hands from decades of faulty \u2018intelligence,\u2019 including the non-existent weapons of mass destruction,\u201d said Henning, referring to a purported justification for the start of the Iraq War that turned out to be false.",
      "A rising Democratic star",
      "In 2012, after a surprise election victory as Hawaii\u2019s new congresswoman at the age of 31, Gabbard was seen as a rising young star in the Democratic Party, a fresh face who had served in the Iraq War with the Army National Guard.",
      "During her early days in Congress, Gabbard was part of a bipartisan exercise group in the House. She was also often invited to informal gatherings of a small group of Democrats favoring a moderate foreign policy.",
      "Gabbard appeared even-keeled in her manner and there was no sign she had any predisposition toward authoritarian regimes or bought into their propaganda, according to those who knew her at the time.",
      "\u201cEvery time you talked to her you just felt like this is a measured, thoughtful person. Not prone to hyperbole, not prone to get overly excited or angry,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, also a veteran of the Iraq War. \u201cExactly the kind of attitude and demeanor that I grew to expect from the military.\u201d",
      "Her arrival in Congress coincided with Syria\u2019s descent into civil war.",
      "The Assad regime brutally crushed peaceful political protests in 2011, firing on unarmed demonstrators and carrying out mass arrests and torture. The crackdown led the opposition to take up arms and an all-out war, with the regime launching chemical weapons attacks and Russian-backed air raids on Syrian cities and towns.",
      "As the war intensified, Gabbard\u2019s sympathetic statements about the Russian-backed Assad regime raised eyebrows and alarmed her colleagues.",
      "In 2014, Gabbard first encountered the defector Caesar at a hearing before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, where he appeared before cameras with his face covered to shield his identity.",
      "Citing some 50,000 photographs smuggled out of Syria, Caesar outlined how the regime had executed and tortured tens of thousands of Syrians who dared to oppose the regime.",
      "Gabbard praised his \u201ccourage\u201d and asked Caesar if armed rebels were strong enough to take on Assad. Caesar assured her that they were strong because they believed in their cause and that their cause was \u201cjust.\u201d",
      "In 2015, Gabbard was invited on a congressional trip to the Turkish-Syrian border, where she and other members met medical workers, activists and wounded civilians who recounted the fallout from the Assad regime\u2019s military attacks. Syrian human rights advocates hoped the trip might lead her to reconsider her views.",
      "Gabbard and the other lawmakers traveled to Gaziantep, just over the border from Syria, and spoke to Syrian civilians who had been forced to flee their homes. She took notes and nodded politely but rarely spoke, according to Moustafa, who accompanied the delegation.",
      "Although the trip took place nine years ago, one exchange has stayed with Moustafa. Two Syrian girls described suffering severe burns when aircraft bombed their displaced persons camp.",
      "\u201cShe asked them, \u2018How do you know it was the Russians and Assad who did it and not ISIS?\u2019\u201d Moustafa said.",
      "Gabbard\u2019s question shocked Moustafa, as the lawmaker did not say anything else to the children. And Gabbard\u2019s intervention showed how badly informed she was, he said. ISIS had no air force.",
      "\u201cAfter that conversation with the little girls, I saw there was nothing to be done,\u201d Moustafa said. He concluded that \u201cfacts don\u2019t matter\u201d to Gabbard and there was no way to shift her view. He added it would be \u201cdangerous\u201d for Gabbard to be given the top U.S. intelligence job.",
      "Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin first reported on the exchange.",
      "Gabbard\u2019s spokesperson called the account of the conversation with the Syrian children \u201cfalse.\u201d",
      "Afterward, Gabbard did not publicly refer to what she and the other members of the delegation saw and heard firsthand from Syrian civilians. Two years later, she made an unannounced trip to meet Assad, the leader of Syria accused of orchestrating large-scale atrocities.",
      "By the time of her 2017 visit, U.S. diplomatic relations with Syria had been suspended for five years and Russian air power, Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard troops and Lebanese Hezbollah fighters had shored up Assad\u2019s forces.",
      "Gabbard did not tell most of her Democratic colleagues about the trip. Syrian-Americans linked to a pro-regime party paid for her flight and hotel and organized her meetings. After news of the trip became public and Gabbard came under criticism, she said she repaid the cost of the trip in full.",
      "The Trump transition spokesperson said Gabbard handled the trip in accordance with congressional rules.",
      "\u201cShe did everything that was required of any Member (of Congress) going on foreign travel by getting the itinerary and trip approved by House Ethics Committee prior to travel and submitting post trip reports upon returning,\u201d Henning said.\u00a0\u201cShe also met with the U.S. Ambassador in Lebanon.\u201d",
      "Henning added: \u201cDue to security concerns and active terrorist activity that would compromise the safety of everyone on the trip if it were leaked in advance, she kept the trip under close hold.\u201d",
      "Following her meeting with Assad, Gabbard defended her trip in interviews at the time and said she was \u201cskeptical\u201d that Syria was responsible for a chemical weapons attack that killed dozens of people.",
      "U.S. intelligence agencies, the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons concluded that the Assad regime was behind that attack, as well as multiple other attacks.",
      "She also embraced the Assad regime\u2019s line that the war was a struggle against Islamist terrorists. Speaking about her trip in 2017, Gabbard told CNN that \u201cpeople of all ages they asked me, \u2018why is the United States and its allies supporting these terrorist groups who are destroying Syria, when it was Al-Qaeda who attacked the United States on 9/11 not Syria?\u2019 I didn\u2019t have an answer for them.\u201d",
      "The United States waged an air war against ISIS extremists in Syria and Iraq and did not support terrorists in Syria.",
      "The Obama administration did provide limited assistance and training to some Syrian armed groups that Washington deemed as moderate forces opposing Assad. But the military aid ended in 2017 and anti-regime forces splintered, with hardline Islamists taking on a prominent role.",
      "In an interview with journalist Ryan Grimm, Gabbard said that during her conversation with Assad, she challenged him to hold free and fair elections with international observers and that Assad agreed. No such elections have taken place.",
      "Gabbard has rejected accusations that she is aligned with authoritarian leaders or undermining U.S. interests. She maintains she is coming under attack for questioning Washington\u2019s establishment and opposing U.S. military \u201cregime change\u201d interventions including the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq.",
      "\u201cLt. Col. Gabbard has seen the casualties of war firsthand, and like President Trump, is committed to peace and preventing endless wars,\u201d Henning said.",
      "Concerns among lawmakers and intelligence officials",
      "Several Republicans have indicated they will enthusiastically support Gabbard\u2019s nomination. But Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he would like to know more about her 2017 meeting with Assad.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll have lots of questions. She met with Bashar Assad, we\u2019ll want to know what the purpose was and what the direction for that was, as a member of Congress,\u201d Lankford told CNN.",
      "One former senior intelligence official said Gabbard\u2019s statements on Syria called into question her willingness to accept facts that don\u2019t fit her world view.",
      "\u201cShe basically completely adopted the Assad regime propaganda, where she suggested falsely that the U.S. was supporting terrorist extremists in Syria, and didn\u2019t mention that the Assad regime had been slaughtering fellow Syrians there,\u201d the former official said. \u201cSo what does that say about her judgment?\u201d",
      "Some lawmakers and former intelligence officials say they worry that America\u2019s partners, including those in the vital \u201cFive Eyes\u201d intelligence alliance -- the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand -- may choose to withhold some sensitive information if they distrusted Gabbard as director of intelligence.",
      "Nikki Haley, the former Republican governor of\u00a0South Carolina who served as ambassador to the United Nations in the first Trump administration, has sharply criticized Gabbard\u2019s nomination, saying her statements showed she was not ready to assess threats to the United States.",
      "\u201cAfter Russia invaded Ukraine, Tulsi Gabbard literally blamed NATO, our western alliance that\u2019s responsible for countering Russia,\u201d Haley said on her Sirius XM radio show last week. \u201cShe blamed NATO for the attack on Ukraine, and the Russians and the Chinese echoed her talking points and her interviews on Russian and Chinese television.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cThis is not a place for a Russian, Iranian, Syrian, Chinese sympathizer.\u201d"

    "summary": "South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol apologized on Saturday for declaring martial law but did not say he would resign as he faces an impeachment vote.",
    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Members of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s governing party left parliament on Saturday ahead of a planned impeachment vote over his short-lived declaration of martial law, leaving its passage in doubt.",
      "Lawmakers from the People Power Party (PPP) were shouted and cursed at as they left en masse after voting on a separate motion, leaving the 192 opposition lawmakers eight votes short of the two-thirds majority needed for the impeachment motion to succeed.",
      "Opposition lawmakers have said that if the impeachment motion doesn\u2019t pass they will come back to it on Wednesday, amid simmering public anger over Yoon\u2019s bewildering order, which plunged the East Asian democracy and key U.S. ally into chaos.",
      "Earlier Saturday, Yoon apologized for his actions in a brief nationally televised address, saying they \u201cstemmed from the urgency\u201d\u00a0he felt as president but \u201ccaused anxiety and inconvenience to the public.\u201d",
      "\u201cI deeply regret this and sincerely apologize to the citizens who were alarmed,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI will not evade the legal and political responsibility regarding this declaration of martial law,\u201d Yoon continued, speaking for a total of just over two minutes before deeply bowing his head before cameras.",
      "He said he would not declare martial law a second time, a concern that had been expressed by some opposition lawmakers, and that his party would decide how long he should stay in office and how state affairs would be managed.",
      "Han Dong-hoon, the leader of the PPP, urged Yoon to step down, telling reporters after the address that it had become \u201cimpossible\u201d for him to carry out his normal presidential duties.",
      "Lee Jae-myung, leader of the liberal opposition Democratic Party and Yoon\u2019s rival in the 2022 presidential election, described the president\u2019s address as \u201cvery disappointing.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Yoon\u2019s statement was completely out of touch with the public\u2019s expectations and further fueled a sense of betrayal,\u201d Lee said.",
      "\u201cThere is no other way but to leave office early.\u201d",
      "Six opposition parties began impeachment proceedings against Yoon this week. The opposition bloc holds 192 of the unicameral legislature\u2019s 300 seats, just under the two-thirds majority needed for the motion to pass.",
      "The likelihood that the motion would succeed increased Friday after Han said the president\u2019s powers should be suspended, adding that Yoon might continue to \u201cput South Korea and its people in great danger.\u201d",
      "But the conservative PPP remained formally opposed to the impeachment motion, as well as a bill appointing a special prosecutor to investigate corruption allegations involving Yoon\u2019s wife. That bill was narrowly voted down on Saturday before PPP lawmakers left the chamber.",
      "Opposition lawmakers, by contrast, are adamant that Yoon be removed from office, as is much of the public. Large crowds of protesters have called for Yoon\u2019s ouster, while smaller ones have rallied in support of him.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t and cannot apologize only with words after attempting to stage martial law. The only way for President Yoon Suk Yeol to mean his apology is to resign now,\u201d Seoul resident Margie Kim\u00a0said after Yoon\u2019s address.",
      "A Gallup Korea poll released on Friday showed Yoon\u2019s approval rating at 13%, The Korea Times reported, down from 19% a week earlier.",
      "Lee, the Democratic Party leader, said Yoon\u2019s \u201cunconstitutional and illegal declaration of martial law\u201d had caused chaos and fear in the country of 50 million people, which spent decades under military-authoritarian rule before transitioning into a vibrant democracy and the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy.",
      "\u201cThe democracy of this nation that has been achieved through blood, sweat and tears is now being wrecked by an unruly power, and our people have suffered serious wounds to their national dignity and pride,\u201d he said Friday.",
      "Lee also expressed concern about how the martial law declaration might affect South Korea\u2019s relations with the U.S., noting that meetings of the U.S.-South Korea Nuclear Consultative Group that were planned in Washington this week had been postponed amid the turmoil.",
      "\u201cOur national credibility, as well as diplomacy, has been severely impacted,\u201d he said.",
      "Biden administration officials said they were not notified in advance that Yoon would declare martial law. But they have repeatedly reaffirmed the \u201cironclad\u201d nature of the U.S. alliance with South Korea, which it views as an important bulwark against North Korea, China and Russia, and which hosts almost 30,000 American troops.",
      "The U.S. relationship with South Korea \u201ctranscends any particular president or government on both sides of the Pacific Ocean,\u201d State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said Thursday.",
      "Before his address on Saturday, Yoon, 63, a former chief prosecutor who took office in 2022, had not made any public appearances since lifting the martial law order early Wednesday after lawmakers defied a security cordon to enter the National Assembly building and voted unanimously to reject it.",
      "Since then, he has accepted the resignation of his defense minister Kim Yong-hyun, who said he took full responsibility for what happened. Many other officials, including Yoon\u2019s chief of staff and all senior presidential secretaries, have also tendered their resignations.",
      "South Korean police and prosecutors are investigating claims of insurrection and treason against Yoon, Kim and Interior Minister Lee Sang-min. The Ministry of National Defense has also suspended three top commanders from duty and requested overseas travel bans for them, Kim and seven other active-duty military officers.",
      "Military officers and government officials described a chaotic six hours from the time Yoon declared martial law around 10:30 p.m. Tuesday to the time he lifted the order around 4:30 a.m. Wednesday. Many of them said they learned about the martial law order, South Korea\u2019s first since 1980, from Yoon\u2019s surprise TV address or from news reports.",
      "In his address, Yoon accused the opposition-controlled parliament of paralyzing the government by seeking the impeachment of multiple government officials and slashing critical funding from next year\u2019s national budget. He also accused his opponents of sympathizing with nuclear-armed North Korea, its reclusive communist neighbor that the South technically remains at war with.",
      "A martial law proclamation issued after Yoon\u2019s address banned all political activity, including demonstrations, and censored the news media. It also ordered\u00a0the country\u2019s striking doctors\u00a0to return to work within 48 hours.",
      "Officials said Friday that Yoon had ordered the arrest of prominent politicians including Lee, the leader of the Democratic Party, and Han, the leader of Yoon\u2019s own party, along with other opposition lawmakers, a journalist, a former Supreme Court justice and a former Supreme Court chief justice.",
      "Yoon\u2019s office has not commented on the allegations.",
      "If Yoon is impeached, he will be suspended from office until the Constitutional Court decides whether to uphold the motion, with a deadline of 180 days. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo would serve as acting president in the meantime.",
      "While it wouldn\u2019t take many defections from Yoon\u2019s party to pass the impeachment motion, \u201cI do think it is important that this be bipartisan,\u201d said Eun A Jo, a postdoctoral fellow at the\u00a0Dickey Center for International Understanding\u00a0at Dartmouth.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 21:36:19 GMT",
    "summary": "The gunman being sought in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has not made it easy for the New York Police Department to find him, but he did leave behind some confounding clues that could lead to his arrest, experts said Friday.",
    "story": [
      "The gunman being sought in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has not made it easy for the New York Police Department to find him, but he did leave behind some confounding clues that could lead to his arrest, experts said Friday.",
      "Despite firing the fatal shots in a busy part of Manhattan where there are countless security cameras, and despite revealing his face at the hostel where he is believed to have stayed before the fatal shooting, investigators have not yet publicly identified the gunman who ambushed the 50-year-old insurance executive early Wednesday.",
      "Former NYPD Detective Michael Alcazar, who is now an adjunct professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, noted that the time before the shooter's image was widely released has helped him.",
      "\"Right off the bat, this guy had a day to get away,\" Alcazar told NBC News.",
      "\"But now that we got his image, I can almost guarantee that detectives have gotten solid leads on who he is from Crime Stoppers or somebody else looking to collect reward money. They probably already have a lot more information about him than they are letting on to the public.\"",
      "\"That might be the lead the NYPD needs,\" retired NYPD Detective Jillian Snider told MSNBC. \"This is someone with distinguishable features. He has a smile.\"",
      "Earlier, Tom Verni, who is also a retired NYPD detective, told MSNBC's Jose Diaz-Balart that it's only a matter of time before the shooter is identified or arrested now that \"his face is being plastered\" on news sites across the country. He also didn't rule out that the killer might still be in New York City.",
      "\"In a city like New York City you can disappear in a crowd,\" Verni said.",
      "NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said later they believed the suspect had left New York City. He said they have footage of him entering a cab that took him to a Port Authority bus terminal near 178th Street and Broadway.",
      "\u201cThose buses are interstate buses,\" Kenny said. \"That\u2019s why we believe he may have left New York City.\u201d",
      "Thompson was fatally shot in what Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said appeared to be a \u201cpremeditated, preplanned targeted attack\u201d outside the New York Hilton hotel in midtown Manhattan. He was on his way to speak at UnitedHealth Group\u2019s investor conference when the gunman approached from behind and \u201cfired several rounds,\u201d Tisch said at a news conference after the deadly shooting.",
      "The gunman had been \"lying in wait for several minutes\" before opening fire, Tisch said.",
      "Thompson's final moments were caught on surveillance camera footage, which showed the gunman approaching him from behind and opening fire. He continued to fire as Thompson fell to the pavement, the video showed.",
      "Police said the shooter arrived at the scene about five minutes before the shooting. Thompson, who lived in Minnesota, was pronounced dead at Mount Sinai West Hospital.",
      "Meanwhile, the shooter fled on foot and then on a rental bike, Tisch said. He was last seen in Central Park.",
      "On Thursday, a possible murder motive emerged when police revealed that shell casings found at the crime scene had the words \u201cdeny,\u201d \u201cdefend\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d written on them.",
      "UnitedHealthcare has been hit with complaints from thousands of unhappy customers over the years, and Thompson\u2019s wife told NBC News that her late husband had received threats. He was not traveling with a security detail.",
      "Alcazar said payback might be a motive, but several other things also stood out for him when he viewed the video.",
      "\"Initially, I thought it might be a guy with a vendetta of some kind and it still may be, given the words that were found on the shell casings,\" Alcazar said. \"But if you look at the video, there is also a confidence there. He shoots. Then when it appears his gun has jammed, he calmly deals with that and starts shooting again.\"",
      "So, said Alcazar, \"if I am working the case I am not ruling out, at least not at this moment, that this could be a hired gun or somebody with a military background who has some experience with weapons.\"",
      "Alcazar said the fact that no murder weapon has been found might, in and of itself, also be a clue.",
      "\"I believe the gun may be specifically a bolt action single shot weapon, which is very specific,\" he said. \"A unique choice of a weapon to execute a target.\"",
      "But Verni said he is not convinced that Thompson's killer was a pro.",
      "\"A professional hitman would have been more of a ghost\" and not kill a man on Midtown Manhattan street because even at that hour there are likely to be witnesses, he said.",
      "Also, the fact that the gunman appeared to use \"some kind of noise suppressor\" on his gun is \"kind of odd,\" he added.",
      "\"But he planned this out, that's for sure,\" Verni said.",
      "Investigators told NBC News earlier that they believe the shooter may have traveled to New York City from Atlanta last month by bus.",
      "Officials are working to see whether they can find a name from the tickets purchased for a Nov. 24 Greyhound trip that might help identify the gunman. Greyhound said it is cooperating with authorities on the investigation.",
      "Police are also looking into whether the gunman paid in cash and used a fake ID to rent a room at a hostel on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, according to two law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation.",
      "Before the shooting, the gunman bought a water bottle and two protein bars from a nearby Starbucks and discarded the items, the sources said.",
      "In addition to the shooting footage, investigators recovered a video showing where the man discarded the purchased items, and police collected them as evidence, hoping it could aid in the investigation, an official said.",
      "\"There\u2019s also still a lot of scene crime processing that needs to be done,\" Alcazar said. \"We may know it\u2019s him, but we\u2019ve got to be able to prove it was him and that requires things like collecting and identifying DNA and processing other physical evidence.\""

      "A high-profile violent crime typically sets social media abuzz with tips and theories from amateur internet sleuths, hunting for the alleged perpetrator.",
      "But after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was gunned down in New York City this week without a primary suspect being identified, a rare occurrence happened in the thriving true-crime world: silence online from highly followed armchair detectives.",
      "\u201cI have yet to see a single video that\u2019s pounding the drum of \u2018we have to find him,\u2019 and that is unique,\u201d said Michael McWhorter, better known as TizzyEnt on TikTok, where he posts true crime and viral news content for his 6.7 million followers. \u201cAnd in other situations of some kind of blatant violence, I would absolutely be seeing that.\u201d",
      "A masked gunman, who is still on the lam, fatally shot the 50-year-old executive in front of a busy New York City hotel Wednesday, police said. Shell casings found at the scene had \u201cdeny,\u201d \u201cdefend\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d written on them, according to a senior New York City law enforcement official briefed on the investigation.",
      "Thompson\u2019s targeted killing has sparked online praise from people angry over the state of U.S. health care. Tens of thousands of people have expressed support on social media for the killing or sympathized with it. Some even appeared to celebrate it.",
      "\u201cThe surge of social media posts praising and glorifying the killing of UnitedHealth CEO Brian Thompson is deeply concerning,\u201d Alex Goldenberg, a senior adviser at The Network Contagion Research Institute at Rutgers University previously told NBC News. (Thompson was CEO of UnitedHealthcare, not of UnitedHealth Group, its parent company.)",
      "In a statement, Thompson\u2019s family said he was \u201can incredibly loving father\u201d to two sons and \u201cwill be greatly missed.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are shattered to hear about the senseless killing of our beloved Brian,\u201d the statement said. \u201cBrian was an incredibly loving, generous, talented man who truly lived life to the fullest and touched so many lives.\u201d",
      "Still, some of the most popular internet sleuths have sat out the investigation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re pretty apathetic towards that,\u201d Savannah Sparks, who has 1.3 million followers on her TikTok account \u2014 where she tracks down and reveals the identities of people who do racist or seemingly criminal acts in viral videos \u2014 said about helping to identify the shooter. She added that, rather than sleuthing, her community has \u201cconcepts of thoughts and prayers. It\u2019s, you know, claim denied on my prayers there,\u201d referring to rote and unserious condolences.",
      "Although Sparks, 34, has been tapped by law enforcement in the past to help train officers on how to find suspects online, according to emails seen by NBC News, she said this time she isn\u2019t interested in helping police.",
      "Sparks, who also works in health care as a lactation consultant and holds a doctorate of pharmacy, didn\u2019t mince words when asked if her community was working to find the suspect in Thompson\u2019s murder.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely the f--- not,\u201d she said.",
      "Another popular TikTok sleuth, thatdaneshguy, who has 2 million followers on the platform, made a video that was critical of the health care industry, saying that he wouldn\u2019t try to identify the killer. \u201cI don\u2019t have to encourage violence. I don\u2019t have to condone violence by any means. But I also don\u2019t have to help,\u201d he said.",
      "That attitude among some content creators comes amid amplified attention on frustrations with medical care in the U.S. in the wake of the killing.",
      "A Gallup poll released Friday found that Americans believe health care quality is at a 24-year low. Those polled said health care coverage is even worse, with 54% saying it\u2019s fair or poor.",
      "Online sleuths have helped the FBI identify hundreds of Capitol rioters and catch previously arrested Jan. 6 defendants committing crimes that the bureau\u2019s own review had missed, in one case even finding evidence of a Proud Boy assaulting an officer in the middle of his seditious conspiracy trial.",
      "And when Gabby Petito, 22, went missing as she documented her cross-country travels on social media with her fianc\u00e9, online sleuths jumped into action. It was later determined that Petito was killed by her fianc\u00e9 Brian Laundrie, who died by suicide.",
      "At least one person who did try to help find Thompson\u2019s killer was criticized on X, formerly known as Twitter, for doing so.",
      "In a viral post, Riley Walz, a software engineer, said he was \u201cfairly confident\u201d about where the shooter fled to on a bike after scouring data from the Citi Bike\u2019s bikeshare program. He said he shared the information with the police.",
      "But a source close to Lyft, which operates Citi Bike, later said the NYPD told the company directly that the incident did not involve the bikeshare program.",
      "Walz declined to comment Friday. Since his post, some X users have called him a \u201csnitch.\u201d McWhorter, or TikTok\u2019s TizzyEnt, said backlash toward those who did try to help might cause others to not want to step in.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re seeing it in such a groundswell, I have to imagine that factors into some people\u2019s decision,\u201d he said.",
      "But mostly, McWhorter said, \u201cthere\u2019s this weird thing, this vibe of like, I don\u2019t see a bunch of people just feeling an urgency.\u201d",
      "McWhorter posted his first video about the incident Friday evening. The roughly two-minute video was about \u201chow much people don\u2019t care.\u201d",
      "Sukrit Venkatagiri, an assistant professor of computer science at Swarthmore College, said many people feel a lack of connection with a wealthy CEO.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t really empathize with who the victim is in this scenario,\u201d Venkatagiri said.",
      "Venkatagiri, who has studied the harms of misinformation and disinformation as well as crowd sourcing investigations, said, anecdotally, he has seen less talk of finding Thompson\u2019s killer on spaces like the subreddit r/Reddit Bureau of Investigations, an online sleuthing page on Reddit that claims it is \u201cusing the power of the internet to solve real-world problems.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are less motivated, from an altruistic perspective, to help this victim in this specific case,\u201d Venkatagiri said.",
      "Beyond a lack of online sleuthing, which can sometimes muddy law enforcement\u2019s investigations, there has been a flurry of information released by the New York Police Department.",
      "Police released two images of a \u201cperson of interest,\u201d including one in which he is smiling while using a fake ID to check out of a hostel on New York City\u2019s Upper West Side, as well as several surveillance videos, including one in which the suspect shoots Thompson.",
      "Investigators believe the shooter may have traveled to New York City from Atlanta last month by bus, three senior law enforcement officials familiar with the case told NBC News.",
      "Investigators have not identified a suspect, although the investigation is ongoing, a senior law enforcement official briefed on the matter said Friday. Police have found dozens of images from surveillance cameras of the suspect from tracking his timeline in Manhattan, the official said.",
      "Police have offered a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction."

    "summary": "Luca Guadagnino\u2019s 'Queer' stars Daniel Craig as a loquacious heroin-addicted expat living in 1950s Mexico City, and Drew Starkey as the man who becomes his obsession.",
    "story": [
      "From its grunge rock and \u201880s pop soundtrack to the intentionally artificial backdrops inspired by old Hollywood studio films, \u201cChallengers\u201d director Luca Guadagnino\u2019s \u201cQueer\u201d is a trippy tribute to the life and work of Beat writer William S. Burroughs. Largely based on Burroughs\u2019 unfinished novel of the same name, the film stars Daniel Craig as the writer\u2019s alter ego \u2014 a loquacious, heroin-addicted expat living in 1950s Mexico City \u2014 and Drew Starkey as the younger man who becomes his obsession. Teeming with references to the \u201cJunkie\u201d and \u201cNaked Lunch\u201d novelist\u2019s life and works, \u201cQueer\u201d portrays two men searching for connection but stifled by their own repressive tendencies and an era that views their desires as deviant.",
      "\u201cLuca put it beautifully in that, it\u2019s not a story about unrequited love, it\u2019s a story of unsynchronized love \u2014 in another time and place, yes, but not now,\u201d Craig told NBC News ahead of the movie\u2019s limited theatrical release on Nov. 27 (its nationwide release is Dec. 13).",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the tragedy of the film: There\u2019s a moment where you think, \u2018This could be,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not to be.\u201d",
      "\u201cQueer,\u201d which was almost exclusively shot on a soundstage at Cinecitt\u00e0 Studios in Rome, opens with a Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor cover of Nirvana\u2019s \u201cCome as You Are\u201d in a nod to frontman Kurt Cobain\u2019s own affection for Burroughs, a writer known for his public aloofness and icy, obscene wit. From there, the film loosely follows the plot of the Beat novelist\u2019s slim book, composed during a tumultuous handful of years living in Mexico City to avoid drug charges \u2014 before shooting and killing his wife, allegedly, during a game of \"William Tell.\"",
      "Like Burroughs\u2019 protagonist, Craig\u2019s convivial but haunted William Lee wanders the streets and bars of the Mexican capital looking for his next drink and unsatisfying sexual encounter, until he comes across a moody and mysterious ex-soldier named Eugene Allerton, played by Starkey. Awakened from years of drug-fueled apathy, the older expat forms a slavish attachment to the younger man whose reticence only fuels his yearning.",
      "Transfixed on the idea of mind reading, Lee entreats Allerton to accompany him to Ecuadorian jungles in search of a hallucinogenic root that he imagines will give him telepathic powers. But whereas Burroughs\u2019 book ends with the characters empty-handed, the film, penned by \u201cChallengers\u201d screenwriter Justin Kuritzkes, climaxes with a balletic sequence where the men are intertwined in desire while tripping on ayahuasca.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the moment in the movie where they get synchronized, and they become one,\u201d Craig said, riffing on his earlier comments about the characters\u2019 ultimately \u201cunsynchronized love.\u201d",
      "The intimate encounter \u2014 which brings Guadagnino\u2019s vision of the men as star-crossed lovers, rather than moths to a flame, into focus \u2014 is all too eye-opening for Allerton, who abandons Lee. And shortly after, the film descends into a series of dreamy vignettes, which like the disillusioned protagonist being left in the jungle, are drawn from other devastating bits of Burroughs lore."

    "story": [
      "The national milk supply must be tested for bird flu under a federal order announced Friday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Entities handling raw milk, such as bulk milk transporters or dairy processors, must collect and share samples with the USDA upon request.",
      "The goal is to quickly identify which dairy herds are affected by H5N1 \u2014 the strain of bird flu that's causing outbreaks in poultry and dairy cows \u2014 and prevent transmission among livestock. As of Thursday, 718 dairy herds have been affected in 15 states.",
      "\u201cAmong many outcomes, this will give farmers and farmworkers better confidence in the safety of their animals and ability to protect themselves, and it will put us on a path to quickly controlling and stopping the virus\u2019 spread nationwide,\u201d Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said Friday in a press release.",
      "The initial round of testing under the order, which was first reported by Reuters, is set to begin on Dec. 16. The rollout will start with six states: California, Colorado, Michigan, Mississippi, Oregon and Pennsylvania.",
      "In addition to the testing mandate, the order requires dairy herd owners with cattle that test positive for bird flu to provide information that can help with surveillance.",
      "The USDA previously issued a federal order in April that required lactating dairy cows to be tested for bird flu before being shipped across state lines, and required private labs and state veterinarians to report positive cases based on those tests. Those requirements remains in place under the new order as well.",
      "The order responds to renewed urgency to address the rapid spread of bird flu among livestock in recent months, which scientists worry could eventually pose a more widespread risk to human health.",
      "Drinking raw, or untreated, milk has risen in popularity, despite warnings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that it might be possible to contract bird flu that way. Several studies have shown that commercial pasteurization \u2014 using heat to treat milk \u2014 inactivates the virus, making milk that\u2019s safe for consumption.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration\u00a0regulates the sale of raw milk across state lines, but as many as 30 states allow it to be sold locally.",
      "In November, California health officials detected bird flu in multiple batches of raw milk from a local dairy farm. On Tuesday, the California Department of Public Health announced a broad recall of the farm\u2019s raw milk and cream on retail shelves \u2014 though no human bird flu cases have been linked to the products.",
      "To date, the CDC has confirmed 58 human cases of bird flu in the U.S. The vast majority were exposed to infected cattle or poultry. Arizona reported an additional two cases in poultry workers on Friday \u2014 the first in the state.",
      "Symptoms so far have been mild, and often include pinkeye, coughs or sneezes. However, the CDC reported last month that some cases may be asymptomatic, so the agency recommends that anyone who has been exposed to bird flu get tested.",
      "Research on dairy farms has shown the virus spreads efficiently between mammals, including from cows to other species like raccoons and cats. Scientists think the virus likely spreads between farm animals through raw milk, because infected cows shed large amounts of the virus through their mammary glands.",
      "There is no evidence yet that people can pass bird flu to each other, but scientists are concerned that H5N1 might evolve in that direction, which could lead to the next human pandemic.",
      "Research published in the journal Science on Thursday bolstered those concerns. The study found that a single mutation to\u00a0the bird flu strain that's circulating in dairy cows would allow it to spread more easily between people."

      "Far-right streamer and influencer Nick Fuentes has been accused of battery after allegedly spraying a woman with pepper spray when she appeared at his front door in Illinois last month as his refrain \u201cYour body, my choice\u201d was going viral.",
      "Marla Rose, 57, told police that she went to record Fuentes\u2019 home on Nov. 10 after she saw his controversial social media post and that he pepper-sprayed her, pushed her onto the concrete and broke her phone outside his Chicago-area home in Berwyn, Illinois. According to a police report, which was filed Nov. 11, the woman did not have any visible physical injuries but her eyes were \u201cwatery.\u201d",
      "Fuentes was arrested late last month and released the same day. He is set to appear in court on Dec. 19.",
      "Fuentes did not respond to requests for comment Friday.",
      "He posted pictures Friday of his mugshots on X and wrote, \u201cFree me n----\u201d. Rose also took to social media, posting on Facebook: \u201cIt. Is. On. \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 PS \u2014 Civil case pending.\u201d",
      "Rose could not be reached for comment Friday.",
      "Fuentes was doxxed and his address posted on social media after he went viral for an X post that has been viewed more than 99.6 million times since he posted it on Election Day, in which he wrote \u201cYour body, my choice. Forever,\u201d referring to abortion policies.",
      "He told police that since he \u201cposted a political joke online,\u201d he has faced death threats and \u201cpeople showing up to his house unannounced\u201d and had been \u201cin fear for his life,\u201d the report stated.",
      "Another woman who had driven by Fuentes\u2019 house called police to report that she had seen a woman shoved by a man outside the home, according to the police report. Rose was still at the house when police arrived, but she and Fuentes were separated while they spoke to officers, the report stated.\u00a0Police said Fuentes \u201cbecame uncooperative\u201d with the resource officer on scene and would not answer any additional questions about the alleged altercation with Rose, according to the report.",
      "After his Election Day post, Fuentes\u2019 personal information began circulating online, with many on social media posting his address and pictures of his house, writing, \u201cYour house, our choice.\u201d",
      "In a now-deleted Facebook post, Rose had said that she was prompted to appear at Fuentes\u2019 door given the views he shared online. In her post, she also disclosed Fuentes\u2019 home address several times."

      "Pollard was last seen around 5 p.m. on Monday in Unity Township, about 40 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. She fell through a sinkhole and into a decades-old mine shaft.",
      "On Wednesday, state police said that the nature of search shifted from a rescue to a recovery mission.",
      "\u201cObviously, it would have been best if we could have found her alive,\u201d said Pleasant Valley Volunteer Fire Chief John Bacha, the chief of operations for the search and rescue. \u201cWe knew after a period of time that that was probably not going to be likely, unfortunately.\u201d",
      "The family was grateful their loved one's body was found, recovered by searchers who toiled for more than 80 hours over 3 1/2 days, officials said at the presser.",
      "\"Like to have had a better outcome,\" said Marguerite Fire Chief Scot Graham, the incident commander. \"We were able to bring Elizabeth home.\"",
      "Pollard had been reported missing by a relative Monday.",
      "State troopers discovered her car parked near a restaurant with her 5-year-old granddaughter still inside. The granddaughter was in good condition despite freezing temperatures, police said.",
      "About 15 to 20 feet from Pollard\u2019s car, authorities found the sinkhole.",
      "With the rescue and recovery complete, engineers will work to fortify any points of possible erosion.",
      "\"They\u2019re going to talk about putting a grout in there, eventually and shoring up the entire entire area,\" Limani said.",
      "With abandoned mines dotting much of southwestern Pennsylvania, authorities urged residents to keep an eye out for possible sinkholes and call the state.",
      "\"My hope is that a tragedy like this never happens again,\" Unity Township Supervisor Mike O\u2019Barto said."

Taufiq\u2019s recording of the Nov. 23 incident has gone viral on social media, directing a firestorm of anger toward the attacker.",
      "\u201cWhat was most disappointing is that there\u2019s no level of contrition, no level of remorse,\u201d Taufiq told NBC News.",
      "Taufiq did not initially file a police report, but he said the attacker\u2019s identity has been shared with him and now he intends to press charges.",
      "A woman gave an interview to L.A. Fox News affiliate Fox 11 on Tuesday, admitting to the incident and saying she had been provoked by Taufiq and his wife. She asked not to be named by the outlet.",
      "Taufiq feels sorry for her, he said, but doesn\u2019t feel by her responses that she is remorseful. He plans to start the process of pressing charges because he wants to make it clear that her behavior was not OK, he said. It\u2019s not clear whether the police will charge the woman with a crime.",
      "Taufiq said the harassment began on the flight from Mexico, when she approached his 11-year-old son, who was sitting apart from the family, and questioned him about his race. On the shuttle bus from the aircraft to Los Angeles International Airport, video documents her putting up her middle fingers and insulting the family, calling them \u201cstinky\u201d and \u201ctandoori.\u201d",
      "\u201cYour family is from India, you have no respect, you have no rules,\u201d she said in the video. She then reached for her phone and said she was going to record while calling him \u201ctandoori\u201d in a derogatory way.",
      "In the interview with Fox 11, the woman blamed her behaviour on a previous brain injury.",
      "\u201cMost people know me as a very kind, calm person, but since the brain injury I get agitated very easily,\u201d she said.",
      "She also accused Taufiq of verbally attacking her first with a derogatory term for white people.",

    "summary": "Is Red No. 3 safe? The FDA may finally move to ban artificial red food dye, the coloring found in beverages, snacks, cereals and candies.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration may finally move to ban artificial red food dye, the coloring found in beverages, snacks, cereals and candies.",
      "At the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee meeting Thursday, Jim Jones, the FDA\u2019s deputy commissioner for human foods, said it\u2019s been over a decade since the safety of the synthetic color additive Red No. 40 has been re-evaluated. \u201cWith Red 3, we have a petition in front of us to revoke the authorization board, and we\u2019re hopeful that in the next few weeks we\u2019ll be acting on that petition,\u201d he said.",
      "House Energy and Commerce Committee ranking member Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., also urged the FDA to ban Red No. 3, which is made from petroleum and gives food and drinks a bright cherry color.",
      "\u201cWith the holiday season in full swing where sweet treats are abundant, it is frightening that this chemical remains hidden in these foods that we and our children are eating,\u201d Pallone wrote in a letter to the agency. \u201cWhile food companies must ensure that the food they market is safe, they are also only required to ensure that their products meet FDA\u2019s standards. This means that thousands of products that contain this chemical can remain on the market.\u201d",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for health secretary, has claimed food dyes cause cancer, but has not said what he would do if confirmed to the Cabinet post \u2014 if anything \u2014 about artificial food dyes in American food.",
      "\u201cThere are some departments such as the nutrition departments in the FDA that have to go, that are not doing their job, they are not protecting our kids,\u201d Kennedy told NBC News in November.",
      "The FDA regulates more than three-quarters of the United States\u2019 food supply.",
      "All color additives must be approved by the FDA before they are used in food sold in the U.S. There are 36 FDA-approved color additives, nine of which are synthetic dyes. This includes the two red dyes facing federal scrutiny.",
      "Some of the same dyes that are used in food are also used in pharmaceutical drugs, but the dyes are approved separately for each use. In 1990, the FDA banned Red No. 3, also known as erythrosine, from cosmetics and topical drugs under the Delaney Clause, because the chemical was shown to be carcinogenic at high doses in tests on lab rats.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t believe there is a risk to humans,\u201d FDA\u2019s Jones said.",
      "Some of the dyes allowed in food in the United States are either banned or require a warning label in other countries. The European Union requires a warning label on products that contain three artificial food dyes approved in the U.S.:",
      "Yellow No. 5, also known as tartrazine.Red No. 40, also called E129 or Allura Red AC.Yellow No. 6, called sunset yellow or E110.",
      "Yellow No. 5, also known as tartrazine.",
      "Red No. 40, also called E129 or Allura Red AC.",
      "Yellow No. 6, called sunset yellow or E110.",
      "The required label warns that the additive \u201cmay have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is something called the precautionary principle, which is basically the thought that it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry,\" said Jerold Mande, an adjunct professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who is also a former FDA senior adviser and former deputy undersecretary for food safety at the Agriculture Department.\u00a0\u201cThe U.S. wears it as a badge of honor that we don\u2019t adhere to it.\u201d",
      "Other countries do not want to take a risk, even if data on potential harms is not conclusive, he said.",
      "\u201cThese food dyes only serve one function in food, to make them look pretty so you and I want to buy it, it\u2019s a marketing tool,\u201d said Thomas Galligan, principal scientist for food additives and supplements at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "What the science says about artificial food dyes",
      "Some experts and consumer advocacy groups argue there is enough evidence showing some color additives may cause harm, particularly in children, to warrant a ban, but the FDA maintains that its approved artificial food dyes are safe when used in accordance with the agency\u2019s recommendations.",
      "An FDA advisory committee conducted a review of the possible link between artificial food dyes and hyperactivity in 2011 and determined that \u201ca causal relationship between exposure to color additives and hyperactivity in children in the general population has not been established.\u201d The agency revisited the issue in 2019 and maintained its stance. Regulatory agencies and scientists alike have reached conflicting conclusions about what research has found.",
      "\u201cThe most concerning is that we do so little science to understand the harms,\u201d Mande said, referring to research funded by the U.S. government.",
      "In a 2012 review of studies on artificial food dyes and ADHD symptoms, which included the research presented to the FDA in 2011, researchers concluded that artificial food colorings \u201care not a main cause of ADHD, but they may contribute significantly to some cases, and in some cases may additively push a youngster over the diagnostic threshold.\u201d",
      "The researchers also said that three landmark placebo-controlled studies conducted in children in the U.K., which have been cited as reason for banning or restricting the use of artificial dyes, \u201cwere barely sufficient to detect the statistically small but clinically important effects noted.\u201d",
      "The European Food Safety Authority also concluded in 2008 that the findings showed \u201ca lack of consistency.\u201d",
      "More than a decade later, officials completed the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, a 2021 review of all the available research that studied whether artificial food dyes may have an effect on human health. The conclusion: \u201cConsumption of synthetic food dyes can result in hyperactivity and other neurobehavioral problems in some children, and that children vary in their sensitivity to synthetic food dyes.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe evidence now shows pretty conclusively that when some kids eat these, they will experience nervous system effects that look like ADHD,\u201d Galligan said. \u201cThere are 27 human clinical trials that show these dyes do in fact harm children\u2019s behavior.\u201d",
      "How the U.S. differs from Europe",
      "Red No. 40 was approved in 1971 and Red No. 3 and Yellow No. 5 were approved in 1969. At the time, the safety trials were conducted in animals, not people. Researchers have since tested safety in a mix of animal studies and a few placebo-controlled trials in children. \u201cWe really don\u2019t have the science we should have so these things are a little unclear, but these dyes and behavioral issues, there is an established connection,\u201d Harvard\u2019s Mande said.",
      "The government spends very little money researching synthetic food additives once they are approved, Mande said. Less than 5% of the National Institutes of Health\u2019s research budget goes to studying issues related to nutrition.",
      "Acute harms, such as poisoning, are well understood among FDA-approved products, Mande said, \u201cbut the effort to understand the effects in the long term or subtle things like behavior, we don\u2019t study that.\u201d",
      "The FDA lacks a formal way to review substances that are already in the food supply \u2014 known as a post-market review \u2014 which could allow unsafe additives to linger in the food system even as new research becomes available, said Jennifer Pomeranz, an associate professor of public health policy and management at the New York University School of Global Public Health.",
      "\u201cEven when there is an enormous amount of data, it can take decades to remove something that might be harmful from the food system,\u201d she said. \u201cThe FDA clearly needs more resources for post-market research because of these additives that have been in the food system for so long without any post-market review.\u201d",
      "This lack of follow-up sets the U.S. apart from Europe, Jones said at Thursday\u2019s committee meeting.",
      "\u201cThe biggest distinction between the U.S. and Europe is that they have been doing post-market review of chemicals for over 20 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe FDA, although we have authorization to do post-market review, there\u2019s no statutory mandate.\u201d",
      "That may change.",
      "In September, the FDA held a public meeting about proposed enhancements to re-evaluating chemicals that have been approved for use in food, including color additives. The agency also extended the public comment period to late January 2025.",
      "An FDA spokesperson said in an email that the food dyes it has approved are reviewed by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives.",
      "\u201cIn addition to evaluations and review by the FDA, the FDA supports and participates in the international risk assessments conducted under JECFA as a part of our post-market activities to ensure safety of substances added to food,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAll the colors listed have recently undergone assessments for safety in food by the JECFA and were found to be safe for use in food under current use conditions.\u201d",
      "States already banning the artificial food dyes",
      "States are already putting pressure on manufacturers to remove artificial dyes from food and beverages. In the last year, three states have introduced or passed legislation banning certain color additives.",
      "In October 2023, legislators passed the California School Food Safety Act. The law will ban six of the nine FDA-approved artificial food dyes \u2013\u2013 Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Blue No. 1, Blue No. 2 and Green No. 3 \u2013\u2013 in public school food and drinks by 2027.",
      "In April, Illinois lawmakers advanced legislation that would ban Red No. 3 in the state by 2028.",
      "New York legislators introduced a bill in February that would ban Red No. 3 in food and drinks in the state beginning in 2026.",
      "The moves, particularly in California, could push food manufacturers to remove the dyes from food nationwide, Mande said.",
      "\u201cThese food dyes are things that a lot of countries already don\u2019t allow. It\u2019s one thing to produce different foods for different countries, but to do it for different states is a nonstarter,\u201d he said.",
      "Some food manufacturers have already removed artificial dyes from their products.",
      "After years of pressure from the public, Kraft voluntarily removed synthetic dyes from its macaroni and cheese in 2015, replacing Yellow No. 5 and Yellow No. 6 with natural coloring. That same year, Nestl\u00e9 removed Red No. 40 and Yellow No. 5 from over 250 products, including candy bars.",
      "A ban on the federal level would be relatively simple, Center for Science in the Public Interest\u2019s Galligan said: \u201cThey just have to make the decision that it no longer meets the safety standard and issue a decision that it is no longer allowed in food.\u201d",
      "An FDA spokesperson told NBC News that it has reviewed the studies cited by California lawmakers in the California School Food Safety Act.",
      "\u201cThe totality of scientific evidence shows that most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives, but some evidence suggests that certain children may be sensitive to them,\u201d the spokesperson said in an email."

    "story": [
      "When the Michigan Wolverines hired Jim Harbaugh as their head coach in December 2014, the task was obvious: Beat Ohio State and return the school to national relevance.",
      "From 1997 until Harbaugh\u2019s hiring, the Wolverines had fallen behind their bitter rival, as the Buckeyes won two national championships and played for two others. Michigan, on the other hand, had no championship appearances. And from 2001 to 2019, the Wolverines had only two wins in 19 tries against Ohio State.",
      "Harbaugh would eventually get Michigan over the hump, beating the Buckeyes in each of his last three tries before winning a national championship after the 2023 season.",
      "Less than three weeks after winning his final game with the Wolverines, Harbaugh accepted the head coaching job with the Los Angeles Chargers. And now, his task is eerily the same: Beat the Kansas City Chiefs and return the Chargers to national relevance.",
      "While Los Angeles versus Kansas City isn\u2019t quite Ohio State versus Michigan, the Chiefs are the team standing in everybody\u2019s way in the NFL, but particularly their divisional opponents.",
      "For a stretch in the aughts, the Chargers were the elite of the AFC West. From 2004-09, they won the division in five out of six seasons. In the next three, they finished no worse than third.",
      "Since 2016, however, Kansas City has won the division every season. In that time, the Chiefs are also 12-3 against the Chargers, including five straight wins. (And for good measure, they\u2019ve also won three Super Bowls in five years.)",
      "Harbaugh, known for turning teams around dating back to his time as head coach at Stanford to his first NFL stint with the San Francisco 49ers, can\u2019t be expected to knock off Kansas City overnight. The whole league, after all, is searching for answers against quarterback Patrick Mahomes. But Sunday will be an interesting test to see how close Los Angeles is to its current chief rival.",

      "Only two of Kansas City\u2019s 11 wins have been by double digits. The team\u2019s last five wins have come by an average of 4 points. Even though they are tied for the NFL lead in wins, the Chiefs are only 11th in point differential \u2014 behind multiple five-loss teams.",
      "Mahomes, meanwhile, is averaging only 7.0 yards per attempt (tied with last season for a career low) and is on pace to throw the most interceptions he\u2019s ever had in a single season. His passer rating of 92.2 is also a career worst.",
      "Nobody is foolish enough to suggest Kansas City isn\u2019t actually good. But there\u2019s an argument to be made the Chiefs are more beatable than they have been in the last two seasons, both of which resulted in championships.",
      "After the Chargers finished last year 5-12, Harbaugh has the team on an 11-win pace this season. He has put less on the plate of phenom quarterback Justin Herbert \u2014 whose passing yards per game are at a career low \u2014 and instead leaned more on a physical rushing attack.",
      "The formula has worked so far, as Los Angeles is 8-4. It still needs to be proven against the best opponents, though, because the Chargers have only one win against a team currently over .500. And in the teams\u2019 first matchup earlier this season, Kansas City beat Los Angeles 17-10.",
      "Harbaugh is no stranger to big moments. He knocked off No. 1 USC as a 41-point underdog when he was coaching Stanford, beat Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers in the playoffs with San Francisco, and then finally found his way around Ohio State.",
      "Though not as quite high stakes as some of his previous wins, Sunday\u2019s game is the reason why Harbaugh will be on the Chargers\u2019 sideline."

    "published": "Sat, 07 Dec 2024 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump has moved quickly to identify top officials for his next administration, but it hasn't all gone smoothly.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump is building his second administration at a breakneck speed, announcing his choices for nearly all of the roughly two dozen top-tier nominations, including Cabinet posts, at earlier dates than he did when starting his first term. It\u2019s a sign not only that Trump\u2019s team has more experience than it did in 2016, but also that it has a much more defined sense of what it wants: loyalty.",
      "The expedited pace, however, has not come without setbacks and intrigue. Trump has long skipped the careful vetting of the backgrounds and financial records of potential picks that most incoming administrations undertake. This approach has led to surprise controversies and unexpected bumps for some of his more contentious choices.",
      "Trump has \u201cbotched up the nomination process pretty bad,\u201d a Republican senator said, adding, \u201cThey clearly aren\u2019t vetting these people.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s also extensive jockeying between influential voices like Trump\u2019s sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, and other transition staffers, including chief of staff Susie Wiles.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 over there. I think Don Jr. has been trying to do things at times. It\u2019s like Susie will have a meeting and then Don Jr. will say something else,\" a transition source said, who said they were not implying there's any tension between the two, just that there are big personalities on the team. \"Some of it has been kind of weird.\u201d",
      "Trump Jr.\u2019s most overt influence to date was felt in his negative feedback of former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for another administration role. Pompeo is now disliked by much of the MAGA base and faced direct pushback from Trump\u2019s eldest child.",
      "This account of the Trump transition effort is based on interviews with a dozen people familiar with or involved in the process. Many were granted anonymity to speak candidly or because they were not authorized to speak on the record.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump was re-elected by a resounding mandate from the American people to change the status quo in Washington. That\u2019s why he has chosen brilliant and highly-respected outsiders to serve in his Administration, and he will continue to stand behind them as they fight against all those who seek to derail the MAGA Agenda,\u201d Trump transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \u201cAlongside his highly-qualified nominees, President Trump will shatter the Deep State and restore government that is controlled by the people.\u201d",
      "Though many of Trump\u2019s nominees appear poised for relatively easy confirmation, some of his highest-profile picks have become bogged down in controversy; two have already withdrawn their names from consideration, and others \u2014 most notably Pete Hegseth, Trump\u2019s pick for defense secretary \u2014 may not have the votes to be confirmed. Trump also changed his mind and announced a new pick for White House counsel.",
      "For his first administration, Trump lost just one nominee. And even those who are moving forward this time have been the subject of, at times, internal fights among longtime Trump loyalists, family members and the newest \u2014 perhaps biggest \u2014 influence: tech billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "\u201cI think he is around Musk more than anyone else,\u201d a Trump ally familiar with the transition said. \u201cThere are several of the traditional sort of transition tensions and fighting over picks, but Musk casts a huge shadow.\u201d",
      "Musk, who poured more than $250 million into helping Trump get elected, is not only co-chairing the new Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE \u2014 a nongovernmental entity that has promised to make $2 trillion in cuts to the federal budget \u2014 but he has also been a prominent voice on key picks, most notably Kash Patel, Trump\u2019s pick to be FBI director. Patel is a vocal backer who has spread baseless \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy theories, calling for the purge of perceived Trump enemies from within the FBI and to \u201cshut down\u201d the bureau\u2019s Washington headquarters on his first day in office.",
      "\u201cElon was the principal guy behind Patel,\u201d the Trump ally said. \u201cHe is a big reason he ultimately got picked.\u201d",
      "During Trump\u2019s first transition process, there was a tug of war between his MAGA movement and those seen as more traditional Republicans. This time, that\u2019s less the case. Not only are the voices in the president-elect\u2019s ear all generally philosophically aligned, but also Trump himself is taking a much more hands-on approach.",
      "\u201cNow he is coming in with a much clearer vision,\u201d the Trump ally said. \u201cHe has been in the job, so he knows exactly what the job is. And you know the No. 1 thing he wants is loyalty and competence.\u201d",
      "Another Trump ally, who notoriously views fighting among staff and decision-makers as a positive rather than a negative, said the president-elect is getting involved in more than just top-tier appointments.",
      "\u201cHe is not just interested in who the Cabinet secretaries are, but also looking at who the deputy secretary candidates are, as well as the assistant secretary candidates,\u201d the person said.",

      "Part of the strategy has been to avoid \u201cunforced errors or distractions\u201d by keeping potential nominees largely offline and away from television interviews.",
      "\u201cI think you\u2019re seeing the campaign discipline translate to the transition,\u201d a transition source said.",
      "Among the most heated Cabinet fights is the one over Hegseth. The former Fox News host and Army National Guard veteran has been meeting with Republican senators over the past week in an attempt to alleviate concerns over allegations of drinking and his treatment of women.",
      "For many Trump supporters, the Hegseth nomination has become a litmus test for how loyal Republicans, specifically those in the Senate who would have to vote to confirm him, are to the president-elect\u2019s pledge to install people who will fundamentally remake key swaths of the federal government.",
      "Trump and his allies have already promised primary challengers for senators who do not vote to confirm Hegseth, including skeptics like Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who is a member of the Armed Services Committee and a veteran. MAGA adherents have turned their wrath on Ernst, believing that she wants the job for herself \u2014 even though she has not indicated so publicly.",
      "\u201cPeople in Iowa have a well-funded primary challenger ready against her,\u201d Charlie Kirk, founder of the influential conservative group Turning Point USA, wrote on social media. \u201cHer political career is in serious jeopardy.\u201d",
      "Hegseth has been defiant and pledged to keep fighting, and Trump has continued to back him, posting as recently as Friday morning that he \u201cis doing very well.\u201d",
      "But the Hegseth drama has spun off its own political intrigue, as a shortlist of potential replacements has been publicly discussed, including Ernst, Tennessee Sen. Bill Hagerty, former Trump administration Pentagon official Elbridge Colby, Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt and most surprisingly, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
      "The DeSantis chatter has caught particular attention because he had an intense political rivalry with Trump during the 2024 Republican presidential primary and has a history of bad blood with several Trump staffers, including Wiles, who ran his 2018 gubernatorial campaign before the two had a falling out.",
      "\u201cWe have all advised him on the pros and cons here, and I think given him good advice,\u201d a Trump official said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, if he can get over it, why can\u2019t we.\u201d",
      "The emergence of DeSantis\u2019 name has also stirred up potential considerations for the 2028 presidential race. DeSantis is likely to once again consider a run for the White House, which many anticipate would put him on a collision course with Vice President-elect JD Vance, who is also expected to consider a run and would likely try to tap into the same pool of Trump voters DeSantis would need.",
      "Trump\u2019s transition team brushed off any concerns that potentially nominating DeSantis as defense secretary could elevate his presidential prospects.",
      "\u201cRon is not a full [Trump] convert, but he has a little star power, and that\u2019s something the president likes. There is media value there,\u201d a person involved in the transition said. \u201cAnd if we pull him in and hug him tight, he\u2019s part of our administration. He could not run against our administration.\u201d",
      "\u201cThen it becomes a personality test,\u201d the person added. \u201cJD wins that 100% of the time.\u201d",
      "The highest-profile defeat to date for Trump was around former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to be attorney general. Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration after it became clear an investigation into allegations of sex trafficking and sex with a minor would prevent him from getting enough votes to be confirmed. Gaetz was never charged and has denied the allegations.",
      "Six hours after Gaetz withdrew late last month, Trump nominated former two-term Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a longtime ally, as his replacement. Bondi\u2019s pick prompted some pushback over her past comments about prosecuting prosecutors who came after Trump, but she is widely considered to be a pick who will be able to secure Senate confirmation.",
      "Bondi did play an influential role in suggesting the other Trump pick who has withdrawn his name \u2014 Tampa-area Sheriff Chad Chronister, who was the president-elect\u2019s choice to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration, according to two sources familiar with the decision.",
      "Last week, Chronister posted on social media that he was pulling his name \u201cas the gravity of this very important responsibility set in,\u201d a claim quickly undercut by Trump himself. In his own post, Trump pointed to how Chronister handled the coronavirus pandemic, including a 2020 decision to arrest a Tampa-area pastor who flouted pandemic-era lockdown orders.",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t pull out,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI pulled him out, because I did not like what he said to my pastors and other supporters.\u201d",
      "Even some nominations that have received relatively little attention have been the subject of internal jockeying.",
      "Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is not expected to have a formal role in a\u00a0 second administration, advocated for private equity executive Marc Rowan to be nominated for treasury secretary, four sources told NBC News, but Trump instead chose hedge fund executive Scott Bessent.",
      "But the speed at which things are moving and, at times, complicating some of Trump\u2019s nominations is part of an aggressive strategy that is by design.",
      "\u201cTrump is in a pretty aggressive mode of trying to shove the system as hard and as fast as he can,\u201d said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a staunch ally. \u201cIf 5% do not make it, he would regard that as a reasonable price for being as daring as he is and he will get 95%.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe is being Trump!\u201d Gingrich continued. \u201cThat is the guy that got to be president despite everything.\u201d"

Stay tuned \u2014 the best has yet to come!\u201d",

      "\u201cOne day, I met a guy who said, \u2018Anything you draw I can have made,\u2019 so we started making things from my ideas,\u201d she told the Urban Outfitters blog. \u201cI also represented other people and sold their artwork, and then we realized that I was the one with the commercial sense, because if I said \u2018Make a teddy bear or a unicorn,\u2019 that was what sold.\u201d",
      "One of her earliest businesses was a brand called Sticky Fingers, which Frank described as \u201cjewelry all made up of plastic that I glued together with glue gun.\u201d",
      "Eventually, she rebranded Sticky Fingers using her own name, and Lisa Frank, Inc. (LFI) was born. The company was established in 1979, according to public records.",
      "The company boomed, bringing in more than $1 billion in retail sales between 1990 and 2005, the\u00a0Tucson Citizen reported in 2005.",
      "In 1994, Frank married James Green, an in-house illustrator hired in 1982 who later became the company\u2019s president and CEO in 1992,\u00a0per court documents, and gifted him 49% of LFI\u2019s shares, according to the same\u00a0court documents.",
      "Green, in the documentary and on his social media pages, has taken credit for \u201cestablishing the look and feel\u201d of Lisa Frank\u2019s signature art, which persists to this day. \u201cI am not the head artist. I am\u00a0the\u00a0artist,\u201d he said in an Instagram video posted after the\u00a0documentary aired.",
      "TODAY.com\u00a0has reached out to Green for comment and has not heard back at the time of publication.",
      "Frank and Green have two sons, Hunter and Forrest. Their names were inspired by two characters from the Lisa Frank universe: Hunter the leopard and Forrest the tiger cub.",

      "Frank filed for divorce against Green in 2005, marking the beginning of a years-long legal saga involving the former couple and other Lisa Frank associates, including former executive vice president Rhonda Rowlette.",
      "Frank sued Green in 2005 to remove him as director, president and chief operating officer of LFI, and buy back his shares. The case went to trial in 2007 and ruled in favor of LFI, terminating\u00a0Green as director, per a 2009 appeal.",
      "\u201cI lost my titles, I lost my business, I lost my building, I lost everything else ... She owns everything. She owns my life\u2019s work,\u201d Green said in the documentary.",
      "Meanwhile, Frank fired Rowlette, who in turn sued her in 2006 for $2 million plus damages, saying that Frank had promised her that amount in the event that her job was terminated. LFI denied making any such promises and the claim was settled, per a\u00a0court filing.",
      "The docuseries also includes interviews with several former employees about their experiences at LFI. Many share anecdotes about times both Frank and Green allegedly treated them harshly.",
      "\u201cThey definitely felt like they were trying to break my spirit,\u201d Tony De Luz, an illustrator at LFI from 1996 to 2000, said in the documentary. \u201cI think that was the way they operated, was that they wanted people who took whatever s--- they piled on them.\u201d",

      "Why is Lisa Frank not in the \u2018Glitter & Greed\u2019 documentary?",
      "Frank is notoriously private. There are few photos available of her publicly, she seldom gives interviews and when she agreed to speak to Urban Outfitters on camera in 2012 in conjunction with LFI\u2019s former collaboration with the brand, she asked for her face to be obscured.",
      "She doesn\u2019t appear in \u201cGlitter and Greed: The Lisa Frank Story,\u201d which explores the inner workings of Lisa Frank, Inc and suggests that the behind-the-scenes reality of the company was anything but rainbows and unicorns.",
      "Director Arianna La Penne says they reached out to Frank multiple times, but she declined to be interviewed.",
      "\u201cI thought about Lisa Frank every day that I was making this ... I really wanted her to participate,\u201d La Penne says, but added she has \u201cno judgment\u201d about the media-shy Frank declining to take part.",
      "La Penne says if she did have a chance to speak to Frank, the first question she would ask her would be, \u201cWas it all worth it?\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the sense of, is she happy now with where she landed?\u201d La Penne says. \u201cBecause in this company\u2019s life, the personal and the professional were completely intertwined, so it\u2019s all connected and related. And I really would love to know what it\u2019s like in her head.\u201d",
      "Where is Lisa Frank now?",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re baaaack!\u201d reads the caption.",
      "\u201cWhen we casually make a major comeback,\u201d the brand captioned a similar TikTok post in April.",
      "One key figure in Lisa Frank\u2019s new chapter is her son, Forrest Green, who has served as Head of Brand and Chairman of LFI since 2018, according to his LinkedIn profile.",
      "Forrest Green has worked closely with his mother from a young age, according to a 2021 Bustle profile. Frank was not interviewed for the article, but Forrest Green, then 21, said on the record he was behind the brand's recently revitalized Instagram.",
      "Forrest Green said his mother used to pull him out of elementary school to sit in at meetings at LFI.",
      "\u201cOne time when I was probably 8 or 9, I closed the meeting like, \u2018All right, guys, this was awesome; what are the next steps?\u2019\u201d he told Bustle. \u201cThe licensing agent at the time looked at me and said, \u2018Well, I guess Forrest closed the meeting!\u2019\u201d",
      "In recent years, Forrest Green has worked to build the brand\u2019s social media following. He has said one of his goals is to tap into \u201890s nostalgia while redefining the Lisa Frank brand for the 21st century.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just so much possibility. More than just people saying, \u2018Make some folders again, make some stickers again,\u2019\u201d he told Bustle. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely part of the plan, but it\u2019s like people don\u2019t even know who we are at this point. Lisa Frank is a lifestyle and it needs to be treated as such.\u201d",
      "The story of Lisa Frank is no doubt complex but for Robertson, working on the documentary ultimately increased her appreciation for the brand.",
      "\"I love the Lisa Frank work now more than ever after having spent several years deep, deep, deep in the story, and after having become aware of a really complicated reality that existed behind the scenes at the company,\" she tells TODAY.com.",
      "After interviewing several former Lisa Frank employees, Robertson says when she thinks of Lisa Frank, she sees the \"passions of all these people who left a part of themselves in it. And they want us to love that work. They want it to endure through the ages.\"",
      "As for the brand's future, Robertson says she has witnessed first-hand the ability of Lisa Frank designs to captivate a new generation.",
      "\"I think they have timeless appeal,\" she says. \"I remember as a girl, the attachment and attraction that I felt towards these objects and designs. And now I have a 6-year-old daughter, and she goes absolutely nuts for them.\""

      "\u201cIt\u2019s blowing my mind,\u201d Christopher Scott, the film\u2019s choreographer, tells TODAY.com.",
      "Now, Scott is helping viewers with their dancing skills. He recently posted a tutorial on how to perform the breakdown from the song's outro, recognized by the repeated refrain of \"loathing.\"",
      "The musical sequence, and perhaps one of the most widely circulating clips online, sees Glinda (Ariana Grande) and Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) express the depths of their disdain for each other during their early days at Shiz University.",
      "In the dance flooding TikTok, Glinda \u2014\u00a0then known as Galinda \u2014 marches with her school pals flanked behind her.",
      "Scott says it was one of the first group scenes filmed, as the movie was primarily choreographed in sequential order. When he initially showed the moves to his team of dancers, they loved it. Grande gave her blessing, too, he says.",
      "\u201cShe was like, \u2018Oh, my God!\u2019 That was one of the first things she\u2019s seeing of the work \u2014 which was pressure on me, because I want her to feel taken care of in this film,\" he says. \"So if she thinks the choreography is not strong, and she\u2019s a part of it, it can mess with people. So it\u2019s important to deliver for them.\"",
      "The dance is meant to physically invoke feelings of frustration, he says. The 25 seconds of viral choreography comes at the very end of the song, as Glinda and Elphaba's \"loathing\" reaches a fever pitch.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re slapping on the books. The way that they twist their body, because they\u2019re irritated by this woman. The thought of Elphaba is making them cringe,\u201d Scott says of the sharp, staccato dance moves.",
      "\"Wicked\" is filled with memorable dance sequences, including the tear-jerking Ozdust Ballroom duet, in which Glinda and Elphaba finally move from enemies to friends.",
      "So why did this section go so viral?",
      "\u201cI think a big part of it is because it came from a place of being connected to the music,\u201d Scott says. \u201cI do think that tapping on the books gave a rhythm for people to become kind of musicians. And I think that level of fun is all part of it.",
      "\"When you're watching it, it\u2019s like, 'I want to play in that space. I want to be one of those people in Glinda\u2019s crew. And I want to become a part of the movie,'\" he adds.",
      "One of Scott\u2019s favorite interpretations that he\u2019s seen so far has fittingly been from the Broadway cast of \"Wicked.\" The stage musical that inspired the 2024 and 2025 films has been running at the Gershwin Theatre since 2003 and currently stars Mary Kate Morrissey as Elphaba and Alexandra Socha as Glinda.",
      "\u201cWatching them re-create the choreography from the film that was a re-creation of what they created made me feel like I\u2019m part of the family of \u2018Wicked\u2019 and not just the outsider that got to do the film,\u201d Scott says.",
      "Scott started working with \"Wicked\" director Jon M. Chu 15 years ago, including most recently on 2021's \"In the Heights,\" based on Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical of the same name.",
      "Scott choreographed the show-stopping number \u201c96,000,\u201d which featured dancers performing styles of dance inspired by Busby Berkeley, ballet, bone-breaking and more \u2014 all in a swimming pool.",
      "Scott recalls the memorable way Chu asked him to be a part of \"Wicked.\" In March 2022, Chu surprised Scott with a hat from the Broadway musical and said, \u201cYou ready to choreograph 'Wicked'?\u201d",
      "Then it was time to get to work on the monumental task at hand, Scott says.",
      "Here's how he pulled off some of the film's most memorable dance sequences.",
      "'Dancing Through Life'",
      "Scott says he leaned into each actors\u2019 strengths. For instance, once he learned Jonathan Bailey, who plays Fiyero, did gymnastics as a kid, Scott incorporated the actor's exceptional front walkover into the introduction of \u201cDancing Through Life.\u201d",
      "That number, set in a library at Shiz University, features a physical wheel, known as a tornado wheel, that the actors dance on, slide off, climb up and more throughout the song.",
      "\u201cThere was actually a question on whether or not they were going to let the actors in the space, because for insurance purposes,\" Scott says.",
      "For Ethan Slater\u2019s role as Boq, Scott used the actor's existing climbing skills from starring in Broadway's \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" in the \"Dancing Through Life\" choreography.",
      "\"If (Slater) auditioned as a performer going into the tornado wheel, he would have booked the job,\" he says. \"It\u2019s very rare you have an actor that can do all of that stuff, to music and the timing.\"",
      "Ozdust Ballroom duet",
      "\"Dancing Through Life\" smoothly transitions into a party scene set off-campus at the \"scandalocious\" Ozdust Ballroom. While Glinda and Fiyero dance the night away, Elphaba arrives wearing a pointy black hat that Glinda had encouraged her to wear, becoming the laughingstock of the party.",
      "Putting on a false confidence, Elphaba starts to dance alone in the middle of the room, before Glinda hesitantly joins her, learning the moves as they go. And with the popular girl's buy-in, the rest of the attendees start dancing, too.",
      "The secret sauce for the scene was to not teach the dancers the choreography that Elphaba and Glinda do in the center of the dance floor to make the moment feel organic.",
      "\u201cI want to make it believable. I hate when a movie in five seconds, someone does a move and everyone knows the move,\u201d he says.",
      "Erivo had been practicing the choreography for days. Grande, however, was introduced to it briefly.",
      "\u201cWe taught her a very little bit of the movement. Then we just follow along. And she just went with it,\u201d Scott says.",
      "'A Sentimental Man'",
      "For those wondering, yes, it is indeed Jeff Goldblum tap dancing before his song \u201cA Sentimental Man.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe knows how to tap. He\u2019s a jazz musician. He\u2019s a mover. That man is musically brilliant. I have video. It\u2019s one of my favorite things I own, and I am going to keep it in my little vault,\u201d Scott says.",
      "To first learn just how Goldblum could move, Scott put on a Frank Sinatra track and freestyled with Goldblum in the room.",

      "\"We got to set the record straight. And that\u2019s him behind the curtain,\u201d Scott adds. \u201cThat is 100% Mr. Goldblum, national treasure at its finest, dancing his face off.\u201d"

    "summary": "Ariana Grande spoke candidly about the body-shaming she has felt during her career.",

      "Ariana Grande has a message for anyone who will listen: Stop commenting on each other's bodies.",
      "During the London leg of the \"Wicked\" press tour, Grande reflected on the criticism surrounding her body over the course of her career. The conversation took place with French journalist Salima Jeanne Poumbga, known professionally as Sally, in an interview with Grande's co-star Cynthia Erivo.",
      "\"How do you cope with beauty standards to critics?\" Sally asked. \"Because this is something that is so overwhelming for women to always look perfect. How do you deal with that?\"",
      "The question visibly struck an emotional chord with Grande. \"My goodness,\" she replied before taking a pause to collect herself. \"I'm not gonna...\"",
      "The moment set the tone for an intimate discussion on the weight of societal beauty ideals as Grande reflected on her own life.",
      "\"I've been kind of doing this in front of the public and kind of been, you know, a specimen in a petri dish, really, since I was 16 or 17,\" Grande explained, adding that commentary about her appearance has been a constant presence in her life. \"I've heard every version of it, of what's wrong with me, and then you fix it, and then it's wrong for different reasons.\"",
      "This isn't the first time Grande has spoken on this topic. In April 2023, she addressed the mounting speculation she faced about her health and body with a post on TikTok.",
      "\u201cI just wanted to address your concerns about my body and talk a little bit about what it means to a person with a body and to be seen \u2026 to be paid this close attention to,\u201d she explained.\u00a0 \u201cI think we should be gentler and less comfortable commenting on people\u2019s bodies, no matter what.\u201d",
      "In her interview with Sally, Grande acknowledged that the experience of such criticism isn't isolated to just celebrities.",
      "\"Even just the simplest thing, your appearance, you know, you're young, and you're hearing all kinds of things, it's hard to protect yourself from that noise,\" she said. \"Even if you go to Thanksgiving dinner and someone's granny says, 'Oh, my God, you look skinnier, what happened?' or 'You look heavier, what happened?' It's like, that is something that is uncomfortable and horrible no matter where it's happening, no matter the scale it's happening on.\"",
      "The Grammy winner underlined the dangers of this tendency to take it upon ourselves to comment on others' appearances.",
      "\u201cIn today\u2019s society, there\u2019s a comfortability that we shouldn\u2019t have at all, commenting on others\u2019 looks, appearance, what they think is going on behind the scenes, or health, or how they present themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a comfortability that people have commenting on that that I think is really dangerous.\u201d",
      "She went on to\u00a0credit her personal support system for keeping her grounded and confident.",
      "\"I'm really lucky to have the support system that I have and to just know and trust that I'm beautiful,\" she said. \"I know what the pressure of that noise feels like. It's been a resident in my life since I was 17, and I just don't invite it in anymore. It's not welcome.\"",
      "The singer also took some credit for herself, noting that she's learned how to focus on what matters to her most when the pressure becomes too loud.",
      "\"I have work to do. I have a life to live. I have friends to love on. I have so much love, and it's not invited, so I don't leave space for it anymore,\"\u00a0she said before encouraging others to do the same for themselves. \"You keep yourself safe, because no one has the right to say shit.\""

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 18:35:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Inspired by Rachel Yoder\u2019s novel, \"Nightbitch,\" recently adapted to a film starring Amy Adams, I transformed into a dog named Sparkles to connect with my son.",
    "story": [
      "In the fall of 2023 two seemingly unrelated events happened to me: I hit a rough patch with my then 4-year-old, and I picked up the novel \u201cNightbitch\u201d by Rachel Yoder. Usually I resisted what I deemed \u201cmommy lit\u201d (obviously a mistake on my part related to ingrained internalized misogyny), but the raw slab of steak on the novel\u2019s cover called to me. At the time I was struggling externally with my son\u2019s behaviors and internally with my identity as a parent.",
      "\u201cMother\u201d wasn\u2019t a label I clamored to claim.",
      "When my firstborn arrived, I was struck by the obvious: overwhelming love, anxiety and a newfound sense of responsibility. Within hours of my son\u2019s birth, another more bizarre feeling cropped up: the urge to hide from my new title of mother. This was likely due to the well-worn knowledge that the label \u201cmother\u201d was the fastest way to detach a woman from herself, more disconnecting even than \u201cwife.\u201d All women, whether or not they are married or have children, are brought up to outstrip themselves from their natural selves. We are taught to adjust our emotions, looks and desires to fit within societal boxes. This push to conform is even more compounded for mothers.",
      "Personal history and pop culture had taught me that mothers were not fully formed people, but rather caricatures with hardened truths. Mothers were supposed to be instinctual,\u00a0self-scarifying, pleasant, asexual and fully devoted at all times.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t want to be or be seen as a reduction of a person, so I kept my distance from mommy-related tropes and hoped my friends without children didn\u2019t see me as \u201cone of those\u201d moms.",
      "I didn\u2019t want to be or be seen as a reduction of a person, so I kept my distance from mommy-related tropes and hoped my friends without children didn\u2019t see me as \u201cone of those\u201d moms.",
      "Other women I knew were also fighting the overshadowing title of \u201cmommy.\u201d One friend confided in me that she didn\u2019t allow her cycling instructor to become Instagram friends with her because she didn\u2019t want him to know she was a mom. She revered this 50-minute space where once a week someone thought she was a mysterious, possibly sexy, unattached woman out in the world. Instinctively she knew his knowledge of her full identity would dissolve this.",
      "And then came \u201cNightbitch.\u201d",
      "I read along as the mother narrator struggled with her own feral son. In the book, it was taking her hours to put him to bed, which brought about a nighttime rage in her that at times turned her so dissimilar and intense that it frightened her son and husband. I was intimately familiar with that particular rage and had never seen it discussed anywhere or with any of my mom friends. I relayed this matching sensation to my wife, who then happily referred to me as Nightbitch during my own bouts of evening anger. In the novel, I read as the nameless mother struggled with feeling disconnected from her old creative self, and with the push and pull of wanting to be with her child while simultaneously far away from the domestic. While it wasn\u2019t a life-changing read at first, I welcomed seeing the reflection of the mundane and exhausting mirrored back.",
      "In my own home, nothing was making my kid happy. Seemingly overnight everything according to him was \u201cstupid\u201d or \u201cboring,\u201d and worse, he was resistant to everyday routines. At night he chucked his toothbrush across the bathroom and screamed in protest, and in the morning he greeted my singsong wake-ups with animal howls (and hurling stuffed animals). I attempted reward charts, talking to him man-to-man, and yelling (and then apologizing because I\u2019m a millennial gentle parent). Finally I gave up hoping it was a phase.",
      "But I kept reading. One night as we sat side by side on the couch, him watching \u201cPeppa Pig,\u201d me consuming \u201cNightbitch,\u201d the following passage jumped out at me: \u201cShe likes the idea of being a dog. She can run free if she wants. She can be a body and instinct and urge. She can be hunger and rage, thirst and fear, nothing more.\u201d",
      "I put down the book and thought about what it would feel like to crawl around on all fours. To bark. To not communicate through words. To not resist hunger, or tamper my rage. Like a dog, what would it be like to allow all the parts of myself to just be, without twisting them into a more presentable package? After all, this was the issue with motherhood (and womanhood, really): We are expected to hide our mess. It might feel great to be an animal \u2014 all id, no ego, I thought. But how silly would that be? I wrangled my kid to bed while the lingering thoughts of trotting around my apartment on my hands and knees played in the backdrop of my mind.",
      "The next morning, with nothing to lose, I decided to go full Nightbitch. When I went into my son\u2019s room, I didn\u2019t sing or give the typical good morning salutation. I turned on the light, dropped to the ground and crawled inside, making high-pitched barking sounds. His sleepy eyes opened. He stared at me, confused, but not mad.",
      "\u201cRuff, ruff,\u201d I barked, climbing into his bed, licking his face and nuzzling him awake. Of course, he was thrilled. I proceeded to carry him his clothes piece by piece using my mouth, and maintained barking sounds as encouragement while he got dressed.",
      "Without questioning what happened to his mom, my son happily pet me. \u201cSparkles,\u201d he quickly decided, inventing my dog name.",
      "The more I read \u201cNightbitch,\u201d it was illuminated that as the narrator mother leaned into her nature, hunger and desires, the more she felt like herself, even with her updated mother identity. Leaning in caused her to feel better. She mothered better. In a favorite scene, Nightbitch and her son sloppily chow down on chunks of raw meat at the playground in front of gobsmacked parents. Finally, they are a team \u2014 a pack. I realized that while I can\u2019t always throw societal norms out the window, the idea of connecting with myself and my kid in ways that felt natural was a good place to start."

      "In a recent episode of the \u201cHow to Fail With Elizabeth Day\u201d podcast, the actor and director of the film said there were moments when he \u201cwould just have to leave\u201d the set.",
      "Baldoni not only brought Colleen Hoover's megahit book to life as director, but he also portrayed the troubled and abusive Ryle, who marries Blake Lively's character, Lily. The actor told host Elizabeth Day that it took him time to process and leave behind his complicated character after filming ended.",
      "\u201cDirecting is a very lonely job, I\u2019ll just be very candid. Because you are kind of at the top of this totem pole. In your moments of quiet, everybody has a thousand questions for you and also nobody wants to disturb you,\u201d Baldoni said. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t really have many people to talk to, and you can\u2019t necessarily share your anxiety or your nervousness about something because you\u2019re also the leader.\u201d",
      "Calling it \u201ca very strange place to be,\u201d he explained how also portraying a tumultuous character like Ryle affected him.",
      "\u201cLet alone directing while trying to play a character who does the things that Ryle does in the movie, so there were moments in the filming of this where I would just have to leave,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d have to remove myself and go shake it out. I mean, I\u2019ve done a lot of somatic therapy so there were times when I was actually just shaking.\u201d",
      "Baldoni recalled having a \u201cnear breakdown\u201d after filming a scene where Ryle has Lily\u2019s phone and finds a phone number from someone else.",
      "While Ryle, he said, is \u201cvery jealous,\u201d heartbroken and angry, \u201che doesn\u2019t harm her, but you can see in his eyes how dangerous he is. After that scene, I had a near breakdown. And I had to leave and just cry and shake because there was so much pain.\u201d",
      "Baldoni shared that it was hard to have Ryle's trauma live in his body, \u201ccreating that insecurity and the pain and the feeling that you shouldn\u2019t actually be (feeling).\u201d",
      "\u201cThat was very hard and that took a few months,\u201d he said of releasing those feelings. \u201cI had dreams as him for a while, and it lived in my body, but I think for the most part, he\u2019s out.\u201d",
      "The release of \"It Ends With Us,\" which will arrive on Netflix Dec. 9, was met with criticisms and controversy surrounding what some called the romanticizing of domestic abuse. Some domestic violence survivors told TODAY.com that their criticisms include the lack of a trigger warning and resources as well as promotional content that seemed to depict the film as lighthearted. (Sony Pictures Entertainment, the film\u2019s distributor, declined to comment on the criticism at the time.)",
      "In the podcast interview, Baldoni briefly touched on how he wanted to approach the film with caution when it came to the subject matter.",
      "\u201cI just didn\u2019t want to re-traumatize the majority of my audience, which is why I was advocating for a trigger warning at the front and things like that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut those are certain battles that you can\u2019t always win.\u201d",
      "It was also rumored that there was cast drama behind the scenes of the making of \"It Ends With Us,\" specifically between Baldoni and Lively, who is credited as a producer. The two co-stars didn't do any press together and didn't take photos together at the premiere.",
      "The \"Jane the Virgin\" star previously told\u00a0TODAY.com\u00a0in an interview published Aug. 9 that directing \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d was an \u201cextreme challenge.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery movie is a miracle,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cAnd then, of course, you\u2019re navigating complex personalities and trying to get everybody on the same page with the same vision. And mistakes are always made, and then you figure out how to move past them.\u201d",
      "He later told \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201c that Lively should be the one to direct a potential film adaptation of the book\u2019s sequel, \u201cIt Starts With Us.\u201d At this time, there's no official word on if there will be a second film."

That's her armor, the same way that Elphaba uses black as her armor. There's nothing accidental about what their styling is. I wanted for each of them to feel and and appear as beautiful as possible, even in how they represent themselves.\"",
      "Tazewell says Erivo and Grande played a role in creating their costumes. For example, Erivo tried on multiple versions of Elphaba's hat before settling on the one she liked best.",
      "\"We had in-depth discussions early on what their emotional arc would be as it was reflected through the clothing,\" he says.",

      "\"Elphaba is caught emotionally at that time. We have her carry that through. It defines why she then gravitates toward black as her defining color,\" Tazewell says.",
      "For the stage production, costume designer Susan Hilferty embedded color into Elphaba's black dresses, a look she told Playbill in 2018 was inspired by \"looking at the stones in earth and gems.\"",
      "Tazewell had a different Easter egg for his Elphaba, leaning more toward texture than color.",

      "\"In contrast with her ability to fly and manipulate gravity, keeping her grounded and connected to the Earth was really important story-wise,\" he says.",

      "In \"The Wizard of Oz,\" Glinda wears a bright pink puffy-sleeved gown, with a giant crown and wand.",
      "But in the stage musical of \"Wicked,\" Glinda wears blue for the major moment, due to certain rights restrictions, according to Hilferty.",
      "2024\u2019s \u201cWicked,\u201d however, was able to return to the original pink \u2014 that \u201cperfect pink,\u201d Tazewell says.",
      "\"My intent was for it to reference the original 'Wizard of Oz' dress but be different,\" Tazewell says.",

      "The commercial opens with ESPN personality Stephen A. Smith asking former Denver Broncos quarterback and Pro Football Hall of Famer John Elway how the Yankees drafted him ahead of former San Diego Padres great Tony Gwynn in 1981.",
      "\u201cFrom my understanding, it was all Steinbrenner,\u201d Elway replies.",
      "The video then jumps back to 1981 with a Yankees executive making the pitch to draft Gwynn. Steinbrenner is miffed, though, at the idea of drafting Gwynn, who, in addition to playing baseball, was a basketball player at San Diego State University.",
      "Steinbrenner makes it clear he\u2019s eyeing Elway, who played baseball and football at Stanford University.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gotta be Elway. I want him out in right field with that cannon of an arm,\u201d he says.",
      "The executive tries to stay the course, adding Gwynn projects to be better than even Keith Hernandez, who, of course, famously guest-starred as himself on a Season Three episode of \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d",
      "\u201cKeith Hernandez? I don\u2019t like that big mustache,\u201d Steinbrenner fires back.",
      "Steinbrenner refuses to budge, noting he likes Elway\u2019s name, even when the executive points out Gwynn is a great name, with the word \u201cwin\u201d being part of it.",
      "\u201cDiMaggio. Mantle. Ruth. It\u2019s gotta be Elway,\u201d Steinbrenner responds.",
      "He then orders his men to draft Gwynn before an alarm goes off.",
      "\u201cNo more time to chat. It\u2019s calzone time,\u201d he says as he sends his employees out of his office. The calzone is a reference to a Season Seven episode of \"Seinfeld\" in which George Costanza gets Steinbrenner hooked on calzones.",
      "The video then goes back to present day and Elway waking up from a nap on his couch as his alarm goes off.",
      "Elway was indeed selected by the Yankees six spots ahead of Gwynn in the second round of that year\u2019s Major League Baseball draft and even wound up playing in some minor league games for the franchise before ultimately settling on playing in the NFL, where he would win a pair of Super Bowls. The set of cards features one of Elway on the Yankees, even though he never played a game for them.",
      "Meanwhile, things also worked out pretty well for Gwynn, who would become one of the best hitters in baseball history while playing all 20 years during his career for the Padres. He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007 before dying in 2014 at the age of 54."

    "published": "Sat, 07 Dec 2024 02:22:48 GMT",
    "summary": "South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol apologized on Saturday for declaring martial law but did not say he would resign as he faces an impeachment vote.",
    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Members of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s governing party left parliament on Saturday ahead of a planned impeachment vote over his short-lived declaration of martial law, leaving its passage in doubt.",
      "Lawmakers from the People Power Party (PPP) were shouted and cursed at as they left en masse after voting on a separate motion, leaving the 192 opposition lawmakers eight votes short of the two-thirds majority needed for the impeachment motion to succeed.",
      "Opposition lawmakers have said that if the impeachment motion doesn\u2019t pass they will come back to it on Wednesday, amid simmering public anger over Yoon\u2019s bewildering order, which plunged the East Asian democracy and key U.S. ally into chaos.",
      "Earlier Saturday, Yoon apologized for his actions in a brief nationally televised address, saying they \u201cstemmed from the urgency\u201d\u00a0he felt as president but \u201ccaused anxiety and inconvenience to the public.\u201d",
      "\u201cI deeply regret this and sincerely apologize to the citizens who were alarmed,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI will not evade the legal and political responsibility regarding this declaration of martial law,\u201d Yoon continued, speaking for a total of just over two minutes before deeply bowing his head before cameras.",
      "He said he would not declare martial law a second time, a concern that had been expressed by some opposition lawmakers, and that his party would decide how long he should stay in office and how state affairs would be managed.",
      "Han Dong-hoon, the leader of the PPP, urged Yoon to step down, telling reporters after the address that it had become \u201cimpossible\u201d for him to carry out his normal presidential duties.",
      "Lee Jae-myung, leader of the liberal opposition Democratic Party and Yoon\u2019s rival in the 2022 presidential election, described the president\u2019s address as \u201cvery disappointing.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Yoon\u2019s statement was completely out of touch with the public\u2019s expectations and further fueled a sense of betrayal,\u201d Lee said.",
      "\u201cThere is no other way but to leave office early.\u201d",
      "Six opposition parties began impeachment proceedings against Yoon this week. The opposition bloc holds 192 of the unicameral legislature\u2019s 300 seats, just under the two-thirds majority needed for the motion to pass.",
      "The likelihood that the motion would succeed increased Friday after Han said the president\u2019s powers should be suspended, adding that Yoon might continue to \u201cput South Korea and its people in great danger.\u201d",
      "But the conservative PPP remained formally opposed to the impeachment motion, as well as a bill appointing a special prosecutor to investigate corruption allegations involving Yoon\u2019s wife. That bill was narrowly voted down on Saturday before PPP lawmakers left the chamber.",
      "Opposition lawmakers, by contrast, are adamant that Yoon be removed from office, as is much of the public. Large crowds of protesters have called for Yoon\u2019s ouster, while smaller ones have rallied in support of him.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t and cannot apologize only with words after attempting to stage martial law. The only way for President Yoon Suk Yeol to mean his apology is to resign now,\u201d Seoul resident Margie Kim\u00a0said after Yoon\u2019s address.",
      "A Gallup Korea poll released on Friday showed Yoon\u2019s approval rating at 13%, The Korea Times reported, down from 19% a week earlier.",
      "Lee, the Democratic Party leader, said Yoon\u2019s \u201cunconstitutional and illegal declaration of martial law\u201d had caused chaos and fear in the country of 50 million people, which spent decades under military-authoritarian rule before transitioning into a vibrant democracy and the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy.",
      "\u201cThe democracy of this nation that has been achieved through blood, sweat and tears is now being wrecked by an unruly power, and our people have suffered serious wounds to their national dignity and pride,\u201d he said Friday.",
      "Lee also expressed concern about how the martial law declaration might affect South Korea\u2019s relations with the U.S., noting that meetings of the U.S.-South Korea Nuclear Consultative Group that were planned in Washington this week had been postponed amid the turmoil.",
      "\u201cOur national credibility, as well as diplomacy, has been severely impacted,\u201d he said.",
      "Biden administration officials said they were not notified in advance that Yoon would declare martial law. But they have repeatedly reaffirmed the \u201cironclad\u201d nature of the U.S. alliance with South Korea, which it views as an important bulwark against North Korea, China and Russia, and which hosts almost 30,000 American troops.",
      "The U.S. relationship with South Korea \u201ctranscends any particular president or government on both sides of the Pacific Ocean,\u201d State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said Thursday.",
      "Before his address on Saturday, Yoon, 63, a former chief prosecutor who took office in 2022, had not made any public appearances since lifting the martial law order early Wednesday after lawmakers defied a security cordon to enter the National Assembly building and voted unanimously to reject it.",
      "Since then, he has accepted the resignation of his defense minister Kim Yong-hyun, who said he took full responsibility for what happened. Many other officials, including Yoon\u2019s chief of staff and all senior presidential secretaries, have also tendered their resignations.",
      "South Korean police and prosecutors are investigating claims of insurrection and treason against Yoon, Kim and Interior Minister Lee Sang-min. The Ministry of National Defense has also suspended three top commanders from duty and requested overseas travel bans for them, Kim and seven other active-duty military officers.",
      "Military officers and government officials described a chaotic six hours from the time Yoon declared martial law around 10:30 p.m. Tuesday to the time he lifted the order around 4:30 a.m. Wednesday. Many of them said they learned about the martial law order, South Korea\u2019s first since 1980, from Yoon\u2019s surprise TV address or from news reports.",
      "In his address, Yoon accused the opposition-controlled parliament of paralyzing the government by seeking the impeachment of multiple government officials and slashing critical funding from next year\u2019s national budget. He also accused his opponents of sympathizing with nuclear-armed North Korea, its reclusive communist neighbor that the South technically remains at war with.",
      "A martial law proclamation issued after Yoon\u2019s address banned all political activity, including demonstrations, and censored the news media. It also ordered\u00a0the country\u2019s striking doctors\u00a0to return to work within 48 hours.",
      "Officials said Friday that Yoon had ordered the arrest of prominent politicians including Lee, the leader of the Democratic Party, and Han, the leader of Yoon\u2019s own party, along with other opposition lawmakers, a journalist, a former Supreme Court justice and a former Supreme Court chief justice.",
      "Yoon\u2019s office has not commented on the allegations.",
      "If Yoon is impeached, he will be suspended from office until the Constitutional Court decides whether to uphold the motion, with a deadline of 180 days. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo would serve as acting president in the meantime.",
      "While it wouldn\u2019t take many defections from Yoon\u2019s party to pass the impeachment motion, \u201cI do think it is important that this be bipartisan,\u201d said Eun A Jo, a postdoctoral fellow at the\u00a0Dickey Center for International Understanding\u00a0at Dartmouth.",
      "\u201cBecause once it reaches the Constitutional Court, I think there will be much more pressure for them to uphold it.\u201d",
      "Stella Kim reported from Seoul, and Jennifer Jett from Hong Kong."

      "Homs \u201cis a stepping stone to Damascus and what comes next,\u201d he told NBC News on Friday. \u201cIt would be passing through a threshold that suggests to the [Syrian] forces and all Syrians that HTS and those fighting forces with it are about to bear down on the capital and sweep away the regime.\u201d",
      "With his forces nearing, thousands of people had fled towards western coastal regions, a stronghold of the government where fighting has remained less fierce than in other parts of the country, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Friday.",
      "Various reports from around the country also suggested that the fall of Aleppo and Hama, as well other cities such as Idlib and numerous rural settlements, has significantly strained Assad\u2019s forces as fighting between government troops and various rebel groups raged around the country.",
      "Pro-Assad soldiers were also battling Kurdish forces who seized government positions in eastern Syria near the cities of Raqqa and Deir Ez-Zour, the Observatory said."

      "The underlying lawsuits are brought under a law called the Anti-Terrorism Act by various victims, including the family of Ari Fuld, an American citizen who was killed by a Palestinian terrorist at a West Bank shopping mall in 2018. Other plaintiffs involved in the litigation had previously won a $655 million judgment that the lower court threw out.",

      "\u201cIt was really surprising that they managed to make it into Aleppo,\u201d said Samuel Ramani, an associate fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute think tank. \u201cThis is certainly beyond anyone\u2019s expectations \u2014 Hama\u2019s a critical logistical area between Aleppo and Damascus.\u201d",
      "The taking the city of Hama by HTS-led forces could prove pivotal in shifting the balance of the civil war. The city has never before been in rebel hands and has been the site of more than one bloody crackdown by both Assad's regime and that of his father, Hafez al-Assad.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge humiliation for Assad, and it comes at a time when he was confident in his long-term position, focusing on doing a deal with the Trump administration and guarding from spillovers from the Gaza and Lebanon wars \u2014 neither Damascus nor Moscow expected a second Syrian civil war,\u201d added Ramani, who is also an international relations lecturer at the University of Oxford.",
      "Charles Lister, the director of the Syria program at the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank, said in an interview that if Hama were to fall to the rebels, their next target will be the strategically important and central city of Homs, which is around 30 miles south of Hama.",
      "One feature of the battle for Hama \u2014 and the broader Syrian civil war \u2014 has been fierce aerial attacks from government forces.",
      "The air superiority of Assad\u2019s forces \u2014 which have long received heavy backing from Russia and Iran \u2014 was on display Thursday before government forces left Hama. Helicopter gunships carried out aerial bombardments with barrel bombs, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.",
      "Despite Moscow\u2019s depleted presence, a return to the heavy Russian-led bombing of civilian infrastructure not seen since 2018 looks likely, said Ramani, of RUSI.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really unclear what\u2019s next for the Assad government and how they turn back the tide. The Russians have said they\u2019re all in on Assad, but they\u2019ve redeployed jets and air defenses to Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that Damascus is going to fall, but it also doesn\u2019t mean Assad will be able to restore authoritarian stability any time soon.\u201d"

      "Hard-liners want to re-establish Jewish settlements in Gaza, he said, including in northern areas where civilians have been urged to leave indefinitely as the Israeli military prepares to move against Hamas fighters who have regrouped.",
      "\u201cWhat is going on there? There is no Beit Lahiya, no Beit Hanoun, they are operating now in Jabalia and basically cleaning the area of Arabs,\u201d Yaalon said.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office referred a request for comment to the IDF. In a post on X, IDF spokesman Lt. Col.\u00a0Nadav Shoshani said the IDF \u201coperates in accordance with international law, and evacuates civilians based on operational necessity, for their own protection.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe IDF rejects the serious claims that the IDF is conducting ethnic cleansing in the Gaza Strip,\u201d he added.",
      "Yaalon was the IDF\u2019s chief of staff during the second intifada, or \u201cuprising\u201d by Palestinians against Israeli occupation, which ended in 2005. He also served as defense minister from 2013 to 2016, including during a 2014 war in Gaza that lasted more than six weeks and had been the longest conflict between Israel and Hamas until the current one.",

      "Yaalon\u2019s comments came after the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant last month over alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes in the Gaza Strip. Netanyahu\u2019s office rejected the accusations as \u201cabsurd and false\u201d and branded the decision \u201cantisemitic,\u201d while also condemning the ICC as a \u201cbiased and discriminatory political body.\u201d",

About 1,200 people were killed in that attack, while about 100 people who were taken hostage are still being held captive in Gaza more than a year later, according to Israeli tallies. Around a third of them are thought to be dead.",

    "summary": "Syria's civil war has exploded back into life after Islamist rebels launched a lightning offensive on the northern city of Aleppo.",
    "story": [
      "In the messy patchwork of conflicts raging across the Middle East, one country has been absent from the spotlight: Syria.",
      "A civil war that dominated international headlines for more than a decade has now been reignited after a coalition of Syrian rebels launched a lightning offensive last week, seizing Aleppo, the country\u2019s second-largest city, from President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime.",
      "The rebels took only hours to recapture territory that Assad\u2019s forces had spent years reclaiming. Fighter jets from Syria and its ally Russia soon began bombing the area \u2014 killing hundreds of the rebels but civilians, too, according to a leading monitoring group.",
      "\u201cThis is a very unstable situation with a huge amount of flux,\u201d said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "Some anti-Assad activists hope it could herald the crumbling of a depleted regime; others fear the brutality of the Russia-Syrian response \u2014 as well as the hard-line ideology of the Islamist rebels themselves.",
      "It\u2019s also unclear how this may affect the 900 or so American troops still in the region, or the remnants of the Islamic State terror group that they are there to fight and that the Pentagon has warned may be regrouping.",
      "Here\u2019s what we do know:",
      "What happened?",
      "With little warning last Wednesday, a coalition of Syrian rebels launched a rapid assault that soon seized Aleppo as well as towns in the nearby Idlib and Hama provinces, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based monitoring group.",
      "The rebels are being led by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which grew out of a former al Qaeda affiliate called Jabhat al-Nusra and is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., the United Nations and others.\u00a0The State Department has a $10 million bounty for information about its leader, Abu Mohammed al-Golani.",
      "However, some analysts say the group has \u201cgreatly moderated\u201d its positions, as Robin Yassin-Kassab, author of \u201cBurning Country: Syrians in Revolution and War,\u201d wrote this week. \u201cIt\u2019s still an authoritarian Islamist militia\u201d but \u201chas a much more positive policy towards sectarian and ethnic minorities than ISIS,\u201d he said.",
      "For these anti-Assad observers, the group presents an opportunity to topple the brutality of his regime and its Russian and Iranian benefactors.",
      "But after the rebels\u2019 offensive, Syrian and Russian fighter jets responded by launching airstrikes on the rebel-held areas, with Assad\u2019s government claiming to have killed more than 400 of the \u201cterrorists.\u201d",
      "The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights puts the number of rebels killed in five days of fighting at 244, with 61 civilians killed alongside 141 government troops.",
      "Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi offered his full support to Assad and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia would do likewise. And on Monday, Iran-backed militias based in Iraq crossed the border into Syria to support the government there, according to the Observatory.",
      "Why is this happening now?",
      "Syria\u2019s time on the back burner of international attention is also one  reason it has roared back into prominence, some experts say.",
      "Assad once looked like he might be toppled by the diverse group of rebels that rose up against him after the Arab Spring of 2011. That he has survived was largely because of the intervention of Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s Lebanon-based proxy.",
      "Russia\u2019s indiscriminate bombing, in particular, turned the tide against the rebels. It also transformed then rebel-held cities such as Aleppo and Homs into moonscapes of rubble and rebar. In all, the U.N. has documented more than 350,000 deaths but says this is \u201ccertainly an undercount.\u201d",
      "Today, however, Russia, Iran and Lebanon are distracted and depleted.",
      "Russia\u2019s primary focus is on the war in Ukraine, where it is locked in an attritional battle of trenches, tanks and mud with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s Washington-backed government in Kyiv. In recent years Moscow has withdrawn assets from Syria, potentially weakening Assad\u2019s grip on power, experts say.",
      "Likewise, Iran has taken a hit at the hands of Israel, which has gutted Hezbollah\u2019s leadership and targeted its missile arsenal, while also fighting Hamas in Gaza.",
      "\u201cIranians have also shown that their forces are stretched and perhaps not as powerful as people get them credit for,\u201d said Hellyer, the Russia analyst who was speaking from Cairo. All of this \u201cputs Assad in a much weaker position.\u201d",
      "But \u201cthe Syrian regime, in coordination with the Russians and less so the Iranians, will hit them with everything they\u2019ve got,\u201d he added.",
      "Washington and ISIS",
      "Less clear is what role, if any, the U.S. may play.",
      "As well as the American troops based in Syria, there are another 2,500 in neighboring Iraq that are part of a residual 80-country coalition to prevent ISIS from regrouping.",
      "However, it\u2019s far from certain these forces will remain there after President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. He twice threatened to withdraw these troops during his first term.",
      "But the ISIS threat has not gone away, despite the group being purged in 2017 from the vast swaths of Syria and Iraq over which it had governed.",
      "In July, the Pentagon warned ISIS attacks were on track to double year-on-year.",
      "If HTS were to seize the city of Deir el-Zour \u2014 a former ISIS stronghold \u2014 then ISIS could be freer to expand its influence across the east of the country, some analysts believe.",
      "\u201cAs Assad\u2019s regime moves resources to the northwest\u201d to try to fight off the rebels, \u201cISIS will reap the rewards, filling vacuums\u201d elsewhere,  Charles Lister, director of the Syria program at the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank, said in a post on X.",
      "If Assad were to fall altogether, Iran may no longer be able to use Syria as a pipeline of weapons and other supplies to Hezbollah, the Council on Foreign Relations, a Washington-based think tank, said in a briefing.",
      "However, any hopes for Assad's ouster should be tempered by who or what might replace him.",
      "\u201cMuch as I oppose the Assad regime, its atrocities and abuses, what is happening in Aleppo right now is terrifying. Many will die,\u201d Chris Doyle, director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding, posted on X. \u201cIf there was a chance of a lovely peaceful outcome to the benefit of Syrians, I will be thrilled. This is unlikely.\u201d"

      "Han Dong-hoon, leader of the conservative People Power Party (PPP), had earlier said he opposed impeaching Yoon because it would only create more turmoil. But on Friday he said he had learned that Yoon ordered the arrest of prominent politicians in addition to declaring martial law, an order that was lifted six hours later after lawmakers voted to reject it.",
      "\u201cIn light of these new revelations, I have come to the conclusion that it is necessary to suspend President Yoon from exercising his mandate to protect the South Korea and its people,\u201d Han said, adding that Yoon was \u201cnot acknowledging his wrongdoings.\u201d",

      "The deeply unpopular Yoon, 63, whose approval rating was already at 19% before the emergency martial law, had blamed opposition lawmakers in his declaration, accusing them of paralyzing the government by seeking the impeachment of multiple government officials and slashing critical funding from next year\u2019s national budget.",
      "He also accused his opponents of sympathizing with nuclear-armed North Korea, a reclusive communist state with which the South technically remains at war.",
      "Yoon has not made any public appearances since lifting the martial law order on Wednesday. On Friday, lawmakers at the National Assembly, which was swarmed by almost 300 martial law troops on Tuesday after Yoon declared martial law in a surprise late-night TV address, linked arms to block the entrance amid concerns that he might visit.",
      "Opposition lawmakers have expressed concern that Yoon might declare martial law a second time if he is impeached or even earlier.",

      "Acting Defense Minister Kim Seon-ho dismissed such concerns and said that even if Yoon made such an attempt, the Ministry of Defense and the South Korean military \u201cwould categorically reject it.\u201d",
      "Yoon\u2019s special forces commander, Kwak Jong-keun, also said Friday that it would be impossible for Yoon to declare martial law again \u201cbecause I will refuse to comply with any such order.\u201d",

      "The ministry also said it had requested overseas travel bans for 10 active-duty officers, including Kwak, Lee, Yeo and Gen. Park Ahn-soo, who as army chief of staff was named martial law commander. All four are accused of treason, the ministry said, adding that three brigadier generals and three commanders who were confirmed to have deployed soldiers made up the other six.",

      "Blinken also reaffirmed the \u201cironclad\u201d nature of the U.S. alliance with South Korea, which it views as an important bulwark against North Korea, China and Russia, and which hosts almost 30,000 American troops.",

      "Hong Jang-won, deputy director of the National Intelligence Service (NIS), told lawmakers on the National Assembly\u2019s Intelligence Committee that Yoon had told him to arrest key politicians, Democratic Party lawmaker and committee member Kim Byeong-gi told reporters.",
      "They included Lee Jae-myung, the party\u2019s leader, and Yoon\u2019s rival in the 2022 presidential election; Woo Won-shik, speaker of the National Assembly; Han, the leader of Yoon\u2019s own People Power Party; and Kim Ou-Joon, a journalist who has been critical of Yoon, along with other opposition leaders, a former Supreme Court justice and a former Supreme Court chief justice.",
      "\u201cHong said that such a directive was ridiculous,\u201d Kim said, \u201cand although the key leadership meeting at the NIS was held, the meeting ended without a conclusion.\u201d",

      "South Korea\u2019s National Election Commission said Friday that after the martial law declaration on Tuesday, about 300 troops infiltrated its headquarters and related facilities in what the commission called \u201ca clear violation of the Constitution and the law.\u201d",
      "The soldiers confiscated the mobile phones of five people on duty and restricted access to the premises, the commission said, occupying its headquarters for about 3 hours and 20 minutes.",

      "Kwak said that no one entered the premises, and that there were no plans to detain or obstruct commission personnel.",

      "Lee said he concluded it was unlikely to be a terrorism scenario and told his troops not to carry live ammunition.",
